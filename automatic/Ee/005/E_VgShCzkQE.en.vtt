00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 very good two people speak to you javi nygma 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 and today I wanted good to solve a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.309
 doubt that you ask me with a lot 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.230
 good frequency plus a doubt and now it's 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.840
 a question many others ask me 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.480
 what is my configuration of my disk 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.090
 hard usb to load the backups here in 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.439
 the wii console although I think what 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.150
 explained in some of the tutorials 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.800
 well I could record this video 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.910
 specifically for it to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.750
 tell me how is my configuration 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 current of my hard disk I will tell you my disk 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.969
 hard is a digital western 500 gb usb 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.590
 2.0 since I bought it 78 years ago 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.690
 Currently 3.0 usb hard drives 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.280
 they are also compatible with me 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.379
 least I have set some 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.860
 for friends and family members who are 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.730
 usb 3.0 and well they have worked without 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.790
 no problem 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.039
 tell you that my hard drive is 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.660
 partitioned into three parts is going to them 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.910
 explain why it is in three parts 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.350
 As you can see here I have a first 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:06.460
 partition of 200 gb in wps a second 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.159
 partition of 255 gigabytes in ntfs and a 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.250
 third partition in fat32 of 10 gigas 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.340
 I'm telling you because I must partitioned 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.410
 So good when I pirate my console 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.690
 wii ago I do not remember, but I think 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.899
 that six or seven years six or seven years 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.509
 minimum I want to remember to load the 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.240
 backups on the web through a disk 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:32.200
 hard or good or a usb was necessary 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.140
 have a partition or wps format in the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.659
 usb ie the ntfs and fas partitions 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.819
 32 were not read by the loader of 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.759
 way that they forced you or else to 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.580
 format the entire hard drive 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.079
 completely in wm fs that in my case I 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.400
 I did not want to do that because of course 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.470
 I would force to dedicate 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.970
 all this hard drive completely for 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.650
 the wii that in the end I have it like this 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.140
 practically but good is not like that 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.940
 everything or the ass that I did in my case 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.830
 that was good because I say I 'm going to partition 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.180
 arlo what partition in the first 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.640
 partition in wm 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.760
 a second was detected from the wii 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.460
 ntfs partition I also have games 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.250
 of the wii but I also have other 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.830
 files like movies and music and a 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.510
 partition third partition fat32 that the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.100
 used to load emulators and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.420
 Applications of the home blue channel as 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.610
 the cellular lego confirm what 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.550
 I have the covers and everything that is what 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.470
 happens that the wv fs partition is not 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.230
 recognized by windows is to say if your 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.790
 us partition or format in w 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.340
 you can only load games from the wii 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.900
 with go back and manager wps manager and 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.090
 similar programs but when with this 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.090
 is the usb hard drive to the computer that 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.010
 partition that format wv that windows not 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.450
 you will recognize you therefore you are not going to 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.200
 be able to put other types of files like 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.820
 could be music movies series 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.470
 word files and that's why I already 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.580
 I made this second partition because 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.530
 although I may have games of the wii 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.790
 also in this second partition I 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.500
 wanted to have 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.150
 access from windows to that second 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.799
 partition so to have then for 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.709
 example what I say music series 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:06.909
 movies and so on, that's the reason 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.829
 the years passed and the loader 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.770
 they were updated and therefore 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:15.160
 the loader started 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.710
 and admit to recognize ntfs formats 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.990
 and fast 32 therefore it was no longer 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.710
 necessary to have a format or partition 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.970
 wps like I already had my hard drive 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.270
 partitioned in this way and I have it 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.280
 Well loaded with games, so I 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.160
 it is very uncomfortable to arrive and remove 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.750
 this first partition wv cesc so I have 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.370
 left that way for that when many others 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.440
 you ask me if it is necessary 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.270
 partition the hard drive I do not have the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.520
 answer is obviously not now 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.620
 today you can leave your 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.720
 hard drive in ntfs completely that os 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.370
 he will recognize it in my case when I 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.470
 I did it for the first time it was not possible 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.810
 As I told you, you can also leave 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.220
 32 although I do not recommend it in this 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.750
 yes yes I remind you with the partition 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.860
 is in 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:03.080
 ntfs and em fas 32 if you want now there is a 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.650
 loader the only thing that currently does not 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.800
 recognizes neither ntfs nor fast 32 which is one to 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.770
 see one to see only recognizes w 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.840
 wcs and in addition the partition wv cease has 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.910
 to be the first partition of the disk 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.549
 hard is not worth either the second or the 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.850
 third partition is worth so good 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.050
 I think that with this I have solved this 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.840
 consult that you do not do with a lot 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.390
 frequency on my hard drive I repeat my 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.480
 hard drive has wcs 200 gb for games 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.490
 of wii 255 gigas in ntfs the second 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.410
 partition for wii games and other use 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.690
 since it is going to recognize windows and 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.490
 a third small partition in fat32 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.250
 of 10 gigs where I have the emulators 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.770
 applications with blue channel in fas 32 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.169
 so that if I go for example or what 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.540
 I will teach well I will teach here 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.980
 I also have here for example the 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.330
 first partition with web games 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.560
 but the second request I also have 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.090
 wii games and now you're watching the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.040
 ntfs partition that is this is the 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.600
 ntfs partition I do not have games too 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.320
 from the web but if now outside the 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.360
 computer and connect to my hard drive 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.540
 windows yes that recognizes me this second 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.580
 ntfs partition and therefore I agree 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.600
 also to my movies series and others 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.970
 files that I also have in this 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.610
 second partition ntfs however that 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.890
 first partition wv fs if i would like 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.780
 open it on the computer from my pc in 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.030
 windows would tell me that it has a format not 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.680
 valid and will ask me to format it for 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:30.250
 that that first partition wps you have to 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:34.300
 open it with programs like manager w time 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.560
 that manager is worth it now if I leave the 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.230
 loader 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.050
 and I go to the main menu and zero to 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.310
 homebrew channel what I told you 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.680
 homebrew channel applications 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.050
 you can load from an sd but also 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.240
 you can load them from a usb in fat32 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.080
 or as in my case a third partition 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.360
 32 eye if you use god of mine the partition 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.790
 fat32 has to be the first of the disk 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.980
 hard if you use my god because god of mine 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.720
 you have to have that first partition 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.370
 for 32 for loading the backups by 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.280
 So I recommend you now heap up 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.490
 nintendo since it is not necessary that that 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.740
 first partition be the fas 32 now if 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.300
 I went to homebrew channel I 'm going to 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.490
 start 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.860
 you will see that I have applications here 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.860
 both in the sd and in that third 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.629
 small partition of 10 gigas fat32 and 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.389
 to access one or other simply 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:29.270
 just press button one and here 12 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.860
 sd slot or usb device too 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.199
 you can have applications and you have the 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.260
 club lavines slots worth here we have 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.240
 the sd we give to accept 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.880
 and we will load the applications of the 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.640
 sd if I give it back to 1 and I'm going to 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.020
 usb and I 'll accept it because it will load me 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.660
 the applications that I have in that 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.760
 partition 32 of the hard drive that I eat 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.740
 You see there are so many applications 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.480
 which are very different as for example 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:58.040
 the emulators 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:00.050
 is the vga here I have also the one of the 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.940
 cne is that of silk and above all 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.700
 I have the loader as they are configurable 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.260
 usb loader because here I can have 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.020
 example more storage for all 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.700
 the covers and so on so good 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.530
 people 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.600
 well I think I 've been in the leader I know 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.040
 you can also see from the to 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.460
 richard and not only through the 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.139
 channel 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.850
 I hope it 's resolved as I say this 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.430
 doubt of course if you have more doubts 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.229
 more you want to do any suggestion 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.789
 Any request you know how good 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:29.160
 it will always be there in the middle what 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:31.080
 possible and the mean of time that the 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.700
 have time available for it then 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.520
 I will help you 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.680
 soon I will continue contributing more episodes 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.060
 of the game the week and I hope that you 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.040
 like and that we are liking for 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.650
 your support that I am receiving and 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.930
 nothing more people who are referred here to 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:49.640
 next tutorial of play a strong 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.640
 Take care bye hug
