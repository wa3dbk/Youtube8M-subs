00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.759
 that was 2 percent unbelievable for what 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.720
 an end we have greatly in 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.680
 kicked the ass 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.870
 and i have to say i really had 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.340
 a huge fun with the game and 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.349
 if I liked the last one and the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.460
 whole videos gives the videos or too 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.320
 this video a thumbs up 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.609
 Practical your favorites and let 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.140
 comment there and let us know how 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.020
 I liked it I had one 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.470
 Giant fun and joke in the third part 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.689
 give 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
 I strongly assume that too 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.930
 bit, well, the end was perhaps 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.029
 not so great is just so the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.029
 run day what we do now 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.680
 ingenious 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.600
 Absolutely awesome I had to say it was felt 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.420
 already cool he would say yes he would rather 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.219
 not so on average because they are not 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.270
 the game then maybe a two 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.370
 times and and what makes it fun as you 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.160
 can still upgrade the black boxes 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.629
 search can build even more buildings 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 the club thinks that build 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.739
 can look for further buildings and continue 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.869
 upgrading can be easy but the last one 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.590
 fight against aids was already epic 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.510
 really cool 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.560
 you can just enjoy that very much 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.560

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.280
 a complete review of the game 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.870
 make up to 2 percent by 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.209
 For example, the graphics are what I talk about 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.280
 about the moves just think about that 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.280
 whole game will be awesome in any case 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.680
 once this video is high 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.680
 Of course then the review above 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.260
 we still have a nice happy 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.260
 ending 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.870
 the publishing people that I 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.950
 really what was my last if 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.260
 I do it when I play the games where I said 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.239
 I have really worked so many 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.090
 People meanwhile just that 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.470
 just blatantly that's so huge 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.780
 I would have finished everything with the game 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.319
 on-site at work maybe 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.319
 not thought at all 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.959
 Canada 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.959
 aroused 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.910
 after doing some decent work with the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.420
 game done pretty well because 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.120
 the moves 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.120
 fusion the monsters to be completed 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.780
 already cool 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.820
 so many maries 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.820
 Marie Marie Marie 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.650
 I even get a crooked wall 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.050
 whole credits by short two types 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.400

 have played through the scabies look 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.140
 we have to know because you get for 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.889
 but why not 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.580
 the user had to play the game 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.580
 really check for heart and kidney 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.140
 fries alex mercer 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.839
 and I can agree with ours 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:59.209
 that's really saying a lot 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:59.209
 a lot of trouble with the votes 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.730
 if the super many 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.320
 To be honest, I have to say that 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.380
 super long ago that I always have one 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.830
 bought another game as a call of 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.830

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.760
 absorbed 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.720
 Okay, the story is complete 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.550

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.900

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.180
 G 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.870

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.870

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.440
 but make the city so unsafe here 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.820
 when I liked the last play 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.380
