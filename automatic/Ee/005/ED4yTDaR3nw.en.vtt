00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
can compete in this format to a certain

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.289 
can compete in this format to a certain
degree<00:00:12.480> I'm<00:00:12.960> not<00:00:13.500> saying<00:00:13.830> it's<00:00:14.099> gonna<00:00:14.580> do

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
degree I'm not saying it's gonna do

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.689 
degree I'm not saying it's gonna do
really<00:00:15.599> well<00:00:15.900> against<00:00:16.260> plants<00:00:16.949> or<00:00:17.100> rabbit

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
really well against plants or rabbit

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.939 
really well against plants or rabbit
which<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.449> basically<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.140> format<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:19.800> I'm

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
which is basically the format but I'm

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.950 
which is basically the format but I'm
saying<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.609> take<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> regional<00:00:21.779> or

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
saying if you take it to a regional or

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.620 
saying if you take it to a regional or
something<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.740> may<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.630> decent

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
results so what makes my build different

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.919 
results so what makes my build different
from<00:00:28.590> other<00:00:28.859> people<00:00:29.310> well<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.480> main<00:00:30.689> card

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929
