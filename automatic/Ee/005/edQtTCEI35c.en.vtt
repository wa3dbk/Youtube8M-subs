00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.010 

I<00:00:01.639> love<00:00:02.639> that<00:00:03.060> math<00:00:03.389> generally<00:00:04.290> has<00:00:06.020> initially

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
I love that math generally has initially

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.260 
I love that math generally has initially
clear<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.740> precise<00:00:08.100> answers<00:00:08.549> that<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.059> know

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
clear and precise answers that you know

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.520 
clear and precise answers that you know
when<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.570> know<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.170> know<00:00:10.320> when<00:00:10.440> you

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
when you know it and you know when you

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.189 
when you know it and you know when you
don't<00:00:10.709> know<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.420> as<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.600> get<00:00:12.719> farther<00:00:12.959> on<00:00:13.170> in

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:13.199 
don't know it as you get farther on in

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.590 
don't know it as you get farther on in
it<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.680> answers<00:00:13.980> are<00:00:14.190> not<00:00:14.459> so<00:00:14.910> clearly<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.510> the

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
it the answers are not so clearly in the

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.570 
it the answers are not so clearly in the
back<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.869> a<00:00:15.959> book<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.410> initially<00:00:16.890> math<00:00:17.100> has

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
back of a book but initially math has

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.370 
back of a book but initially math has
answers<00:00:18.029> clear<00:00:18.390> answers<00:00:18.449> sometimes<00:00:19.019> they're

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
answers clear answers sometimes they're

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.970 
answers clear answers sometimes they're
hard<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.589> find<00:00:20.000> but<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.060> clarity<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.560> second

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
hard to find but that clarity the second

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.159 
hard to find but that clarity the second
thing<00:00:23.099> I<00:00:23.189> love<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.400> math<00:00:23.849> is<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
thing I love about math is it's it's a

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.829 
thing I love about math is it's it's a
puzzle<00:00:25.650> solving<00:00:26.070> kind<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.580> if<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.329> can<00:00:27.509> figure

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839 
puzzle solving kind of if I can figure

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.810 
puzzle solving kind of if I can figure
it<00:00:28.019> out<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.650> joy<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:28.980> figuring<00:00:29.579> it<00:00:29.699> out

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
it out and the joy of figuring it out

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.730 
it out and the joy of figuring it out
the<00:00:30.060> kind<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.390> sense<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.749> accomplishment<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the kind of sense of accomplishment the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.939 
the kind of sense of accomplishment the
sense<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.130> excitement<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.060> get<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.949> the

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
sense of excitement when you get it the

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.410 
sense of excitement when you get it the
challenge<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.520> trying<00:00:35.789> to<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:36.090> it

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
challenge of trying to get it

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.590 
challenge of trying to get it
it's<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.460> puzzle<00:00:38.460> solving<00:00:38.850> kind<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.359> thing

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it's that puzzle solving kind of thing

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.590 
it's that puzzle solving kind of thing
that<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> really<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.100> decided<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.180> wanted<00:00:42.329> to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that I really like I decided I wanted to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.639 
that I really like I decided I wanted to
do<00:00:42.750> math<00:00:43.699> probably<00:00:44.699> when<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.500> Oh<00:00:47.629> a

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
do math probably when I was in Oh a

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.849 
do math probably when I was in Oh a
junior<00:00:49.649> senior<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.219> high<00:00:50.340> school<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:51.679> was<00:00:52.679> good

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
junior senior in high school I was good

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.910 
junior senior in high school I was good
at<00:00:52.980> math<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.519> liked<00:00:54.090> math<00:00:54.359> I<00:00:54.750> got<00:00:54.809> rewarded<00:00:55.710> for

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
at math I liked math I got rewarded for

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.860 
at math I liked math I got rewarded for
math<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.429> had<00:00:56.670> lots<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.969> confidence<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.660> math

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
math so I had lots of confidence in math

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.490 
math so I had lots of confidence in math
and<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> decided<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:00.870> more<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and that and so I decided to do more and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.400 
and that and so I decided to do more and
it<00:01:01.949> sort<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.250> fed<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.640> itself<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.329> think<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
it sort of fed on itself I think one of

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.540 
it sort of fed on itself I think one of
the<00:01:04.559> problems<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.100> math<00:01:05.340> is<00:01:06.080> if<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
the problems with math is if you if you

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.400 
the problems with math is if you if you
aren't<00:01:08.820> strong<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.720> end<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.050> with<00:01:10.200> weak

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
aren't strong in it you end up with weak

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.890 
aren't strong in it you end up with weak
weak<00:01:11.010> spots<00:01:11.370> in<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.700> foundation<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.750> if

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
weak spots in the foundation and so if

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
weak spots in the foundation and so if
you<00:01:12.990> want<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> build<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.800> that<00:01:14.010> if<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.790> want<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you want to build on that if you want to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
you want to build on that if you want to
go<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.300> and<00:01:15.480> major<00:01:15.690> in<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.830> do<00:01:16.980> honors

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
go in and major in it or on to do honors

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100 
go in and major in it or on to do honors
in<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.360> do<00:01:18.510> need<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.750> solid

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
in it you really do need a solid

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.140 
in it you really do need a solid
foundation<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.940> if<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.290> don't<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.830> it

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
foundation and so if you don't have it

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.760 
foundation and so if you don't have it
if<00:01:24.150> you've<00:01:24.390> had<00:01:24.510> a<00:01:24.540> bad<00:01:24.750> experience<00:01:24.870> with<00:01:25.440> math

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
if you've had a bad experience with math

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.580 
if you've had a bad experience with math
you<00:01:26.520> tend<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.940> sort<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.360> Slough<00:01:28.050> it<00:01:28.200> off<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you tend to sort of Slough it off and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.420 
you tend to sort of Slough it off and
that's<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.890> serious<00:01:29.430> mistake<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.480> I

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
that's a serious mistake I think I

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.530 
that's a serious mistake I think I
believe<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.670> appropriate<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.510> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
believe was the appropriate with the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.290 
believe was the appropriate with the
right<00:01:33.840> resources<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.620> help<00:01:34.890> most<00:01:35.790> people<00:01:36.120> can

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
right resources and help most people can

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.030 
right resources and help most people can
learn<00:01:36.450> most<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.050> math<00:01:37.260> that<00:01:37.470> they<00:01:37.800> need<00:01:38.010> to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
learn most of the math that they need to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.030 
learn most of the math that they need to
learn<00:01:38.330> but<00:01:39.330> in<00:01:39.510> almost<00:01:39.900> any<00:01:40.140> class<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.860> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
learn but in almost any class that you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.710 
learn but in almost any class that you
go<00:01:41.220> into<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.880> need<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> make<00:01:42.330> sure<00:01:42.360> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
go into you need to make sure that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480 
go into you need to make sure that
you're<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.170> starting<00:01:43.530> point<00:01:43.590> people<00:01:44.370> come

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you're at the starting point people come

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.920 
you're at the starting point people come
in<00:01:44.760> with<00:01:44.910> different<00:01:44.940> backgrounds<00:01:45.870> different

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
in with different backgrounds different

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.380 
in with different backgrounds different
preparations<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.400> you're<00:01:47.580> not<00:01:47.760> all<00:01:48.060> on

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
preparations and so you're not all on

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.930 
preparations and so you're not all on
the<00:01:49.110> first<00:01:49.290> day<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.830> exactly<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> same<00:01:50.640> place

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
the first day at exactly the same place

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.450 
the first day at exactly the same place
and<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.380> go<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.860> learn<00:01:52.950> math<00:01:53.190> you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and so you can go on and learn math you

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.400 
and so you can go on and learn math you
may<00:01:53.580> need<00:01:53.760> tutorials<00:01:54.510> you<00:01:54.630> may<00:01:54.690> need<00:01:54.960> tutors

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
may need tutorials you may need tutors

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.160 
may need tutorials you may need tutors
etc<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.580> your<00:01:56.850> foundation<00:01:57.180> solid<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.140> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
etc to get your foundation solid so that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.740 
etc to get your foundation solid so that
you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.560> build<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.950> next<00:01:59.130> course<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.820> but

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you can build the next course on it but

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.690 
you can build the next course on it but
math<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.590> complicated<00:02:01.980> that<00:02:02.460> most

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
math is not so complicated that most

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.240 
math is not so complicated that most
people<00:02:03.090> can't<00:02:03.330> learn<00:02:03.600> high<00:02:04.380> school<00:02:04.710> math<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
people can't learn high school math and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.790 
people can't learn high school math and
certainly<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.180> introductory<00:02:06.690> courses<00:02:07.230> in<00:02:07.530> in

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
certainly the introductory courses in in

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.009 
certainly the introductory courses in in
university<00:02:08.550> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.329> want<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> go<00:02:09.689> on<00:02:09.840> and

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
university if you want to go on and

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.140 
university if you want to go on and
major<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.469> math<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:11.009> new<00:02:11.159> honours<00:02:11.519> in<00:02:11.670> math<00:02:11.849> or

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
major in math or new honours in math or

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.400 
major in math or new honours in math or
take<00:02:12.629> through<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> career<00:02:13.200> at

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
take through a career at

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.860 
take through a career at
you<00:02:13.680> really<00:02:13.950> do<00:02:14.100> need<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.520> good<00:02:14.670> at<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.880> but

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
you really do need to be good at it but

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.500 
you really do need to be good at it but
I<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:16.290> too<00:02:16.470> many<00:02:16.620> people<00:02:16.770> stop<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.910> too<00:02:18.180> soon

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
I think too many people stop it too soon

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.840 
I think too many people stop it too soon
because<00:02:19.200> they've<00:02:19.500> had<00:02:19.650> bad<00:02:19.800> experiences<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
because they've had bad experiences I

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.560 
because they've had bad experiences I
think<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:23.670> think<00:02:23.700> math<00:02:24.150> teachers

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
think that and I think math teachers

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.680 
think that and I think math teachers
have<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> lot<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.640> responsibility<00:02:26.640> for<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.000> we

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
have a lot of responsibility for that we

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.300 
have a lot of responsibility for that we
haven't<00:02:28.020> taught<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:28.560> well<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:29.100> haven't

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
haven't taught it so well we haven't

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.070 
haven't taught it so well we haven't
provided<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.910> resources<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.570> people<00:02:30.900> need

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
provided the resources that people need

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.670 
provided the resources that people need
and<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:32.180> think<00:02:33.180> if<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.930> need<00:02:34.170> help<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.560> need

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
and so I think if you need help you need

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.350 
and so I think if you need help you need
to<00:02:34.800> get<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.370> need<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.670> get<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:36.000> early

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
to get it and you need to get it early

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.860 
to get it and you need to get it early
and<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:38.220> need<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.460> work<00:02:38.640> at<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.180> way<00:02:39.720> we

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
and you need to work at it the way we

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.080 
and you need to work at it the way we
teach<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.260> university<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.610> high

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
teach it in university and in high

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.690 
teach it in university and in high
school<00:02:42.360> as<00:02:42.510> well<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.050> colleges<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.580> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
school as well and colleges is if you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.760 
school as well and colleges is if you
fall<00:02:44.970> behind<00:02:45.180> you're<00:02:45.990> in<00:02:46.140> desperate<00:02:46.620> trouble

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
fall behind you're in desperate trouble

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.510 
fall behind you're in desperate trouble
that<00:02:47.640> if<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.810> miss<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.080> class<00:02:49.230> or<00:02:49.800> miss<00:02:49.980> an<00:02:50.130> idea

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
that if you miss a class or miss an idea

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.430 
that if you miss a class or miss an idea
or<00:02:50.760> don't<00:02:51.000> do<00:02:51.150> your<00:02:51.270> homework<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.990> go<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
or don't do your homework you go to the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.530 
or don't do your homework you go to the
next<00:02:52.650> class<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.370> teacher<00:02:53.580> assumes<00:02:54.360> you

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
next class and the teacher assumes you

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.780 
next class and the teacher assumes you
know<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.930> but<00:02:55.710> it's<00:02:55.860> like<00:02:55.950> Greek<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.580> and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
know it but it's like Greek to you and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.810 
know it but it's like Greek to you and
so<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.140> biggest<00:02:58.380> challenge<00:02:58.770> is<00:02:59.190> not<00:02:59.220> falling

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
so the biggest challenge is not falling

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.510 
so the biggest challenge is not falling
behind<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.870> strategy<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.530> do<00:03:02.250> whatever

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
behind and the strategy is do whatever

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.370 
behind and the strategy is do whatever
needs<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.090> be<00:03:03.210> done<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.840> don't<00:03:03.900> fall

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
needs to be done so you don't fall

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.010 
needs to be done so you don't fall
behind<00:03:04.970> seek<00:03:05.970> help<00:03:06.270> wherever<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.810> can<00:03:06.960> find

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
behind seek help wherever you can find

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.920 
behind seek help wherever you can find
it<00:03:07.470> from<00:03:07.850> students<00:03:08.850> from<00:03:09.090> student<00:03:09.720> help

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
it from students from student help

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.630 
it from students from student help
centers<00:03:10.440> from<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.950> teacher<00:03:11.190> from<00:03:11.550> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
it because if you fall behind it's like

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.880 
it because if you fall behind it's like
you're<00:03:15.960> missing<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.320> floor<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.740> building

or<00:03:38.130> going<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.150> class<00:03:39.360> has<00:03:39.600> no<00:03:39.780> point<00:03:40.080> if<00:03:40.320> you

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
or going to class has no point if you

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.990 
or going to class has no point if you
don't<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:40.710> to<00:03:40.740> class<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.220> just<00:03:41.250> gets<00:03:41.580> worse<00:03:41.760> it

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
don't go to class it just gets worse it

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.940 
don't go to class it just gets worse it
snowballs<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.690> once<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.560> starts<00:03:43.830> going

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
snowballs and once it starts going

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.030 
snowballs and once it starts going
downhill<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:44.700> you're<00:03:45.690> in<00:03:45.780> trouble<00:03:45.990> and<00:03:46.320> so

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
downhill it's you're in trouble and so

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.860 
downhill it's you're in trouble and so
the<00:03:47.160> biggest<00:03:47.400> secret<00:03:47.970> or<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.150> biggest<00:03:48.420> piece

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
the biggest secret or the biggest piece

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.160 
the biggest secret or the biggest piece
of<00:03:49.020> advice<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.880> get<00:03:50.880> help<00:03:51.090> early<00:03:51.330> from<00:03:51.840> as<00:03:51.990> many

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
of advice is get help early from as many

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.810 
of advice is get help early from as many
people<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.680> there's<00:03:52.830> lots<00:03:53.070> of<00:03:53.220> sources<00:03:53.610> for

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
people and there's lots of sources for

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.350 
people and there's lots of sources for
help<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.360> other<00:03:54.959> students<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.830> course

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
help that other students in the course

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.240 
help that other students in the course
teachers<00:03:57.360> etc<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.050> so<00:03:58.170> go<00:03:58.560> there<00:03:58.800> for<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.160> and

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
teachers etc and so go there for it and

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.980 
teachers etc and so go there for it and
go<00:03:59.490> early<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.209> go<00:04:00.660> as<00:04:00.990> often<00:04:01.530> as<00:04:01.680> necessary

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
go early and go as often as necessary

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.880 
go early and go as often as necessary
one<00:04:03.990> of<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.170> wonderful<00:04:04.530> things<00:04:04.680> about

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
one of the wonderful things about

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.270 
one of the wonderful things about
mathematics<00:04:05.610> I<00:04:05.940> think<00:04:06.480> is<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:07.230> people<00:04:07.770> are

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
mathematics I think is that people are

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.570 
mathematics I think is that people are
impressed<00:04:09.260> it's<00:04:10.260> often<00:04:10.680> seen<00:04:10.830> as<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> very<00:04:11.310> hard

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
impressed it's often seen as a very hard

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.420 
impressed it's often seen as a very hard
subject<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.570> if<00:04:12.720> you've<00:04:12.900> done<00:04:13.170> math<00:04:13.440> it's

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
subject and so if you've done math it's

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.330 
subject and so if you've done math it's
often<00:04:14.880> treated<00:04:15.540> as<00:04:15.780> an<00:04:15.990> entrance<00:04:16.530> requirement

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
often treated as an entrance requirement

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.099 
often treated as an entrance requirement
as<00:04:17.520> a<00:04:17.549> credential<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.390> do<00:04:18.510> lots<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.989> other

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
as a credential to do lots of other

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.030 
as a credential to do lots of other
things<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.700> one<00:04:21.660> idea<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.229> some<00:04:22.620> for

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
things and so one idea is that some for

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.940 
things and so one idea is that some for
example<00:04:23.130> some<00:04:23.729> MBA<00:04:24.090> programs<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.350> only<00:04:25.770> thing

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
example some MBA programs the only thing

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.410 
example some MBA programs the only thing
there

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
there

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.200 
there
are<00:04:26.570> going<00:04:26.870> into<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.200> as<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.320> math<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:28.220> good

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
are going into it as a math is a good

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.120 
are going into it as a math is a good
solid<00:04:29.600> math<00:04:29.930> understanding<00:04:30.620> they<00:04:30.740> can<00:04:30.920> teach

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
solid math understanding they can teach

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.500 
solid math understanding they can teach
you<00:04:31.310> all<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> business<00:04:31.910> they<00:04:32.120> just<00:04:32.150> can't

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
you all the business they just can't

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.590 
you all the business they just can't
teach<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.960> math<00:04:33.170> fast<00:04:33.560> enough<00:04:33.920> and<00:04:34.130> so<00:04:34.310> I

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
teach you the math fast enough and so I

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.660 
teach you the math fast enough and so I
think<00:04:35.600> that<00:04:35.930> math<00:04:36.290> aside<00:04:36.890> from<00:04:37.160> obvious

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
think that math aside from obvious

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.150 
think that math aside from obvious
careers<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.300> require<00:04:38.360> math<00:04:39.020> if<00:04:40.010> you're

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
careers that require math if you're

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.530 
careers that require math if you're
going<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:40.340> go<00:04:40.430> work<00:04:40.640> in<00:04:40.790> a<00:04:40.880> department<00:04:41.060> that

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
going to go work in a department that

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.050 
going to go work in a department that
does<00:04:42.160> operations<00:04:43.160> research<00:04:43.550> or<00:04:43.790> something

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
does operations research or something

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.160 
does operations research or something
like<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.330> they'll<00:04:44.540> want<00:04:44.690> people<00:04:45.080> with

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
like that they'll want people with

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.740 
like that they'll want people with
specific<00:04:45.800> skills<00:04:45.950> in<00:04:46.310> mathematics<00:04:46.510> but<00:04:47.510> math

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
specific skills in mathematics but math

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.860 
specific skills in mathematics but math
is<00:04:47.960> often<00:04:48.320> seen<00:04:48.560> as<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.830> as<00:04:49.340> a<00:04:50.030> filter<00:04:50.600> or<00:04:50.750> as<00:04:50.840> a

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
is often seen as a as a filter or as a

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.480 
is often seen as a as a filter or as a
screen<00:04:51.290> for<00:04:51.530> many<00:04:51.740> many<00:04:52.010> other<00:04:52.190> disciplines

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
screen for many many other disciplines

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.670 
screen for many many other disciplines
and<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:53.180> if<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.480> I<00:04:53.780> guess<00:04:54.230> what<00:04:54.350> I'm<00:04:54.440> trying<00:04:54.650> to

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
and so if you I guess what I'm trying to

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.860 
and so if you I guess what I'm trying to
say<00:04:54.860> is<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.490> can<00:04:55.670> think<00:04:55.820> broad<00:04:56.180> because<00:04:56.510> math

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
say is you can think broad because math

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.870 
say is you can think broad because math
actually<00:04:57.170> is<00:04:57.530> a<00:04:57.560> is<00:04:57.980> a<00:04:58.040> solid<00:04:58.550> preparation

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
actually is a is a solid preparation

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.180 
actually is a is a solid preparation
it's<00:04:59.450> a<00:04:59.540> good<00:04:59.780> credential<00:05:00.380> to<00:05:00.500> go<00:05:00.650> into<00:05:00.950> lots

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
it's a good credential to go into lots

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.070 
it's a good credential to go into lots
of<00:05:01.400> different<00:05:01.880> fields<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.420> people<00:05:02.600> often

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
of different fields that people often

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.970 
of different fields that people often
don't<00:05:03.200> consider<00:05:03.620> at<00:05:03.920> the<00:05:04.130> at<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.670> beginning
