00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.900
 hello to all girls here is dinner with one 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.180
 new episode of the blue fairy 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.400
 Blue fairy is not dead but I always have 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.400
 from the networks I start so many columns and 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.439
 then all continue with them 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.210
 monthly cadence would involve doing 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.910
 really a mile a day 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.310
 I still have to do the masters or indeed of 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.949
 essence but I haven't forgotten it not 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.810
 you worry but we come to you there 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.599
 I want to give practical advice I have 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.340
 collected the first in recent months 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.650
 I recommend that video I have just 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.280
 born because just recorded a video is 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.549
 just feed the lengths with a needle 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 China of oil immediately after doing it 

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:48.589
 shampoo last year I told you precisely 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.390
 to apply only the oil a drop 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.129
 just on the tips it was 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.989
 precisely all in flax seeds but 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.930
 especially the light then oil 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.019
 of argan jojoba oil above all 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.790
 today I say to you with serenity that a 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.710
 trick to avoid knots in the hair 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.930
 especially because it has curly hair and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.760
 crespi is precisely that of applying them 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.380
 from the lengths onwards where per 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.210
 lengths means all that is not 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.700
 in close contact with the luca in 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.040
 so from there and do not panic 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.260
 when you apply just one year 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.730
 china a droplet its goal of 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.090
 teaspoon even if you have hair 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.130
 long like my fairies so you put them there 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.170
 even if you don't look like your hair 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.490
 they absorb so much that if you put a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.960
 bit of excessive relief then for 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.940
 degrease billions of donuts 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.050
 council number two the council on 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.860
 number two is an advice that I have in short 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.600
 acquired with experience in 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.110
 particular in a few years ago I did 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.510
 the paul j reconstruction 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.400
 a very competent person that he is 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.630
 long had flaked in the part 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.670
 higher 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.780
 until I discovered a cream that 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.180
 they have been around for years 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.950
 but for those of you doing the reconstruction is 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.980
 a cream that is used to reinforce the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.570
 hooves of the horses you find for a 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.090
 cost of 7 euros 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.040
 on the site that they tell you in the box below 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.110
 and it's called elves use of one's health 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.560
 I put on healthy horse sugar 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.560
 the picture 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.750
 and it's a really wonderful cream 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.310
 reconstitutes totally precisely long 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.950
 to the nail surface but another 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.430
 this is just as effective a trick 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.440
 growth activator of collistar me 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.640
 I came up to here how 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.450
 you can see is a gel that should be spread 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.490
 on the nail it is absorbed is practically me 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.230
 within a week he solved 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.260
 all the damage that had been created in two 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.510
 busted packaging weeks 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.060
 moving furniture assembly disassembly 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.060
 furniture is really effective remains 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.190
 transparent on the nail and pleasant and it is 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.380
 highly recommended because it rebuilds it 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.180
 one can see that being absorbed 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.420
 especially for flaked nails that 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.820
 maybe short of disability in clothes and 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.700
 so it reopens and hurts you is 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.660
 really glad that i want to give you is 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.250
 that of disinfecting the brushes in that 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.720
 so it's a trick I learned thanks 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.610
 to continue enemy and it was 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.130
 very effective because this winter I am 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.180
 been several times struck by the tsar 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.610
 jolo 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.160
 you must first use the 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.190
 special cleaners maybe if you have 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.440
 precisely the stye also shares it a 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.740
 any infection and it would be good 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.800
 normally talk about it in every 2 3 months put 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.470
 a bit of mutine ie the brushes 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.390
 with a pinch of amuchina a little water 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.080
 and of course not in a bath 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.010
 touch the handle and do not come off 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.100
 the last advice I want to give you 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.420
 but today it's for combing eyelashes 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.690
 lower 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.780
 I always recommend you maybe for the 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.450
 lovers of our fatty pipe cleaners of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.060
 keep the ones you hate most because 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.460
 I often use a 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.170
 mascara for the upper lashes and the 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.880
 very thin mascara for the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.130
 lower lashes 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.720
 I hope to be helpful or foreign 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.030
 to have made especially happy 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.080
 my friend assets that they wanted so much 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.190
 just a new episode is not at all 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.380
 zucchini are still full of advice 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.430
 give you but I don't want to get too bored 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.650
 so expect another episode 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.100
 short milan left-handed to the next hello 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.100
