00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hi, how are you people saying hello ? 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.990
 new account and it's a pleasure to have them 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.390
 here again and this time 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.190
 I'm bringing a video with the card 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:17.010
 nvidia 660 in slide although it is not a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.940
 alone are two conversions of with the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.500
 processor in this does not come one another or 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.510
 nobody that is completely with the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.449
 Factory settings coming from the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.619
 two cards are from the zotac brand both 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.600
 ok well it's heard out there and I've seen 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.729
 that they are agents that you can 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.940
 play in ultra series with everything with nothing 

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:41.129
 is to take him against and it is a lie 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.089
 full we can this video I recorded it 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.769
 much as you see the 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.089
 graphic configuration that I put not him 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.999
 I put not even motion blur nor the 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.190
 resolution and the is that the resolution of 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.929
 scale at 200 because it can be 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.239
 completely against and still the 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.940
 game there are moments in which it goes down to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.579
 40 50 frames per second and this is no longer 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.739
 is comfortable and without saying where you 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.899
 feels like playing by myself 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.240
 I have problems at this time of 12 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.570
 coming soon this video will be a 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.820
 horrible but this time it was worse 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 still because of that to this configuration 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 graphic that I put you can not 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.990
 play in ultra you can play with a 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.060
 goal that I'm going to show in another video 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.369
 later probably after 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.320
 that this one up the other with a fair 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.509
 settings in which the game runs 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.600
 perfect usually always up 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.310
 of 80 or 90 frames per second in the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.520
 what forgiveness 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.130
 you can see everything at a distance near the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.899
 stone is a bit of graphics a bit 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.390
 but really if you what you want is 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.390
 play comfortable I would recommend you more 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.390
 does not mean that these cards in 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.790
 Islay are bad grades are very good 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.450
 cards because they are to some extent 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.640
 the ultra setting but they do not do it to the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.479
 perfection the low in the boxes by 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.720
 second where it should not be because 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.979
 the card does not work 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.770
 When it's worth it's worth it 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:13.160
 buy those that like life 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.320
 changing the subject a bit what is the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.110
 video recording is done with the 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.990
 program of a play of life that comes in 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.670
 the force that is a program that 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.590
 really surprised the quality is 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.260
 incredible and it leaves you in a weight 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.750
 quite reduced compared to others 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.610
 programs not with sites is the best 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.080
 I've tried because I've tried several 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.090
 but this program has surprised me 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.020
 quite and above all to do free 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.420
 for people who wear that kind of costume 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.760
 already high-end 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.730
 and I really tell them they do not consume almost 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.849
 no resources do not notice a difference 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.150
 having the active and deactivated and if the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.160
 there was minimal I do not read do not notice those 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.050
 differences is amazing what it does 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.880
 this program for us and it is very 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.709
 easy to use has the options of 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.030
 that you record the amount by a song 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.730
 of minutes 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.340
 do not let free you plan to record 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.500
 automatically when you enter the game 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.850
 once inside the video game with the f 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.739
 9 is a program that I liked a lot 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.690
 and I recommend them if they have cards 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.430
 video of the 600 series of 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.650
 insistent ahead are going to have it 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.390
 available and it's very easy for kids that 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.380
 use or maybe to record your gameplay 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.380
 share it with your friends 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.739
 always memories of certain moments 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.569
 chavos to me there is nothing more 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.209
 add only that if they like the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.860
 video at the end give me a like 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.450
 comment that you thought that more than 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.930
 between my channel and the guy that in the 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.250
 comment team of 66 560 ti I'm 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.170
 checking to see what is possible to see if 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.480
 with this card since I do not have 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.959
 access to it for the moment but let's 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.670
 to see that they give me a like as I already 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.959
 I said subscribe if you have not done so for 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.750
 that they are aware that they can sexual 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.370
 Gameplay game to my channel and
