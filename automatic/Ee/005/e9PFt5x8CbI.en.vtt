I<00:00:25.539> think<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:25.930> plays<00:00:26.109> like<00:00:26.320> it<00:00:26.470> when<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.710> balls

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
I think the plays like it when the balls

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.890 
I think the plays like it when the balls
come<00:00:27.369> out<00:00:27.490> on<00:00:27.640> it<00:00:27.789> yeah<00:00:28.000> definitely<00:00:28.599> I<00:00:28.630> mean
