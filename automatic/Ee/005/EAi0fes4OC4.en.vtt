00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
your car is steering too much so if you

looking steer to get there maybe even
have<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> add<00:00:59.219> some<00:00:59.520> throttle<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.969> put<00:01:00.149> some

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
have to add some throttle to put some

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
go straight when you turn that's called

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.840 
go straight when you turn that's called
understeer<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.280> happen<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.700> driving

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
understeer so if we happen to be driving

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.410 
understeer so if we happen to be driving
along<00:01:12.330> coming<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.080> icy<00:01:13.470> corner<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.420> steer

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
along coming to an icy corner and steer

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
along coming to an icy corner and steer
with<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.720> steering<00:01:15.960> wheel<00:01:16.140> too<00:01:16.560> much<00:01:16.830> we

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
with the steering wheel too much we

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.630 
with the steering wheel too much we
might<00:01:17.909> find<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.560> reduce<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
might find that we have to reduce the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
might find that we have to reduce the
amount<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.939> steering<00:01:21.420> suddenly<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.560> front

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
amount of steering suddenly the front

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.100 
amount of steering suddenly the front
tires<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.369> regain<00:01:23.759> grip<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.330> carry<00:01:24.780> us<00:01:24.869> where

tires can regain grip and carry us where

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.230 
tires can regain grip and carry us where
we'd<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.560> go<00:01:25.680> regaining<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.850> grip

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
we'd like to go regaining that grip

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.510 
we'd like to go regaining that grip
