00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 it all starts watching TV 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.839
 cars or tractors with 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.760
 water as fuel it's not a 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.440
 dream but a reality a technique that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.580
 meets with some success with 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.620
 the increase in fuel prices 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.379
 especially one among farmers at 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.130
 marylebone years old fabien deleury 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.740
 information to interpol and my 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.779
 spectator sensitivity concerned about 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.070
 the future of our sick world as soon as 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.990
 first clicks on the internet 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.519
 I noticed an obvious craze of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 media for the topic an initiative 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.230
 original the communal vehicle rolls 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.930
 with gasoline and naulleau a system 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.460
 injection of water into the diesel is this 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.660
 that this process works is really 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.309
 on the Web 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.320
 apart from some opaque controversy 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.120
 on forums we did not learn big 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.440
 more thing and as we are never 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.660
 as well served as by oneself 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.590
 I decided to go to meet 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.590
 his anonymous inventors 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.040
 and you 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.040
 and 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.370
 the biggest comment we make is 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.600
 that if it works and we would have more 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.070
 survived from origin is at 11 liters to 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.900
 the hour about consumption says 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.270
 admitted says it on time and there we turn 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.830
 around 6 liters and a half ago there are 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.940
 irreducible who said they wait 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.000
 there is still something to scratch 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.560
 and who showed and demonstrated by a plus 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 b because it works every day and 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.009
 that there are plenty of people who ride with 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.330
 islands that save money 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.330
 actually works very well 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.829
 I can not understand why 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.659
 builders do not get over 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.890
 look at the system 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.130
 I spoke to jean martin folz CEO of 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.020
 group at the time 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.079
 engineer training that's what got me 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.240
 says I do not see how this project 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.420
 can walk we hear a lot of 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.469
 things on engines 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.630
 revolutionary like the water engine and 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:01.280
 companies is clearly not 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.280
 pauthe engines that may exist 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.049
 sought to contact the editorial staff of 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.510
 organic auto magazine if I arrive by my 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.099
 speech by experience by my return 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.140
 experience also because we did 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.400
 succeed in making him change this way 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.799
 to think to say ah yes yes actually 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.480
 but it works then we do not have it on 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.370
 our cars 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.110
 why today there are hundreds 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.849
 and tens of thousands of engineers in 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.620
 the world for tens and tens 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.670
 of years working on the subject 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.930
 that's how it could have escaped them 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.049
 good conspiracy theory I do not mind 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.230
 but at this point there still 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.230
 it's strong
