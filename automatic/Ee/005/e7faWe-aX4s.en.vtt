prints are die-cut so when you see it on

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.850 
prints are die-cut so when you see it on
the<00:02:00.689> ebay<00:02:01.079> or<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.649> see<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:01.979> our<00:02:02.159> website<00:02:02.310> um

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
the ebay or you see it on our website um

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.920 
the ebay or you see it on our website um
you<00:02:04.860> might<00:02:05.250> get<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> sheet<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.509> you

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you might get a sheet like this if you

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.339 
you might get a sheet like this if you
just<00:02:07.170> fold<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.590> over<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:08.220> see<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.580> separates

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
just fold it over you see it separates

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.809 
just fold it over you see it separates
so<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.700> two

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
so for this you can do this one of two

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.580 
so for this you can do this one of two
ways

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
ways

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.800 
ways
you<00:02:14.590> can<00:02:14.740> either<00:02:14.920> pin<00:02:15.250> aside<00:02:15.610> which<00:02:16.600> you'd

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
you can either pin aside which you'd

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.830 
you can either pin aside which you'd
fold<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.350> over<00:02:17.500> like<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:18.040> get<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.640> positioned

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
fold it over like this get it positioned

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.840 
fold it over like this get it positioned
pin<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.020> side<00:02:20.260> or<00:02:20.590> what<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.520> do<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.760> you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
pin the side or what you can do is you

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.090 
pin the side or what you can do is you
can<00:02:21.880> remove<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.390> completely<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:23.710> nice<00:02:23.920> thing

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
can remove it completely the nice thing

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.860 
can remove it completely the nice thing
about<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.400> lamination<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.210> it<00:02:25.420> keeps<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
about the lamination is it keeps the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.650 
about the lamination is it keeps the
print<00:02:26.740> more<00:02:26.890> rigid<00:02:27.310> as<00:02:27.460> well<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:27.940> this<00:02:28.450> was

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
print more rigid as well if this was

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.940 
print more rigid as well if this was
just<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.900> regular<00:02:29.230> print<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.740> would<00:02:29.830> actually

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
just the regular print it would actually

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.160 
just the regular print it would actually
fold<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.580> half<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.880> fold<00:02:31.060> over<00:02:31.480> onto<00:02:31.810> itself

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
fold in half and fold over onto itself

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.500 
fold in half and fold over onto itself
so<00:02:32.950> what<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.550> can<00:02:33.640> do<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.940> either<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.270> pin<00:02:34.480> it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
so what you can do is either you pin it

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.480 
so what you can do is either you pin it
again<00:02:34.990> you<00:02:35.110> pin<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.290> from<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.620> center<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.100> you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
again you pin it from the center and you

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.120 
again you pin it from the center and you
work<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.820> out<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.090> each<00:02:37.240> end<00:02:37.420> or<00:02:37.890> what<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:38.980> do

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
work it out on each end or what you do

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.060 
work it out on each end or what you do
is<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.490> pin<00:02:39.820> one<00:02:40.060> corner<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.680> slowly<00:02:41.680> work

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
is you pin one corner and slowly work

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.810 
is you pin one corner and slowly work
your<00:02:42.130> way<00:02:42.490> across<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.560> decal<00:02:44.730> pressing<00:02:45.730> it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
your way across the decal pressing it

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.020 
your way across the decal pressing it
down<00:02:45.900> notice<00:02:46.900> how<00:02:47.020> holding<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.530> up<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
down notice how holding that up and the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.470 
down notice how holding that up and the
squeegee<00:02:49.630> presses<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.500> down<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.209> have<00:02:52.270> any

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
squeegee presses it down if you have any
