00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
crowd to the wall to make you drop

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.340 
crowd to the wall to make you drop
through<00:01:04.030> certain<00:01:04.449> platforms<00:01:04.660> if<00:01:05.020> you<00:01:05.110> hold<00:01:05.290> it

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
through certain platforms if you hold it

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.130 
through certain platforms if you hold it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
down if you want to run you double tap

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.280 
down if you want to run you double tap
open<00:01:08.500> or<00:01:09.190> if<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.550> can<00:01:09.700> just<00:01:09.729> attack<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:11.229> you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
open or if you can just attack if you

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.390 
open or if you can just attack if you
want<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.500> run<00:01:11.620> just<00:01:11.800> double<00:01:12.010> tap<00:01:12.130> in<00:01:12.280> any

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
want to run just double tap in any

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.710 
want to run just double tap in any
direction<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.880> then<00:01:12.970> you<00:01:13.060> move<00:01:13.210> faster<00:01:13.570> than

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
direction and then you move faster than

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.870 
direction and then you move faster than
right<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.860> two<00:01:15.040> button<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.400> your<00:01:15.520> main<00:01:15.670> attack

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
right the two button is your main attack

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.690 
right the two button is your main attack
so<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:17.259> tapping<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.710> will<00:01:17.830> be<00:01:17.979> relatively

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
so just tapping it will be relatively

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.240 
so just tapping it will be relatively
weak<00:01:19.000> standard<00:01:19.420> attacks<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.770> you<00:01:20.950> combine<00:01:21.220> it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
weak standard attacks if you combine it

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.420 
weak standard attacks if you combine it
with<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.490> directional<00:01:21.820> you<00:01:22.750> will<00:01:22.900> do<00:01:23.430> for

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
with a directional you will do for

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.810 
with a directional you will do for
instance<00:01:24.670> up<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:25.780> whoa<00:01:25.930> alright<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:27.700> if<00:01:27.759> I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
instance up and whoa alright see if I

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.280 
instance up and whoa alright see if I
get<00:01:28.000> back<00:01:28.119> there<00:01:28.360> we've<00:01:28.690> worked<00:01:28.930> on<00:01:29.050> this<00:01:29.110> game

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
get back there we've worked on this game

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.790 
get back there we've worked on this game
for<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:30.690> so<00:01:31.690> it's<00:01:31.720> magic<00:01:31.990> tag<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.470> tapping<00:01:32.740> a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
for it so it's magic tag is tapping a

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.010 
for it so it's magic tag is tapping a
directional<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:34.119> that<00:01:34.450> two<00:01:34.660> button<00:01:34.930> at

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
directional and that that two button at

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.880 
directional and that that two button at
the<00:01:35.080> same<00:01:35.140> time<00:01:35.500> so<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.750> getting<00:01:38.530> annihilated

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
the same time so or getting annihilated

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.920 
the same time so or getting annihilated
by<00:01:39.220> huge<00:01:39.520> bombs<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.300> then<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.630> also<00:01:40.780> have

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
by huge bombs and then you also have
