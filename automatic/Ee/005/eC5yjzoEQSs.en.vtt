00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.149 
package and local round until you find
one<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.549> says<00:01:09.140> 25<00:01:10.140> millimeter<00:01:10.860> because

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
one that says 25 millimeter because

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:11.990 
one that says 25 millimeter because
that's<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.549> we're<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:11.939> using

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that's the one we're going to be using

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240 
that's the one we're going to be using
for<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.510> Kodak<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.439> fits<00:01:13.680> perfectly

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
for this Kodak so it fits perfectly

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.450 
for this Kodak so it fits perfectly
right<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.150> top<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:17.280> we're

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
right on top of there but now we're

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.859 
right on top of there but now we're
going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> go<00:01:17.700> ahead<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.299> glue<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
going to go ahead and get this glue and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.420 
going to go ahead and get this glue and
you<00:01:19.439> want<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> make<00:01:19.740> sure<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.310> hundred

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
you want to make sure it's one hundred

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
you want to make sure it's one hundred
percent<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.970> centered<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:22.049> lens<00:01:22.290> there

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
percent is centered on that lens there

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.080 
percent is centered on that lens there
and<00:01:22.830> then<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.369> apply<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.880> bit<00:01:24.000> of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and then just apply a little bit of

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.880 
and then just apply a little bit of
pressure<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.049> let's<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.350> into<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.710> right

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
pressure so let's get into that right

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.230 
pressure so let's get into that right
now<00:01:25.950> I'm<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.549> ahead<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.820> switch<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
now I'm going to go ahead and switch the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
now I'm going to go ahead and switch the
angle<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> little<00:01:28.049> bit<00:01:28.170> easier<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.890> me

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
angle so it's a little bit easier for me

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.850 
angle so it's a little bit easier for me
so<00:01:29.579> go<00:01:29.729> ahead<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> grab<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.439> get<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.590> pen

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so go ahead and grab that get your pen

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.730 
so go ahead and grab that get your pen
your<00:01:32.159> glue<00:01:32.400> pen<00:01:32.579> ready<00:01:33.200> go<00:01:34.200> ahead<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.470> screw

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
your glue pen ready go ahead and screw

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.440 
your glue pen ready go ahead and screw
that<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.130> off

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that right off

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.550 
that right off
should<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.289> ready<00:01:37.469> to<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:41.990> then<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.200> apply<00:01:43.320> it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
should be ready to go then just apply it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.669 
should be ready to go then just apply it
and<00:01:43.890> hold<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> real<00:01:44.579> tight<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:44.850> about<00:01:45.329> no<00:01:46.140> 10

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
and hold it real tight for about no 10

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.980 
and hold it real tight for about no 10
to<00:01:46.829> 15<00:01:47.159> seconds<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:48.240> enough<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> glue

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to 15 seconds just enough so the glue

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
to 15 seconds just enough so the glue
dries<00:01:49.289> and<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.950> will<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.340> hold<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.610> on

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
dries and this will be to hold it on

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.950 
dries and this will be to hold it on
just<00:01:51.000> until<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.479> some<00:01:51.689> stronger

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
just until you get some stronger

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.569 
just until you get some stronger
adhesive<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.710> now<00:01:53.130> i'm<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.429> go<00:01:53.549> ahead

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
adhesive and now i'm going to go ahead

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.760 
adhesive and now i'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:53.789> sink<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.360> even<00:01:54.509> further<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:55.079> got<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and sink it in even further I got a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.080 
and sink it in even further I got a
little<00:01:55.920> bits<00:01:56.159> kind<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.429> old<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.850> sticks

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
little bits kind of old but it sticks

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090 
little bits kind of old but it sticks
really<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:58.049> good<00:01:58.229> almost<00:01:58.590> turns<00:01:58.860> into

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
really really good almost turns into

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.850 
really really good almost turns into
fiberglass<00:01:59.700> this<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.539> Elmer's<00:02:00.990> ultimate

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
fiberglass this is the Elmer's ultimate

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.800 
fiberglass this is the Elmer's ultimate
high<00:02:02.009> performance<00:02:02.549> glue<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.539> let's<00:02:03.689> get

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
high performance glue so let's get

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.270 
high performance glue so let's get
myself<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.380> little<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:05.869> helping<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.280> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
myself a little a little helping here it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.380 
myself a little a little helping here it
acts<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:10.019> fiberglass<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:11.519> hardens

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
acts just like fiberglass it hardens

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.930 
acts just like fiberglass it hardens
like<00:02:12.569> fiberglass<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.959> I'm<00:02:15.959> going<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.140> use<00:02:16.349> this

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
like fiberglass so I'm going to use this

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.559 
like fiberglass so I'm going to use this
go<00:02:17.940> ahead<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.239> get<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:19.670> lens<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:21.000> let<00:02:21.450> it

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
go ahead and get the lens here let it

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.540 
go ahead and get the lens here let it
drip<00:02:21.810> down<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.200> nail

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.440 

and<00:02:25.670> then<00:02:26.120> apply<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.030> spots

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
and then apply it to the to the spots

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:44.170 
and then apply it to the to the spots
that<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.840> need

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.520 

it's<00:02:45.180> very<00:02:45.360> thick<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.930> can<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.140> let<00:02:46.380> it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
it's very thick so you can just let it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.130 
it's very thick so you can just let it
sit<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:47.070> second<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.730> will<00:02:47.940> follow<00:02:48.300> its

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
sit for a second and the will follow its

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.040 
sit for a second and the will follow its
own<00:02:49.350> trail<00:02:49.740> down<00:02:50.300> now<00:02:51.300> I'm<00:02:51.450> sledding<00:02:51.900> that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
own trail down now I'm sledding that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.470 
own trail down now I'm sledding that
glue<00:02:52.350> sit<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.160> Elmer's<00:02:53.460> glue<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.360> going

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
glue sit the Elmer's glue this is going

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.240 
glue sit the Elmer's glue this is going
to<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> little<00:02:54.900> stronger<00:02:55.230> might<00:02:55.920> look<00:02:56.100> a

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
to be a little stronger might look a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.920 
to be a little stronger might look a
little<00:02:56.400> shitty<00:02:56.670> right<00:02:56.880> now<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.060> I'll<00:02:57.420> uh<00:02:57.450> I'll
