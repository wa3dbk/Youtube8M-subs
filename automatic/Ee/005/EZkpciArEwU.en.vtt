00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
turn feather finish same way as we did

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.900 
turn feather finish same way as we did
when<00:01:37.430> we<00:01:37.580> danced<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.150> regular<00:01:38.840> reverse<00:01:39.170> wave

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
when we danced the regular reverse wave

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.460 
when we danced the regular reverse wave
but<00:01:40.910> as<00:01:41.060> we<00:01:41.240> dance<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.630> reverse<00:01:41.900> way<00:01:42.170> we're

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
but as we dance the reverse way we're

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.340 
but as we dance the reverse way we're
adding<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.070> couple<00:01:43.460> parts<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.030> make<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.020> a

quick<00:02:40.390> now<00:02:41.390> we<00:02:41.450> at<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.810> ending<00:02:42.380> which<00:02:42.920> for<00:02:43.430> now

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
quick now we at the ending which for now

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.310 
quick now we at the ending which for now
we<00:02:43.640> use<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.450> heel<00:02:44.750> pull<00:02:45.110> ending<00:02:45.880> slow<00:02:47.320> slow

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
we use the heel pull ending slow slow

00:02:48.320 --> 00:03:00.610 
we use the heel pull ending slow slow
slow<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:52.989> man's<00:02:53.989> part<00:02:54.350> in<00:02:54.470> detail

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.309 

if<00:03:01.620> we<00:03:01.920> dance<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.670> reverse<00:03:03.060> turn<00:03:03.420> feather

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
if we dance the reverse turn feather

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.820 
if we dance the reverse turn feather
finish<00:03:04.560> we<00:03:05.129> would<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.760> slow<00:03:06.830> quick

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
finish we would have this slow quick

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.509 
finish we would have this slow quick
quick<00:03:08.099> slow<00:03:08.940> quick<00:03:09.980> quick<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:13.280> always<00:03:14.280> break

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
quick slow quick quick I always break

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.750 
quick slow quick quick I always break
down<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.510> reverse<00:03:15.870> way<00:03:16.140> into<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.129> individual

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
down the reverse way into the individual

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.690 
down the reverse way into the individual
components<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.480> each<00:03:18.930> component<00:03:19.129> has<00:03:20.129> three

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
components and each component has three

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.650 
components and each component has three
steps<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.330> each<00:03:22.290> component<00:03:22.590> has<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
steps and each component has a a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.250 
steps and each component has a a
distinct<00:03:24.660> rise<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.440> fall<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:27.660> continuous

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
distinct rise and fall so the continuous

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.960 
distinct rise and fall so the continuous
reverse<00:03:29.010> wave<00:03:29.370> has<00:03:30.170> five<00:03:31.170> parts<00:03:31.940> each<00:03:32.940> part

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
reverse wave has five parts each part

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.870 
reverse wave has five parts each part
has<00:03:33.390> three<00:03:33.840> steps<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:34.470> let's<00:03:34.709> call<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.519> part

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
has three steps so let's call this part

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.710 
has three steps so let's call this part
one<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.720> reverse<00:03:37.110> turn<00:03:38.209> slow<00:03:39.500> quick<00:03:40.500> quick
