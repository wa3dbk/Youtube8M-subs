00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.460
 Omsk, at last, from his element rather 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.980
 racing simulators yes it seemed to say 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.980
 kraushkin all his field of view securely 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.520
 I still do not understand what I thought that 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.929
 happened in the name of a great racer 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.300
 in general, that's their business 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.110
 the developers didn't stop registering 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.600
 not great recording or 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.460
 now the car physicist saw the clouds 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.539
 over and full of trivia thank god 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.670
 at least setting the level of difficulty 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.960
 rests this unfortunate omission and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.350
 the game is trying to please again 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.500
 simulator behavior app store 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.490
 in a statement of great developers this 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.910
 part of the game is almost one hundred percent done 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.480
 for the sake of fans from here and a lot of new tracks 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.079
 different weather conditions 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.270
 large fleet 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.500
 and most importantly, a new regime appeared 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.970
 name than security 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.730
 which sets faster in summer but 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.660
 quite different clubs own goal 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.480
 for example we need to drive around 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.700
 sticking out the sixth of the earth by a certain 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.730
 trajectory or wind up languishing 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.670
 bagels a certain place and 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.060
 the list of tricks doesn't end there 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.610
 the more varied you are 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.420
 will perform a try on the track 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.020
 the faster your points will accumulate and you will win 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.630
 in almost every table of the eternal 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.950
 ken block leader 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.490
 we certainly wouldn't 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.579
 there are also other modes that are almost 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.610
 no different from heat 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.560
 and we give up 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.740
 they won't have 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.820
 so remained a deadpan service 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.390
 these with which you can again 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 replay some crashes 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.570
 By the way, even the repetition has changed 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.400
 games now they got stylish 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.480
 youtube logos which represents 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.590
 of yourself nothing more than anchoring your 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.840
 account in the game and you can safely not 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.550
 includes extra programs immediately 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.539
 unload re-up 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.419
 this time the efforts of the developers 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.949
 the graphic parts of the game are very poor 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:27.869
 details at a height not only 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:31.139
 cars but the trust themselves are empty juicy 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.309
 green desert track will try 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:35.519
 smash monitor flying we played from 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.440
 under the wheels and winter beeline evening things 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.980
 and all this under notices 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.170
 nissan third game 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.950
 but to be honest with the increase 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.090
 producing investigates the reasons for any 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.219
 and with this, the developers also did not let everyone down 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.529
 sounds bangs into showers and cracks 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.529
 how to 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.139
 almost all seven points after very 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.339
 entertaining menu 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.379
 and here again does not leave us without joy 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.639
 this is probably the most creative menu 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.719
 which I just saw racing start 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.409
 like nothing special then 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.919
 there is a background lettering and clean 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.539
 side spinning machines like you only 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.059
 enter tour mode 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:24.009
 Vitya several three-dimensional and coal 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.059
 which is certain 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.769
 types of races that you need to go through if 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.219
 for example you go through all the races 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.119
 a series of gold is the descendants of 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:34.089
 triangle will be salads 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:36.549
 and telling the truth will be cool as well 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.579
 again they give us reputation and points for 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.399
 passed the race just now to 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:41.809
 Unfortunately there is no possibility to buy 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:44.359
 All of these author gadgets as well as 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.719
 self in use of the diversity 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.069
 turing is only giving spammer 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.449
 passing game bonus vinyl 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:51.359
 will also be present 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.869
 ordinary Lyamin on stilts multiplayer 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:55.899
 almost with all living things that are in 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:58.429
 single player and say more i 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.429
 I can not because I have not tried it 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.819
 summing up with pride 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.239
 confidence to say that this is probably the 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.540
 best game of the series 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.310
 so in the table I praise yes but 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.959
 understand it exactly that one field honed 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.889
 intuitive you don't want to pour with realism 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.850
 all helpers are included in kind 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.100
 the way finally appeared beautiful 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.460
 refined graphics which even on stage 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.620
 configuration delivers at least 60 fps that 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.960
 very impressive of the minuses 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.560
 the audience made the car interior it 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.840
 a bit upset and parallel cars 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.949
 almost nothing to detail you can 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.259
 had to try 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.090
 also not happy aboard times 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.870
 their trials meticulously 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.740
 tried but their number is a bit 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.719
 grieves 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.389
 but still for this just minor nagging 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.889
 the game came out great even thought to put 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.789
 score type 8 as many as 500 points out of ten that 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.929
 would be very good car simulators 

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:01.050
 who are more drawn to the arcade 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.860
 May we all show you the train 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.789
 play only good games
