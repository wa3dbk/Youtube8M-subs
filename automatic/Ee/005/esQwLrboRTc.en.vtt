coach chase here free catholics we're
gonna<00:00:02.610> be<00:00:02.700> talking<00:00:02.909> about<00:00:02.970> two<00:00:03.330> foot<00:00:03.540> jumping

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
gonna be talking about two foot jumping

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.809 
gonna be talking about two foot jumping
techniques<00:00:04.259> today<00:00:04.380> so<00:00:05.100> when<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.549> trained

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
techniques today so when I trained

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.570 
techniques today so when I trained
athletes<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:07.140> help<00:00:07.470> them<00:00:07.680> jump<00:00:07.890> higher<00:00:08.069> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
athletes to help them jump higher the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.860 
athletes to help them jump higher the
number<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:08.910> thing<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.150> noticed<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.719> lot

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
number one thing I noticed is that a lot

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.020 
number one thing I noticed is that a lot
of<00:00:09.900> people<00:00:10.230> have<00:00:10.469> leaks<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:11.490> there<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.940> their

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
of people have leaks in there and their

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.669 
of people have leaks in there and their
jumping<00:00:12.269> technique<00:00:12.599> what<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.870> mean<00:00:13.049> by<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.349> is

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
jumping technique what I mean by that is

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.709 
jumping technique what I mean by that is
you<00:00:14.639> know<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.910> could<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.089> any<00:00:15.389> number<00:00:15.690> of

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
you know it could be any number of

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.090 
you know it could be any number of
things<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.199> most<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.529> time<00:00:16.680> when<00:00:16.920> they<00:00:16.980> go

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
things but most of the time when they go

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.140 
things but most of the time when they go
to<00:00:17.130> jump<00:00:17.460> they're<00:00:17.609> trying<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.820> jump<00:00:18.029> really

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
to jump they're trying to jump really

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.939 
to jump they're trying to jump really
hard<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.779> they<00:00:19.199> end<00:00:19.320> up<00:00:19.410> dropping<00:00:19.619> their

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
hard and they end up dropping their

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.500 
hard and they end up dropping their
chest<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.609> end<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.150> know<00:00:21.240> doing<00:00:21.359> all

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
chest they end up you know doing all

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.480 
chest they end up you know doing all
kinds<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.840> things<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.170> they're<00:00:22.740> not<00:00:22.980> optimal

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
kinds of things that they're not optimal

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.759 
kinds of things that they're not optimal
so<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> quickest<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.650> easiest

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
so this is the quickest and easiest

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.470 
so this is the quickest and easiest
thing<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:27.090> make<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> biggest

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
thing you can do to make the biggest

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.419 
thing you can do to make the biggest
impact<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:27.990> your<00:00:28.140> vertical<00:00:28.380> jump<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:29.010> what<00:00:29.340> we

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
impact on your vertical jump so what we

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.679 
impact on your vertical jump so what we
have<00:00:29.550> here<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.060> couple<00:00:30.210> cones<00:00:30.480> set

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
have here is we have a couple cones set

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.440 
have here is we have a couple cones set
up<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:31.890> first<00:00:32.160> cone<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.640> basically<00:00:33.120> that

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
up this first cone is basically that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.540 
up this first cone is basically that
it's<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.380> third<00:00:34.620> step<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.160> your<00:00:35.219> two<00:00:35.370> foot

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
it's the third step out in your two foot

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.450 
it's the third step out in your two foot
plant<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.200> this<00:00:37.200> third<00:00:37.500> step<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:37.920> what<00:00:38.370> I'm

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
plant so this third step out what I'm

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.530 
plant so this third step out what I'm
what<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.760> mean<00:00:38.910> by<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.300> when<00:00:39.450> you're

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
what I mean by that is when you're

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.540 
what I mean by that is when you're
running<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:40.530> would<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> step<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.430> you

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
running this would be the step that you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.810 
running this would be the step that you
take<00:00:41.579> before<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.750> go<00:00:42.870> into<00:00:43.050> your<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.800> two<00:00:44.010> all

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
take before you go into your one two all

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.270 
take before you go into your one two all
right<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.660> next<00:00:45.930> step<00:00:46.170> would<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.039> are

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
right this next step would be if I are

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.799 
right this next step would be if I are
this<00:00:47.430> next<00:00:47.670> cone<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> smaller<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.719> be

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
this next cone the smaller one would be

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.690 
this next cone the smaller one would be
if<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.530> set<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.890> where<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.520> just

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
if it's set up to where if I was just

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.430 
if it's set up to where if I was just
running<00:00:50.910> that's<00:00:51.660> where<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:51.930> next<00:00:52.110> step<00:00:52.320> would

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
running that's where my next step would

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
running that's where my next step would
be<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.969> third<00:00:53.969> cone<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> set<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> little

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
be the third cone is set up a little

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.110 
be the third cone is set up a little
further<00:00:55.020> than<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:56.460> reason<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
further than that the reason for that is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.209 
further than that the reason for that is
that's<00:00:57.300> that's<00:00:57.719> showing<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.010> take

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that's that's showing that when I take

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.170 
that's that's showing that when I take
that<00:00:59.340> third<00:00:59.579> step<00:00:59.820> I'm<00:01:00.030> actually

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
that third step I'm actually

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
that third step I'm actually
exaggerating<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> making<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.379> step<00:01:01.710> longer

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
exaggerating and making that step longer

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.250 
exaggerating and making that step longer
so<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.059> I'm<00:01:03.270> able<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.660> take<00:01:03.809> my<00:01:03.960> horizontal

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
so that I'm able to take my horizontal

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.500 
so that I'm able to take my horizontal
speed<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.010> translate<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.909> into<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.270> vertical

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
speed and translate it into my vertical

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.990 
speed and translate it into my vertical
jump<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.189> little<00:01:08.310> bit<00:01:08.490> longer<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
jump so it's a little bit longer a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.460 
jump so it's a little bit longer a
little<00:01:09.030> bit<00:01:09.180> more<00:01:09.390> elongated<00:01:09.869> you're

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
little bit more elongated you're

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.020 
little bit more elongated you're
actually<00:01:10.770> getting<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.310> front<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.939> your

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
actually getting out in front of your

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.649 
actually getting out in front of your
body<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.479> bit<00:01:14.330> alright<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.570> we

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
body a little bit alright so what we

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.170 
body a little bit alright so what we
want<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.500> you're<00:01:17.340> when<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.939> when

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
want to do here is you're when you when

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.609 
want to do here is you're when you when
you<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.420> run-up<00:01:18.840> you're<00:01:19.320> trying<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you do your run-up you're trying to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
you do your run-up you're trying to
accelerate<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.189> whole<00:01:20.340> way<00:01:20.460> through<00:01:20.720> you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
accelerate the whole way through you

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.910 
accelerate the whole way through you
don't<00:01:21.869> want<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> slow<00:01:22.200> down<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.590> don't<00:01:22.740> want<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
don't want to slow down we don't want to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.350 
don't want to slow down we don't want to
see<00:01:23.009> choppy<00:01:23.250> feet<00:01:23.990> we<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.320> plant<00:01:26.360> plant

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
see choppy feet we want to plant plant

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.760 
see choppy feet we want to plant plant
where<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> third<00:01:27.900> step<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.590> able<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
where that third step is to be able to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.710

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
so when I take my third step as soon as

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.420 
so when I take my third step as soon as
I<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> load<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.390> swinging<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:45.990> arms<00:01:46.200> back

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
way up so as soon as I hit here it's

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.289 
way up so as soon as I hit here it's
straight<00:02:01.409> down<00:02:01.880> here<00:02:02.880> straight<00:02:03.270> up

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
straight down here straight up

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.300 
straight down here straight up
everything<00:02:03.990> everything's<00:02:04.619> from<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.130> time

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
everything everything's from this time

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.520 
everything everything's from this time
at<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.579> foot<00:02:05.790> hits<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> time<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.320> one

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
at this foot hits to the time this one

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.080 
at this foot hits to the time this one
hits<00:02:07.680> should<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.009> going<00:02:08.459> straight<00:02:08.789> up<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
hits should be going straight up in the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.800 
hits should be going straight up in the
air<00:02:09.319> alright<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.190> third<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.760> most<00:02:12.540> are

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
air alright the the third and most are

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.290 
air alright the the third and most are
that<00:02:13.110> there

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
that there

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.720 
that there
and<00:02:13.540> next<00:02:14.140> thing<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.380> think<00:02:14.410> about<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.920> your

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
and next thing to think about is your

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.330 
and next thing to think about is your
hip<00:02:15.880> position<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.830> reason<00:02:18.100> we're<00:02:18.220> taking

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
hip position so the reason we're taking

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.670 
hip position so the reason we're taking
that<00:02:18.520> long<00:02:18.760> step<00:02:19.120> is<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.290> foot<00:02:20.530> gets

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
that long step is so that this foot gets

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.890 
that long step is so that this foot gets
out<00:02:20.830> in<00:02:20.920> front<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.310> our<00:02:21.430> hips<00:02:21.660> because<00:02:22.660> our

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
out in front of our hips because our

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.780 
out in front of our hips because our
horizontal<00:02:23.170> momentum<00:02:23.590> from<00:02:23.920> from<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.490> run-up

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
horizontal momentum from from the run-up

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.030 
horizontal momentum from from the run-up
is<00:02:24.910> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.540> allow<00:02:26.170> our<00:02:26.380> hips<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.650> travel

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
is going to allow our hips to travel

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.010 
is going to allow our hips to travel
through<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.000> they're<00:02:28.270> directly<00:02:28.750> over<00:02:28.990> our

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
through so they're directly over our

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.570 
through so they're directly over our
feet<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.560> we're<00:02:29.710> standing<00:02:30.040> straight<00:02:30.280> up<00:02:30.310> as

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
feet and we're standing straight up as

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.440 
feet and we're standing straight up as
we<00:02:30.700> go<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.880> takeoff

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
we go to takeoff

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.620 
we go to takeoff
so<00:02:32.170> our<00:02:32.260> hips<00:02:32.410> are<00:02:32.560> back<00:02:33.330> then<00:02:34.330> we're<00:02:34.480> here

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
so our hips are back then we're here

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.960 
so our hips are back then we're here
everything<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.500> straight<00:02:35.770> up<00:02:35.800> chest<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.790> up

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
everything is straight up chest is up

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.940 
everything is straight up chest is up
hips<00:02:37.840> are<00:02:38.140> over<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.560> balls<00:02:38.710> of<00:02:38.860> our<00:02:38.890> feet

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
hips are over the balls of our feet

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.770 
hips are over the balls of our feet
everything<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:39.970> going<00:02:40.210> up<00:02:40.330> from<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.600> last

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
everything is going up from that last

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.140 
everything is going up from that last
