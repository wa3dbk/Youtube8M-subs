00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.880
 well to everybody of the unsj yesterday 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.710
 welcome to the off the map vertigo 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.839
 tell you that this trick is not done with 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.700
 no package we will simply 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.950
 with a missing stone and with the game 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.140
 of teleportation is worth having the 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.830
 teleport departure we will have to 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.080
 go to with tv and here we search in community 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.300
 and then we look in more popular 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.429
 and in here we will find the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.410
 Custom games we have to 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.740
 look for one that is called ftf glitch or 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.570
 teleport or out of green any of these 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.890
 you will have to find and any of 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.450
 those serve because what we will have to 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.820
 search is a game that has to take 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.510
 the flag with six teams then the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.129
 we load and we go to the options of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.109
 change it in the game settings and 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.670
 we give the square we keep where 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.020
 we want and we'll have it saved for 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.640
 you can always also do this 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.559
 trick in xbox you will find in the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.390
 custom games then when 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.269
 already we are with a partner we will have 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.010
 than to be both on the team or with 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.199
 the teleportation departure because yes 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.239
 no yes we are in militia in mercenaries 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.379
 the fbi or in there what will happen is that 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.030
 appear we have out of the map and 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.200
 we will die and if we die during the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.880
 departure 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.990
 falling off the map or killing us 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.030
 partner what will happen is that you 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.590
 will deactivate the trick then when 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.939
 we are in the game we change to 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.159
 mercenary team when we have already 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.750
 appeared and our partner also 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.340
 will have to put the team mercenaries 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.530
 what will not have to appear 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.329
 simply they will stay on the menu nothing 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.710
 more then what we will do now is 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.179
 catch the two flags because as 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.280
 we have the teleportation trick 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.439
 we will have the infinite points then 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.700
 when we already have the hairston missile what 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.469
 what we have to do is that our 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.689
 partner is put in changing equipment and 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.789
 put in there just stays there 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.099
 in there it is worth that what our 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.720
 fellow that is in the 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:46.270
 spectator and then we take off 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.979
 the hairston missile and we place it where 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.110
 is the h is of the cepol in the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.209
 helicopters and when exactly the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.549
 missile explode we tell our 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.470
 partner that is changed to the team there 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.509
 class gets everything is very fast and has 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.860
 to be very fast everything and then it 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.959
 will be there flying or it may be 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.340
 falling on the ground or that is dead 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.959
 if love is because you have done it 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.939
 too soon and it has changed very 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.170
 fast then it's worth to look with him 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.079
 what we will have to do is change 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.790
 we have the team with him and we do not take 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.790
 class we change the team again 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.250
 mercenaries 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.170
 and here I made a mess to tell you 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.400
 that has changed many teams if 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.469
 you want to see it in the video as I have 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.849
 done but tell you that at the end of 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.319
 this video will do the best method to 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.120
 appear without problems because 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.900
 changed several times to tell you that 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.090
 you can also change 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.189
 change to any team but that 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.519
 do not be sdc or be the ones you can not anymore 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.260
 appear with the social team or sdc as 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.519
 you see there I have changed the equipment is etc 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.950
 but has not appeared I changed to 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.269
 another team because if it appears what 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.370
 happens is that if you have me on the map 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.799
 yes or yes if you put in the team seal or 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.090
 sdf so you can get in any 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.420
 of the other four teams that I have not 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.590
 said and when we have appeared normal 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.870
 as you have seen there I have already changed 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.189
 Team again on our partner 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.500
 will have to put on the team that 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.030
 we are we do not take class and insurance 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.889
 put on the computer that was before or 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.379
 be there to supposed mercenaries with 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:06.290
 we have not appeared and now it gets 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.879
 in the team now you will see that this 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.769
 I'm putting in slow motion so that 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.840
 give me time to comment and there you see it 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.280
 put the team there and at the end of the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.989
 video as I'm saying I'll show you 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.939
 how to make it easier because here I 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.220
 made a mess like I'm saying and 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.630
 As you can see we can fall down here without 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.340
 problem we will not die or anything 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.430
 and we can go by the railing there 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.070
 down there is saying that we can go by 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.590
 all this also you can not go for 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.720
 other sides because if you kill me in my 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.790
 case I had fear as it is and thoughtful 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.770
 and with fear because if I die or die 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.930
 another partner we have to restart 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.080
 because I know the teleportation trick 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.570
 will stop working okay then now 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.220
 I'm going to show you another place where 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.780
 can go there 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.910
 we say I'm going to do the same thing another 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.980
 now and then it just destroys the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.080
 missile hairston our partner will 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.940
 will change the equipment there as you have seen 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.190
 there and now it has appeared well in 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.080
 the ground then we now 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.700
 we change the equipment there and now yes 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.500
 we take class to hours when we do 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.360
 well then what will we do like that and we 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.580
 we will change the team of 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.560
 mercenaries and we take class is already not 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.700
 you have to do as much as I did 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.830
 before you have seen that I have 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.180
 changed a lot of times this from 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.680
 our partner will change the team 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.329
 mercenaries and will change the 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.580
 team there usually appear in 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.590
 mercenaries is worth it and then we are already 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.810
 again normal as before and now as 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.300
 you see me shot here and already the trick of 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.380
 transportation stopped working that 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.510
 means that if we do what 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.070
 change our team we will not change 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.620
 nothing of that will happen 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.420
 those of the flags will work 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.740
 but what to transport us where is 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.360
 our partner will no longer work 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.490
 then we will have to restart the 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.490
 I left here and it gave me the same because 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.930
 I was going to finish the video not then 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.419
 tell you that you can go for all these 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.540
 sites by the railings and little else 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.160
 They are pretty inaccessible areas 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.820
 they are the most 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.780
 I could get to see so far so 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.550
 Well, I hope that I have 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.620
 liked the video do not forget to leave your 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.240

 video here the unsj a greeting and even the 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.070
 next
