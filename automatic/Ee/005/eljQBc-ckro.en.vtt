in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.809> price<00:00:46.079> or<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.920> will<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.789> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
in the price or we will not have it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.970 
in the price or we will not have it
correct<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.600> let's<00:00:48.870> do<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> link<00:00:49.469> first

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
correct so let's do the link first

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.830 
correct so let's do the link first
because<00:00:50.700> that's<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.420> we're<00:00:51.570> talking

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
because that's what we're talking

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.479 
because that's what we're talking

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
straining on right now sometimes people

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.619 
straining on right now sometimes people
don't<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:55.250> person<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.430> them<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.480> way

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
don't have a person with them so the way

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.200 
don't have a person with them so the way
we<00:00:57.840> choose<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.620> your<00:00:58.890> by<00:00:59.129> yourself<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.820> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
we choose to do your by yourself is to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.500 
we choose to do your by yourself is to
take<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.719> cloth<00:01:01.469> measure<00:01:02.180> measuring<00:01:03.180> tape

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
take your cloth measure measuring tape

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
take your cloth measure measuring tape
they<00:01:04.260> feel<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.890> little<00:01:05.100> piece<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.430> masking

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
they feel just a little piece of masking

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
they feel just a little piece of masking
tape<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:07.490> make<00:01:08.490> sure<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.799> at

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
tape to make sure that you have it at

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.330 
tape to make sure that you have it at
the<00:01:10.860> top

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.819 

directly

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
directly

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.310 
directly
when<00:01:16.399> I<00:01:16.700> one<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:17.030> our<00:01:17.149> pet<00:01:17.390> peeves<00:01:17.659> is<00:01:17.899> that<00:01:18.200> we

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
when I one of our pet peeves is that we

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.179 
when I one of our pet peeves is that we
don't<00:01:18.530> like<00:01:18.829> short-swing

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
don't like short-swing

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.709 
don't like short-swing
yeah<00:01:22.189> but<00:01:22.520> if<00:01:22.759> we<00:01:22.939> don't<00:01:22.969> get<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.450> right

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
yeah but if we don't get the right

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.980 
yeah but if we don't get the right
measurements<00:01:24.560> then<00:01:25.179> your<00:01:26.179> slings<00:01:26.509> may<00:01:26.719> come

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
measurements then your slings may come

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.669 
measurements then your slings may come
short<00:01:27.969> it<00:01:28.969> if<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:30.350> don't<00:01:30.530> light<00:01:31.130> too<00:01:31.369> hard<00:01:32.679> so

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
short it if you don't light too hard so

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.779 
short it if you don't light too hard so
we<00:01:34.310> do<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:35.110> come<00:01:36.110> down<00:01:36.670> following<00:01:37.670> the

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
we do this come down following the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.069 
we do this come down following the
contour<00:01:38.329> of<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.539> frame<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.700> my<00:01:41.659> suggestion

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
contour of the frame and my suggestion

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.660 
contour of the frame and my suggestion
would<00:01:42.319> be<00:01:42.380> is<00:01:42.619> that<00:01:42.829> you<00:01:42.920> put<00:01:43.159> another<00:01:43.429> one

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
would be is that you put another one

would be is that you put another one
there<00:01:43.939> well<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.569> got<00:01:44.750> an<00:01:44.869> extra<00:01:45.170> set<00:01:45.319> of<00:01:45.380> hands

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619

chairs<00:02:24.799> if<00:02:25.130> they<00:02:25.340> look<00:02:25.880> exactly<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.569> same

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
chairs if they look exactly the same

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.039 
chairs if they look exactly the same
they<00:02:27.560> usually<00:02:27.769> are<00:02:28.190> exactly<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.030> same<00:02:29.090> but<00:02:29.900> it

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
they usually are exactly the same but it

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.280 
they usually are exactly the same but it
never<00:02:30.410> hurts<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.190> measure<00:02:32.230> particularly<00:02:33.230> if

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
never hurts to measure particularly if

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.860 
never hurts to measure particularly if
you<00:02:33.440> have<00:02:33.470> swivel<00:02:34.100> rockers<00:02:34.730> or<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.510> may<00:02:35.660> have

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
you have swivel rockers or you may have

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.160 
you have swivel rockers or you may have
love<00:02:36.139> seats<00:02:36.760> always<00:02:37.760> measure<00:02:38.480> it's<00:02:38.750> always

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
love seats always measure it's always

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.050 
love seats always measure it's always
better<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.500> measure<00:02:39.859> twice<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.639> like<00:02:40.880> they

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
better to measure twice and like they

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.390 
better to measure twice and like they
say<00:02:41.299> cut<00:02:41.600> once

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
say cut once

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.580 
say cut once
because<00:02:43.400> basically<00:02:43.930> once<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.109> give<00:02:45.290> us<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
because basically once you give us the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.670 
because basically once you give us the
measurements<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:46.280> your<00:02:46.849> material<00:02:47.359> choices

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
measurements and your material choices

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.650 
measurements and your material choices
we<00:02:48.680> make<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.340> you're<00:02:49.670> stuck<00:02:50.000> with<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.450> so

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
we make it and you're stuck with it so

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.330 
we make it and you're stuck with it so
let's<00:02:50.900> make<00:02:51.109> sure<00:02:51.139> we<00:02:51.319> get<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.799> measurements

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
let's make sure we get the measurements

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.270 
let's make sure we get the measurements
right<00:02:53.049> now<00:02:54.049> we<00:02:54.109> want<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.590> measure<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.950> width

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
right now we want to measure the width

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.509 
right now we want to measure the width
and<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> width<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.389> the<00:02:56.660> slings<00:02:57.019> is<00:02:57.519> measured

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
and the width of the slings is measured

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.089 
and the width of the slings is measured
best<00:02:58.819> at<00:02:59.180> where<00:02:59.989> they<00:03:00.169> are<00:03:00.200> screwed<00:03:00.680> into<00:03:00.889> the

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
best at where they are screwed into the

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.220 
best at where they are screwed into the
frame<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.840> very<00:03:03.079> top<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:04.220> chair<00:03:05.230> will

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
frame the very top of the chair will

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.860 
frame the very top of the chair will
probably<00:03:06.739> be<00:03:06.889> a<00:03:06.919> little<00:03:07.160> bit<00:03:07.310> wider<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.329> and

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
probably be a little bit wider and and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.289 
probably be a little bit wider and and
really<00:03:09.349> that's<00:03:09.609> that's<00:03:10.609> a<00:03:10.760> natural

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
really that's that's a natural

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.509 
really that's that's a natural
measurement<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:12.049> we<00:03:12.230> really<00:03:12.500> don't<00:03:12.709> need<00:03:12.950> so

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
measurement that we really don't need so

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.909 
measurement that we really don't need so
we<00:03:13.730> do<00:03:13.910> need<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.329> where<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:15.049> is<00:03:15.079> screwed<00:03:15.620> into

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
we do need it where it is screwed into

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.659 
we do need it where it is screwed into
the<00:03:16.190> frame<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.750> hook<00:03:17.989> your<00:03:18.669> it's

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
the frame and and you hook your it's

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.949 
the frame and and you hook your it's
your<00:03:19.819> tape<00:03:20.209> measure<00:03:20.480> right<00:03:20.810> into<00:03:21.769> this<00:03:22.579> slot

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
your tape measure right into this slot

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.390 
your tape measure right into this slot
and<00:03:23.959> then<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.410> come<00:03:24.620> right<00:03:24.650> over<00:03:24.889> to<00:03:25.160> the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
and then you come right over to the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.420 
and then you come right over to the
middle<00:03:25.820> of<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.120> other<00:03:26.239> slot

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
middle of the other slot

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.780 
middle of the other slot
here<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.819> we<00:03:28.209> can<00:03:28.420> see<00:03:28.659> that<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.109> is<00:03:29.790> 20

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
here and we can see that that is 20

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.709 
here and we can see that that is 20
inches<00:03:31.349> so<00:03:32.349> our<00:03:32.680> then<00:03:33.640> we<00:03:33.790> measure<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.359> front

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:34.719 
inches so our then we measure the front

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:40.699 
inches so our then we measure the front
where<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.349> is<00:03:35.500> screwed<00:03:35.799> in<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.510> chair<00:03:39.689> and

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
where it is screwed in to the chair and

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.679 
where it is screwed in to the chair and
it<00:03:41.709> is<00:03:42.129> we're<00:03:42.819> going<00:03:42.939> to<00:03:43.000> hand<00:03:43.239> in<00:03:43.390> way<00:03:43.540> but

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
it is we're going to hand in way but

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:44.190 
it is we're going to hand in way but
there<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:43.930> is

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
there it is

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.330 
there it is
it<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.799> also<00:03:45.340> 20<00:03:45.819> inches<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.709> therefore<00:03:48.040> our

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
it is also 20 inches so therefore our

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.440 
it is also 20 inches so therefore our
our<00:03:49.120> finished<00:03:49.659> width<00:03:50.430> would<00:03:51.430> be<00:03:51.609> 20<00:03:52.180> inches

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
our finished width would be 20 inches

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.110 
our finished width would be 20 inches
now<00:03:53.379> those<00:03:53.620> are<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:53.889> two<00:03:53.950> measurements<00:03:54.819> that

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
now those are the two measurements that

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.520 
now those are the two measurements that
sling<00:03:55.780> masters<00:03:56.290> needs<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:57.730> make<00:03:58.629> you<00:03:59.260> a

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
sling masters needs to make you a

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.159 
sling masters needs to make you a
beautiful<00:04:00.269> sling<00:04:01.269> that's<00:04:01.629> going<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.930> fit

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
beautiful sling that's going to fit

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.250 
beautiful sling that's going to fit
right<00:04:03.329> so<00:04:04.329> we<00:04:04.659> will<00:04:04.810> go<00:04:04.959> through<00:04:05.169> the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
right so we will go through the

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.520 
right so we will go through the
procedure<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:06.099> putting<00:04:06.639> the<00:04:06.819> sling<00:04:07.150> on<00:04:07.530> when

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
procedure of putting the sling on when

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.199 
procedure of putting the sling on when
you<00:04:08.739> get<00:04:08.980> your<00:04:09.189> sling<00:04:10.560> okay<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:12.099> all<00:04:12.519> you<00:04:12.909> need

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
you get your sling okay so all you need

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.289 
you get your sling okay so all you need
is<00:04:13.719> your<00:04:14.500> finish<00:04:14.889> weight<00:04:15.489> when<00:04:16.180> you're

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
is your finish weight when you're

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.360 
is your finish weight when you're
finished<00:04:16.690> with<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.259> then<00:04:17.530> you<00:04:17.650> call<00:04:17.919> us<00:04:18.160> and
