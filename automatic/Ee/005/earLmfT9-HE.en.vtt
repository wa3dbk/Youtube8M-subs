00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
the breast is this numbing will last for

the breast is this numbing will last for
12<00:01:03.470> hours<00:01:03.620> after<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.250> surgery<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:05.420> we've

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
12 hours after the surgery so we've

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.780 
12 hours after the surgery so we've
found<00:01:05.870> so<00:01:06.260> far<00:01:06.290> that<00:01:06.920> patients<00:01:07.520> have<00:01:07.760> had

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
found so far that patients have had

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.700 
found so far that patients have had
decreased<00:01:08.450> post-operative<00:01:09.140> pain<00:01:09.409> and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
decreased post-operative pain and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.670 
decreased post-operative pain and
they've<00:01:10.340> also<00:01:10.550> had<00:01:11.060> improved<00:01:11.720> hospital<00:01:12.440> stays

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
they've also had improved hospital stays

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.960 
they've also had improved hospital stays
meaning<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.400> their<00:01:13.580> stay<00:01:13.790> will<00:01:13.940> be

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
meaning that their stay will be

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.850 
meaning that their stay will be
shortened<00:01:14.390> significantly<00:01:14.540> if<00:01:15.290> they<00:01:15.680> have

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
shortened significantly if they have

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.500 
shortened significantly if they have
this<00:01:16.010> anesthetic<00:01:16.610> used<00:01:16.640> prior<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.420> the

this anesthetic used prior to the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.469 
this anesthetic used prior to the
mastectomy<00:01:17.840> I<00:01:18.290> also<00:01:18.950> perform<00:01:19.549> nipple<00:01:20.270> and

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
mastectomy I also perform nipple and

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.960 
mastectomy I also perform nipple and
areola<00:01:20.659> sparing<00:01:21.409> mastectomies<00:01:21.670> which<00:01:22.670> means

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
areola sparing mastectomies which means

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.550 
areola sparing mastectomies which means
at<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.299> time<00:01:23.510> of<00:01:23.720> mastectomy

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
at the time of mastectomy

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.469 
at the time of mastectomy
after<00:01:24.950> removing<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.520> breast<00:01:25.790> tissue<00:01:26.090> and

preserved all of this surgery is done

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.510 
preserved all of this surgery is done
through<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.750> scar<00:01:36.170> that's<00:01:36.650> below<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.340> breast

so<00:01:38.299> after<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.750> surgery<00:01:39.080> is<00:01:39.140> completed<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
so after the surgery is completed the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.730 
so after the surgery is completed the
scar<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.400> basically<00:01:41.000> hidden<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:42.260> patients

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
scar is basically hidden the patients

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.219 
scar is basically hidden the patients
look<00:01:42.950> excellent<00:01:43.460> cosmetically<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:44.479> some<00:01:45.110> of

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
look excellent cosmetically and some of

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.390 
look excellent cosmetically and some of
them<00:01:45.320> can't<00:01:45.560> even<00:01:45.770> tell<00:01:45.950> that<00:01:46.070> they've<00:01:46.220> had<00:01:46.340> a

them can't even tell that they've had a

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.700 
them can't even tell that they've had a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
mastectomy so here at Cornell we have
