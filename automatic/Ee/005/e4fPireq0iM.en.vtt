00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
across the pitch the way it was but all

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770

four of them played and we as a team
played<00:00:43.050> football<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> floor<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.930> not

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
played football on the floor and not

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.240 
played football on the floor and not
just<00:00:46.170> playing<00:00:46.440> football<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> floor<00:00:47.129> but

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
just playing football on the floor but

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
just playing football on the floor but
we<00:00:47.370> also<00:00:47.520> moved<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.660> through<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> Third's<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
we also moved it through the Third's a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.770 
we also moved it through the Third's a
lot<00:00:49.500> quicker<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.399> think<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.750> was<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
lot quicker and I think that was the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.040 
lot quicker and I think that was the
basis<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.680> why<00:00:53.160> today<00:00:53.789> was<00:00:54.180> what<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.719> and

basis of why today was what it was and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.319 
basis of why today was what it was and
it<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.590> hands-down<00:00:56.219> best<00:00:56.789> performers

was him to love played yeah you can tell

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.530 
was him to love played yeah you can tell
you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.380> tell<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.950> got<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.369> always<00:01:42.240> start

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
you can tell and you got I always start

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.899 
you can tell and you got I always start
and<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.049> still<00:01:43.259> believe<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.770> blend<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.759> play

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and I still believe that blend can play

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.399 
and I still believe that blend can play
alongside<00:01:45.180> Carrick<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.930> too<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
alongside Carrick in that too and I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.719 
alongside Carrick in that too and I
think<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.829> improve<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.310> what<00:01:47.340> we've<00:01:47.579> done

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
think we can improve on what we've done

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.550 
think we can improve on what we've done
there<00:01:47.939> because<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.720> still<00:01:48.930> wasn't<00:01:49.049> perfect

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
there because it still wasn't perfect

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.780 
there because it still wasn't perfect
they<00:01:49.950> were<00:01:50.040> still<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> couple<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.549> occasions

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
they were still a couple of occasions

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.460 
they were still a couple of occasions
where<00:01:51.180> there<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.390> hopeful<00:01:51.720> balls<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
where there was hopeful balls but as the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.230 
where there was hopeful balls but as the
game<00:01:52.500> went<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.159> looked<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.579> relaxed

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.870 
game went on it looked like we relaxed
more<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.560> looked<00:01:55.799> freer<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.759> look

more and we looked freer and we look
more<00:01:57.060> comfortable<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.810> looked<00:01:57.990> happier

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
more comfortable and we looked happier

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.160

week that's the big test going to and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.520 
week that's the big test going to and
feel<00:02:10.050> uh-uhh<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.830> hate<00:02:11.700> say<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.319> I'm<00:02:13.319> not

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
feel uh-uhh I hate say but I'm not

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.110 
feel uh-uhh I hate say but I'm not
confident

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
confident

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.089 
confident
I'm<00:02:14.690> not<00:02:15.049> that<00:02:15.230> confident<00:02:15.530> going<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.769> unfilled

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
I'm not that confident going to unfilled

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.649 
I'm not that confident going to unfilled
but<00:02:16.280> i<00:02:16.310> think<00:02:16.519> if<00:02:16.640> we<00:02:16.670> play<00:02:16.940> like<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.299> then

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
but i think if we play like that then

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.880 
but i think if we play like that then
three<00:02:17.870> points<00:02:18.140> are<00:02:18.200> asked<00:02:18.409> for<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.560> taking

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
three points are asked for the taking

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.339 
three points are asked for the taking
that<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.129> could<00:02:19.280> play<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.549> same<00:02:19.760> 11<00:02:20.150> I

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
wouldn't but I think he might I think he

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.670 
wouldn't but I think he might I think he
might<00:02:26.599> I<00:02:26.659> think<00:02:26.810> he<00:02:27.019> really<00:02:27.260> likes<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680

I won't go with that I would go with the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.069 
I won't go with that I would go with the
team<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:36.980> I've<00:02:37.099> picked<00:02:37.370> midweek<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:38.900> he<00:02:38.989> not

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
team that I've picked midweek but he not

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.149 
team that I've picked midweek but he not
going<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.260> play<00:02:39.319> matter<00:02:39.560> away<00:02:39.739> from<00:02:39.890> home<00:02:40.010> or

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
going to play matter away from home or

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.250 
going to play matter away from home or
and<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.280> thought<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.540> know<00:02:41.659> it<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.079> what<00:02:42.200> it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
and I thought so you know it is what it

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.710 
and I thought so you know it is what it
is<00:02:42.349> great<00:02:42.980> performance<00:02:43.220> Herrera<00:02:44.090> magic

is great performance Herrera magic
carrick<00:02:45.260> magic<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.160> think<00:02:46.489> he<00:02:46.579> might<00:02:46.700> made<00:02:46.910> a

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
carrick magic I think he might made a

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.819 
carrick magic I think he might made a
massive<00:02:47.150> big<00:02:47.420> difference<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:48.079> goal<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.769> an

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
massive big difference a goal and an
