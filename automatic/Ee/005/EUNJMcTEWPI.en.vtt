kind of stuck here vacuum not able to
land<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.640> powershot<00:00:51.030> will<00:00:51.180> now<00:00:51.300> open<00:00:51.829> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
land but the powershot will now open the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.560 
land but the powershot will now open the
way<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.039> evil<00:00:53.520> geniuses<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.090> claim<00:00:54.360> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
way for evil geniuses to claim that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.810 
way for evil geniuses to claim that
won't<00:00:54.780> cast<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.440> his<00:00:55.559> abilities<00:00:55.980> he's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
won't cast all of his abilities he's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
won't cast all of his abilities he's
keeping<00:00:57.210> down<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:57.690> now<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.989> he<00:00:58.649> already

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
keeping down right now and he already

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.220 
keeping down right now and he already
only<00:00:59.340> has<00:00:59.520> enough<00:00:59.760> mana<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> supernova

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
only has enough mana for the supernova

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.650 
only has enough mana for the supernova
so<00:01:01.920> by<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.300> goes<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.629> think

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
so by going for this and it goes I think

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
so by going for this and it goes I think
you<00:01:03.899> want<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.199> into<00:01:04.320> fights<00:01:04.559> nice<00:01:05.100> pick<00:01:05.369> up
