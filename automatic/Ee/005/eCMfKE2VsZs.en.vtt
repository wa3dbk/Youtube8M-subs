00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.830 

okay<00:00:01.040> Here<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.100> am<00:00:02.190> today<00:00:02.460> trying<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.149> diagnose

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
okay Here I am today trying to diagnose

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.690 
okay Here I am today trying to diagnose
the<00:00:04.170> problem<00:00:04.740> with<00:00:04.890> my<00:00:05.100> throttle<00:00:05.580> position

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
the problem with my throttle position

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.799 
the problem with my throttle position
sensor<00:00:06.440> least<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.589> think<00:00:07.649> that's<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.099> problem

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
sensor least I think that's a problem

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.089 
sensor least I think that's a problem
the<00:00:09.809> last<00:00:10.050> one<00:00:10.380> which<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.010> just<00:00:11.040> pulled<00:00:11.519> off

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
the last one which I just pulled off

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.189 
the last one which I just pulled off
you'll<00:00:14.099> notice<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.639> previous<00:00:15.059> owner<00:00:15.269> put<00:00:16.049> on

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
you'll notice a previous owner put on

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.810 
you'll notice a previous owner put on
obviously<00:00:16.800> because<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.520> wrong

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
obviously because this is the wrong

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.070 
obviously because this is the wrong
style<00:00:18.390> for<00:00:18.840> an<00:00:18.960> 85<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.039> none<00:00:20.250> adjustable

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
style for an 85 that's a none adjustable

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.019 
style for an 85 that's a none adjustable
so<00:00:22.080> I've<00:00:22.529> bought<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> new<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.160> from<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.789> guy<00:00:23.820> on

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
so I've bought a new one from a guy on

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.810 
so I've bought a new one from a guy on
TG<00:00:24.840> Oh<00:00:24.869> at<00:00:25.740> least<00:00:25.890> he<00:00:26.160> said<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.670> was

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
TG Oh at least he said it was

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.560 
TG Oh at least he said it was
practically<00:00:27.510> new<00:00:28.189> got<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.369> didn't<00:00:30.269> look<00:00:30.330> beat

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
practically new got it didn't look beat

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.410 
practically new got it didn't look beat
up<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.140> looked<00:00:31.320> pretty<00:00:32.070> dirty<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> new

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
up I just looked pretty dirty for a new

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.190 
up I just looked pretty dirty for a new
throttle<00:00:33.660> position<00:00:33.899> sensor<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.899> hoping<00:00:36.899> he

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
throttle position sensor so hoping he

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560 
throttle position sensor so hoping he
didn't<00:00:37.590> sell<00:00:38.250> me<00:00:38.340> an<00:00:38.460> old<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.910> saying<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.450> was

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
didn't sell me an old one saying it was

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.380 
didn't sell me an old one saying it was
new<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.079> long<00:00:40.739> story<00:00:40.770> short<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.489> last<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:42.149> I

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
new but long story short the last one I

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.720 
new but long story short the last one I
noticed<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> cold<00:00:44.070> start<00:00:44.930> would<00:00:46.309> cause<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
noticed on a cold start would cause the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.389 
noticed on a cold start would cause the
engine<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> bog<00:00:48.960> down<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.559> idle<00:00:49.920> speed<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
engine to bog down to idle speed and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.670 
engine to bog down to idle speed and
almost<00:00:50.730> stall<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.629> held<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> gas<00:00:52.289> pedal<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
almost stall if you held the gas pedal a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.049 
almost stall if you held the gas pedal a
quarter<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> way<00:00:53.219> down<00:00:53.489> until<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.940> was

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
quarter of the way down until it was

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.910 
quarter of the way down until it was
warmed<00:00:54.390> up

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
warmed up

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
warmed up
if<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.399> mashed<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.879> down<00:00:57.030> halfway<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:57.780> of

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
if you mashed it down halfway or more of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.000 
if you mashed it down halfway or more of
course<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> engine<00:00:58.410> would<00:00:58.530> jump<00:00:58.770> right<00:00:58.949> up

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
course the engine would jump right up

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.139 
course the engine would jump right up
and<00:00:59.250> wake<00:00:59.460> up<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.829> read<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> voltages<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.969> it

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and wake up so I read the voltages on it

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.630 
and wake up so I read the voltages on it
gave<00:01:03.840> me<00:01:03.960> some<00:01:04.199> pretty<00:01:04.619> funky<00:01:04.979> readings<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
gave me some pretty funky readings I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.780 
gave me some pretty funky readings I
couldn't<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.140> point<00:01:07.500> five<00:01:07.860> four<00:01:08.250> like

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
couldn't get it to point five four like

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.640 
couldn't get it to point five four like
people<00:01:09.150> say<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.420> could<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.080> point<00:01:10.320> four

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
people say I could get it to point four

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.560 
people say I could get it to point four
eight<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.820> even<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> slightest

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
eight and then even the slightest

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.969 
eight and then even the slightest
adjustment<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:13.590> caused<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
adjustment from that what caused it to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.749 
adjustment from that what caused it to
jump<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.369> point<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.850> know<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:16.759> opening

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
jump to point and I know and opening

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.350 
jump to point and I know and opening
this<00:01:17.880> throttle<00:01:18.210> slowly<00:01:18.750> resulted<00:01:19.710> in

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
this throttle slowly resulted in

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.550 
this throttle slowly resulted in
up-and-down<00:01:21.360> readings<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.049> about<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> do

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
up-and-down readings and I'm about to do

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.960 
up-and-down readings and I'm about to do
it<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.920> new<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.369> which<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.640> doing<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
it with this new one which is doing the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.190 
it with this new one which is doing the
same<00:01:24.150> thing<00:01:25.729> at<00:01:26.729> no<00:01:27.180> point<00:01:27.450> during<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> test

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
same thing at no point during the test

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.350 
same thing at no point during the test
do<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.439> close<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> throttle<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.670> only<00:01:29.820> steadily

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
do I close the throttle I only steadily

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.149 
do I close the throttle I only steadily
open<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.079> you'll<00:01:31.259> notice<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.650> voltages

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
open and you'll notice the voltages

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.770 
open and you'll notice the voltages
actually<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.790> down<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.450> some<00:01:33.720> points<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
actually go down at some points so I

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.859 
actually go down at some points so I
don't<00:01:36.780> know<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.850> that<00:01:38.850> thing<00:01:38.880> right<00:01:39.390> there<00:01:39.689> was

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
don't know if that thing right there was

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
don't know if that thing right there was
bad<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:40.979> guy<00:01:41.280> sent<00:01:41.640> me

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
bad and then this one this guy sent me

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.160 
bad and then this one this guy sent me
was<00:01:42.000> bad<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> problem<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
was bad if it's a problem with the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.069 
was bad if it's a problem with the
computer<00:01:43.320> or<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> wiring<00:01:44.340> somewhere<00:01:44.899> have<00:01:45.899> no

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
computer or the wiring somewhere have no

00:01:46.079 --> 00:02:30.610 
computer or the wiring somewhere have no
 clue<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.250> go

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:41.440 

there<00:02:31.430> we<00:02:31.519> go<00:02:31.700> back<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.120> point<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.540> know<00:02:40.450> slowly

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
there we go back the point I know slowly

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:50.059 
there we go back the point I know slowly
opening<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.200> throttle

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.110 

you<00:02:50.610> just<00:02:50.819> jumping<00:02:51.269> up<00:02:51.360> just<00:02:51.659> went<00:02:51.840> down<00:02:52.140> just

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
you just jumping up just went down just

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.759 
you just jumping up just went down just
went<00:02:54.120> down<00:02:54.299> again<00:02:54.659> starting<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.680> go<00:02:55.769> back<00:02:55.980> up

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.110 

just<00:03:01.769> went<00:03:02.040> way<00:03:02.189> up<00:03:02.219> back<00:03:02.790> down<00:03:03.349> down<00:03:04.349> up<00:03:05.120> going

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
just went way up back down down up going

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.099 
just went way up back down down up going
up<00:03:06.329> just<00:03:08.209> jumped<00:03:09.209> way<00:03:09.390> up<00:03:09.569> back<00:03:09.750> down<00:03:09.810> back

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
up just jumped way up back down back

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:16.970 
up just jumped way up back down back
down<00:03:10.980> going<00:03:11.579> back<00:03:11.790> up<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:15.269> that's<00:03:16.079> wide<00:03:16.620> open

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
down going back up and that's wide open

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.929 
down going back up and that's wide open
throttle<00:03:17.450> slowly<00:03:18.450> going<00:03:18.720> back<00:03:18.930> down<00:03:22.939> that's

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:23.939 
throttle slowly going back down that's

00:03:23.939 --> 00:04:00.119 
throttle slowly going back down that's
why<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.209> back<00:03:24.450> up<00:03:24.689> god<00:03:24.959> damn

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:07.869 

so<00:04:01.129> as<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.700> can<00:04:01.939> see<00:04:03.310> around<00:04:04.659> every<00:04:05.659> I<00:04:06.879> don't

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
so as you can see around every I don't

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.530 
so as you can see around every I don't
know<00:04:07.969> hundredth<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.599> volt<00:04:09.579> when<00:04:10.579> it<00:04:10.790> gets<00:04:11.150> to

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
know hundredth of a volt when it gets to

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:20.050 
know hundredth of a volt when it gets to
I<00:04:13.599> guess<00:04:14.599> you<00:04:14.629> could<00:04:14.930> say<00:04:15.230> X<00:04:17.079> 40<00:04:18.079> something<00:04:19.060> it

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
I guess you could say X 40 something it

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.439 
I guess you could say X 40 something it
will<00:04:20.239> immediately<00:04:20.509> jump<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.410> X<00:04:22.130> 90<00:04:22.970> something

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
will immediately jump to X 90 something

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.860 
will immediately jump to X 90 something
then<00:04:23.900> go<00:04:24.020> back<00:04:24.199> down<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.560> X<00:04:24.740> 80<00:04:25.099> then<00:04:25.430> X<00:04:25.639> 70<00:04:26.180> then

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
then go back down to X 80 then X 70 then

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.920 
then go back down to X 80 then X 70 then
start<00:04:27.259> climbing<00:04:27.440> back<00:04:27.800> up<00:04:27.830> like<00:04:28.160> normal<00:04:28.930> it

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
start climbing back up like normal it

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.629 
start climbing back up like normal it
does<00:04:30.229> this<00:04:30.380> on<00:04:30.560> every<00:04:30.800> hundred<00:04:31.130> thousands<00:04:31.520> of

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
does this on every hundred thousands of

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.610 
does this on every hundred thousands of
a<00:04:31.699> volt<00:04:31.940> as<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.419> saw<00:04:32.660> I'm<00:04:32.900> not<00:04:33.110> sure<00:04:33.349> whether

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
a volt as you saw I'm not sure whether

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.320 
a volt as you saw I'm not sure whether
this<00:04:33.860> is<00:04:34.099> normal<00:04:34.550> or<00:04:34.729> whether<00:04:34.970> it's<00:04:35.150> something

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
this is normal or whether it's something

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.710 
this is normal or whether it's something
that's<00:04:35.930> up<00:04:37.030> not<00:04:38.030> too<00:04:38.240> familiar<00:04:38.389> with

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
that's up not too familiar with

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.270 
that's up not too familiar with
the<00:04:38.810> throttle<00:04:39.020> position<00:04:39.229> sensor<00:04:39.889> and<00:04:40.039> how<00:04:40.130> it

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
the throttle position sensor and how it

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.099 
the throttle position sensor and how it
works<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:43.330> any<00:04:44.330> input<00:04:44.570> greatly<00:04:45.470> appreciated
