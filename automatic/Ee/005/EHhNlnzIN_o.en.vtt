00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
using it for so long I not a big fan of

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.499 
using it for so long I not a big fan of
it<00:01:48.320> but<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:48.530> don't<00:01:48.770> hate<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.130> but<00:01:49.850> it's<00:01:50.210> nothing

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
great either I would say the the UI it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.709 
great either I would say the the UI it
hasn't<00:01:55.340> been<00:01:55.429> decided<00:01:55.579> hasn't<00:01:56.299> been<00:01:56.420> designed

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
hasn't been decided hasn't been designed

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.199

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
pretty bright I know it might be

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.170

there<00:02:23.269> weren't<00:02:23.450> any<00:02:23.630> call<00:02:23.870> drawbacks<00:02:26.110> the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
there weren't any call drawbacks the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.530 
there weren't any call drawbacks the
loudspeaker<00:02:27.739> isn't<00:02:28.099> that<00:02:28.310> loud<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.329> pretty

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
loudspeaker isn't that loud it's pretty

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.130 
loudspeaker isn't that loud it's pretty
okay<00:02:30.579> the<00:02:31.579> problem<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:31.970> when<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.299> when<00:02:32.810> when

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
okay the problem is when you when when

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.509 
okay the problem is when you when when
someone<00:02:33.380> calls<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.799> and<00:02:33.950> if<00:02:34.099> you<00:02:34.220> have<00:02:34.400> your

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
someone calls you and if you have your

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.520 
someone calls you and if you have your
East<00:02:34.730> 72<00:02:35.239> on<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:36.620> surface<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:38.500> kind<00:02:39.500> of

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
East 72 on that surface I kind of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.930 
East 72 on that surface I kind of
muscles<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.160> sound<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:40.579> might<00:02:40.790> not

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
muscles of the sound so you might not

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.190 
muscles of the sound so you might not
hear<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.269> very<00:02:42.110> well

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.860 

vibration<00:02:46.160> isn't<00:02:46.519> very<00:02:46.760> strong<00:02:47.450> on<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:47.720> so

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
vibration isn't very strong on this so

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.440 
vibration isn't very strong on this so
it's<00:02:48.109> a<00:02:48.170> little<00:02:48.590> bit<00:02:48.769> weak<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.280> would<00:02:49.519> say<00:02:49.670> if

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
it's a little bit weak I would say if

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.090 
it's a little bit weak I would say if
you<00:02:50.600> have<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:50.989> silent<00:02:51.290> mode<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.650> only<00:02:51.889> have

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
you have it on silent mode I only have

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.039 
you have it on silent mode I only have
the<00:02:52.220> vibrate<00:02:52.579> on<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:54.709> might<00:02:54.920> not<00:02:55.100> feel<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:56.049> the

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
the vibrate on you might not feel it the

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.680 
the vibrate on you might not feel it the

tiny bit of Creek it's a little bit

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.570 
tiny bit of Creek it's a little bit
loose<00:03:41.940> too

loose too

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.670

just<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.670> tiny<00:03:44.880> bit<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:46.080> enough<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.350> annoy

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
just a tiny bit but just enough to annoy

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.890 
just a tiny bit but just enough to annoy
me<00:03:46.710> slightly<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.900> also<00:03:49.050> uses<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.470> same<00:03:50.900> hatch

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
me slightly it also uses the same hatch

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.430 
me slightly it also uses the same hatch
as<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.500> e75<00:03:53.300> which<00:03:54.300> means<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.660> might<00:03:54.930> come<00:03:55.170> to

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
as the e75 which means it might come to

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.600 
as the e75 which means it might come to
suffer<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.040> couple<00:03:56.570> months<00:03:57.570> of<00:03:57.720> use<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.050> guess

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
suffer a couple months of use I guess

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.590 
suffer a couple months of use I guess
but<00:03:59.610> nothing<00:03:59.880> too<00:04:00.060> bad<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:02.370> UI<00:04:02.550> is<00:04:02.760> really

but nothing too bad the the UI is really

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.770 
but nothing too bad the the UI is really
really<00:04:03.840> fast<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:05.070> 600<00:04:05.640> megahertz<00:04:05.880> processor
