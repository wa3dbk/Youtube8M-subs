 First impressions about Minsk, I will surprise you 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.160
 Adil surprised by prices shops 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.210
 but I took pictures of the store today 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.890
 rubles of assessment 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.170
 thousands there millions cool what are you waiting for 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.000
 from today's party which 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.270
 anticipation you have hope that 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.180
 First of all 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:51.199
 that I will not fail in the second Cossack 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:55.079
 I hope the public that it will be clear 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.350
 tell me here you have crazy xiang 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.789
 xiang you crazy sound there 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.379
 tracks what distinguishes itself from others 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.510
 against producers that's where you scoop 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.080
 his inspiration, you do it all very 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:14.130
 from afar I’m doing music already 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.880
 15 first good 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.250
 musicality 8 from the eighth year there 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.970
 very far away 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.909
 it comes with experience the tin falls out 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.619
 and the most interesting is that someone says 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.530
 what you need there to write so long 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.810
 work there is something you need to do yourself 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 just not exactly long over the track 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.399
 you have to work on yourself for a long time 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.280
 probably all the same to get some 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.549
 the result must pass the time and then 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.780
 there is no way to fly pies and scans from 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.689
 conveyor spikes 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 and you often do work on the bottom 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.520
 tracks sit there at home sit there but 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.640
 often 4 last time not really 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.670
 it did not work out quite often before 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.590
 there is a track there week literally fit 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.950
 new i mean i open the show by 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.700
 its only because hundreds of dolls some 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.910
 100 projects written as if from them 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.900
 there half will be released that is a 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:23.220
 very much his music that man 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.540
 have not heard everything yes yes yes interesting well 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.090
 but of course maybe not so there 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.970
 interesting it is not for everyone but teaches 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.450
 very dohrena became often favored 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.060
 somewhere 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.160
 go on tour somewhere you go 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.890
 the last time of the battle is once a month 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:43.140
 it turns out touring here to last 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.239
 Moscow then had to sculpt the floor now 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.190
 Minsk next month posts will be in general 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.590
 then we all collect quite often want 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.640
 before that there was a gap decent husband 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.660
 half a year no plan there somehow 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.590
 incomprehensibly somehow getting closer and for some reason 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.360
 Kazimierz or some movement 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.220

 then be described there a year ago 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:20.510
 accounting when there are things here brings 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:33.500
 addressing future music plans well 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:35.570
 of course but I have plans I honestly 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.130

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.850
