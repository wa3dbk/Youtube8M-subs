00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
alright guys so opening look here

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.000 
alright guys so opening look here
everything<00:00:47.590> is<00:00:47.710> on<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.100> low<00:00:48.340> E<00:00:48.700> string<00:00:50.010> for

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
everything is on the low E string for

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.780 
everything is on the low E string for
where<00:00:51.130> your<00:00:51.280> power<00:00:51.550> cord<00:00:51.879> is<00:00:51.970> anchored<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:53.790> it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
where your power cord is anchored and it

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.190 
where your power cord is anchored and it
gets<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:55.030> little<00:00:55.150> awkward<00:00:55.390> going<00:00:55.870> up<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.079> the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
gets a little awkward going up to the

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.700 
gets a little awkward going up to the
13th<00:00:56.620> fret<00:00:56.890> I<00:00:57.900> think<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:58.989> reason<00:00:59.260> why<00:00:59.350> that<00:00:59.530> is

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
13th fret I think the reason why that is

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.820 
13th fret I think the reason why that is
is<00:00:59.890> because<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.430> sliding<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:01.390> I'll<00:01:01.809> try<00:01:02.769> to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
is because of the sliding so I'll try to

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.160 
is because of the sliding so I'll try to
make<00:01:03.100> this<00:01:03.309> sound<00:01:04.089> legible<00:01:04.660> while<00:01:05.019> it's

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
make this sound legible while it's

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:21.090 
make this sound legible while it's
slowed<00:01:05.410> down<00:01:05.650> so<00:01:06.610> we<00:01:06.729> go<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.350> notice<00:01:20.800> I<00:01:20.950> was

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
slowed down so we go so notice I was

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.820 
slowed down so we go so notice I was
sliding<00:01:21.520> in<00:01:21.610> all<00:01:21.759> those<00:01:21.940> positions<00:01:22.649> I'm<00:01:23.649> going

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
sliding in all those positions I'm going

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.639 
sliding in all those positions I'm going
to<00:01:23.890> show<00:01:24.039> the<00:01:24.190> tabs<00:01:24.460> for<00:01:24.789> this<00:01:25.060> version<00:01:25.810> but<00:01:26.410> um

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
slide right down to the D for the just

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.120 
slide right down to the D for the just
repeat<00:06:30.280> it<00:06:30.310> and<00:06:31.440> so<00:06:32.440> you<00:06:32.500> do<00:06:32.710> that<00:06:32.740> pattern

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130

three<00:06:33.490> times<00:06:33.760> and<00:06:34.120> then<00:06:34.360> the<00:06:34.480> last<00:06:34.660> one<00:06:34.930> is

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
three times and then the last one is

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:42.610 
three times and then the last one is
just<00:06:35.080> a<00:06:35.320> little<00:06:35.590> different

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.720 

and<00:06:43.060> that<00:06:44.060> part<00:06:44.330> should<00:06:44.390> seem<00:06:44.990> familiar<00:06:45.670> go<00:06:46.670> to

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
and that part should seem familiar go to

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.880 
and that part should seem familiar go to
those<00:06:47.000> four<00:06:47.270> spots<00:06:47.420> and<00:06:47.960> then<00:06:48.230> go<00:06:48.470> to<00:06:48.530> the<00:06:48.680> F

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890
