sedgwick<00:00:16.190> level<00:00:17.190> artifact<00:00:17.850> number<00:00:18.090> 25

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
sedgwick level artifact number 25

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.500 
sedgwick level artifact number 25
continuing<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.400> part<00:00:20.640> 4<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.060> thought

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
continuing on for part 4 I thought

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.000 
continuing on for part 4 I thought
number<00:00:21.720> 25<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.320> right<00:00:22.470> when<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.650> start<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
number 25 is right when you start the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.150 
number 25 is right when you start the
level<00:00:23.189> through<00:00:23.939> these<00:00:24.090> doors<00:00:24.300> take<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.500> left

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
level through these doors take a left

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.960 
level through these doors take a left
and<00:00:26.699> then<00:00:27.269> take<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.560> closest<00:00:29.130> right<00:00:29.490> well

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
and then take the closest right well

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.519 
and then take the closest right well
only<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.750> take<00:00:30.929> you'll<00:00:31.410> see

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
only right you can take you'll see

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.510 
only right you can take you'll see
floating<00:00:31.769> genes<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.610> slime<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:35.370> have

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
floating genes this slime here you have

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.819 
floating genes this slime here you have
to<00:00:35.700> spray<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.870> obviously<00:00:37.050> cannot

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
to spray because you obviously cannot

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.220 
to spray because you obviously cannot
get<00:00:38.160> closer<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> genes<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:40.110> they're

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
get closer to the genes what they're

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.160 
get closer to the genes what they're
getting<00:00:40.530> hurt<00:00:40.829> I'll<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:42.000> scan<00:00:42.360> them<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
getting hurt I'll then scan them and you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.290 
getting hurt I'll then scan them and you
have<00:00:43.379> artifact<00:00:43.920> number<00:00:44.100> 25<00:00:44.550> that's<00:00:44.760> good

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
have artifact number 25 that's good

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.930 
have artifact number 25 that's good
start<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.870> level<00:00:46.309> artifact<00:00:47.309> number<00:00:47.489> 26

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
start for this level artifact number 26

00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:01.340 
start for this level artifact number 26
when<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.600> hear<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.960> part

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.930 

start<00:01:02.350> running<00:01:02.560> over<00:01:02.980> toward<00:01:03.310> the<00:01:03.489> double

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
start running over toward the double

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.850 
start running over toward the double
doors<00:01:04.150> that<00:01:04.390> open<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:05.670> wait<00:01:06.670> again<00:01:06.970> I<00:01:07.860> think

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
doors that open and wait again I think

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.590 
doors that open and wait again I think
we're<00:01:09.040> dealing<00:01:09.370> with<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.520> level<00:01:09.760> 5<00:01:10.090> anchored

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
better jobs in this but I forgot where

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.710 
better jobs in this but I forgot where
it<00:02:44.390> was<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:46.099> was<00:02:46.129> searching<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.879> for<00:02:47.450> quite

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
it was and I was searching for for quite

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.979 
it was and I was searching for for quite
a<00:02:47.780> bit<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:52.130> it's<00:02:52.519> pretty<00:02:52.880> much<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.120> right<00:02:53.450> across

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
a bit so it's pretty much a right across

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.559 
a bit so it's pretty much a right across
from<00:02:54.260> where<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.500> was<00:02:54.790> right<00:02:55.790> behind<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.239> wall

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
from where I was right behind that wall

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.729 
from where I was right behind that wall
that<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.810> was<00:02:56.930> what<00:02:57.050> were<00:02:57.140> their<00:02:57.349> only<00:02:57.470> name

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
that I was what were their only name

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.740 
that I was what were their only name
then<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.489> finally<00:02:58.910> figured<00:02:59.090> out<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.420> that's

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
then I finally figured out that that's

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.570 
then I finally figured out that that's
where<00:03:00.230> that's<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.920> rumor<00:03:01.069> you're<00:03:01.340> supposed
