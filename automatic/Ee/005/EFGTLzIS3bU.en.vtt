basically a freakin interactive novel so

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.789 
basically a freakin interactive novel so
you<00:02:08.459> read<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.209> then<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:10.049> read<00:02:10.289> some<00:02:10.560> more

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
you read and then you read some more

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.940 
you read and then you read some more
then<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.850> get<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.180> investigate<00:02:13.079> you<00:02:13.590> do<00:02:13.769> that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
then you get to investigate you do that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
then you get to investigate you do that
by<00:02:14.130> looking<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> crime<00:02:14.940> scene<00:02:15.299> and
