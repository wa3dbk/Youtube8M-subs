00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 first revolution the ferrari for the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.790
 passion 2015 and music has been changed 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.219
 also a respect for the new rules that 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 wants much lower uses but also 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.279
 get excited we see the use of ff dct 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.539
 a surgeon than that 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.830
 pollution and body of the car 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.230
 of last year 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.600
 here they are compared mixed then low 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.849
 cost the old one to the right but the changes 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.740
 with the themes all over the car at 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.040
 chassis is no longer unleashed in a manner 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.110
 abrupt but much sweeter 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.840
 syndicated the girls down a little 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.489
 last year the sides are 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.649
 completely new 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.110
 starting from the front with the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.149
 lower inlet mouth but then the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.610
 changes affect a little the whole 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.010
 central card of the car we see it 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.500
 the lower side in the front area 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.399
 the first power station is different at the sprint 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.129
 of the engine bonnet also the vent 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.410
 air for use was 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.680
 moved slightly higher on the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.689
 2015 car also new in the wing 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.280
 back one starting from the support e 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.600
 from the so-called multi chip which is 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.100
 become we see it very simple 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.060
 also in the comparison to say that you see 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.680
 as this section has been modified 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.560
 completely new in the bulkheads 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.720
 lateral these vertical fringes have 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.840
 also a trend the montale 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.790
 completely new and unpublished but this one 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.729
 of the brakes has become a device 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.680
 aerodynamic in the comparison from above yes 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.049
 sees very well that the new car more 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.079
 below it is longer than five 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.880
 centimeters compared to the 2014 car 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.579
 but the big news in the suspension 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.829
 front with very narrow triangle 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.370
 which becomes a true wing profile has 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.580
 kept the style a note 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.180
 the uprights of the cameras in which data 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.800
 have been affected by the federation and a 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.860
 June the car what or with these 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.990
 completely new vertical supports 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.150
 also the entire front wing to start 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.560
 from the side bulkheads they have 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.270
 received these pings and then ended up at 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.370
 raised clubs that are completely 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.530
 new this the net the new solution 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.270
 with the vertical pen we see 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.100
 still in carbon 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.380
 here we see the difference from the side 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.180
 left where you also see that the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.500
 main profile has been changed 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.500
 with slots
