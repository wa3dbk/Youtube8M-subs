00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
back of it it makes a little bit more

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.809 
back of it it makes a little bit more
rigid<00:06:30.810> makes<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:31.800> when<00:06:32.009> you<00:06:32.130> glue<00:06:32.400> it<00:06:32.430> to<00:06:32.789> the

gets all the flashing off that heads off

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.650 
gets all the flashing off that heads off
the<00:06:46.740> other<00:06:46.860> direction<00:06:47.070> okay<00:06:47.970> that's<00:06:48.180> really

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
hole in the future but you can actually

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.170 
hole in the future but you can actually
see<00:07:27.840> it<00:07:28.200> there's<00:07:28.710> a<00:07:28.800> smaller<00:07:29.370> hole<00:07:29.610> here<00:07:29.910> you

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
see it there's a smaller hole here you

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.180 
see it there's a smaller hole here you
just<00:07:30.330> need<00:07:30.450> to<00:07:30.570> keep<00:07:30.870> working<00:07:30.930> it<00:07:31.410> out<00:07:31.500> until

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.190 
just need to keep working it out until

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.250 
just need to keep working it out until
you<00:07:32.400> get<00:07:32.640> it<00:07:32.850> big<00:07:33.090> enough<00:07:33.210> for<00:07:34.170> the<00:07:36.260> joystick

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.260 
you get it big enough for the joystick

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.170 
you get it big enough for the joystick
don't<00:07:37.800> try<00:07:37.980> to<00:07:38.010> use<00:07:38.220> a<00:07:38.250> drill<00:07:38.550> bit<00:07:38.700> you<00:07:39.030> need

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
don't try to use a drill bit you need

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.610 
don't try to use a drill bit you need
you<00:07:39.450> can<00:07:39.600> use<00:07:39.720> a<00:07:39.750> drill<00:07:40.020> bit<00:07:40.110> have<00:07:40.230> to<00:07:40.320> hit<00:07:40.470> the

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 
you can use a drill bit have to hit the

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.460 
you can use a drill bit have to hit the
first<00:07:41.160> part<00:07:42.090> like<00:07:42.270> a<00:07:42.300> quarter<00:07:42.720> inch<00:07:42.870> but<00:07:43.350> then

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.470 
first part like a quarter inch but then

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.690 
first part like a quarter inch but then
you<00:07:43.560> need<00:07:43.710> to<00:07:43.770> take<00:07:43.860> them<00:07:44.010> exactly<00:07:44.250> and<00:07:44.490> I<00:07:44.520> can

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:44.700 
you need to take them exactly and I can

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.400 
you need to take them exactly and I can
start<00:07:44.850> cleaning<00:07:45.150> it<00:07:45.210> out<00:07:45.360> until<00:07:46.050> you<00:07:46.170> get<00:07:46.320> it

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.410 
start cleaning it out until you get it

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.840 
start cleaning it out until you get it
big<00:07:46.530> enough<00:07:46.650> you<00:07:46.890> use<00:07:47.010> to<00:07:47.280> bigger<00:07:47.460> drill<00:07:47.700> bit

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:47.850 
big enough you use to bigger drill bit

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.340 
big enough you use to bigger drill bit
adjust<00:07:48.150> it<00:07:48.300> will<00:07:48.420> just<00:07:48.540> eat<00:07:48.720> that<00:07:48.930> whole<00:07:49.080> area

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:49.350 
adjust it will just eat that whole area

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.000 
adjust it will just eat that whole area
way<00:07:49.680> I've<00:07:50.340> done<00:07:50.820> it
