00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
hurdles which you know we did win a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.650 
hurdles which you know we did win a
valuable<00:00:38.129> race<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.579> Haydock<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> probably

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
valuable race of Haydock but it probably

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.569 
valuable race of Haydock but it probably
would<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.809> been<00:00:40.170> more<00:00:40.590> helpful<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.399> we'd

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
would have been more helpful if we'd

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.639 
would have been more helpful if we'd
start<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> season<00:00:42.420> over<00:00:42.750> fences<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.410> give<00:00:43.530> it

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
start the season over fences to give it

start the season over fences to give it
more<00:00:43.770> practice<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.149> was<00:00:45.329> thrilled<00:00:45.570> with

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
more practice and I was thrilled with

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.540 
more practice and I was thrilled with
the<00:00:45.899> hey<00:00:46.050> dot<00:00:46.260> run<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:46.680> disappointed<00:00:47.309> by<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the hey dot run but disappointed by the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.209 
the hey dot run but disappointed by the
Newbery<00:00:48.059> run<00:00:48.239> where<00:00:48.870> he<00:00:48.930> made<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.410> jump<00:00:49.980> so

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
Newbery run where he made a jump so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.520 
Newbery run where he made a jump so
badly<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.690> don't<00:00:51.809> think<00:00:51.989> he'll<00:00:52.199> get<00:00:52.289> away

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
badly and I don't think he'll get away

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.830 
badly and I don't think he'll get away
with<00:00:52.680> jumping<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> RSA<00:00:54.149> he's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
with jumping like that in the RSA he's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.630 
with jumping like that in the RSA he's
been<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.530> brilliant<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.250> he's<00:00:56.370> jumping

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
been out so brilliant and he's jumping

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.479 
been out so brilliant and he's jumping
at<00:00:56.879> home<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.480> he<00:00:58.050> was<00:00:58.199> prior<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.620> hey<00:00:58.920> Doc<00:00:59.160> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
at home and he was prior to hey Doc that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
at home and he was prior to hey Doc that
I<00:00:59.579> haven't<00:00:59.789> felt<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.840> made<00:01:01.050> any

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
I haven't felt that it's it's made any

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.930 
I haven't felt that it's it's made any
difference<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:01.829> he<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.070> slightly<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> same

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
difference but he was slightly the same

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.119 
difference but he was slightly the same
over<00:01:03.180> hurdles<00:01:03.390> he'll<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.409> brilliant<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.920> home

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
over hurdles he'll be brilliant at home

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.770 
over hurdles he'll be brilliant at home
and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.939> got<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> racing

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
and then when we got to the racing

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.660 
and then when we got to the racing
situation<00:01:07.380> he'd<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:08.010> running<00:01:08.159> down<00:01:08.490> his

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
situation he'd be running down his

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.359 
situation he'd be running down his
hurdles<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.510> keeping<00:01:09.900> straight<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:11.189> we

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
hurdles and not keeping straight so we

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.770 
hurdles and not keeping straight so we
actually<00:01:11.729> had<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> same<00:01:12.090> problem<00:01:12.659> over

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
actually had the same problem over

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.090 
actually had the same problem over
hurdles<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.650> there<00:01:13.799> were<00:01:13.890> fences

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
hurdles this because there were fences

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100 
hurdles this because there were fences
and<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:15.000> isn't<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.390> anything<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.020> do

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and there isn't really anything I can do

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.840 
and there isn't really anything I can do
about<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.619> home<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.189> you're<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.369> waiting

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
about at home so you're just waiting

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.280 
about at home so you're just waiting
until<00:01:17.909> cheltenham<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> hoping<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.080> he'll

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
until cheltenham and hoping that he'll

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
until cheltenham and hoping that he'll
perform<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.950> he<00:01:20.070> did<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.400> hey<00:01:20.520> doc<00:01:20.729> yeah

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
perform like he did at hey doc yeah

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
perform like he did at hey doc yeah
that's<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.470> can't<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.830> any

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that's all we can do we can't do any

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.080 
that's all we can do we can't do any
more<00:01:22.979> all<00:01:23.220> I've<00:01:23.340> got<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> make<00:01:23.670> sure<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.970> I

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
more all I've got to make sure is I

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.480 
more all I've got to make sure is I
don't<00:01:24.150> overdo<00:01:24.780> him<00:01:24.930> work-wise<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:26.310> he's

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
don't overdo him work-wise because he's

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.630 
don't overdo him work-wise because he's
a<00:01:26.520> horse<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.060> easily<00:01:27.210> over<00:01:27.750> train<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
a horse you can easily over train and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.800 
a horse you can easily over train and
possibly<00:01:29.640> you're<00:01:29.850> slightly<00:01:30.119> over<00:01:30.540> trained

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
possibly you're slightly over trained

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.390 
possibly you're slightly over trained
before<00:01:31.170> he<00:01:31.229> went<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> Cheltenham<00:01:31.680> last<00:01:32.040> year

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
before he went to Cheltenham last year

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
before he went to Cheltenham last year
so<00:01:33.060> how<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.540> feel<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.750> Diamond<00:01:34.500> Harry

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
so how do you feel about Diamond Harry

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.319 
so how do you feel about Diamond Harry
this<00:01:34.920> year<00:01:35.130> compared<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> last<00:01:35.640> year<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
this year compared to last year going to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.300 
this year compared to last year going to
the<00:01:36.420> festival<00:01:36.600> probably<00:01:37.470> about<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.829> same<00:01:38.070> but

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the festival probably about the same but

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.460 
the festival probably about the same but
I<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.030> RSA<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> much<00:01:40.259> more

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I think the RSA is a much more

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
I think the RSA is a much more
competitive<00:01:40.860> race<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.909> lot<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.210> ways

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
competitive race in a lot of ways

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.719 
competitive race in a lot of ways
because<00:01:42.540> it'll<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> bigger<00:01:43.200> field<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.950> it's

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
because it'll be a bigger field and it's

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.760 
because it'll be a bigger field and it's
a<00:01:44.850> furious<00:01:45.360> gallop<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.200> hugely<00:01:46.590> in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
a furious gallop and it's a hugely in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.410 
a furious gallop and it's a hugely in
competitive<00:01:47.430> race<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.390> way

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
competitive race so I think in a way

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.870 
competitive race so I think in a way
he's<00:01:49.259> got<00:01:49.470> more<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.340> year<00:01:50.610> than<00:01:50.850> he

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
he's got more to do this year than he

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.850 
he's got more to do this year than he
did<00:01:51.030> last<00:01:51.329> year<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.320> would<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.680> the

weather<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.280> warm<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.270> I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390

than<00:02:01.290> he's<00:02:01.409> really<00:02:01.740> showing<00:02:01.950> at<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.159> moment

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
than he's really showing at the moment

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.240 
than he's really showing at the moment
but<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.030> has<00:02:03.210> been<00:02:03.420> horrendous<00:02:04.110> winter<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.159> be

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
but it has been horrendous winter to be

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
but it has been horrendous winter to be
honest<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.729> who<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.390> rate<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.840> main

I think long-run is is the best horse in
the<00:02:10.739> race

two-mile champion chase but that looks

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.080 
two-mile champion chase but that looks
to<00:04:18.620> be<00:04:18.739> one<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.160> hottest<00:04:19.340> races<00:04:19.730> of<00:04:20.000> the

armor<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.570> don't<00:04:23.840> think<00:04:24.140> of<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:25.220> Paul<00:04:25.430> Nichols

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.030 
armor I don't think of the Paul Nichols
pair<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.690> know<00:04:26.750> they're<00:04:27.050> very<00:04:27.290> strong<00:04:27.710> and

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
pair you know they're very strong and

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.400 
pair you know they're very strong and
Kalahari<00:04:28.760> Kings<00:04:29.120> very<00:04:29.420> strong<00:04:29.750> pretty<00:04:30.020> robust

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
Kalahari Kings very strong pretty robust

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.820 
Kalahari Kings very strong pretty robust
very<00:04:30.680> strong<00:04:31.390> it's<00:04:32.390> a<00:04:32.690> big<00:04:33.170> serve<00:04:33.410> strong

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
very strong it's a big serve strong

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.400 
very strong it's a big serve strong
though<00:04:34.490> it's<00:04:34.730> a<00:04:34.880> formidable<00:04:35.600> opposition<00:04:35.750> and

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
though it's a formidable opposition and

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.070 
though it's a formidable opposition and
so<00:04:37.220> therefore<00:04:37.640> we<00:04:37.760> might<00:04:37.970> even<00:04:38.000> duck<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:38.810> and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
so therefore we might even duck that and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.260 
so therefore we might even duck that and
go<00:04:39.200> for<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.500> ground<00:04:39.710> annual<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.340> what<00:04:40.970> race

that work which has worked out is very

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.800 
that work which has worked out is very
strong<00:05:28.130> form<00:05:28.460> perhaps<00:05:29.060> we<00:05:29.330> made<00:05:29.479> a<00:05:29.510> bit<00:05:29.690> too

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
perhaps a shade disappointing at Exeter

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.820 
perhaps a shade disappointing at Exeter
where<00:05:34.400> we<00:05:34.550> were<00:05:34.669> well<00:05:34.880> beaten<00:05:35.350> but<00:05:36.350> I'm<00:05:36.470> hoping

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
where we were well beaten but I'm hoping

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.860 
where we were well beaten but I'm hoping
that<00:05:36.979> the<00:05:37.070> step-up<00:05:37.430> in<00:05:37.580> trip<00:05:37.880> will<00:05:38.330> enable<00:05:38.570> him

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
that the step-up in trip will enable him

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.460 
that the step-up in trip will enable him
to<00:05:38.930> show<00:05:39.860> better<00:05:40.070> form<00:05:40.460> so<00:05:41.060> um<00:05:41.360> you<00:05:41.870> know<00:05:41.930> I<00:05:42.020> see

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
the triumph hurdle but he is a horse who

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.719 
the triumph hurdle but he is a horse who
must<00:05:53.870> have<00:05:54.050> some<00:05:54.260> cut<00:05:54.500> in<00:05:54.680> the<00:05:54.770> ground<00:05:55.010> so<00:05:55.340> he's

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
must have some cut in the ground so he's

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.270 
must have some cut in the ground so he's
a<00:05:55.760> horse<00:05:56.000> that<00:05:56.210> it's<00:05:56.930> very<00:05:57.169> unlikely<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:57.979> run

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
a horse that it's very unlikely to run

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:06.670 
a horse that it's very unlikely to run
unless<00:05:58.850> it's<00:05:59.150> soft<00:05:59.390> or<00:05:59.570> heavy

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.369 

in<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:07.860> long<00:06:08.069> run<00:06:08.370> I<00:06:08.580> see<00:06:09.240> him<00:06:09.419> as<00:06:09.599> a<00:06:09.629> future

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379 
in the long run I see him as a future

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.189 
in the long run I see him as a future
Gold<00:06:10.589> Cup<00:06:10.860> horse<00:06:11.159> and<00:06:11.629> but<00:06:12.629> he<00:06:12.779> has<00:06:12.960> been

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
Gold Cup horse and but he has been

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.709 
Gold Cup horse and but he has been
impressive<00:06:13.740> as<00:06:14.129> a<00:06:14.159> juvenile<00:06:14.699> a<00:06:14.909> 10<00:06:15.180> length<00:06:15.419> win

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
impressive as a juvenile a 10 length win

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.140 
impressive as a juvenile a 10 length win
of<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:16.080> grade<00:06:16.830> one<00:06:17.039> at<00:06:17.189> Chester<00:06:17.669> Christmas

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
of the grade one at Chester Christmas

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.129 
of the grade one at Chester Christmas
was<00:06:18.360> hugely<00:06:19.050> impressive<00:06:19.499> I<00:06:19.800> thought<00:06:20.099> and<00:06:20.520> I

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
was hugely impressive I thought and I

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.450 
was hugely impressive I thought and I
think<00:06:22.139> he<00:06:22.259> should<00:06:22.439> go<00:06:22.620> on<00:06:22.650> from<00:06:22.979> here<00:06:23.189> but<00:06:23.430> we

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
think he should go on from here but we

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.010 
think he should go on from here but we
have<00:06:23.669> to<00:06:23.789> be<00:06:23.879> a<00:06:23.909> bit<00:06:24.150> careful<00:06:24.389> with<00:06:24.779> a<00:06:24.809> young

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
have to be a bit careful with a young

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.439 
have to be a bit careful with a young
horse<00:06:25.259> with<00:06:25.529> his<00:06:25.680> potential<00:06:26.069> not<00:06:26.879> to<00:06:27.059> ask<00:06:27.210> him

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449

to do too much too soon it is a

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.730

fantastic season and we were 12th in the
table<00:06:40.169> at<00:06:40.259> the<00:06:40.379> moment<00:06:41.120> you<00:06:42.120> know<00:06:42.240> I<00:06:42.270> wouldn't

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:42.899

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:46.229 
end of the season so we need to have a

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:49.850

suppose we go to the festival with with
slightly<00:06:52.529> better<00:06:52.710> prospects<00:06:53.460> than<00:06:53.550> we<00:06:53.639> had

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789 
slightly better prospects than we had

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.730 
slightly better prospects than we had
last<00:06:53.819> year<00:06:54.210> and<00:06:54.629> in<00:06:54.779> the<00:06:54.899> end<00:06:55.050> last<00:06:55.289> year<00:06:55.620> we

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
last year and in the end last year we

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.219 
last year and in the end last year we
managed<00:06:56.069> a<00:06:56.479> second<00:06:57.479> a<00:06:57.809> third<00:06:57.870> a<00:06:58.819> sixth<00:06:59.819> so<00:07:00.659> you

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
managed a second a third a sixth so you

know<00:07:01.349> I'd<00:07:01.469> hoped<00:07:01.680> to<00:07:01.740> do<00:07:01.830> a<00:07:01.889> bit<00:07:02.009> better<00:07:02.039> than

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
know I'd hoped to do a bit better than
