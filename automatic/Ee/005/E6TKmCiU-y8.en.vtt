draw<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.219> play<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.760> they<00:01:00.449> all<00:01:00.570> come<00:01:00.750> with

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
draw one play one they all come with

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.380

their<00:01:01.039> how<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> play<00:01:02.489> cards<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:05.240> they're<00:01:06.240> all

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
their how to play cards and they're all

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.600 
their how to play cards and they're all
about<00:01:06.630> their<00:01:06.840> different<00:01:07.229> themes<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:08.280> let's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
about their different themes now let's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.010 
about their different themes now let's
see<00:01:10.220> because<00:01:11.220> I've<00:01:11.400> gone<00:01:12.030> through<00:01:12.090> these<00:01:12.390> all

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
see because I've gone through these all

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
see because I've gone through these all
three<00:01:13.170> decks<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:15.530> select<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.710> few<00:01:17.299> cards<00:01:18.299> that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
three decks and select a few cards that

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.990 
three decks and select a few cards that
I<00:01:18.750> think<00:01:19.049> help<00:01:19.350> illustrate<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.340> uniqueness

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
I think help illustrate the uniqueness

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.660 
I think help illustrate the uniqueness
of<00:01:21.390> each<00:01:22.320> different<00:01:22.590> type<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.430> one's

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
of each different type so this one's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820 
of each different type so this one's
obviously<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.780> getting<00:01:25.049> stoned<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.680> all

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
obviously that getting stoned and all

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.410 
obviously that getting stoned and all
that<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.820> your<00:01:26.880> basic<00:01:27.030> rules

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that so you got your basic rules

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.810 
that so you got your basic rules
everyone<00:01:27.900> every<00:01:28.439> single<00:01:28.470> flux<00:01:29.369> game<00:01:29.610> has

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
everyone every single flux game has

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
everyone every single flux game has
basic<00:01:30.390> rules<00:01:30.570> draw<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:30.990> play<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.860> per

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
basic rules draw one play one and as per

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.120 
basic rules draw one play one and as per
usual<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.820> any<00:01:33.060> flux<00:01:33.390> game<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.740> rules<00:01:34.920> can

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
usual in any flux game the rules can

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.530 
usual in any flux game the rules can
change<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.090> already<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.450> the
