00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:34.340
 so i have like this 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:37.720
 T-shirt mesh and knitwear material 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.070
 also mesh 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.960
 Now we will cut this one 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:48.340
 t-shirt we fold our stuff 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.730
 half face down inside 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.309
 we straighten the T-shirt and 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.570
 do not forget to give seam allowances 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.570
 and to hem 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.930
 we cut out our parts on the front 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.930
 half we deepen the neck 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:25.310
 now each of the halves must be folded 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.420
 in half language well or easier to say 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.540
 trim all the bumps 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.540
 that our halves were symmetrical 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.090
 after ac strove both halves 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.689
 on making sure that we have one side seams 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:56.729
 lengths and the same thing we do with 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:56.729
 shoulder seams now we circle the sleeve 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.170
 and 2 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.170
 a novelty 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.800
 next we need to carve out 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:28.180
 booths of this neck should be 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:33.460
 necessarily elastic so we edge 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.650
 or until salt or across is generally needed 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.520
 choose a place that is the most 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.520
 stretches 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.489
 now we go to typewriter and sew one 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.489
 shoulder seam 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.519
 after that we start to sew in 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:10.360
 the neck for this to the seamy side 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:15.459
 cry products but also apply facial 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.880
 side of the bake and start sewing on 7 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.540
 millimeters from the edge 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.590
 so we apply the check and 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.590
 stitching on her neck 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.799
 then we fold it to the front 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.730
 side and sew can be first 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.780
 to outline 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.780
 then sew on 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.599
 now we are plotting the second line 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.840
 Now iron out our back and shoulder 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.840
 seam like this we should be able to 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:15.450
 after the neck we have processed 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:17.609
 go to sew the second shoulder seam after 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.889
 how the shoulder seam was downloaded 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.620
 we need this one 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.759
 attach the neck to this tail 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.759
 we did not hang out 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:47.910
 iron our 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:52.640
 your stress, suffer it already, and get down to it 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.640
 to what not sleeves open armhole 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.000
 find the middle point on the sleeve 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:06.810
 do we see if we have the same length if 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.260
 sleeve length is slightly longer then this 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.400
 Normal wrap sleeves should be 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:22.560
 a little bit at the passage that is a little bit 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:26.960
 seam on the sleeve never 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:31.350
 gets along he gets on live that is 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:35.240
 iron is taken and passed straight 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.240
 about not really 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:52.979
 after sleeves vtachnye start 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.979
 to stitching side slices 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:01.210
 side seam we iron 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:11.469
 bend did not sit on 7 millimeters this 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:16.229
 the same further we bend on two 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.229
 half or three centimeters and hem 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:25.000
 so that the powerful line you do not 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:27.520
 burst at wear a little tight 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.629
 on the material and then the line will be 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.629
 as if stretched 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:42.560
 and redeem imitating once 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.800
 sewing stitch if anyone has 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.950
 flat surface 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.180
 machine or sewing time 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:55.410
 as they call it then you can immediately 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:07:02.120
 bend and hem exactly the same way we 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:02.120
 we bend the sleeve and the conclusion we go 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.480
 new TA 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.900
