large variety of cameras you know but
the<00:01:41.580> one<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.880> had<00:01:42.060> available<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.750> night

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
the one that I had available that night

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.730 
the one that I had available that night
during<00:01:44.070> available<00:01:44.580> night<00:01:44.730> was<00:01:44.940> my<00:01:45.120> nikon<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.290> i

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
during available night was my nikon so i

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
during available night was my nikon so i
figured<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.940> my<00:01:48.090> experience<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.750> stop

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
figured with my experience with stop

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.040 
figured with my experience with stop
motion<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.710> my<00:01:50.070> love<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.640> bending<00:01:51.390> time<00:01:51.690> I

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
motion and my love for bending time I

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.620 
motion and my love for bending time I
figured<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.040> could<00:01:53.490> compress<00:01:54.090> an<00:01:54.300> entire

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
figured that I could compress an entire

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.830 
figured that I could compress an entire
night<00:01:55.610> much<00:01:56.610> faster<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.510> a<00:01:57.570> lot<00:01:57.810> more

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
was editing it and that's often what

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.380 
was editing it and that's often what
happens<00:04:32.540> with<00:04:33.050> me<00:04:33.200> it's<00:04:33.350> my<00:04:33.560> process<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.390> guess

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
and actually put it together

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.250 
and actually put it together
and<00:05:10.040> they<00:05:10.490> that's<00:05:10.730> one<00:05:11.360> of<00:05:11.480> the<00:05:12.080> most

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.200 
and they that's one of the most
fascinating<00:05:12.440> challenges<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.610> I've<00:05:13.760> found

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
fascinating challenges that I've found

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.830 
fascinating challenges that I've found
in<00:05:14.510> you<00:05:14.720> know<00:05:14.840> creative<00:05:15.170> projects<00:05:15.680> today<00:05:15.830> so<00:05:16.840> i

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
in you know creative projects today so i

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.020 
in you know creative projects today so i
brought<00:05:18.590> it<00:05:18.980> together<00:05:19.130> and<00:05:19.490> i<00:05:19.550> realized<00:05:19.880> that

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
brought it together and i realized that

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.930 
brought it together and i realized that
it<00:05:20.210> didn't<00:05:20.450> make<00:05:20.570> sense<00:05:20.600> to<00:05:21.490> start<00:05:22.490> from<00:05:22.700> the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
it didn't make sense to start from the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.440 
it didn't make sense to start from the
beginning<00:05:23.090> or<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.560> end<00:05:24.830> i<00:05:25.190> just<00:05:25.940> decided<00:05:26.180> to

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
beginning or the end i just decided to

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.870 
beginning or the end i just decided to
reverse<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.990> entire<00:05:27.290> night<00:05:27.620> so<00:05:28.340> that<00:05:28.580> at<00:05:28.820> the

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
reverse the entire night so that at the

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.330 
reverse the entire night so that at the
end<00:05:29.330> there<00:05:30.260> was<00:05:30.350> a<00:05:30.410> funny<00:05:30.710> little<00:05:30.890> twist

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
end there was a funny little twist

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.780 
end there was a funny little twist
whereas<00:05:32.030> it<00:05:32.450> ends<00:05:32.810> with<00:05:32.900> hi<00:05:33.110> I'm<00:05:33.320> Matt<00:05:33.790> which

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
whereas it ends with hi I'm Matt which

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.060 
whereas it ends with hi I'm Matt which
was<00:05:34.970> like<00:05:35.180> I<00:05:35.210> uh-huh<00:05:35.870> hey<00:05:36.200> I'm<00:05:36.380> here<00:05:36.590> kind<00:05:36.950> of

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
thing for better for worse you know it

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.740 
thing for better for worse you know it
made<00:05:39.710> me<00:05:39.860> laugh<00:05:40.040> yeah<00:05:40.820> I<00:05:40.850> think<00:05:41.150> it's<00:05:41.450> really

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
made me laugh yeah I think it's really

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.390 
made me laugh yeah I think it's really
really<00:05:41.930> funny<00:05:42.140> especially<00:05:42.890> if<00:05:42.980> you<00:05:43.040> know<00:05:43.160> that

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
really funny especially if you know that

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.440 
really funny especially if you know that
your<00:05:43.550> mat<00:05:44.380> so<00:05:45.380> it<00:05:45.650> feels<00:05:46.460> to<00:05:46.730> me<00:05:46.760> like<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:47.210> film

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
your mat so it feels to me like the film

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.660 
your mat so it feels to me like the film
plays<00:05:47.720> backwards<00:05:48.410> sort<00:05:48.980> of<00:05:49.040> like<00:05:49.220> memento<00:05:49.460> or

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
plays backwards sort of like memento or

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.940 
plays backwards sort of like memento or
something<00:05:50.180> was<00:05:50.300> that<00:05:50.510> intentional<00:05:51.140> or<00:05:51.590> is

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
something was that intentional or is

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.110 
something was that intentional or is
that<00:05:52.100> just<00:05:52.160> sort<00:05:52.430> of<00:05:52.490> what<00:05:52.610> happened<00:05:52.880> in<00:05:52.970> the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
that just sort of what happened in the

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.330 
that just sort of what happened in the
Edit<00:05:53.450> there's<00:05:54.440> a<00:05:54.500> certain<00:05:54.680> point<00:05:54.800> during<00:05:55.160> the

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
Edit there's a certain point during the

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.850 
Edit there's a certain point during the
editing<00:05:55.430> process<00:05:55.820> where<00:05:56.510> the<00:05:57.260> other<00:05:57.440> decided

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
editing process where the other decided

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.640 
editing process where the other decided
to<00:05:57.920> take<00:05:58.070> a<00:05:58.130> gamble<00:05:58.220> or<00:05:58.700> not<00:05:58.960> in<00:05:59.960> this<00:06:00.170> case<00:06:00.380> I

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
to take a gamble or not in this case I

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.790 
to take a gamble or not in this case I
thought<00:06:00.920> what<00:06:01.820> the<00:06:01.940> heck<00:06:02.120> you<00:06:02.660> know<00:06:02.720> like<00:06:03.020> I<00:06:03.200> it

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
thought what the heck you know like I it

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.770 
thought what the heck you know like I it
seemed<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.580> make<00:06:04.760> more<00:06:05.090> sense<00:06:05.420> and<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:05.690> was

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
seemed to make more sense and it was

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.270 
seemed to make more sense and it was
more<00:06:05.930> visually<00:06:06.320> appealing<00:06:06.350> with<00:06:06.830> everything

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
more visually appealing with everything

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.640 
more visually appealing with everything
going<00:06:07.400> backwards<00:06:07.910> to<00:06:08.060> the<00:06:08.090> film<00:06:08.420> so<00:06:09.080> I<00:06:09.380> tried

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
going backwards to the film so I tried

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.290 
going backwards to the film so I tried
it<00:06:09.800> as<00:06:09.920> an<00:06:10.070> experiment<00:06:10.430> and<00:06:10.820> I<00:06:10.940> fell<00:06:11.150> in<00:06:11.270> love

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
it as an experiment and I fell in love

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.630 
it as an experiment and I fell in love
so<00:06:11.780> I<00:06:11.840> just<00:06:12.050> continued<00:06:12.530> going<00:06:12.770> that<00:06:12.920> way<00:06:13.040> and<00:06:13.430> I

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
so I just continued going that way and I

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.340 
so I just continued going that way and I
think<00:06:13.700> it<00:06:13.910> turned<00:06:14.120> out<00:06:14.240> pretty<00:06:14.600> phenomenally

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350
