00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.869
 a message that we have is always because their holiday there is 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:22.069
 in addition one must make an effort to continue in celebration a comeback who who 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.269
 is not that is not completed actually 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.429
 it's just saying that he has always been told something to do 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.800
 it's one of the countries 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.870
 one of the places that are removed in the world and that are 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 and that are very little visible in fact the whole body 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.040
 the message is unfortunately a fake 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.690
 and the others our business match serves that's to say that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.780
 through this match through 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.050
 the most so do besides do some things 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.130
 and that's why also say that the body is in English or not 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.090
 some certain things and coming back every year and seeing who is 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.510
 always a craze 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.610
 a manna vidard this project 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.210
 and the people who respond to it, if only by their coming 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.000
 in an acquired stadium he fills every time 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.730
 but that proves that it proves to us that the hulls the world not to let go 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.370
 we must continue 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.850
 and at the same time across the hour 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.150
 their strength and seems strong to them to come to the stadium and become for the 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.020
 good cause 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.050
 two countries move to another 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.480
 and why and in these cases in feast we have the impression that 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.750
 that the message go from one country to another and the text and that's the message 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.150
 that we want to do more lost some time to continue 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.520
 in any case the way to the level 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.850
 already 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.030
 and next year it will be our country and without laces it is the message in 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.950
 all cases the stone that is super important 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.950
 that the Polish coma the floor is not finished 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.300
 actually what I'm what I can say again it's true that 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 every year actually have chosen a very specific thing 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.200

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.659

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.380
 time 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.629
 there was a grain 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.989

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.060
 57 'each 5000 people at the stage 7 th strong sage 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.059
