I'm going to show you a quick and easy

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:21.380 
I'm going to show you a quick and easy
interval<00:01:19.440> training<00:01:19.500> exercise<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:21.000> works<00:01:21.179> like

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
interval training exercise it works like

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.870 
interval training exercise it works like
this<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> 1<00:01:26.369> 1<00:01:26.729> 2<00:01:26.910> 1<00:01:26.940> 1<00:01:27.390> 2<00:01:27.690> 3<00:01:27.840> 2<00:01:28.050> 1<00:01:28.080> 1<00:01:28.649> 2<00:01:28.800> 3<00:01:28.950> 4<00:01:29.160> 3<00:01:29.310> 2<00:01:29.369> 1

it's<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.830> way<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.300> work<00:01:39.300> on<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.660> intervals<00:01:40.410> as

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
it's a way to work on the intervals as

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.650 
it's a way to work on the intervals as
you<00:01:40.920> go<00:01:41.039> up<00:01:41.069> the<00:01:41.190> scale<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:41.729> by<00:01:42.240> numbering

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
you go up the scale and by numbering

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.699 
you go up the scale and by numbering
them<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.959> make<00:01:43.110> sure<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.380> always<00:01:43.590> remember

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
them you make sure you always remember

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.469 
them you make sure you always remember
which<00:01:43.950> they<00:01:44.160> are<00:01:44.369> once<00:01:45.119> you're<00:01:45.270> comfortable

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
which they are once you're comfortable

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.839 
which they are once you're comfortable
with<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.080> start<00:01:46.800> missing<00:01:47.160> out<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> notes<00:01:47.670> in

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:47.849 
with this start missing out the notes in

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.109 
with this start missing out the notes in
between<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.509> it'll<00:01:48.750> work<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.929> this<00:01:49.580> one<00:01:50.580> one

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
between so it'll work like this one one
