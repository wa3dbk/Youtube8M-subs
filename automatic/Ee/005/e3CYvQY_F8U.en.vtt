00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.100
 because he is the composite skeleton tomo 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.460
 Canvas and no beds 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.090

 not active but also with that house 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.930
 but this is normal 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.560
 the grace of the supreme attack of the nau 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.410
 the earth is a perfect 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.030
 you do not have all this can not be like this 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.650
