relationship<00:00:33.970> because<00:00:34.270> we<00:00:34.989> obviously<00:00:35.320> wanted

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
relationship because we obviously wanted

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.830 
relationship because we obviously wanted
to<00:00:35.860> move<00:00:36.190> forward<00:00:36.700> and<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.180> that<00:00:37.660> was<00:00:37.809> a

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
to move forward and and that was a

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.130 
to move forward and and that was a
strong<00:00:38.830> topic<00:00:39.310> so<00:00:39.670> we<00:00:40.150> talked<00:00:40.390> about<00:00:40.540> it<00:00:40.900> and

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
strong topic so we talked about it and

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.830 
strong topic so we talked about it and
decided<00:00:41.710> that<00:00:42.180> family<00:00:43.180> was<00:00:43.300> our<00:00:43.420> way<00:00:43.540> forward

and we started to look into the best way

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.560 
and we started to look into the best way
for<00:00:46.510> us<00:00:46.630> to<00:00:46.960> go<00:00:47.110> forward<00:00:47.140> him<00:00:47.770> and<00:00:48.340> trying<00:00:49.150> and

being a gay couple going for fertility
treatment<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.380> think<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.430> London<00:01:48.729> winds<00:01:49.030> can

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.450 
treatment I think the London winds can
it<00:01:49.450> was<00:01:49.540> amazing<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.140> be<00:01:50.170> less<00:01:50.409> because<00:01:50.649> never

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
it was amazing to be less because never

a lot and gone through all the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.530 
a lot and gone through all the
eventualities<00:02:57.730> but<00:02:58.180> when<00:02:58.299> you're<00:02:58.420> actually

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
eventualities but when you're actually

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.750 
eventualities but when you're actually

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
time the concerns I had were obviously

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.130 
time the concerns I had were obviously
because<00:03:03.880> we<00:03:04.000> initially<00:03:04.540> we<00:03:04.630> went<00:03:04.810> through<00:03:04.989> the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
because we initially we went through the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.930 
because we initially we went through the
egg<00:03:05.290> sharing<00:03:05.650> process<00:03:06.070> was<00:03:06.340> they<00:03:06.549> would<00:03:06.760> be

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
egg sharing process was they would be

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.180 
egg sharing process was they would be
quite<00:03:07.420> intrusive<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.530> I'm<00:03:08.620> quite<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.829> private

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
quite intrusive and I'm quite a private

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.250 
quite intrusive and I'm quite a private
person<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:10.420> know<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.570> was<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.810> bit<00:03:10.989> worried

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
about that but my concerns were really

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.180 
about that but my concerns were really
taken<00:03:13.780> care<00:03:13.959> of<00:03:13.989> by<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.260> other<00:03:14.620> ones<00:03:14.799> clinic

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.490 
we chose obviously to use that the
London<00:03:22.209> was<00:03:22.299> Fernbank<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.930> because<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.380> was

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
London was Fernbank a because it was

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.720 
London was Fernbank a because it was
connected<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.130> London<00:03:24.370> Women's<00:03:24.609> Clinic

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
and because it was so easy to use

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.470 
and because it was so easy to use
it's<00:03:27.040> like<00:03:27.160> internet<00:03:27.609> shopping<00:03:27.970> really<00:03:28.150> if<00:03:28.359> I

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
it's like internet shopping really if I

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.360 
it's like internet shopping really if I
could<00:03:28.630> put<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:28.989> way<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.410> it<00:03:30.010> had<00:03:30.160> all<00:03:30.280> the

just really easy and it was a fantastic

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.640 
just really easy and it was a fantastic
way<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.150> doing<00:03:40.480> things<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:41.170> was<00:03:41.319> something

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
way of doing things it was something

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.220 
way of doing things it was something
that<00:03:41.950> we<00:03:42.400> could<00:03:42.609> have<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> real<00:03:43.209> say<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:43.510> who<00:03:43.989> the

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
the beginning about their background

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.890 
the beginning about their background
that<00:04:10.950> we<00:04:11.910> had<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.060> down<00:04:12.299> there<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.750> help

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
that we had a down there to help

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.300 
that we had a down there to help
conceive<00:04:13.500> them<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:13.890> it<00:04:13.950> was<00:04:14.040> something<00:04:14.280> that

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
conceive them and it was something that

them<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.510> they<00:04:18.900> can<00:04:19.079> understand<00:04:19.470> from<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.709> very

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130
