00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.570 

transitions<00:00:01.530> real<00:00:01.770> important<00:00:02.159> they<00:00:02.250> did<00:00:02.429> that

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
transitions real important they did that

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.519 
transitions real important they did that
tend<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.970> concentrate<00:00:03.300> walleyes<00:00:04.170> so<00:00:04.380> if<00:00:04.440> you

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
tend to concentrate walleyes so if you

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.619 
tend to concentrate walleyes so if you
can<00:00:04.680> find<00:00:04.890> some<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.190> those<00:00:05.339> transitions<00:00:05.940> it

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
can find some of those transitions it

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.210 
can find some of those transitions it
can<00:00:06.779> be<00:00:06.899> real<00:00:07.080> good<00:00:07.259> for<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.649> so<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:07.830> was<00:00:08.040> using

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
can be real good for you so I was using

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.310 
can be real good for you so I was using
structure<00:00:08.820> scan<00:00:09.000> here<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:09.809> let<00:00:09.929> me<00:00:09.960> just<00:00:10.050> go

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
structure scan here so let me just go

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.870 
structure scan here so let me just go
back<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.710> my<00:00:10.830> history<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.309> little<00:00:11.429> bit<00:00:11.580> here

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
back in my history a little bit here

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.870 
back in my history a little bit here
first<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.809> all<00:00:12.929> I'm<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.559> take<00:00:14.370> us<00:00:14.490> all<00:00:14.670> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
first of all I'm going to take us all to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.880 
first of all I'm going to take us all to
just<00:00:14.910> all<00:00:15.450> structure<00:00:16.049> scan<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.500> we<00:00:16.560> can<00:00:16.710> really

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
just all structure scan so we can really

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.279 
just all structure scan so we can really
look<00:00:17.070> at<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.460> close<00:00:17.760> now<00:00:18.539> if<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.810> go<00:00:18.930> back<00:00:19.109> in

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
look at this close now if I go back in

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.929 
look at this close now if I go back in
my<00:00:19.320> history<00:00:19.590> here<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.100> I'm<00:00:20.250> looking<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.850> is

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
my history here what I'm looking for is

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.000 
my history here what I'm looking for is
this<00:00:21.119> transition<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
this transition you can see here on the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
this transition you can see here on the
right-hand<00:00:23.460> side<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:23.939> boat<00:00:24.119> here<00:00:24.570> is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
right-hand side of my boat here is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.839 
right-hand side of my boat here is
Rock's<00:00:25.050> starting<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.740> come<00:00:25.980> into<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.490> screen

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
Rock's starting to come into the screen

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.419 
Rock's starting to come into the screen
so<00:00:27.570> that's<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.019> transition<00:00:28.650> I'm<00:00:28.769> looking<00:00:29.160> for

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
so that's the transition I'm looking for

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.400 
so that's the transition I'm looking for
and<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.060> cuts<00:00:30.269> across<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> goes<00:00:31.230> over

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
and it cuts across here it goes over

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.370 
and it cuts across here it goes over
here<00:00:31.859> that's<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.669> great<00:00:32.880> transition<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> want

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
here that's a great transition so I want

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.350 
here that's a great transition so I want
to<00:00:34.440> look<00:00:34.590> how<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.100> save<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:36.210> know

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
to look how can I save that you know

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.389 
to look how can I save that you know
because<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.350> real<00:00:37.559> important<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:37.980> know<00:00:38.160> that

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
because it's real important to know that

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.310 
because it's real important to know that
so<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.660> simply<00:00:39.960> move<00:00:40.140> my

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
so what I can do is simply move my

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.930 
so what I can do is simply move my
cursor<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.219> touch<00:00:41.460> screen<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.879> can

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
cursor and on this touch screen I can

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.240 
cursor and on this touch screen I can
just<00:00:42.180> touch<00:00:42.329> where<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.660> want<00:00:43.010> interesting<00:00:44.010> note

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
just touch where I want interesting note

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.069 
just touch where I want interesting note
here<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:45.000> gonna<00:00:45.120> tell<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.510> exactly<00:00:45.629> how

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
here it's gonna tell you exactly how

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840 
here it's gonna tell you exactly how
deep<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.320> transition<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.309> right<00:00:47.520> there<00:00:47.700> it's

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
deep that transition is right there it's

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180 
deep that transition is right there it's
eleven<00:00:48.210> point<00:00:48.450> seven<00:00:48.719> feet<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.860> even<00:00:50.070> though<00:00:50.160> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
eleven point seven feet so even though I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.680 
eleven point seven feet so even though I
didn't<00:00:50.460> drive<00:00:50.610> over<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.090> tell<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.510> deep

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
didn't drive over it I can tell it deep

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.720 
didn't drive over it I can tell it deep
that<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:52.980> got<00:00:53.160> my<00:00:53.219> cursor

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that is but now that I got my cursor

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610 
that is but now that I got my cursor
touched<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.750> transition<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
touched there right on that transition I

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.439 
touched there right on that transition I
can<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.219> simply<00:00:56.550> hit<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.879> flag<00:00:57.149> button

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
can just simply hit this flag button

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.810 
can just simply hit this flag button
twice<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.649> will<00:00:58.770> save<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> waypoint<00:00:59.280> there

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
twice and it will save a waypoint there

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.700 
twice and it will save a waypoint there
then<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.539> could<00:01:00.690> go<00:01:00.840> over<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.230> somewhere

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
then I could go over here somewhere

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.609 
then I could go over here somewhere
maybe<00:01:02.190> save<00:01:02.489> another<00:01:02.789> Waypoint<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.660> could<00:01:04.470> come

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
maybe save another Waypoint I could come

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.800 
maybe save another Waypoint I could come
over<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.830> save<00:01:05.369> another<00:01:05.670> Waypoint<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
over here save another Waypoint so I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.600 
over here save another Waypoint so I
could<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> series<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.830> waypoints<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.549> if

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
could have a series of waypoints and if

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
could have a series of waypoints and if
I<00:01:08.700> went<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.150> chart<00:01:09.450> plot<00:01:09.750> now<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.380> would

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
I went to my chart plot now I would

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.740 
I went to my chart plot now I would
actually<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.280> those<00:01:11.460> waypoints<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.630> would

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
actually see those waypoints and I would

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
actually see those waypoints and I would
have<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.049> transition<00:01:13.530> marked<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.430> cool

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
have that transition marked in a cool

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.880 
have that transition marked in a cool
way<00:01:15.299> though<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.960> keep<00:01:16.320> track<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.799> this

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
way though to keep track of this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.890 
way though to keep track of this
permanently<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:18.030> maybe<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:18.869> maybe

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
permanently is maybe you have or maybe

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.539 
permanently is maybe you have or maybe
you<00:01:19.170> haven't<00:01:19.320> noticed<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.070> little<00:01:20.280> red

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you haven't noticed but this little red

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.550 
you haven't noticed but this little red
flashing<00:01:21.060> light<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.600> means<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.409> I've

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
flashing light up here means that I've

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920 
flashing light up here means that I've
been<00:01:22.710> recording<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.490> sonar<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:24.900> I

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
been recording the sonar and so what I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.140 
been recording the sonar and so what I
can<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.650> instead<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.100> picking<00:01:27.030> out

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
can do is instead of picking out

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.480 
can do is instead of picking out
waypoints<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.170> actually<00:01:28.350> overlay<00:01:28.829> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
waypoints I can actually overlay this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.109 
waypoints I can actually overlay this
data<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.900> side<00:01:31.200> scan<00:01:31.530> data<00:01:31.850> onto<00:01:32.850> my

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
data this the side scan data onto my

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
data this the side scan data onto my
chart<00:01:33.780> platter<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.259> let's<00:01:34.439> take<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> look<00:01:34.829> at

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
chart platter so let's take a look at

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
chart platter so let's take a look at
how<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.420> first<00:01:36.689> thing<00:01:36.840> we're

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
how we do that the first thing we're

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.340 
how we do that the first thing we're
gonna<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.860> actually<00:01:38.189> stop<00:01:38.640> our<00:01:39.060> logging<00:01:39.689> so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
gonna do is actually stop our logging so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.109 
gonna do is actually stop our logging so
here<00:01:40.530> we're<00:01:40.650> gonna<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:40.920> under<00:01:41.040> log<00:01:41.369> sonar<00:01:41.939> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
here we're gonna go under log sonar I

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.819 
here we're gonna go under log sonar I
was<00:01:42.360> logging<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:43.049> along<00:01:43.229> I'm<00:01:43.470> gonna<00:01:43.560> say

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
was logging it all along I'm gonna say

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.679 
was logging it all along I'm gonna say
stop<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.299> go<00:01:45.420> through<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
stop then you have to go through a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.679 
stop then you have to go through a
little<00:01:46.250> conversion<00:01:47.250> program<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.479> just

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
little conversion program here this just

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.690 
little conversion program here this just
takes<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.170> log<00:01:49.470> data<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.040> changes<00:01:50.579> it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
takes that log data and changes it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.300 
takes that log data and changes it
around<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.540> it'll<00:01:51.780> actually<00:01:51.840> lay<00:01:52.320> over<00:01:52.530> my

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
around so it'll actually lay over my

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.780 
around so it'll actually lay over my
plot<00:01:53.610> screen<00:01:54.030> version<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.290> complete<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:56.640> I'm

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
plot screen version is complete now I'm

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.450 
plot screen version is complete now I'm
gonna<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> plotter<00:01:58.530> page<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.219> can

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
gonna go to a plotter page so you can

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.249 
gonna go to a plotter page so you can
actually<00:01:59.640> see<00:02:00.680> what<00:02:01.680> we've<00:02:01.829> got<00:02:01.860> here

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
actually see what we've got here

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.529 
actually see what we've got here
so<00:02:03.619> what<00:02:03.829> we've<00:02:03.979> got<00:02:04.219> let<00:02:04.610> me<00:02:04.729> zoom<00:02:04.909> out<00:02:05.119> just<00:02:05.420> a

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
so what we've got let me zoom out just a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.180 
so what we've got let me zoom out just a
hair<00:02:07.239> okay<00:02:08.259> here's<00:02:09.259> where<00:02:09.410> I<00:02:09.470> actually<00:02:09.739> came

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
hair okay here's where I actually came

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.940 
hair okay here's where I actually came
around<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.789> marked<00:02:11.420> those<00:02:11.540> waypoints<00:02:12.349> so

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
around and marked those waypoints so

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.250 
around and marked those waypoints so
that's<00:02:13.160> my<00:02:13.400> edge<00:02:13.550> my<00:02:13.819> structure<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:14.930> could

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
that's my edge my structure but I could

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.809 
that's my edge my structure but I could
just<00:02:15.500> go<00:02:15.620> back<00:02:15.830> let's<00:02:16.129> just<00:02:16.280> go<00:02:16.430> over<00:02:16.550> here<00:02:16.730> and

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
just go back let's just go over here and

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.650 
just go back let's just go over here and
zoom<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.239> little<00:02:17.540> at<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.989> spot<00:02:18.349> I<00:02:19.510> could<00:02:20.510> go

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
zoom in a little at that spot I could go

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.800 
zoom in a little at that spot I could go
back<00:02:20.870> here<00:02:21.290> go<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.920> my<00:02:22.099> overlay<00:02:22.489> options<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.360> I

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
back here go to my overlay options and I

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.650 
back here go to my overlay options and I
can<00:02:23.989> actually<00:02:24.230> overlay<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.430> start<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.420> see

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
can actually overlay and start to see

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.220 
can actually overlay and start to see
let's<00:02:27.110> zoom<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.590> little<00:02:28.299> that<00:02:29.299> transition

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
let's zoom in a little that transition

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.870 
let's zoom in a little that transition
and<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:31.040> can<00:02:31.250> see<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.549> there

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
and you can see it there

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.420 
and you can see it there
here's<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.239> rock<00:02:32.420> out<00:02:32.660> here<00:02:33.110> back<00:02:34.099> here

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
here's the rock out here back here

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.850 
here's the rock out here back here
here's<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:34.910> rock<00:02:35.319> transition<00:02:36.319> there's<00:02:36.620> one

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
here's the rock transition there's one

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.220 
here's the rock transition there's one
of<00:02:36.980> my<00:02:37.130> spots<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:38.180> curled<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:38.720> there's<00:02:38.959> another

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
of my spots it curled in there's another

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.839 
of my spots it curled in there's another
one<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.530> my<00:02:39.620> spot<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:40.459> actually

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
one in my spot so this is actually

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.520 
one in my spot so this is actually
laying<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.209> on<00:02:41.329> there<00:02:41.569> so<00:02:42.019> now<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.200> wouldn't

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
laying it on there so now you wouldn't

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.020 
laying it on there so now you wouldn't
even<00:02:42.590> need<00:02:42.799> those<00:02:43.010> waypoints<00:02:43.579> you<00:02:43.670> can<00:02:43.819> follow

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
even need those waypoints you can follow

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.300 
even need those waypoints you can follow
along<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.630> transition<00:02:45.319> so<00:02:45.950> there's<00:02:46.220> a

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
along that transition so there's a

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.559 
along that transition so there's a
couple<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.640> different<00:02:46.910> ways<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.060> can<00:02:47.329> keep

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
couple of different ways you can keep

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.690 
couple of different ways you can keep
track<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:48.170> transition<00:02:48.709> right<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.549> your

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
track of that transition right on your

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.400 
track of that transition right on your
screen<00:02:50.030> here<00:02:50.239> transitions<00:02:51.230> are<00:02:51.380> really

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
screen here transitions are really

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.559 
screen here transitions are really
really<00:02:51.920> important<00:02:52.400> if<00:02:52.549> you<00:02:52.670> can<00:02:52.849> find<00:02:53.150> them<00:02:53.390> a

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
really important if you can find them a

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.390 
really important if you can find them a
lot<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.049> times<00:02:54.230> you'll<00:02:54.410> find<00:02:54.440> walleyes<00:02:55.099> there

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
lot of times you'll find walleyes there

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.580 
lot of times you'll find walleyes there
with<00:02:55.940> structure<00:02:56.510> scan<00:02:56.660> you're<00:02:57.170> gonna<00:02:57.260> be<00:02:57.470> able

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
with structure scan you're gonna be able

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.250 
with structure scan you're gonna be able
to<00:02:57.739> pick<00:02:58.040> those<00:02:58.220> out<00:02:58.489> see<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.940> rock<00:02:59.180> -<00:02:59.750> sand<00:03:00.049> or

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
to pick those out see the rock - sand or

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.470 
to pick those out see the rock - sand or
rock<00:03:00.440> -<00:03:00.620> mud<00:03:00.799> transitions<00:03:01.519> with<00:03:02.060> structure

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
rock - mud transitions with structure

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.210 
rock - mud transitions with structure
mapping<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.349> can<00:03:03.380> actually<00:03:03.829> save<00:03:04.040> them<00:03:04.190> right

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
mapping you can actually save them right

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.039 
mapping you can actually save them right
on<00:03:04.519> your<00:03:04.549> plotter<00:03:04.880> screen<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:05.480> be<00:03:05.810> real
