00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 most open television chain that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.110
 never lettuce salad with roman and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.660
 is with less and dressing 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.369
 Romaine lettuce is what it is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.730
 roundish is round is a roman ok the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.680
 Orejona is the one that is long is the one that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.320
 Use for salads is for good 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.890
 different and also different all 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.730
 lettuce at least when we chew 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.680
 although its consistency is 90% water 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.399
 they have a different flavor you take the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.920
 time to chew on a romanita may 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.379
 see that it is more much more crispy than 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.420
 all the other lettuce has a lot more 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.590
 water then this does not I'm going to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.310
 do 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.250
 there is 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.990
 it's crispy it has more water and more water and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.880
 There is also a taste of Romanness 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.610
 besides that it is the best of all 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.280
 lettuce we have sangria we have 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.170
 Thermo Malian escaroles we have Boston 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 we have bars but in this case that 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.400
 use romanita because for me it is the most 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.020
 fresh which is cheaper and which 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.020
 we found so much in the market 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.770
 let's make the address this state very 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.700
 ok put mayonnaise older and it's 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.049
 present to appointment 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.719
 this greater mayonnaise cream but in cream 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.950
 and oil are already seen sticking a little 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.950
 the shore 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.330
 let's put cream not rem and this is a 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.420
 vinaigrette dressing when nothing else takes 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.790
 oil and vinegar no matter 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.710
 importing it from shallots or 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.370
 some seeds are called vinaigrettes the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.840
 aggressor have totally another other 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.550
 texture and other flavor and others 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.230
 blue cheese ingredients 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.080
 this is blue cheese if we can see it 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.620
 your blue cheese system because it has 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.460
 mushrooms ok it 's a kiss that already very 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:07.040
 mature to which they began to leave 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:09.290
 and that's how they bled are exactly like that 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.790
 they are not expensive for people who 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.340
 suddenly it is that it is very expensive not the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.900
 Blue cheese is not expensive and I have done in 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.060
