00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
can see better so that's good right I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000 
can see better so that's good right I
think<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.870> think<00:00:37.110> I'll<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.680> take<00:00:37.829> some

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
think I think I'll just take some

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.369 
think I think I'll just take some
getting<00:00:38.219> used<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.790> don't<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.420> we'll<00:00:40.350> see

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
getting used to I don't know we'll see

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.810 
getting used to I don't know we'll see
but<00:00:40.860> anyway<00:00:41.190> today's<00:00:41.640> question<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:43.820> tank

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
but anyway today's question is a tank

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.709 
but anyway today's question is a tank
heal<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.360> dps<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:46.800> i'm<00:00:47.039> assuming<00:00:47.360> which<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:48.600> is

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
heal or dps so i'm assuming which one is

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.560 
heal or dps so i'm assuming which one is
my<00:00:48.870> favorite<00:00:49.320> uh<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:50.280> switch<00:00:50.940> around<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.360> lot

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
my favorite uh I switch around a lot

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.810 
my favorite uh I switch around a lot
I've<00:00:52.440> already<00:00:52.559> told<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.920> switched<00:00:53.250> mains<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I've already told you I switched mains a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.950 
I've already told you I switched mains a
lot<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.629> switch<00:00:55.260> roles<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.710> lot<00:00:55.860> too<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.370> think

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
lot but I switch roles a lot too I think

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.869 
lot but I switch roles a lot too I think
overall<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.140> think<00:00:58.410> healing<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.699> that

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
overall I think healing is the one that

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.400 
overall I think healing is the one that
I<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.180> do<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> longest<00:01:00.930> without<00:01:01.050> getting

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
I can do for the longest without getting

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.549 
I can do for the longest without getting
tired<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.480> don't<00:01:04.470> know

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
least because it's just it's just kind

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.230 
least because it's just it's just kind
of<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.980> matter<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.280> learning<00:02:33.430> your<00:02:33.700> rotation

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
of a matter of learning your rotation

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.090 
of a matter of learning your rotation
and<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.170> course<00:02:35.200> learning<00:02:35.560> each<00:02:35.770> fight

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
and then of course learning each fight

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.729 
and then of course learning each fight
but<00:02:36.490> then<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:37.660> just<00:02:37.870> always<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.500> same

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
but then it's just always the same

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.960 
but then it's just always the same
you're<00:02:38.980> not<00:02:39.100> making<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.430> whole<00:02:39.459> lot<00:02:39.670> of

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
you're not making a whole lot of

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.330 
you're not making a whole lot of
decisions<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:40.900> just<00:02:41.230> did<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.709> do<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.069> right

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
