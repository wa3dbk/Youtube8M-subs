to a color called smoky taupe this is
from<00:00:43.150> Benjamin<00:00:43.570> Moore<00:00:43.600> I<00:00:44.200> am<00:00:44.470> right<00:00:44.680> there

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
from Benjamin Moore I am right there

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.310 
from Benjamin Moore I am right there
with<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:45.190> and<00:00:45.880> why<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:46.450> like<00:00:46.630> this<00:00:46.810> color<00:00:47.050> is

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
with you and why I like this color is

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.360 
with you and why I like this color is
because<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:48.160> is<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.700> really<00:00:49.300> nice<00:00:49.510> neutral<00:00:50.370> gray

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
because it is a really nice neutral gray

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.850 
because it is a really nice neutral gray
beige<00:00:51.730> that<00:00:52.120> won't<00:00:52.360> go<00:00:52.510> pink<00:00:52.810> and<00:00:53.350> I<00:00:53.650> think

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
beige that won't go pink and I think

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.319 
beige that won't go pink and I think
that's<00:00:54.040> really<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.579> difficulty<00:00:55.090> when<00:00:55.239> you're

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
that's really the difficulty when you're

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.760 
that's really the difficulty when you're
picking<00:00:55.480> beiges<00:00:55.960> that<00:00:56.200> they<00:00:56.290> don't<00:00:56.470> turn<00:00:56.650> out

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
picking beiges that they don't turn out

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.190 
picking beiges that they don't turn out
pinky<00:00:57.250> or<00:00:57.460> apricot<00:00:58.060> peachy<00:00:58.630> which<00:00:58.870> most

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
pinky or apricot peachy which most

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.720 
pinky or apricot peachy which most
people<00:00:59.560> don't<00:00:59.680> want<00:00:59.860> so<00:01:00.160> that's<00:01:00.280> one<00:01:00.489> of<00:01:00.610> my

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730

side of blue because if you have
hardwood<00:03:16.160> floors<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:17.000> will<00:03:17.120> look<00:03:17.300> really

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
hardwood floors it will look really

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.410 
hardwood floors it will look really
dingy<00:03:18.250> against<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> white<00:03:19.490> trim<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.300> way

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
dingy against the white trim so the way

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.810 
dingy against the white trim so the way
that<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.810> always<00:03:20.900> defer<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.740> is<00:03:21.980> Oxford<00:03:22.580> white

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
that I think that are very livable

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.090 
that I think that are very livable
that's<00:04:33.850> our<00:04:34.120> key<00:04:34.390> thing<00:04:34.800> greens<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.010> yellows

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
so in terms of greens that's what I

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.800 
so in terms of greens that's what I

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
would pick is Hancock green I think is a

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.170

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
unlivable and I think that's really

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.170 
unlivable and I think that's really
really<00:04:45.070> important

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
really important

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.500

of<00:05:06.580> yellows<00:05:06.970> that<00:05:07.270> I<00:05:07.330> think<00:05:07.630> are<00:05:07.780> very<00:05:07.810> nice

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290

of yellows that I think are very nice
keep<00:05:08.770> in<00:05:08.920> mind<00:05:09.100> that<00:05:09.250> yellow<00:05:09.610> always<00:05:10.000> gets

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
keep in mind that yellow always gets

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.880 
keep in mind that yellow always gets
brighter<00:05:10.450> when<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:10.750> gets<00:05:10.870> on<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:10.990> wall<00:05:11.260> so

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
brighter when it gets on the wall so

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.310 
brighter when it gets on the wall so
although<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.730> may<00:05:12.880> appear<00:05:12.910> all<00:05:13.510> happy<00:05:13.990> and

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
although it may appear all happy and

very<00:05:18.490> important<00:05:18.940> it's<00:05:19.570> right<00:05:19.750> it's<00:05:19.900> very

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
to getting a good color is lots of

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.490 
to getting a good color is lots of
intensity<00:05:39.700> to<00:05:39.970> the<00:05:40.060> color<00:05:40.240> but<00:05:40.510> also<00:05:40.540> lots<00:05:41.290> of

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
intensity to the color but also lots of

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.770 
intensity to the color but also lots of
tone<00:05:41.740> meaning<00:05:42.280> gray<00:05:42.550> so<00:05:43.120> that<00:05:43.150> you<00:05:43.390> can<00:05:43.600> have

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780
