00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.480
 water treatment then everything 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.730
 first the source of the water from 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.490
 tap so the tap water comes 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.740
 either rivers or basement so 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.250
 an origin either on the surface or 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.840
 underground and its waters will undergo a 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.400
 number of chord treatments 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.810
 so that she then goes into the 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.119
 distribution network and that it arrives 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.199
 up to our houses okay so we're going 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.810
 try to understand what are these 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.300
 treatments that allows us to have 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.059
 drinking water in our faucets at 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.799
 we then we have here so as 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.989
 most classic type of treatment 

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:42.370
 it is this one so first lovett 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.650
 sieved ie we will eliminate 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.350
 all particles that have a size 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.699
 greater than 1.5 mm it is a system of 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.229
 filtration in the biggest dreams 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.750
 particles with mesh screens 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.339
 which allow us to filter then 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.839
 we will do a flocculation step and 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.970
 decant then what is it 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.930
 we will add coagulant that will 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.909
 do that all the little particles 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.760
 that stays in the water will agglomerate 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:06.280
 and by settling, ie 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.470
 leaving rest his agglomerations 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.940
 deposit at the bottom of the basins of 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.410
 treatment and so we will be able to 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.120
 eliminate by decantation 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.590
 then we will do a step of 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.060
 filtration on sand is to say that 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.650
 still a few small particles 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.540
 so we'll be able to the filters is 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.740
 okay we'll use some ca for 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.040
 filter those last particles that 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.960
 stay and then we removed the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.600
 most virtually every 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.190
 particles and small myths 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.080
 particles that are in the water and so 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.030
 so we're going to do steps of 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.890
 water purification and how is it 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.620
 that we do that we're going to make an area to 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.450
 sion using another wakil 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.280
 molecules that is very oxidizing which is going 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.440
 kill all the bacteria 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.070
 anything that can be harmful to our 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.510
 health and therefore the blow here we are well 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.280
 purified that everything is then the last 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.900
 step is the chlorination step in 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.600
 this step we will put a little bit of 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.770
 chlorine not to avoid to kill the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.390
 bacteria since they have already been 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.260
 killed by phase 2 to nations but 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.120
 to prevent that between factories from 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.610
 processing the distribution network is 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.590
 our house which is development during 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.580
 of this passage here new bacteria 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.610
 so it's to prevent the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.250
 proliferation at the exit of the machined 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.140
 So here it is the stroke of step 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.650
 how water for water 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.760
 drinking at home 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.610
 obviously this oval to consume we go 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.990
 drink it but we will use it to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.970
 to make a used in China had 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.730
 and so that's what will happen 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.590
 to pass is that we will have water that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.660
 go out and we'll go we'll talk about 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.530
 used at the exit of our home is this 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.320
 we will speak in the third part 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.240
 sewage treatment 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.980
 so here we have our house the 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.510
 outflow of wastewater here is so 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.880
 again we'll have to deal with 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.320
 this water these sewage will undergo a 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.540
 treatment then first treatment 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.540
 screening is a step that 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.400
 looks like the stage of your face of everything 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.840
 on time so the screening used 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.610
 grids that will once again 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.050
 allow to filter the largest 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.600
 particles that are in the wastewater 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.870
 and keith that come from our homes 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.250
 then there is the step of grit removal and 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.930
 of degreasing so we will use a 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.100
 degreaser degreaser and so what is it 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.620
 what will happen is a pool of 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.239
 decantation or fats are going 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.820
 go back to the surface like when 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.110
 mix of oil and water the game of 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.630
 density makes that the oil stays in 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.299
 surface and so again by 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.190
 settling the solid particles are going 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.170
 to sink to the bottom and so suddenly we go 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.830
 recover those sands that are who are 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.110
 at the bottom of the basin 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.360
 we will recover this water that has been 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.310
 to degrease shortbreads and so we go 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.820
 this water arrives in the basin 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.739
 ventilation 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.299
 so in this aeration tank we have 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.890
 added bacteria and these bacteria 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.420
 will consume all the materials 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.190
 organic substances that remain in the waters 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.620
 used to say that here it is a little 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.030
 bacteria to work aerobically 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.010
 using the air and so they go 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.209
 in quotation marks digest all the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.600
 organic molecules that are at 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.070
 interior 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.680
 and this will form what are called 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.440
 Active Cebu active sludge are going to be 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.709
 removed from this aeration tank and therefore 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.239
 are going to be treated the bacteria that 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.400
 are here are going to digest the false the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.620
 phosphates all all 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.329
 particles with nitrogen etc. and so 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.820
 suddenly this treatment of these beautiful 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.260
 active ingredients contain phosphorus and 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.690
 the nitrogen will be able to be for example 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.210
 use 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.310
 in agriculture as a good fertilizer and 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.470
 so once we have digested 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.010
 in quotation marks all these materials 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.930
 organic 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.790
 we are going to use a final pool 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.310
 who the clarifier and that helps 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.930
 separate the water that is clear here from 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.250
 gold sludge some of that mud we're going 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.380
 to reinject them into the basin 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.160
 aeration and so suddenly we have a water 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.110
 which is purified but not done 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.750
 at that time drinking okay we got 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.120
 just eliminated treat this purified water 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.960
 she is not drinking yet they do not 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.580
 do not meet the criteria for 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.770
 potability and so suddenly this dawn 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.640
 is transferred to the rivers 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.100
 rivers etc 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.180
 ha there are so many steps 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.250
 a lot of vocabulary words 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.130
 usually we give you back india and 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.780
 in bac subjects a phase of 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.550
 purification a phase of treatment etc. 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.200
 but it's up to you to understand and 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.220
 to be able to justify with your 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.190
 knowledge of scientific culture 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.990
 your general culture the different 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.590
 things that are related to this story 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.590
 water treatment
