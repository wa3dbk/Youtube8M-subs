 dull eyes are not confident state of mind 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.110
 and shaky mind because of long 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.300
 nights without sleep 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.920
 something like we feel when 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.980
 in contact with the work of Howard 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.619
 phillips lovecraft horrors about 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.140
 will come it got into the realm of video games 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.779
 let's take a closer look at the creepy 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.689
 creatures of madness and tension in such 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.780
 games like dark age must san lasse 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.340
 and bloodborne games that are impossible 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.770
 separate from the work of the great 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.440
 american lovecraft writer 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.890
 words which came only after 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.890
 his death 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.140
 before reviewing these games i would like to 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.770
 mention the concept of lovecraft pskov 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.230
 horror 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.720
 his work presented the world to readers 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.420
 where madness is in every detail and 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.610
 any aspect of his character fiction 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.220
 lovecraft often walked a fine line 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.260
 between sanity and total loss 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.510
 reasoning is always doubting during 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.970
 time space and humanity 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.710
 after meeting indescribable creatures 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.710
 and solve my terrible secrets 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.110
 so we face the question of how 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.080
 games bloodborne stretched and some sort 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.659

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.860
 pskov horror genre 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.210
 At the basic level, all the same games are noticeable 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.580
 different stretched and adventure 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.340
 player challenge game 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.870

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.600
 bloodborne creatures accepts a respected 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.820

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.450
 the most important thing in these three games 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.450
 it's crazy as a game mechanic 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.760
 between a huge number of dark lines 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.220
 storytelling and resource management 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.040

 mechanics is one of the most 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.060
 interesting elements of the game throughout 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.520

 reason 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:00.740
 It is obvious that these three games despite their

 differences share similar mechanics 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.129
