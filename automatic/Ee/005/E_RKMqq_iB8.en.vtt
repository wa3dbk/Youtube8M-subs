00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.020 

there's<00:01:08.190> a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:08.580> blue<00:01:08.880> plane<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.880> we

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
there's a little blue plane and then we

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.650 
there's a little blue plane and then we
also<00:01:12.180> need<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.900> red<00:01:13.140> plane<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.660> don't

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
also need a little red plane I don't

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.240 
also need a little red plane I don't
know<00:01:15.720> how<00:01:15.870> he<00:01:15.900> has<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.440> remote<00:01:16.740> control<00:01:17.130> that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
know how he has one remote control that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.270 
know how he has one remote control that
works<00:01:17.460> both<00:01:17.760> I<00:01:18.619> thought<00:01:19.619> you'd<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.250> have

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
works both I thought you'd have to have

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.350 
works both I thought you'd have to have
two<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:22.550> maybe<00:01:23.550> this<00:01:23.820> isn't<00:01:24.060> what

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
two for that but maybe this isn't what

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.600 
two for that but maybe this isn't what
it's<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.780> maybe<00:01:25.770> he<00:01:26.009> has<00:01:26.130> something<00:01:26.340> else

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
it's for maybe he has something else

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.550 
it's for maybe he has something else
