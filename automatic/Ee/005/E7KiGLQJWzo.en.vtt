 It is practically 70% of the work 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.000
 the second phase which is mainly the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.560
 pediatric specialties officer goes

 in 2015 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.700
 indeed practically that was 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.939
 designed for one million 500 thousand people 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.289

 587 million 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.760
 well look obviously there are things that do not 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.110
 we can detail because there are things that already 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.670
 were complaints from the public prosecutor 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.080
 he has to do his part but 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.340
 we are taking the measures 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.890
 Internal to ensure that these 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.110
 people are obviously not working 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.630
 together and we are monitoring the for 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.700
 make sure that obviously if in the end 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.170
 everything that was there was real 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.300
 denouncing that obviously does not affect 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.070
 no child not sick on the other hand 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.710

 Special physiotherapy rehabilitation 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.260
 traumatology among others is expected 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.940
 also that the hospital city has 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.980
 available to family members of 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.600

 Optical and small bookstore cafeteria 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.860
 commercial premises in order that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.440
 can care for their relatives with the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.000
 minimum possible stress one of the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.590
 most important innovations that 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.230
 unveiled was the use of 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.940
 robotic surgeries that currently do not 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.100
 performed in any hospital center 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.050
 of the country so this new complex 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.210

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.110
