actually interestingly enough I like DC
over<00:01:42.060> Marvel<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.890> ironically<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:45.079> of

over Marvel be ironically because of

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.319 
over Marvel be ironically because of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
what Marvel claims to have which is

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.300 
what Marvel claims to have which is
relatable<00:01:48.899> characters<00:01:49.380> Marvel<00:01:50.040> claims<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
relatable characters Marvel claims to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.819 
relatable characters Marvel claims to
have<00:01:50.369> relatable<00:01:50.759> characters<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.649> find<00:01:52.649> I

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
have relatable characters but I find I

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.179 
have relatable characters but I find I
relate<00:01:53.130> much<00:01:53.430> more<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.850> DC<00:01:54.149> characters<00:01:55.189> not

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
relate much more to DC characters not

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.910 
relate much more to DC characters not
Batman<00:01:57.110> although<00:01:58.110> he's<00:01:58.290> awesome<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.770> that's

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
Batman although he's awesome and that's

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
Batman although he's awesome and that's
probably<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> large<00:01:59.520> part<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
probably a large part of it is the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.870 
probably a large part of it is the
Batman<00:02:01.049> universe<00:02:01.259> which<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.219> kind<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.820> like

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
Batman universe which is kind of like

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.130 
Batman universe which is kind of like
the<00:02:03.090> x-men<00:02:03.329> universe<00:02:03.479> where<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:03.960> kind<00:02:04.110> of

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the x-men universe where it's kind of

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.330 
the x-men universe where it's kind of

does<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.739> on<00:04:20.519> top<00:04:20.760> of<00:04:20.789> that<00:04:21.060> they<00:04:21.269> have<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.840> much

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
does and on top of that they have a much

better variety of female characters
although<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.680> think<00:04:25.830> Marvel's<00:04:26.279> got<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.909> more

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
although I think Marvel's got the more

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.470 
although I think Marvel's got the more
variety

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
variety

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.990 
variety
and<00:04:27.810> more<00:04:28.020> black<00:04:28.290> characters<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.340> know

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000

whatever<00:04:30.740> but<00:04:34.790> DC<00:04:35.790> justjust<00:04:36.180> on<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.540> whole<00:04:36.690> I

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
whatever but DC justjust on the whole I

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.680 
whatever but DC justjust on the whole I
think<00:04:36.900> DC<00:04:37.800> is<00:04:37.920> just<00:04:38.160> uh<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.300> universe

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
think DC is just uh and the universe

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.520 
think DC is just uh and the universe
itself<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:40.470> like<00:04:40.890> because<00:04:41.510> it<00:04:42.510> knows<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:43.110> can't

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530

take itself seriously like it can tell
serious<00:04:46.440> stories<00:04:47.120> but<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.270> still<00:04:48.660> understands

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
serious stories but it still understands
