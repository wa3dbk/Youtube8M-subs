00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.740
 and now 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.080
 hello in this tutorial I'll teach you to 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.450
 make a good night how are you doing 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.250
 they are recycled and the best part is that 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.500
 we use rolls of toilet paper that 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.210
 surely we have in our homes 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.740
 [Music] 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.040
 for this tutorial we are going to occupy two 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.610
 rolls of toilet paper like these one 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.770
 ruler 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.260
 a pencil or a marker 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.540
 scissors 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.140
 diamond of red color and green color 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.510
 I resist white and also silicone 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.580
 liquid newspaper paper to cover 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.890
 our area of work and why not a 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.650
 Brush 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.780
 avoid bad 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.720
 let's take the two rolls of paper 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.550
 well leave one side this what we're going 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.930
 to do is going to be crush it 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.830
 do not forget to mark very well the 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.150
 folds of the top and bottom 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.020
 we do the same for the other roll that 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.270
 we have been left in total we must have 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.040
 this leaves this aside and takes one of 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.130
 them to start at the top 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.400
 let's make marks every 1.5 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.400
 centimeters 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.850
 we do the same for the bottom 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.480
 and we join each segment with the line 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.030
 straight 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.340
 we should have this then we are going to 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.590
 cut on the lines 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.960
 you must then have six figures 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.820
 but here I have another six in total 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.250
 12 because I 'm already in front of the other 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.439
 roll for us the video is so long 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.819
 let's take these six of them that 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.429
 you have chosen are the ones that we are going to use 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.289
 to make Christmas Eve is to say the 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.450
 petals and they will go red 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.819
 for this I recommend you go 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.100
 discovering your work area then 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.170
 let's spread the glue around 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.479
 the whole figure 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:59.880
 [Music] 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.340
 then we frost with diamond the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.390
 objective of this is that the figure is 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.400
 totally covered by the diamond 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.369
 [Music] 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.810
 and we must have this for the part of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.410
 inside we are going to do the same 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.020
 procedure we are going to bathe it totally 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.630
 of glue and then frost we go with 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.210
 the diamond 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.910
 the figure must be completely like this 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.800
 covered by the glitter we do the same 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.680
 for the other five figures that have 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.350
 left 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.780
 [Music] 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.210
 and ready must have all this and 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.880
 you must have the six figures 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.830
 Frosty and totally covered good 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.240
 let's set aside the side ones and we're going to 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.980
 repeat the new procedure for 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.960
 the other six figures only that in this 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.000
 occasion they will be green but 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.500
 here as we are so fast I already 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.840
 forward to the cells to not be the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.400
 video as long and as I tell you is the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.460
 same procedure only that in this 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.580
 occasion is green since the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.440
 have good let's leave them aside 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.900
 let's work with the red ones and to 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.220
 we're going to take three of these are the 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.000
 that we are going to use to form the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.440
 poinsettia takes a leaf and in one of its 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.960
 sides with glue 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.420
 take another sheet and paste the next to the 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.580
 previous 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.650
 the objective of this is that the figures 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.290
 that give the best aligned possible 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.090
 because we will be very useful to put 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.190
 glue next to the previous figure 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.519
 and the other sheet that we have left 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.519
 we stick 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.590
 remember to keep with a lot of pressure to 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.080
 that dries much better we should 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.610
 of having this as a result we 're going to 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.320
 put aside for a moment and 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.090
 we will repeat this procedure for 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.090
 three other sheets that we are missing 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.400
 it should be like that in halves 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.980
 leave them aside now let's work 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.660
 with the green ones for this we are going to 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.900
 take 3 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.180
 yes 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.159
 and we are going to accommodate the sheets of this 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.260
 how I'm accommodating them here 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:11.319
 in the video this is how they should be 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.079
 then taking this into account take a 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.790
 sheet flattens the very well of the part 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.910
 lower and at one end with 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.500
 glue takes the other sheet and sticks to the 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.110
 side of the previous 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.760
 as for the petals with a lot 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.830
 Pressure 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.870
 the last page that we have left 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.190
 to plan the very well from a few ends 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.190
 because we want us 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.740
 no evil thinking clear really good we go 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.780
 to see where intersections are made in 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.490
 this case are done here and taking this 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.270
 in account we put glue on these 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.270
 intersections 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.990
 and we paste it right in the middle of our 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.390
 main figure and we should stay 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.890
 something like that leaves this side and we do what 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.270
 same for the other three that have 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.459
 left over 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.459
 [Music] 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.610
 when giving 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.520
 now since we have all these parts 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.680
 made we can put together our poinsettia 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.289
 we start with the red ones so they take 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.330
 and together we will see them as 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.300
 that the previous time where the 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.069
 intersections good in this case my 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.750
 intersections are going to be done in these 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.330
 areas 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.960
 [Music] 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.440
 all right 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.740
 there we are going to put a lot of glue because 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.479
 no and we adhere to the other figure to 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.300
 this step we can put a lot 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.699
 pressure accommodates poinsettia as more 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.050
 it will be more convenient for you as well 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.960
 say it in this case I'm going to 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.960
 accommodate like this and we're going to take the leaves 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.250
 let's stick them in this way as well 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.680
 that the previous step let's see where 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.300
 the intersections are made here 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.760
 do the intersections how can they 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.130
 give an account and taking this into account 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.639
 we put glue where those are made 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.889
 points 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.889
 and we stick it to our main figure 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.510
 we arrange very well and we do this same 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.830
 procedure for the other side 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:16.630
 [Music] 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.370
 if you want to be able to donate the center 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.169
 you can use a large spangle 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.880
 what do I do? 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.770
 and when you have dried the poinsettia ready 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.150
 you will have your good night and if you like 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.610
 you can make another color like this 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.199
 silver I did, I hope that this 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.910
 tutorial you liked it if so 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.320
 I remember to write to you and share this with 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.169

 remember to follow me on facebook so that 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.520
 be aware of everything we do and 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.180
 see you in the next video until the
