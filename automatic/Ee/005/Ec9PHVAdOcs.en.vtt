Dark Horse is a cool event where you get
to<00:00:21.190> play<00:00:21.310> as<00:00:21.370> a<00:00:21.490> cop<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:22.420> idea<00:00:23.050> here<00:00:23.290> is<00:00:23.320> that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
to play as a cop the idea here is that

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.170 
to play as a cop the idea here is that
you're<00:00:23.680> playing<00:00:23.890> a<00:00:24.070> hot<00:00:24.250> pursuit<00:00:24.610> event<00:00:24.940> you

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
you're playing a hot pursuit event you

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.850 
you're playing a hot pursuit event you
get<00:00:25.330> to<00:00:25.420> chase<00:00:25.630> down<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:25.960> racers<00:00:26.380> your

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
get to chase down the racers your

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.590 
get to chase down the racers your
objective<00:00:27.250> is<00:00:27.430> to<00:00:27.610> shut<00:00:27.880> down<00:00:27.940> the<00:00:28.420> race

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
objective is to shut down the race

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.450 
objective is to shut down the race
before<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.500> races<00:00:29.800> across<00:00:29.950> the<00:00:30.160> finish<00:00:30.340> line

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
before the races across the finish line

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.910 
before the races across the finish line
so<00:00:31.000> that<00:00:31.030> involves<00:00:31.720> you<00:00:31.810> chasing<00:00:32.739> down<00:00:32.860> the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
so that involves you chasing down the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.410 
so that involves you chasing down the
races<00:00:33.399> and<00:00:33.610> basically<00:00:34.120> smashing<00:00:34.600> it<00:00:36.420> dark

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
races and basically smashing it dark

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.410 
races and basically smashing it dark
horse<00:00:37.630> is<00:00:37.930> based<00:00:38.650> on<00:00:38.890> Los<00:00:39.250> hores<00:00:39.520> road<00:00:39.850> it's

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
horse is based on Los hores road it's

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.819 
horse is based on Los hores road it's
one<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.750> cooler<00:00:41.020> roads<00:00:41.380> in<00:00:41.560> the<00:00:41.620> game

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
one of the cooler roads in the game

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.830 
one of the cooler roads in the game
where<00:00:42.130> it's<00:00:42.700> really<00:00:42.940> sweeping<00:00:43.510> there's<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:43.690> lot

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
where it's really sweeping there's a lot

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.020 
where it's really sweeping there's a lot
of<00:00:43.870> big<00:00:44.110> bens<00:00:44.410> it's<00:00:45.100> set<00:00:45.310> at<00:00:45.340> night<00:00:45.670> as<00:00:45.880> well

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
of big bens it's set at night as well

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.850 
of big bens it's set at night as well
which<00:00:46.239> is<00:00:46.329> really<00:00:46.570> important<00:00:47.170> it<00:00:47.440> breaks<00:00:47.770> down

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
which is really important it breaks down

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.500 
which is really important it breaks down
your<00:00:48.160> visibility<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:48.880> makes<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.180> races

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
your visibility and makes the races

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.360 
your visibility and makes the races
slightly<00:00:49.899> harder<00:00:50.290> for<00:00:50.440> chase<00:00:50.680> and<00:00:50.980> you<00:00:51.220> have

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
slightly harder for chase and you have

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.549 
slightly harder for chase and you have
to<00:00:51.489> take<00:00:51.700> down<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.090> races<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:52.690> shut<00:00:53.230> down<00:00:53.380> the

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
to take down the races and shut down the

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.810 
to take down the races and shut down the
race<00:00:53.710> before<00:00:53.920> they<00:00:54.130> get<00:00:54.220> to<00:00:54.309> cross<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.610> finish

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
race before they get to cross the finish

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
really cool cop cars my favorite one is

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.479 
really cool cop cars my favorite one is
a<00:01:00.730> missing<00:01:01.270> 370z<00:01:01.899> it's<00:01:02.770> really<00:01:02.980> fast<00:01:03.250> it's

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
a missing 370z it's really fast it's

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.670 
a missing 370z it's really fast it's
really<00:01:03.760> precisely<00:01:04.479> taking<00:01:05.019> down<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.259> races

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
really precisely taking down the races

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.819 
really precisely taking down the races
and<00:01:06.430> it's<00:01:06.549> also<00:01:06.670> great<00:01:06.939> drifting<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.649> great<00:01:08.649> way

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
and it's also great drifting a great way

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.859 
and it's also great drifting a great way
of<00:01:08.859> making<00:01:09.399> Dark<00:01:09.670> Horse<00:01:09.969> easier<00:01:10.539> and<00:01:10.689> getting

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
of making Dark Horse easier and getting

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.410 
of making Dark Horse easier and getting
a<00:01:10.929> faster<00:01:11.380> time<00:01:11.619> is<00:01:12.069> to<00:01:12.280> use<00:01:12.490> boost<00:01:12.819> as<00:01:13.149> often

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
a faster time is to use boost as often

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.449 
a faster time is to use boost as often
as<00:01:13.569> possible<00:01:13.749> and<00:01:14.229> definitely<00:01:14.920> use<00:01:15.159> boost

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:15.459 
as possible and definitely use boost

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.309 
as possible and definitely use boost
when<00:01:15.579> you're<00:01:15.729> about<00:01:15.939> to<00:01:16.090> hit<00:01:16.209> the<00:01:16.359> races<00:01:16.749> be

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
precise with your hits on the races and

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.330

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
also be careful with this spike strip

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.069 
also be careful with this spike strip
