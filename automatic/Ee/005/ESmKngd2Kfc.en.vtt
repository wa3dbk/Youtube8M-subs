00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello today the months favorites in the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.330
 november are black roots 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.000
 Black Roots really black that 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:27.180
 So let's clarify it so easy to harvest 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 degree not salsify my first 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.040
 I have it early in the summer 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 Maybe june and now was exposed 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.940
 we are at the end of november and they are like that 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.059
 as they should be about two to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.370
 three inches thick and 20 inches long 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.579
 Somehow it reminds you of a carrot 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.770
 before that if they are still dirty now 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.390
 and in principle are black roots with 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.890
 related to the dandelion would be once before 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.420
 Lion numbers have visited from the meadow 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.800
 to sting will know that there is such a 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.219
 large pile root turn is seasonally 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.890
 Black Roots from october to february 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.390
 So are a perfect winter vegetables 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.280
 black in the shop buys the should 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.590
 Make sure that you dixon if possible 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.990
 when they look that way 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 because then you play wolf and of 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.979
 The root does not really stay that way 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.100
 more about so nice and maybe so 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.890
 2 cm 3 cm diameter should already have 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.579
 what are you doing now with the fun roots 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:34.020
 how to prepare the first to peel 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:38.810
 and here we come to the beginning 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.810
 Back are black in black or white 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.160
 as you can see they are beautiful 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.120
 actually knows inside 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.670
 and that's why I 've got the 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.680
 asparagus white my little man 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.900
 on my I have just the one for 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.100
 peel 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.790
 the black root has a bad one 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.480
 image 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.540
 why the bad image is to blame the 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.400
 juice the leak when the camera 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.870
 a bit closer to see percent 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.869
 like the juice from the black root 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:13.930
 If you look at him on the skin 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:19.520
 gets then sticks under 40 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.320
 unpleasant brown 1 on the skin I 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.150
 believe that this milky juice is the 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.890
 why is not black root? 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.520
 The vegetables are also very common 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.700
 plates 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.500
 because it's just uncomfortable but like that 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.150
 Often there are just a few tricks and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.690
 aware how and then everything is at all 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.840
 no problem I if the black castle in 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.070
 chile i'm just always in you 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.290
 sink full of cold water nice 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.120
 under water black-rooted old sage 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.300
 Schiller under further hand under water 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.530
 and then everything stays clean as well 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.270
 Now you use black roots 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.130
 one or the other certainly already 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.170
 similarity to asparagus noticed 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.209
 It's in the form of winter asparagus 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.670
 It can be just like asparagus spears 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.170
 prepare peel cook in water 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.360
 cook and thus the sauce of your choice 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.060
 potatoes or a piece of baguette 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.590
 serve 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.440
 So that's with books that goes with it 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.989
 herbal oil goes with sauce hollandaise 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.840
 but it is also very good fried yes 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.900
 but so who now fear gets in front 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.970
 it was once betrayed to vegetables 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.820
 there are black roots also births 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.920
 cut and pre-cooked in 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.610
 Freezer area of ​​a well sorted 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.110
 Supermarket
