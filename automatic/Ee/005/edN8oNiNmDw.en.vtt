00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.490 
a major gameplay element of cnc four is
that<00:00:25.460> you're<00:00:25.820> playing<00:00:25.970> on<00:00:26.150> a<00:00:26.180> team<00:00:26.240> it<00:00:27.200> wasn't

that you're playing on a team it wasn't

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.920 
that you're playing on a team it wasn't
long<00:00:27.560> before<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:27.950> realized<00:00:28.250> that<00:00:28.400> having<00:00:28.930> 150

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930

buildings<00:00:30.290> on<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.500> field<00:00:30.740> that<00:00:31.310> we're

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
buildings on the field that we're

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.550 
buildings on the field that we're
getting<00:00:31.520> blown<00:00:31.880> up<00:00:31.910> by<00:00:32.329> a<00:00:32.599> variety<00:00:33.230> of<00:00:33.260> players

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
getting blown up by a variety of players

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.810

and<00:00:33.680> knocking<00:00:34.190> certain<00:00:34.430> people<00:00:34.610> out<00:00:34.670> of<00:00:34.700> the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
match was going to be a problem so we

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.810 
match was going to be a problem so we
realized<00:00:36.980> we<00:00:37.190> needed<00:00:37.340> something<00:00:37.670> that<00:00:37.700> could

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
realized we needed something that could

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
model of our offensive crawler it was

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.430 
model of our offensive crawler it was
since<00:01:07.220> they<00:01:07.490> had<00:01:07.820> formula<00:01:08.450> functions<00:01:09.020> it<00:01:09.320> was

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
since they had formula functions it was

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.649 
since they had formula functions it was
important<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.010> get<00:01:10.370> them<00:01:10.730> to<00:01:11.000> transform

accurately when they were in vehicle

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.840 
accurately when they were in vehicle
mode<00:01:14.330> I<00:01:14.540> want<00:01:14.810> them<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.080> like<00:01:15.409> a<00:01:15.490> tank<00:01:16.490> that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
mode I want them to like a tank that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.300 
mode I want them to like a tank that
walked<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.479> then<00:01:18.050> when<00:01:18.290> they<00:01:18.470> turn<00:01:18.950> into<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
walked and then when they turn into the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.490 
walked and then when they turn into the
structure<00:01:19.640> mode<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.870> was<00:01:20.990> important<00:01:21.350> for<00:01:21.380> me

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
structure mode it was important for me

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.500 
structure mode it was important for me
for<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:22.310> make<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.550> look<00:01:22.640> like<00:01:22.790> a<00:01:22.850> building<00:01:23.330> in

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
for to make it look like a building in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.380 
for to make it look like a building in
that<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.750> parked<00:01:24.140> vehicle<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.920> have<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.490> make<00:01:25.880> two

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
that a parked vehicle I have to make two

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.720 
that a parked vehicle I have to make two
models<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.140> put<00:01:27.290> in<00:01:27.410> one<00:01:27.590> textures<00:01:28.040> you<00:01:28.640> know

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
models and put in one textures you know

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.770 
models and put in one textures you know
I<00:01:28.760> receive<00:01:29.300> a<00:01:29.570> concept<00:01:30.290> which<00:01:31.240> just<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.420> 3d

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
I receive a concept which just the 3d

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.830 
I receive a concept which just the 3d
models<00:01:33.290> shape<00:01:34.010> of<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.420> challenge<00:01:35.630> for

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
models shape of it so the challenge for

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.050 
models shape of it so the challenge for
me<00:01:36.080> is<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.350> come<00:01:36.920> up<00:01:37.040> with<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.400> know<00:01:37.820> the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
me is to come up with the know the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.110 
me is to come up with the know the
texture<00:01:38.480> on<00:01:38.690> it's<00:01:39.170> like<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.470> skin<00:01:39.770> on<00:01:39.980> that

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
texture on it's like the skin on that

models my task on the crawler was to

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.900 
models my task on the crawler was to
make<00:01:44.960> it<00:01:45.140> come<00:01:45.380> alive<00:01:45.410> so<00:01:46.220> it<00:01:46.520> was<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.730> little

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
make it come alive so it was a little

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.710 
make it come alive so it was a little
bit<00:01:47.090> challenging<00:01:47.630> my<00:01:48.560> task<00:01:48.890> was<00:01:49.510> to<00:01:50.510> take<00:01:50.660> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
bit challenging my task was to take the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.750 
bit challenging my task was to take the
crawler<00:01:51.170> after

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
crawler after

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.140 
crawler after
after<00:01:53.330> modeling<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.960> made<00:01:54.530> sure<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.610> could

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
after modeling it made sure it could

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.290 
after modeling it made sure it could
actually<00:01:56.630> transform<00:01:57.560> from<00:01:57.980> unit<00:01:58.520> to

satisfaction feel when they manage to
destroy<00:02:15.110> one<00:02:15.320> of<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.530> larger<00:02:15.950> units<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.840> we

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
destroy one of the larger units and we

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.570 
destroy one of the larger units and we
wanted<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.530> portray<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:19.100> unit<00:02:19.400> being

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
wanted to portray the unit being

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.580 
wanted to portray the unit being
literally<00:02:20.180> destroyed<00:02:21.220> little<00:02:22.220> by<00:02:22.370> little<00:02:22.400> and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
literally destroyed little by little and

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.620 
literally destroyed little by little and
see<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.890> inside<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.790> unit<00:02:25.820> as<00:02:26.270> you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
see the inside of the unit as you

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.440 
see the inside of the unit as you
destroy<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.670> took<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> larger<00:02:29.180> unit

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
destroy it so we took the larger unit

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.570 
destroy it so we took the larger unit
like<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> crawler<00:02:30.080> as<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.680> player<00:02:30.860> hits<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
like the crawler as the player hits the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.460 
like the crawler as the player hits the
unit<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.120> unit<00:02:32.510> gets<00:02:33.020> literally<00:02:34.150> this

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
unit the unit gets literally this

unit the unit gets literally this
eviscerated<00:02:36.470> or<00:02:36.710> destroyed<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.550> can

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
eviscerated or destroyed and you can

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.400 
eviscerated or destroyed and you can
actually<00:02:37.820> see<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.150> part<00:02:38.360> coming<00:02:38.660> off<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.140> see

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
actually see the part coming off and see

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.800

christian<00:02:51.050> brando<00:02:51.200> said<00:02:51.770> make<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.580> look

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
christian brando said make it look

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.199 
christian brando said make it look
different<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.140> said<00:02:54.260> okay<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.209> we

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
different and so I said okay and we

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.790 
different and so I said okay and we
needed<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.750> have<00:02:57.020> some<00:02:57.260> more<00:02:57.440> kind<00:02:57.709> of

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
needed to have some more kind of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.860 
needed to have some more kind of
interior<00:02:58.340> detail<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.090> explosions<00:02:59.720> on

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
interior detail to the explosions on

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.979 
interior detail to the explosions on
this<00:03:00.020> we<00:03:00.290> needed<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.680> have<00:03:01.270> sort<00:03:02.270> of<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.420> inside

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
this we needed to have sort of a inside

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.199 
this we needed to have sort of a inside
roiling<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:03.950> smoke<00:03:04.130> whereas<00:03:04.580> kind<00:03:05.150> of

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
roiling of the smoke whereas kind of

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.199 
roiling of the smoke whereas kind of
before<00:03:05.450> another<00:03:05.600> C&amp;C<00:03:06.080> games<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.850> would<00:03:08.000> see

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
before another C&amp;C games you would see

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.120 
before another C&amp;C games you would see
particle<00:03:08.840> sprites<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.200> kind<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.590> disappear

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
particle sprites just kind of disappear

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.550 
particle sprites just kind of disappear
when<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.760> particle<00:03:11.150> ended<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.019> I<00:03:12.200> wanted<00:03:12.440> to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
when the particle ended and I wanted to

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.680 
when the particle ended and I wanted to
get<00:03:12.650> some<00:03:12.950> sort<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.400> movement<00:03:13.910> in<00:03:14.030> between<00:03:14.480> the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
get some sort of movement in between the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.949 
get some sort of movement in between the
particles<00:03:15.140> birth<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.459> its<00:03:16.880> death<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
particles birth and its death the

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.199 
particles birth and its death the
crawler<00:03:18.320> itself<00:03:18.830> is<00:03:19.340> since<00:03:19.640> it's<00:03:19.790> such<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> big

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
crawler itself is since it's such a big

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.390 
crawler itself is since it's such a big
unit<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:20.959> every<00:03:21.230> time<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.560> hits<00:03:21.920> on<00:03:22.100> a<00:03:22.130> crawler

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
unit is every time it hits on a crawler

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.810 
unit is every time it hits on a crawler
system<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.360> get<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.570> difference<00:03:24.820> explosion

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
system you get a difference explosion

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.310 
system you get a difference explosion
coming<00:03:26.120> out<00:03:26.330> of<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.570> different<00:03:26.810> different

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
coming out of a different different

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.270 
coming out of a different different
debris<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.250> we'll<00:03:28.730> go<00:03:28.850> through<00:03:29.150> its<00:03:30.110> death

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
debris and we'll go through its death

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.410 
debris and we'll go through its death
state<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.459> has<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.610> hold<00:03:31.880> another<00:03:32.120> death

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
state it has a hold another death

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.270 
state it has a hold another death
animation<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.080> umberto<00:03:33.500> did<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:33.890> then<00:03:34.130> its

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
animation that umberto did and then its

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.190 
animation that umberto did and then its
final<00:03:34.730> explosion<00:03:35.120> final<00:03:35.660> death<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.050> so

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
final explosion final death and so

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.570 
final explosion final death and so
that's<00:03:36.380> that's<00:03:36.860> kind<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.250> big<00:03:37.340> deal<00:03:37.550> about

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
that's that's kind of the big deal about

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.490 
that's that's kind of the big deal about
the<00:03:37.910> crawler<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.630> crawler<00:03:38.840> functions<00:03:39.320> as

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
the crawler so the crawler functions as

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.040 
the crawler so the crawler functions as
not<00:03:40.040> only<00:03:40.280> your<00:03:40.370> base<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.910> operations<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.600> large

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
not only your base of operations a large
