00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.789
 better everyone is funky I hope 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.740
 that you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.710
 I finally find you for my second 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.720
 how tahri is also a video 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.509
 finally on black ops a gameplay 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.919
 commented we had a lot of delay by 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.660
 report to that precisely to the neck that 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.850
 had to propose to you because we 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.800
 organized on black ops precisely by 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.440
 report to the teams and reese and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.900
 ctf teams at the tournament platform 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.640
 we were going to take for 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.769
 make our matches two tournaments all that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 so a lot of organization that 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.039
 was asking a lot of time so finally 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.920
 we offer content on black ops 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.170
 I'm going to talk about a lot of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 things in this little video so the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.420
 video i'm going to talk to you about it all 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.180
 next before I forget 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.519
 so this is a 2x lg raptor gameplay in 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.949
 gd on the map newton 2025 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.110
 they play on the tipp 25 if I'm wrong 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.090
 I do not think it's quiet 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.470
 wrist and piercing bullets if I 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.869
 wrong in strict score he has 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.000
 iron and lightning workforce of ADAF 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.350
 fight game that bug excuse me he goes 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.300
 make a good score that I will tell you to 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 the end because if I forget 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.990
 I hope not to forget simply 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.630
 because in the studio mode I have not 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.250
 managed to find the scoreboard 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.509
 finally the scoreboard was not 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.310
 recorded at least in the party 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.750
 so I'm going to talk to you about the question 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.989
 main that I wanted to ask you 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.140
 dumont my opinion on something of this 

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:39.209
 game that disturbed me a bit this being 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.080
 said I love blackhawks 2-1 I really 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.670
 hooked to the gameplay 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.220
 there are a lot of things that bother me 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.410
 but in general I hooked well so 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.509
 I'm going to talk about help with aiming 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.789
 we talked a lot about it in the old 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.890
 who then but I found that on this 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.619
 black ops if not I already know the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.289
 youtuber stated it help to aim 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.209
 is really too pronounced for my taste 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.369
 in this game help to aim is 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.379
 when you do l1 your valley viewfinder 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.569
 automatically over a year and a half so 

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:08.039
 as much to tell you that your shoot will be 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.770
 more accurate ie when you when 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.150
 you shoot your balls will go 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.300
 vaude basle will say in the target that you 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.790
 so aim your shoot will be better and 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.370
 for me help to aim is a little 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.860
 abused or at least too pronounced as I 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.810
 say them for my taste so you 'll tell me if 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.150
 you also find that this help to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.570
 the aim is too pronounced or not 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.790
 I wanted to know your opinion 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.100
 try yourself even if you just 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.780
 do not have notice disable the help to the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.090
 targeted in your multiplayer options and 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.590
 you will see the change you 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.150
 feel and I'm curious about 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.250
 know your opinions precisely so there we 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.020
 can see that raptor has unlocked his 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.310
 lightning he killed three enemies with 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.160
 which is not bad laughs and all of 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.630
 even so we can say that is when 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.980
 even the newton map so that is a 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.570
 very small map so that you 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.070
 know about black ops dyed that was 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.560
 handed over to blackhawks 2 in a little bit more 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.030
 futuristic if I can say 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.950
 so that's what I wanted you 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.630
 also say so in relation to the team x 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.370
 and there are a lot of videos going 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.540
 to get content on black ops from the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.850
 zombie hour we will offer you 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.190
 with virus raptor the demos surely where 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.050
 there will be somebody who will show you the secret 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.700
 tears secret everything we can do 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.250
 on the transit map precisely I think 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.170
 that it can be nice for you 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.880
 offer you commented gameplay 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.290
 live matches on black ops 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.400
 what we can do on modern 3 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.350
 unfortunately we did not have time 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.030
 to do so here are plenty of things to 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.500
 tell you in a little video I you 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.800
 will say a lot more and our 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.570
 impressions on black ops 2 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.980
 on the next video that will be released that 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.930
 it will be a quarter of an hour or so 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.820
 on the channel so here I want 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.500
 also thank especially 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.140
 quote it is she who has the plot of 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.920
 iliad it a little more than a month that 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.120
 had claude my gameplay over premium 4 where 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.500
 I did a good part in 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.840
 domination on earth turf I the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.520
 thank you from the bottom of my heart 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.720
 allowed us to win 200 subscribers 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.860
 to have a small audience 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.760
 so thank you but thank you very much 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.290
 so a quad cf 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.790
 and so we will come to the end of the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.150
 part I reconcentrate a little on the 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.610
 gameplay 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.580
 because I forgot to talk about it 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.160
 so here we come to the end of the game 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.590
 raptor and already I think say a little 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.470
 more dikhil to zero I believe or even 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.120
 far more and I remember that his 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.360
 score so he was largely already he 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.520
 says who did it 14 0 in r &amp; d so a 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.530
 quite respectable part there was the 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.140
 lightning the stealthy aircraft so a 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.390
 good part i hope that coach f 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.620
 Lagardere has or not I think not but good 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.510
 we still hope 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.250
