00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
when making that video I realized that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.690 
when making that video I realized that
when<00:00:44.900> mists<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.290> pandaria<00:00:45.350> was<00:00:46.040> released<00:00:46.400> that

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
when mists of pandaria was released that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700 
when mists of pandaria was released that
priest<00:00:47.000> would<00:00:47.239> no<00:00:47.420> longer<00:00:47.630> be<00:00:47.810> able<00:00:48.110> to<00:00:48.410> smite

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
would still be able to do this and when

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.860

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
mind you can't do this with every single

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.510 
mind you can't do this with every single
mob<00:01:19.939> that<00:01:20.509> is<00:01:20.659> in<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.929> dungeon<00:01:21.319> you<00:01:22.159> might<00:01:22.369> be

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
mob that is in the dungeon you might be

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.940 
mob that is in the dungeon you might be
able<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.969> but<00:01:23.389> it's<00:01:23.569> definitely<00:01:23.899> not<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.709> best

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
able to but it's definitely not the best

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.859 
able to but it's definitely not the best
way<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.219> do<00:01:25.459> it<00:01:25.639> when<00:01:25.850> you're<00:01:25.969> the<00:01:26.240> healer<00:01:26.450> if

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
way to do it when you're the healer if

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.230 
way to do it when you're the healer if
your<00:01:27.259> tank<00:01:27.530> decides<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.189> pull<00:01:28.429> several<00:01:28.789> large

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
your tank decides to pull several large

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.410 
your tank decides to pull several large
groups<00:01:29.719> of<00:01:29.929> trash<00:01:30.889> mobs<00:01:31.189> then<00:01:31.909> I<00:01:31.939> wouldn't

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
groups of trash mobs then I wouldn't

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.389 
groups of trash mobs then I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:32.749> doing<00:01:33.170> this<00:01:33.560> might<00:01:33.920> healing<00:01:34.249> way

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
recommend doing this might healing way

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.889 
recommend doing this might healing way
it's<00:01:34.639> just<00:01:34.850> not<00:01:35.029> going<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:35.240> be<00:01:35.359> very<00:01:35.389> effective

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
it's just not going to be very effective

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.260 
it's just not going to be very effective
and<00:01:36.380> your<00:01:36.799> tank<00:01:37.039> is<00:01:37.159> going<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.369> be<00:01:37.490> losing<00:01:38.179> a

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
lot more health than you'll be able to

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
know what it's like for level 90 but for

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.510
