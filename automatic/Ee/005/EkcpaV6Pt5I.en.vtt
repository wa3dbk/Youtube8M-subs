00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
the right thing to do it has to do a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.440 
the right thing to do it has to do a
perception<00:01:07.280> if<00:01:07.490> you're<00:01:07.820> told<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.240> expect

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
perception if you're told to expect

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.180 
perception if you're told to expect
something<00:01:08.930> that's<00:01:09.500> what<00:01:09.680> you're<00:01:09.830> gonna<00:01:09.920> see

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
something that's what you're gonna see

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.580 
something that's what you're gonna see
so<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:10.880> have<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.120> see<00:01:11.300> beyond<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.439> one<00:01:12.560> of

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
so you have to see beyond that so one of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.530 
so you have to see beyond that so one of
the<00:01:12.710> themes<00:01:12.920> of<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.189> film<00:01:13.460> is<00:01:13.790> this<00:01:14.060> idea<00:01:14.240> of

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
the themes of the film is this idea of

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.590 
the themes of the film is this idea of
changing<00:01:15.320> perception<00:01:15.950> changing<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:17.450> way<00:01:17.570> you

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
changing perception changing the way you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.690 
changing perception changing the way you
view<00:01:17.750> other<00:01:18.140> people<00:01:18.590> other<00:01:18.860> cultures<00:01:19.369> and

view other people other cultures and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.570 
view other people other cultures and
this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
this

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.570 
this
so<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.690> know<00:01:21.810> pandora<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.740> kind<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.160> metaphor

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
so you know pandora is kind of metaphor

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.160 
so you know pandora is kind of metaphor
