00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.459
 Hello everyone for the product test of 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.650
 today a pizza of the buitoni 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.049
 precisely the mini margherita I have 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.410
 thought to take it back because you know me 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.359
 as a true Neapolitan we are lovers of the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.539
 pizza is therefore very criticoni for 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.930
 those there that obviously are not ours 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.570
 lives 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.730
 so I hope my opinion 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.380
 cashing to be useful 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 I remind you that I have already done one 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.809
 review for another brand of one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.180
 normal size pizza you find here 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.650
 but as always also in the info box and today 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.580
 instead we will go to see this here of the 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.510
 buitoni 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.940
 first the box contains 4x 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.140
 set after we go to see the size 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.580
 and let's read some ingredients 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.180
 then I expect he has done can 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.180
 to find 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:03.030
 here they are flour ingredients 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.939
 wheat mozzarella with tomato sauce 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.450
 water right sunflower oil of beer 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.540
 salt sugar olive oil and oregano 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.240
 so actually good ingredients 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.890
 because there is absolutely nothing to 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.560
 strange and above all the oils are 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.150
 specified is teaching me a lot 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.420
 of things thanks to everyone how many warriors it is 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.710
 always write to me all 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.610
 ingredients that I do not know vision of 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.370
 great help 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.340
 let's start to open it then inside 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.630
 this is how our box looks like 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.030
 the 7 mini pitches that are really mini 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.100
 I have to say how you see they enter the palm 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.130
 of a hand but let's say for one 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.970
 snack can be good for the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.490
 cooking 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.090
 then we have cooking with 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.850
 the toaster who bets that in 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.610
 you have so many from the mother's outfit 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.649
 and maybe never even used me like that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.630
 in fact I wanted to try it but I found out 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.579
 that not only was not threatened but 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.039
 does not work 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.979
 after the age of thirty marriage seems 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.190
 which also functions like the one a 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.830
 domenico has therefore we are going to try 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.110
 baked for baking 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.510
 if the pizza already thawed here does not 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.780
 branch out thaw it takes four 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.489
 minutes while cooking with pizza 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.760
 frozen in my case 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:30.269
 6 7 minutes are enough while if by chance the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.799
 your function toaster is enough 5 6 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.080
 with the toaster 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.390
 now let's go and find her and then see 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.250
 a little bit all the different aspects 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.799
 after seven minutes actually the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.769
 pizza is ready then first of all 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.860
 we talk to him little aspect 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:50.010
 I show and show killed by what 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.849
 which for the true Neapolitan pizza is not 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.790
 compatible 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.620
 because it should be softer though 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.690
 I realize it's still more than pizza 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.850
 we're talking about focaccia that 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.150
 that I don't like so much about looks and 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.880
 which is a little dry I would have preferred 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.030
 with a little more flavored then for 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.130
 what concerns the aspect I would give a 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.090
 six and a half for what concerns the 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.170
 quality price we bought the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.940
 product 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.269
 I at least found it at this price 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.910
 ie at 3 euros with 3 euros we have 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.459
 four small pizzas if I have to do the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.109
 compare with a pizza bought for 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.670
 road to be sold in Naples 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.040
 even small pizzas a little more 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.459
 great of these to eat from here 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.680
 I generally take the hood off 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.420
 around one euro a euro and fifty 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.170
 so more or less we say that here at least 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.739
 the advantage of having it at home though 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.970
 compared to making it at home of course 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.430
 we will certainly save by making it into 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.860
 home however we know well that these are 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.420
 products for which the 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.459
 quality that if this sense but precisely 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.670
 let's say more than anything else between going the ad 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.220
 buy and buy this one instead 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.739
 frozen so keep it always ready 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.780
 I would say a similar merit more or less like 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.849
 tool for the one purchased there for 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.310
 road also because among other things not only 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.950
 prices are in other regions therefore 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.280
 I would give enough 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.669
 now let's go and see the taste 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:32.120
 I go to taste it, I open it a little 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:32.660
 exponent of the favor then has a good 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.000
 flavor 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.310
 but there is the oregano I am never 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.880
 happy when I find the oregano in the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.910
 daisy 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.950
 however apart from the oregano has a good 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.780
 taste despite I found it 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.450
 looking like there wasn't enough 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.870
 instead seasoning is favored 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.789
 I would give a seven and a half 8 for the flavor 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.650
 for what concerns time of 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:03.169
 fast preparation so I would give a 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.080
 10 for these products here the time of 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.850
 preparation and always very fast then 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.350
 my general vote for this product 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.270
 it's an 8 I 'm glad maybe I would 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.780
 preferred that it was a little bit little 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.710
 certainly cheaper is a vote not given 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.710
 to operate 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.090
 the classic Neapolitan pizza because 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.840
 let's talk about another kind of product 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.180
 just hope this review by 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.430
 behold a kiss to all and there 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.720
 see you at the next video where of 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.720
 hello recipe hello
