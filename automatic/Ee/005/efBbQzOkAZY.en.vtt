00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.799
 kim on youtube welcome to another floor 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.420
 more of world clash of lance in this 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.090
 chance we will see two types of attacks 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.390
 different in which the composition 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.160
 of these attacks varies a little bit in what 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.750
 that would be the troops used are given 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.060
 account in this case they would only be barbarians 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.430
 archers first the barbarians are launched 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.050
 that would be like mini golems bapro those 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.980
 would be the protection of the archers that 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.650
 would ultimately be those who are going 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.530
 Roberto and they will try to take the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.660
 maximum amount of resources possible in 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.309
 this government case will break and a little bit 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.850
 the wall and also take the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.370
 warehouses because there's a lot 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 accumulated resource of 650,000 out there more 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.739
 or less in those stores good too 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.690
 accompanied by two spells for each 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.399
 side four ray spells that stops 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.469
 many back does not bring much account but 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.420
 in this case yes because the most that 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:10.180
 you can use there they were like to know 412 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.130
 120,000 of elixir more or less spent and 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.830
 in the end it ended up winning 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.920
 I do not know how 150 almost 200,000 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.420
 the success in gold that were 400 thousand of 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.250
 total gain then it 's pretty 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.520
 good that attack 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.070
 in the sense of theft they have led 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.320
 here we also have the attack of 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.200
 the patricians and well he did not get it 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.240
 leave there one day and nothing was nothing 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.020
 wrong the attack really a composition 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.130
 quite different 14 giants 11 break 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.100
 some and 106 archers in account is 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.440
 quite different in this case if it's 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.700
 to giants instead of barbarians and in that 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.340
 kind of very good villages if they are given 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.960
 realize that it is much easier to steal it 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.060
 this way position taken barbarians 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.759
 would have cost a little more would have to 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.200
 break more buildings than normal with 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.660
 the archers to be able to enter in good 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.790
 way to the village and at the end of accounts 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.730
 you could not have taken everything 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.800
 the resource 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.720
 that the parties if they could 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.990
 bring good here also uses 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.670
 castle uses a nation spell 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.180
 for the giants and the good thing that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.670
 the king is really going to help here 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.470
 but well, if it helps you in 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.570
 what would be the destruction also 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.640
 can do that is going to serve as a 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.850
 a tank for what would be the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.440
 archers that in the end if you 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.720
 they find most these attacks of 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.300
 farming the archer that says is the one that 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.190
 end up carrying the resource or in 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.290
 some cases like in this the magicians 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.060
 against the magicians in the castle more than 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.930
 all good sometimes are those that 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.710
 they determine what I know when you get 40 50 thousand 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.250
 up to 100,000 gold or elixir or I do not know 23 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.870
 a thousand of dark liquid in a single blow 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.450
 why why not have a little more 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.550
 of damage to the magician than an archer 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.400
 and then a little bit too hard 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.170
 depending on the defense that is attacking 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.230
 it is true these these attacks are before 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.060
 of the update but good as well with 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.040
 the change that there was now with the tower 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.780
 since they were good, there was going to be a 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.340
 bit more complicated really was 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.290
 a little bit more complicated to steal because 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.680
 the agency tower that was killing more 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.990
 quick the archers but well there one 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.310
 have to make do to see how 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.490
 arrogance in mind the attack quite 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.500
 well done 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.180
 in the case of the previous attack because no 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.160
 it was just surrounding the village you lost 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.810
 you have to really know in those guys 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.580
 of attacks the moment indicated for 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.520
 jump the troops and the amount of 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.520
 troops 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.010
 let's say put at the time of attacking 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.720
 because that will depend on if you go to 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.940
 be a good result because if you spend 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.150
 all your troops hit and that takes 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.000
 some giant bomb some traps for 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.310
 there a mortar can finish your 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.660
 troops and for good that amount 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.820
 expresses that there were the two examples of 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.500
 family attacks I hope you have 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.700
 served maybe at some point I can 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.590
 serve one of these two examples 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.850
 so you can steal much more 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.680
 remember that larger in description 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.320
