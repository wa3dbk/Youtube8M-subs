00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello dear friends with you on 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.160
 Communication Oleg Pavlecov 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.429
 and today we'll talk about why 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.950
 generally closed the company whistled and what 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.400
 we are waiting for a mysterious company 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.109
 fireflight or translated from English 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.390
 what do fireflies mean 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.369
 and dear friends means a tip in my 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.439
 anyway under positive you are now 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.460
 understand why there are lots of moments 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.250
 which i like so much 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.700
 promised swiss management 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.000
 halley 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.760
 agee when they are literally a year ago 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.149
 they promised that there would be air travel that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.430
 will be increased by hotel and so on 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.520
 and the like but there will also be events 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.340
 events are connected here and this 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.100
 definitely some kind of furor 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.800
 Do you guys understand what you just created? 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 management of the swiss scheme 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.910
 they implemented within the company power 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.330
 life 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.369
 but it's just unthinkable yes that is y 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.650
 who have these questions in terms of name 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.170
 then I think that here is a personal matter simply 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.450
 habits that is powerless yes it seemed 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.210
 would be so handsome called from vacation 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.909
 rest in Swiss and now we have files 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.830
 I think that you really know the case 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.840
 habits that is about the brand can 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.970
 talk a lot yes there was nobody going 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.310
 thinks when there is already about the fact that 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.710
 this refueling called shell seemed 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 in general it is not a topic in principle punishment 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.920
 gun even refueling but in different brands 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.020
 and there is really very 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.430
 strange with strange names they 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.110
 popular in all the cracks 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.299
 but in reality no one 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.149
 thinking about translating waiting 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.700
 the meaning of their words more precisely their names 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.920
 here let's say everything is clear and understandable 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.840
 what are these fireflies when we are going 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.460
 together we will really bring in the light and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.530
 good world and that with regards to money yes that is 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.360
 why how did the company decide 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.500
 do rebranding because we go out 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.600
 on an international background seriously 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.300
 so this is the american market and check 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.850
 yes if your city comes in some 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.920
 it is a Swiss company yes it is 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.540
 there will be comfortable days for each person 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.670
 with does not seem like a person wants 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.620
 collaborate or even attract him 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.440
 just some kind of swiss online 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.020
 tour operator more no no 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.140
 There is such a global company 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.330
 suffered yes let in his name homeland 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.690
 his education will say the same 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.350
 no longer called american apple 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.239
 the american blockade is called emptiness 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.390
 then what about the money within 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.489
 campaigns for friends I think that we have 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.130
 just waiting for something unthinkable 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.110
 incredible 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:58.030
 what is the reason but you imagine 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.540
 now it turns out formed more precisely 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.940
 already available air ticket due 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.540
 this naturally increases 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.330
 turnover and 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.330
 much increase I think turnover 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.870
 will increase at least twice a 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.480
 because where fly very often for 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.880
 many flight is just necessary 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.840
 the second thing thing is these events and 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.510
 activity 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.160
 now you are much where already in the camp 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.100
 within swiss or started 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.260
 earn decent money there and in 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.720
 other companies earn and they will 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.799
 interesting to buy with discounts through 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.880
 the company whistled 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.739
 not just turn already but specifically tickets 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.750
 at some events of this kind 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.090
 serious scale that is possible 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.549
 such a stupid gala concert or will it be 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.260
 going to the museum i think with museums in general 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.400
 problems will not seem to me with all 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.980
 museums and theaters 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.320
 the company agree but in general it is not 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.870
 our problems are not our questions to us 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.420
 I can only wait, but I believe that 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.260
 that the company sells the most such 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.019
 popular world's coolest museums 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.750
 I will say that people dream of posting 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.829
 to see what is stored in them 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.750
 what history they have kept 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.970
 they will come through our resource 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.560
 plus imagine yes that's four 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.310
 World Cup will be in Russia 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.270
 I am sure that such an event is also 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.110
 be sold through 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.360
 firefly resource 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.820
 and besides that there are lots of others 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.860
 events that occur in 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.530
 including sports and some 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.020
 entertaining I think that through 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.940
 fireflight through the resource poet you will 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.419
 these all activities available are possible 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.250
 these are some kind of hangouts there white nights 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.919
 it happens in Petersburg 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.729
 there is a trance stage some but such 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.280
 Fijian mega goal of appearances but also 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.610
 some world-class stars me too 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.500
 I think will be available through our online 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.040
 tour operator that is, imagine in essence 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.530
 things we expand we get bigger 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.479
 by the way I wanted to notice for those who are not 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.100
 knows that through the resource who is who yet 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.930
 He does not understand to more people 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.050
 become part of the resources arb air 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.460
 flight within this online 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.440
 tour operator is no longer just a tour operator 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.669
 from apple integrated approach will be bo-bo 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.979
 not that cheaper for us are becoming 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:28.310
 Company services including 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.470
 flights and travel Well friends 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.110
