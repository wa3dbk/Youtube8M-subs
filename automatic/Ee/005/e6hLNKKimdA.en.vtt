00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
I like the voice Victoria is the one

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.539 
I like the voice Victoria is the one
that<00:01:33.960> I've<00:01:34.079> always<00:01:34.259> used<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.860> people

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that I've always used but that people

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.310 
that I've always used but that people
can<00:01:35.670> use<00:01:35.820> every<00:01:36.000> once<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.840> Victoria

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
can use every once I like Victoria

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140

because a female voice is actually
easier<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> follow<00:01:39.930> than<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.259> male<00:01:40.470> voice<00:01:40.650> it's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
easier to follow than a male voice it's
at<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.100> higher<00:01:41.340> frequency<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.899> can

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
at a higher frequency so you can you can

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.230 
at a higher frequency so you can you can
follow<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> then<00:01:44.579> I'm<00:01:44.670> gonna<00:01:44.820> do<00:01:45.090> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
follow that and then I'm gonna do this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.819 
follow that and then I'm gonna do this

yeah<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.989> let's<00:03:22.800> do<00:03:22.950> one<00:03:23.160> more<00:03:23.190> thing<00:03:23.370> which<00:03:23.730> is

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
yeah so let's do one more thing which is

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.400 
yeah so let's do one more thing which is
I'm<00:03:23.940> going<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.120> modify<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.540> speed<00:03:24.870> now<00:03:25.350> so

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
I'm going to modify the speed now so

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.920 
I'm going to modify the speed now so
that<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.830> could<00:03:25.950> go<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.100> little<00:03:26.310> bit<00:03:26.520> faster<00:03:27.030> in

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
that you could go a little bit faster in

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.490 
that you could go a little bit faster in
this<00:03:28.200> scenario<00:03:29.630> we'll<00:03:30.630> go<00:03:30.750> into<00:03:31.050> system

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
this scenario we'll go into system

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.530 
this scenario we'll go into system
preferences<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.580> can<00:03:32.730> go<00:03:32.850> just<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.270> little

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
preferences and you can go just a little

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.360 
preferences and you can go just a little
bit<00:03:33.660> faster<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.200> now<00:03:34.530> it'll<00:03:34.830> sound<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.070> this

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
bit faster so now it'll sound like this

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.190 
bit faster so now it'll sound like this
isn't<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.090> nice<00:03:36.239> do<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.900> computer

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
that will talk to you just a little

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.300 
that will talk to you just a little
faster<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.570> then<00:03:40.110> if<00:03:40.380> we<00:03:40.560> did<00:03:40.709> another<00:03:40.920> one<00:03:41.040> so

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
faster and then if we did another one so

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.920 
faster and then if we did another one so
