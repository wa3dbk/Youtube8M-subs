00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello everyone today i am telling 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.350
 how 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.890
 bred its ears flyer apical 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.320
 cuttings 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.110
 I already tried to propagate the chef 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.289
 leaves it is useless and they are not 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.830
 take root not possession in the land of the end 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.490
 winter- based chef I cut off the top of my head 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.980
 here you can see the stump remained here 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.840
 cutting 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.300
 only today transplanted him into the ground before 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.579
 This well, I stood for two months in the water 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.829
 roots per se did not give a cutting 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.200
 there are just white bumps 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.570
 the thing is, when I cut this 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.090
 I cut the cutting and he has leaves 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.539
 left only a few on top and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.360
 these leaflets of old age with plants 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.520
 I began to release and new leaves all the power 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.260
 It took it to the Russian but Steve 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.510
 the roots didn't grow 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.590
 then and only break it available 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.710
 leaves and roots began to be outlined 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.079
 little by little 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.210
 and then the process turned back again 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.110
 that is, the plants are now visible 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 began to produce new leaflets lateral 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.520
 shoots went and I decided that two months 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.040
 this is already a chur 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.340
 stop torturing him and myself and decided this 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.950
 stalk plant in the ground I am of course very 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.860
 I hope that he will take root and will grow 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.640
 and as for the plant itself 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.700
 plants 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.140
 it is very clear that the chefs 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.439
 grow new shoots and it does not 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.409
 leaves on the place where the leaves grew 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.810
 it grows cuttings that is, they 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.320
 they will also grow over time 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.619
 will root and it will be new 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.259
 plant chefler 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.250
 I want to say that you should not be afraid to do 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.490
 pruning 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.549
 sheflera she from this will 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.369
 fluffy bushy and received cuttings 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.420
 it will be possible to root and today 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.890
 all that concerns reproduction 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.890
 lera all bye
