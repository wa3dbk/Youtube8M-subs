 this is how to create a company that will depend on the success of 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.150
 the Greek debt they hold

 lunch and dinner choose light meals put a 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.620
 very little starchy foods inside play a lot on you the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.780
 fruits and vegetables salads but preparations learn to cook 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.280

 halftime 10-9 tab to 1 because in one case a wind too favorable to the concerts 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.700
 that's enough 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.880
 new homes and reduce their speed at the hall 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.880
 the salad automatic control room 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.950
 apples from pears and mandarins 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.040
 veteran of fruits and green vegetables had found things like 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.040
 that and salads and snowshoe seeds 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.390
 after all this would be the setting in agricultural matter 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.200
 these consolidated accounts more dictated they are called 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.310
 and 10h finely and finely 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.430
 when you take vegetables he wanted to shine a little more than what 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.610
 you would have done that usual and like that cut them into small 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.320
 parts 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.510
 when you take fruit wanted to stick award winning balls and if 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.780
 bad that it does not run out of steam 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.940
 you choose other types of preparation like the priests who are 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.540
 especially great for them spring because it's eaten cold 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.570
 current broths how much fruit compotes that are eaten cold c 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 here is my expert opinion fortis spectator 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.740
 canesta have arrived at baba i adore holding 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.410
 the artichoke and preserves the resource 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.580
 it's the only job 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.090
 finally small changes 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.020
 before arriving 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.020
 output will be made in the dunes which is considered a reliable product 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.930
 ecological reasons is that the word artichokes means that producers 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.170
 of heat and so this part of 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.759
 aphrodisiac foods 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.470
 his career 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.370
 however after this setback puts a great show to the party starts for me 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.290
 I crossed it 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.829
 the meeting is mine 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.590
 difficulties in matters everyone is entitled to retirement about the fed 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.469
 ben bernanke 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.829
 born at the table for the builder in montreal quebec 4% 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.499
 the colorful procession and resell them 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.569
 I'm lucky to have gurus who gives silly advice 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.569
 dismissing all hearings as his door with cider vinegar 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.320
 yes wasabi actually never had any oat bran stuff things 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.720
 like that but I did not have any substance that's features 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.569
 so powerful for her alone changing things we are 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.559
 Okay 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:56.249
 this woman when she drinks lemon she plays on the side if the product and 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.569
 astringent more hurry than it gives the imagination of a boost but 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.050
 contrary to what the lemon thinks 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.300
 and when 8th category 2 for vitamin C it is necessary to eat 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.850
 blackcurrant limit for example but all these products are products 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.350
 with high imaginary content like ginger for sexuality% like the 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.990
 honey for sore throat 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.820
 like echo runners when one is sick only gomes the carrot juice for 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.150
 children who have diarrhea never worked 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.370
 but that's part of the imaginary thought as long as it does not hurt 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.090
 to people moaning but are the ones who have invested in this thought for the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.650
 practicing and from the moment it started dangerous and for him to 6 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.080
 years a little bit more we have to stop finding other systems 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.779
 ask for your most beautiful ovation 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.239
 as for the group we have everything wrong now if you can not tell me 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.379
 that bathers do not walk 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.459
 the truth about home improvement products 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.799
 it's actually how to do it there are the so-called natural products there are the 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.150
 products that are bought in pharmacy 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.260
 the products of honor works for two reasons either by transfer of securities 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.500
 lasting 6 months either because drinking a lot led to 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.470
 the elimination of what we know how to regulate our body you are our 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.809
 body it is expected that the need for water against thirst 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.879

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.419
 you are going to eat sahel and it happened the other in the fabrics look 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.040
 always the rates of the one in the product 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.260
 because the more you have a product dirtyh and then he holds the group is not 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.139
 not innate on the ground 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.069
 it should be written specifically quoted but I'll give you something 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.069
 cheap only last week 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:20.129
 you have been enlisted 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.099
 he is now as you usually do I did not know each other 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.229
 powerful and when you finish leather flap the lack of water you go 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.919
 recover vegetable cooking water made in a big in a 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.929
 big pot trying to recover from 3 liters each time this student 

00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:35.599
 long take this other book it in the refrigerator take 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.939
 two or three glasses a day you tell me news is free and 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:40.610
 it's special about i-tv 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.150
 4 the future mother in the united kingdom the truths face to face the number 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
 growing of these two parties would trade quarterly 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.560
 sport is a way of keeping the buzz alive 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.130
 cell 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.530
 so that's finally it's true 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.889
 a form of detoxification because only three because we sweat 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.620
 but because the cells are all active which they are obliged to 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.740
 constantly renew the most effective sport to have a good 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.080
 body interview actually these escorts muscles because when you

 chancellor to vendargues it never happened from doctor's memory 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.039
 it's like that never happened 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.840
 there m more rare in recent years is that it was dangerous 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.860
 paradox of bodybuilding 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.360
 the criterion is pain 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.240
 when you're hurting that's my part 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.080
