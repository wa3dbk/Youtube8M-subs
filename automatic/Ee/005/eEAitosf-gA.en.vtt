00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.900 
clock I think it's a clock what's up
Claudia<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.930> half<00:00:55.110> clock<00:00:55.670> um<00:00:58.039> this<00:00:59.039> unit<00:00:59.850> is

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
Claudia a half clock um this unit is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.360

available<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> icy<00:01:00.989> knee<00:01:01.070> I'm<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.219> sure

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
available for the icy knee I'm not sure

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.149

I think he included that in that will
probably<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> description<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> his<00:01:09.140> as
