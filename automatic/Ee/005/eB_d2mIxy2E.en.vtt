00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.960
 we put in when and how I said out a 9 90 with lg viewty and how do I 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.700
 known 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.030
 which is the leading camera mobile phone within the Korean brand 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:13.599
 yes this is one of the really most interesting phones in the 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.439
 market is not known that I have a 5 megapixel camera 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.140
 with lenses a leader who is one of the first who comes with 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.460
 the ability to have 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.579
 the room pautó little eye with manual directly turning it here 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.249
 with the same wheel that uses to move some things from the menu then 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.320
 when one has the open telephone of vienna and cáceres with what with the one of 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.330
 other tours advancing or passing some things 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.260
 another interesting thing and that I think is one of the first 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.120
 the world is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.979
 what's wrong with it 

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:44.149
 is a phone to be typical coordinate x or that is a phone capable of 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.930
 record to tite play this type of movies 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.790
 and it has light control it has an image television and what good to sell 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.250
 a screen protector 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.670
 when he opens it 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.870
 automatically that the camera function is enough inside the camera function 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.530
 for example I'm not fine video 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.350
 has some things really 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.760
 that one is born another 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.840
 for example the ability to sign seat 20 frames per second 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.630
 it's something that nobody does the ability to put on night modes when 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.720
 nocturnal 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.649
 the ability to choose if you want to sign 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.600
 possible to take pictures directly everything with an external button 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.740
 in fact almost everything is handled with an external motor to June of the day and camera 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.430
 of pictures 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.650
 the menu this is really impressive and notice that one has the ability to 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.260
 to choose 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.890
 from the types of images 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.800
 he got his foot he wants to work 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.930
 I do not really know if it looks good because all this is written and the screen is 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.050
 he sees very well in person but in a perhaps german filming 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.929
 another thing 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.090
 very good that you have and that you do not have 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.499
 almost no other phone 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.580
 that the ability to avoid images 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.770
 directly from the touch screen 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.240
 look for example for the demand that I give an image that I want to win 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.820
 lardiés home 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.200
 tight I'm going to take off 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.070
 and when you're going to avoid you have a series of functions on this side 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.300
 foot example 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.509
 I want to make a drawing forgive my unpleasant pulse 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.699
 but with more or less they are going to have a little india 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.499
 to cut 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.499
 I only know that I can remember there 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.999
 ii this start edit or write signature compose a signature or put an image 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.289
 of the text 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:30.939
 two 'coconuts' serve not really very advanced 1 other interesting thing should 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.989
 trespassing commented fourth believe 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.750
 what they want is power it seems that a few neighbors a lot of things agree 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.049
 apple in the orientation of the phone or walk offers by using 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.959
 example miguel -yes especially in 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.959
 I want to write a new message 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.219
 it is too delicate 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.490
 estimated the possibility of choosing freehand ap 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.269
 that is, with text recognition 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.439
 a normal keyboard when other haughty normal keyboard automatically 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.369
 the present that the guards complete and that works very very well these are 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:05.790
 some of the functions 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.790
 another interesting thing is that inside the entertainment entity by 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.299
 example 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.979
 1b google applications 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.989
 percent and installed directly from the factory 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.470
 and it is rumored that he will come out ahead with a goal 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.159
 ap the home to upload videos to youtube because of the image quality 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.650
 and estimate that this phone manages do not forget I repeat that it is a 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.569
 phone 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.239
 I'm fine with a 3-inch screen 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.319
 with external keyboard, note that the functions are handled from here 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.479
 the same system that serves to 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:44.389
 Ascer auto focus to spend little manual with mothers serves to manage the 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.299
 menu and apart from all sun 13 that walks very very 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.309
 the one that the king is sticking 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:55.429
 In short, a 5 megapixel team that brings a lot of competition to the 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:56.469
 other equipment that there is in the market
