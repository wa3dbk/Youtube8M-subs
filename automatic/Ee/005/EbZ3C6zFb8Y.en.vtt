to artwork or music and the movie

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.870 
to artwork or music and the movie
industry<00:01:23.159> would<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.490> able<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> take<00:01:23.850> advantage

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
industry would be able to take advantage

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
industry would be able to take advantage
of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> tablet<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.930> different<00:01:25.470> ways<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> from

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
of the tablet in different ways to from

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.770 
of the tablet in different ways to from
traditional<00:01:26.820> laptop<00:01:27.030> anything<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
traditional laptop anything like that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
traditional laptop anything like that
but<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:29.070> gonna<00:01:29.189> hit<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> towel<00:01:29.549> but

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
but so I'm not gonna hit the towel but

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.830 
but so I'm not gonna hit the towel but
we<00:01:29.820> already<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> tablets<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> be

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
we already know the tablets going to be

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.600 
we already know the tablets going to be
coming<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.860> can't<00:01:32.100> wait<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.340> actually

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
coming out and we can't wait to actually

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.760 
coming out and we can't wait to actually
see<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.060> creation<00:01:33.450> from<00:01:33.720> Apple<00:01:34.229> since<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
see this creation from Apple since the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.319 
see this creation from Apple since the
jaw<00:01:34.979> supposedly<00:01:35.549> had<00:01:35.729> his<00:01:35.880> hands<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.210> this

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329

tablet<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> while<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.560> also<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.430> think

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
tablet for a while now but also I think

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.130 
tablet for a while now but also I think
we're<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> iphone<00:01:39.810> 4

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
we're also going to see the iphone 4

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140 
we're also going to see the iphone 4

a little sneak peek exactly what that is
it's<00:02:08.520> far<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:08.759> not<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> be<00:02:09.119> released

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it's far I'm not going to be released

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.270 
it's far I'm not going to be released
until<00:02:09.509> kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.259> closer<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> launch

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
until kind of closer up to the launch

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.860 
until kind of closer up to the launch
any<00:02:11.550> new<00:02:11.640> iphone<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.360> speaking<00:02:12.720> about<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
any new iphone and speaking about the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.390 
any new iphone and speaking about the
new<00:02:12.989> I

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
new I

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.280 
new I
again<00:02:13.819> we're<00:02:14.299> probably<00:02:14.750> not<00:02:14.930> going<00:02:15.079> to<00:02:15.140> see

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
again we're probably not going to see

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.899 
again we're probably not going to see
the<00:02:15.409> new<00:02:15.530> hardware<00:02:15.950> for<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:16.189> new<00:02:16.310> iphone<00:02:16.730> at

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
the new hardware for the new iphone at

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.699 
the new hardware for the new iphone at
this<00:02:17.060> event<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.540> think<00:02:17.810> God<00:02:17.959> beats<00:02:18.170> too<00:02:18.470> much

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
this event I think God beats too much

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.789 
this event I think God beats too much
they<00:02:19.549> may<00:02:19.730> touch<00:02:20.120> on<00:02:20.329> it<00:02:20.450> when<00:02:20.689> we<00:02:20.780> maybe<00:02:20.989> half

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
they may touch on it when we maybe half

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.679 
they may touch on it when we maybe half
a<00:02:21.890> chance<00:02:22.129> to<00:02:22.310> see<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.549> new<00:02:22.670> iphone<00:02:23.060> but<00:02:23.659> I

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
a chance to see the new iphone but I

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.000 
a chance to see the new iphone but I
don't<00:02:23.870> think<00:02:23.959> we'll<00:02:24.140> see<00:02:24.200> anything<00:02:24.500> as<00:02:24.739> far<00:02:24.890> as

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
don't think we'll see anything as far as

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.360 
don't think we'll see anything as far as
their<00:02:25.129> hardware<00:02:25.489> for<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.670> new<00:02:25.819> iphone<00:02:27.370> now

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
their hardware for the new iphone now

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.949 
their hardware for the new iphone now
what<00:02:28.760> one<00:02:29.030> thing<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.269> think<00:02:29.329> we<00:02:29.569> will<00:02:29.750> see

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
what one thing I think we will see

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.990 
what one thing I think we will see
actually<00:02:30.349> a<00:02:31.099> lot<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.549> people<00:02:31.640> aren't<00:02:31.819> really

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
actually a lot of people aren't really

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.520 
actually a lot of people aren't really
talking<00:02:32.150> about<00:02:32.359> it<00:02:32.599> that<00:02:32.720> much<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:33.170> actually

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
talking about it that much but actually

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.410 
talking about it that much but actually
