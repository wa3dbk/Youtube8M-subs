hey guys how's it going today we're
going<00:00:08.389> to<00:00:08.480> be<00:00:08.600> doing<00:00:08.750> a<00:00:09.019> short<00:00:09.410> tutorial<00:00:09.590> on<00:00:10.070> a

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
going to be doing a short tutorial on a

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.549 
going to be doing a short tutorial on a
simple<00:00:10.910> motion<00:00:11.059> tracking<00:00:11.480> using<00:00:11.809> autodesk

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
simple motion tracking using autodesk

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.900 
simple motion tracking using autodesk
matchmover<00:00:12.940> 2011<00:00:13.940> matchmover<00:00:14.980> 2011<00:00:15.980> 2012<00:00:16.610> and

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
matchmover 2011 matchmover 2011 2012 and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.700 
matchmover 2011 matchmover 2011 2012 and
2013<00:00:17.710> only<00:00:18.910> open<00:00:19.910> image<00:00:20.420> sequences<00:00:20.930> that<00:00:21.500> can

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
2013 only open image sequences that can

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.519 
2013 only open image sequences that can
actually<00:00:21.890> open<00:00:22.130> a<00:00:22.310> movie<00:00:22.400> file<00:00:22.840> so<00:00:23.840> before<00:00:24.260> we

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
actually open a movie file so before we

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.439 
actually open a movie file so before we
get<00:00:24.680> started<00:00:24.920> with<00:00:25.189> this<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:25.580> have<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.880> export

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
get started with this you have to export

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.050 
get started with this you have to export
whatever<00:00:26.810> sequence<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:27.980> want<00:00:28.130> into<00:00:28.699> an<00:00:28.820> image

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
whatever sequence you want into an image

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.009 
whatever sequence you want into an image
sequence<00:00:29.740> of<00:00:30.740> PNG<00:00:31.099> z--<00:00:31.279> t<00:00:31.640> GA<00:00:32.150> s<00:00:32.269> or<00:00:32.540> Tiff's

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:33.019 
sequence of PNG z-- t GA s or Tiff's

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.299 
sequence of PNG z-- t GA s or Tiff's
work<00:00:33.739> pretty<00:00:34.100> well<00:00:35.260> so<00:00:36.260> I'm<00:00:36.680> just<00:00:36.890> going<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:37.160> go

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
work pretty well so I'm just going to go

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.330 
work pretty well so I'm just going to go
in<00:00:37.430> here<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:37.940> open<00:00:38.930> up<00:00:39.020> a<00:00:39.260> sequence<00:00:39.649> that<00:00:40.040> I've

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
in here and open up a sequence that I've

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.010 
in here and open up a sequence that I've
pre-prepared<00:00:41.059> prepared<00:00:43.149> I've<00:00:44.149> used<00:00:44.420> pngs<00:00:44.840> for

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
pre-prepared prepared I've used pngs for

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.049 
pre-prepared prepared I've used pngs for
this<00:00:45.140> particular<00:00:45.410> one<00:00:45.770> it's<00:00:46.399> just<00:00:46.610> my

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
this particular one it's just my

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:55.479 
this particular one it's just my
personal<00:00:47.390> preference<00:00:53.199> so<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.010> camera

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
personal preference so the camera

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.709 
personal preference so the camera
movement<00:00:55.850> in<00:00:55.940> this<00:00:56.090> particular<00:00:56.390> clip<00:00:56.690> is

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
movement in this particular clip is

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.290 
movement in this particular clip is
quiet<00:00:57.170> stationary

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.760 

you<00:01:02.300> could<00:01:02.480> probably<00:01:02.600> deal<00:01:03.050> with<00:01:03.080> a<00:01:03.200> 2d<00:01:03.530> track

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
you could probably deal with a 2d track

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.150 
you could probably deal with a 2d track
but<00:01:04.190> just<00:01:04.519> for<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:06.350> tutorial<00:01:06.770> purpose<00:01:07.010> our

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
but just for the tutorial purpose our

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.310 
but just for the tutorial purpose our
show<00:01:07.310> is<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.460> very<00:01:07.730> simple<00:01:08.060> clip<00:01:08.300> to<00:01:08.720> track

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
show is a very simple clip to track

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.820 
show is a very simple clip to track
because<00:01:09.710> this<00:01:09.770> is<00:01:10.040> just<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.370> first<00:01:10.610> tutorial

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
because this is just the first tutorial

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.790 
because this is just the first tutorial
so<00:01:12.830> this<00:01:13.190> is<00:01:13.280> an<00:01:13.400> old<00:01:13.580> clip<00:01:13.820> I<00:01:13.940> recorded<00:01:14.800> years

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
so this is an old clip I recorded years

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.219 
so this is an old clip I recorded years
ago<00:01:16.100> in<00:01:16.250> front<00:01:16.460> of<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.580> green<00:01:16.880> screen<00:01:17.229> for

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
ago in front of a green screen for

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.280 
ago in front of a green screen for
another<00:01:18.410> project<00:01:19.540> so<00:01:20.540> if<00:01:20.690> we<00:01:20.840> just<00:01:20.990> go<00:01:21.080> down

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
another project so if we just go down

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.740 
another project so if we just go down
into<00:01:21.860> 2d<00:01:22.280> tracking<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.760> go<00:01:22.910> automatic

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
into 2d tracking and go automatic

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.410 
into 2d tracking and go automatic
tracking<00:01:23.960> it's<00:01:24.470> as<00:01:24.800> simple<00:01:25.640> as<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:25.910> for<00:01:26.270> most

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
tracking it's as simple as that for most

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.030 
tracking it's as simple as that for most
clips<00:01:27.340> click<00:01:28.340> like<00:01:28.490> this<00:01:28.700> with<00:01:28.910> minimal

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
clips click like this with minimal

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.770 
clips click like this with minimal
actual<00:01:31.040> camera<00:01:31.310> movement<00:01:31.670> only<00:01:31.790> camera<00:01:32.510> shake

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
actual camera movement only camera shake

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.320 
actual camera movement only camera shake
and<00:01:32.990> slight<00:01:33.560> angle<00:01:33.830> change<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.399> quite<00:01:34.940> easy<00:01:35.119> to

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
and slight angle change is quite easy to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.480 
and slight angle change is quite easy to
do<00:01:35.890> so<00:01:36.890> just<00:01:37.070> click<00:01:37.160> run<00:01:37.369> here<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:39.369> it'll<00:01:40.369> run

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
do so just click run here and it'll run

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.330 
do so just click run here and it'll run
through<00:01:40.759> right<00:01:40.940> here<00:01:40.970> track<00:01:42.040> points<00:01:43.040> that<00:01:43.220> it

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
through right here track points that it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.810 
through right here track points that it
can<00:01:43.490> find<00:01:43.790> across<00:01:44.240> each<00:01:44.509> frame<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:46.550> default

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
can find across each frame the default

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.310 
can find across each frame the default
settings<00:01:47.090> usually<00:01:47.330> work<00:01:47.479> pretty<00:01:47.720> well<00:01:47.810> you

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
settings usually work pretty well you

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.499 
settings usually work pretty well you
can<00:01:48.500> tweak<00:01:48.860> them<00:01:49.070> but<00:01:49.670> I'll<00:01:49.940> go<00:01:50.149> through<00:01:50.180> that

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
can tweak them but I'll go through that

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.190 
can tweak them but I'll go through that
in<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.690> future<00:01:50.960> tutorial<00:01:52.899> so<00:01:53.899> I'm<00:01:53.990> just<00:01:54.080> going

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
in a future tutorial so I'm just going

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.460 
in a future tutorial so I'm just going
to<00:01:54.259> speed<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.530> up<00:01:54.710> here<00:01:55.539> for<00:01:56.539> tutorial

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
to speed it up here for tutorial

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:17.380 
to speed it up here for tutorial
purposes

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.280 

all<00:02:18.230> right<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:18.560> once<00:02:18.740> it's<00:02:18.890> done<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:21.200> won't

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
all right so once it's done you won't

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.530 
all right so once it's done you won't
get<00:02:21.500> very<00:02:21.709> much<00:02:22.190> visual<00:02:22.700> representation<00:02:23.360> or

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
get very much visual representation or

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.720 
get very much visual representation or
the<00:02:23.569> track<00:02:23.840> points<00:02:24.140> will<00:02:24.260> still<00:02:24.470> be<00:02:24.560> bear<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
the track points will still be bear the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.880 
the track points will still be bear the
duty<00:02:26.000> track<00:02:26.180> points<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:27.470> can<00:02:27.590> scroll<00:02:27.830> through

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
duty track points you can scroll through

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.370 
duty track points you can scroll through
and<00:02:28.130> see<00:02:28.280> them<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.720> it's<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.870> fairly<00:02:30.080> good<00:02:30.230> track

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
and see them so it's a fairly good track

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.120 
and see them so it's a fairly good track
on<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.590> wall<00:02:30.770> on<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.010> side<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.740> click<00:02:33.890> 3d

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
on the wall on the side if you click 3d

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.070 
on the wall on the side if you click 3d
up<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.430> top<00:02:34.640> you'll<00:02:35.300> get<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.510> ready<00:02:35.750> view

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
up the top you'll get this ready view

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.650 
up the top you'll get this ready view
it's<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.890> bit<00:02:37.100> hard<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.670> navigate<00:02:37.880> compared<00:02:38.570> to

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
it's a bit hard to navigate compared to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.780 
it's a bit hard to navigate compared to
other<00:02:38.810> 3d<00:02:39.050> applications<00:02:39.140> but<00:02:39.830> once<00:02:40.640> you

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
other 3d applications but once you

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.830 
other 3d applications but once you
scroll<00:02:41.000> through<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.330> can<00:02:41.360> see<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.750> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
scroll through you can see that the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.729 
scroll through you can see that the
actual<00:02:42.050> camera<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.530> moving<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:45.440> basic

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
actual camera is moving and the basic

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:46.780 
actual camera is moving and the basic
gist<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.070> if<00:02:46.190> you've<00:02:46.310> got<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.459> really<00:02:46.640> good

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
gist is if you've got a really good

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.500 
gist is if you've got a really good
track<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.810> won't<00:02:48.020> see<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.410> actual<00:02:48.709> image

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
track you won't see the actual image

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.760 
track you won't see the actual image
changing<00:02:50.510> angle<00:02:50.930> you'll<00:02:51.350> just<00:02:51.530> see<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
changing angle you'll just see the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.370 
changing angle you'll just see the
camera<00:02:52.100> moving<00:02:52.310> around<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:54.020> just<00:02:54.260> did

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
camera moving around it like it just did

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.320 
camera moving around it like it just did
there<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:55.430> we're<00:02:55.580> going<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.760> export<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.150> now<00:02:56.269> to

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
there so we're going to export it now to

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.240 
there so we're going to export it now to
Mayor<00:02:56.720> format<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.590> can<00:02:57.709> go<00:02:57.830> light<00:02:58.040> wave

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
Mayor format you can go light wave

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.170 
Mayor format you can go light wave

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
amount of programs I'm just I'm going to

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:15.290 
amount of programs I'm just I'm going to
export<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.700> third<00:03:08.600> test<00:03:09.260> file

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.400 

and<00:03:15.870> save<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:18.060> now<00:03:18.210> we'll<00:03:18.390> go<00:03:18.540> into<00:03:18.570> Maya

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
and save it so now we'll go into Maya

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.180 
and save it so now we'll go into Maya
and<00:03:20.810> we<00:03:21.810> will<00:03:21.990> have<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.320> look<00:03:22.470> at<00:03:22.590> what<00:03:23.100> we've

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
and we will have a look at what we've

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:32.740 
and we will have a look at what we've
got

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.280 

I'll<00:03:33.290> just<00:03:33.470> open<00:03:33.590> my<00:03:33.920> here<00:03:34.660> running<00:03:35.660> 2012<00:03:36.170> at

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
I'll just open my here running 2012 at

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:51.200 
I'll just open my here running 2012 at
the<00:03:36.320> moment<00:03:36.590> because<00:03:36.680> 2013<00:03:37.610> is<00:03:37.790> did<00:03:38.720> buggy

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.000 

[Music]

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
[Music]

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:01.100 
[Music]
so<00:03:53.610> if<00:03:53.670> we<00:03:53.760> just<00:03:53.909> go<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.180> open<00:03:54.450> our<00:03:54.540> scene

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.520 

test<00:04:02.110> three<00:04:02.640> you'll<00:04:03.640> be<00:04:03.910> presented<00:04:04.570> with<00:04:04.600> this

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
test three you'll be presented with this

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.380 
test three you'll be presented with this
kind<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:06.010> thing<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.640> each<00:04:07.060> one<00:04:07.210> of<00:04:07.330> those

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
kind of thing and each one of those

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.370 
kind of thing and each one of those
locators<00:04:07.900> are<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.110> 3d<00:04:08.410> track<00:04:09.010> point<00:04:09.310> in<00:04:09.550> space

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
locators are the 3d track point in space

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.630 
locators are the 3d track point in space
so<00:04:11.380> we<00:04:11.650> want<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:11.890> turn<00:04:12.010> that<00:04:12.130> off<00:04:12.190> because<00:04:12.460> they

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
so we want to turn that off because they

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.460 
so we want to turn that off because they
get<00:04:12.760> quite<00:04:13.150> annoying<00:04:13.420> in<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.840> way<00:04:14.140> of<00:04:14.290> things

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
get quite annoying in the way of things

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.810 
get quite annoying in the way of things
when<00:04:14.680> you're<00:04:14.770> trying<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:14.980> select<00:04:15.220> models<00:04:15.670> etc

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
when you're trying to select models etc

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.650 
when you're trying to select models etc
so<00:04:16.780> now<00:04:16.900> we<00:04:16.959> can<00:04:17.110> just<00:04:17.260> see<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.530> camera<00:04:17.920> and<00:04:18.850> if

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
so now we can just see the camera and if

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.910 
so now we can just see the camera and if
we<00:04:19.780> play<00:04:19.959> it<00:04:19.989> we<00:04:20.140> can<00:04:20.350> see<00:04:20.470> that<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.709> camera

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
we play it we can see that the camera

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
we play it we can see that the camera
does<00:04:21.040> move<00:04:22.890> if<00:04:23.890> we<00:04:24.100> look<00:04:24.340> through<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.610> camera

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
does move if we look through the camera

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.600 
does move if we look through the camera
we<00:04:25.240> can<00:04:25.330> see<00:04:25.390> even<00:04:25.690> better<00:04:26.310> with<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.340> grid

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
we can see even better with the grid

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.000 
we can see even better with the grid
moving<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.210> it's<00:04:28.900> basically<00:04:29.350> mimicking<00:04:29.860> the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
moving and it's basically mimicking the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.760 
moving and it's basically mimicking the
camera<00:04:30.280> movement<00:04:30.670> of<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.480> actual<00:04:32.320> camera

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
camera movement of the actual camera

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
camera movement of the actual camera
when<00:04:33.700> I<00:04:33.730> filmed<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.300> footage<00:04:35.340> this<00:04:36.340> is<00:04:36.490> very

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
when I filmed the footage this is very

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.910 
when I filmed the footage this is very
useful<00:04:37.120> for<00:04:37.150> integrating<00:04:37.810> 3d<00:04:38.020> objects<00:04:38.470> into

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
useful for integrating 3d objects into

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.230 
useful for integrating 3d objects into
live-action<00:04:39.490> footage<00:04:41.670> effects<00:04:42.670> anything

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
live-action footage effects anything

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.440 
live-action footage effects anything
really<00:04:45.180> as<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.860> can<00:04:48.010> see<00:04:48.190> I've<00:04:48.520> actually<00:04:49.150> got

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
really as you can see I've actually got

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.340 
really as you can see I've actually got
a<00:04:49.480> plane<00:04:49.720> set<00:04:50.650> up<00:04:51.240> exactly<00:04:52.240> where<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.900> green

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
a plane set up exactly where the green

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:01.140 
a plane set up exactly where the green
screen<00:04:53.650> was<00:04:53.860> in<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:55.000> footage<00:04:59.760> and<00:05:00.760> as<00:05:00.910> you<00:05:01.030> can

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
screen was in the footage and as you can

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.540 
screen was in the footage and as you can
see<00:05:01.210> it's<00:05:01.620> quite<00:05:02.620> nice<00:05:02.860> handheld<00:05:03.250> movement

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
see it's quite nice handheld movement

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.150 
see it's quite nice handheld movement
you<00:05:04.030> can<00:05:04.150> also<00:05:04.300> use<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:04.810> type<00:05:05.440> of<00:05:05.650> tracking

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
you can also use this type of tracking

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.350 
you can also use this type of tracking
to<00:05:06.520> add<00:05:07.210> some<00:05:07.980> realistic<00:05:08.980> handheld<00:05:09.850> movement

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
to add some realistic handheld movement

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.640 
to add some realistic handheld movement
to<00:05:10.540> your<00:05:10.920> 3d<00:05:11.920> animations<00:05:12.490> which<00:05:13.330> I<00:05:13.840> like<00:05:14.410> to<00:05:14.530> do

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
to your 3d animations which I like to do

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.100 
to your 3d animations which I like to do
on<00:05:14.770> most<00:05:15.010> of<00:05:15.100> mine<00:05:17.370> all<00:05:18.370> right<00:05:18.520> so<00:05:18.820> that's<00:05:19.690> all

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
on most of mine all right so that's all

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.300 
on most of mine all right so that's all
for<00:05:20.560> today<00:05:20.860> I'll<00:05:21.490> see<00:05:21.669> you<00:05:21.910> guys<00:05:22.000> next<00:05:22.180> time
