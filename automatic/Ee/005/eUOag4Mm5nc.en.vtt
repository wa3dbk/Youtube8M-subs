00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
now for those who don't know the B is a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.010 
now for those who don't know the B is a
very<00:01:03.719> powerful<00:01:04.580> Hyperion<00:01:05.610> amp<00:01:05.850> shield<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
very powerful Hyperion amp shield that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.960 
very powerful Hyperion amp shield that
was<00:01:07.290> introduced<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> vanilla<00:01:08.280> game<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
was introduced in the vanilla game and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.210 
was introduced in the vanilla game and
what<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:09.900> allow<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.650> basically

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
what it would allow you to do basically

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.990 
what it would allow you to do basically
is<00:01:11.549> take<00:01:12.540> any<00:01:12.840> gun<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.590> make<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.400> supremely

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
is take any gun and make it supremely

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.140 
is take any gun and make it supremely
powerful<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.110> B<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.970> stronger<00:01:17.970> than

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
powerful because the B is stronger than

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.910 
powerful because the B is stronger than
pretty<00:01:18.450> much<00:01:18.540> every<00:01:19.380> single<00:01:19.920> gun<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.180> game

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
pretty much every single gun in the game

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.850 
pretty much every single gun in the game
but<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.250> by<00:01:23.400> itself<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.320> there<00:01:25.320> was<00:01:25.470> also<00:01:25.650> an

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
but just by itself and there was also an

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.880 
but just by itself and there was also an
issue<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.460> multi<00:01:27.000> projectiles<00:01:27.689> where<00:01:28.530> if

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
issue with multi projectiles where if

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
issue with multi projectiles where if
you<00:01:29.009> used<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> shotgun<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.509> get

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you used it with a shotgun you would get

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.460 
you used it with a shotgun you would get
basically<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:33.540> would<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> amp<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.170> every

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
basically you would get the amp on every

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.679 
basically you would get the amp on every
single<00:01:34.650> pellet<00:01:35.119> obviously<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.299> had<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.600> be

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
single pellet obviously that had to be

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
single pellet obviously that had to be
nerfed<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.259> obvious<00:01:37.890> reasons<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.729> in

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
nerfed for obvious reasons but in

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.969 
nerfed for obvious reasons but in
addition<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.780> tried<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> nerf<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.619> B<00:01:40.770> by

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
addition they tried to nerf the B by

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.609 
addition they tried to nerf the B by
making<00:01:41.280> its<00:01:41.460> recharge<00:01:41.970> longer<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.290> feel

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
making its recharge longer and I feel

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.859 
making its recharge longer and I feel
like<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.430> could<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.850> done<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.329> they

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
like what they could have done is they

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.069 
like what they could have done is they
should<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.710> either<00:01:47.450> changed<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.689> B<00:01:48.840> or

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
should have either changed the B or

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.020 
should have either changed the B or
maybe<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.829> beef<00:01:50.009> should<00:01:50.220> never<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.850> even

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
maybe the beef should never have even

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.569 
maybe the beef should never have even
made<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.570> into<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> game<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> begin<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
made it into the game to begin with I

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.389 
made it into the game to begin with I
feel<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.810> did<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> lot<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.740> balance

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
feel like they did a lot of balance

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.630 
feel like they did a lot of balance
changes<00:01:56.880> around<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.719> V<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:59.280> how

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
changes around the V and this is not how

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.359 
changes around the V and this is not how
it<00:01:59.909> should<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.420> been<00:02:00.630> done<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.649> very<00:02:01.979> clear

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
it should have been done it's very clear

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
it should have been done it's very clear
that<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> lot<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:03.090> bosses<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> game<00:02:04.229> are

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that a lot of bosses in the game are

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.930 
that a lot of bosses in the game are
just<00:02:05.060> so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
just so

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.060 
just so
painful<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.750> try<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.170> take<00:02:08.380> out<00:02:08.619> without

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
painful to try and take out without

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.790 
painful to try and take out without
using<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.550> B<00:02:09.729> now<00:02:10.570> obviously<00:02:11.290> salva-dork

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
using the B now obviously salva-dork

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.370 
using the B now obviously salva-dork

I'm using this fire plasma caster I'm
basically<00:02:49.210> one<00:02:49.630> shotting<00:02:50.170> mate<00:02:50.710> or<00:02:50.860> sometimes

the B is up and that's you know without

the B is up and that's you know without
slag<00:02:57.850> either<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:59.500> how<00:02:59.680> old<00:02:59.860> do<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.160> feel<00:03:00.430> about

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.580 
slag either so how old do you feel about
this<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:01.150> feel<00:03:01.600> like<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.840> B<00:03:01.990> could<00:03:02.320> have<00:03:02.440> been

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
this I feel like the B could have been

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.670 
this I feel like the B could have been
balanced<00:03:03.040> in<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.280> different<00:03:03.880> way<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:05.440> should

somewhere around 300 thousand and you

know it would be balanced around the

was full anyway let's go ahead and take
a<00:03:53.800> look<00:03:54.190> at<00:03:54.430> ant<00:03:54.940> shields<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.570> general<00:03:56.260> now

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
a look at ant shields in general now

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.560 
a look at ant shields in general now
this<00:03:57.310> is<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.760> this<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.090> what<00:03:58.239> would<00:03:58.450> be

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
this is the this is what would be

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.910 
this is the this is what would be
considered<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:59.170> perfect<00:03:59.650> amp<00:04:00.190> shield<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.880> a

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
non-unique Hyperion amp as I said it's

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.520 
non-unique Hyperion amp as I said it's

about eight hundred thousand extra

2.5<00:04:12.850> seven<00:04:13.239> seconds<00:04:13.660> in<00:04:13.720> between<00:04:13.840> each<00:04:14.230> shot

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
2.5 seven seconds in between each shot

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.550 
2.5 seven seconds in between each shot
however<00:04:15.700> if<00:04:15.940> we<00:04:16.570> take<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.810> look<00:04:17.049> at<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.350> bee

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.180 
however if we take a look at the bee
you'll<00:04:18.220> notice<00:04:18.520> it's<00:04:18.870> 1.8

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
you'll notice it's 1.8

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.060 
you'll notice it's 1.8
million<00:04:20.489> amp<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.870> doesn't<00:04:22.380> drain<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:23.010> you

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
million amp and it doesn't drain so you

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.480 
million amp and it doesn't drain so you
can<00:04:23.400> go<00:04:23.640> one<00:04:24.120> shot<00:04:24.450> after<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:25.140> next<00:04:25.410> yes<00:04:26.190> it

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
can go one shot after the next yes it

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.300 
can go one shot after the next yes it

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
does have a large recharge delay but

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.830

most classes have a have something that

that I no accident can bring that to
almost<00:04:38.670> two<00:04:39.150> seconds<00:04:39.720> probably<00:04:39.930> even<00:04:40.230> lower

the<00:04:48.840> weapon<00:04:49.260> itself<00:04:50.060> weapons<00:04:51.060> don't<00:04:51.240> really

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
the weapon itself weapons don't really

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
have that much damage behind them when

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.210 
have that much damage behind them when
you<00:04:53.760> compare<00:04:54.210> how<00:04:54.630> much<00:04:54.900> damage<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.650> B<00:04:55.950> is

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
you compare how much damage the B is

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.790 
you compare how much damage the B is
adding<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:57.090> them<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.600> this<00:04:58.200> is<00:04:58.380> where<00:04:58.530> I<00:04:58.560> feel

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
adding to them and this is where I feel

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.770 
adding to them and this is where I feel
like<00:04:58.980> it<00:04:59.160> kind<00:04:59.610> of<00:04:59.790> killed<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.360> balance

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
like it kind of killed the balance

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.990 
like it kind of killed the balance
because<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.410> lot<00:05:01.890> of<00:05:02.040> people<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.490> know<00:05:02.580> use<00:05:02.970> the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
because a lot of people you know use the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.780 
because a lot of people you know use the
B<00:05:03.420> with<00:05:04.050> all<00:05:04.320> of<00:05:04.470> these<00:05:04.590> items<00:05:04.800> now<00:05:05.190> you<00:05:05.580> keep

B with all of these items now you keep

B with all of these items now you keep
like<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.120> said<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.570> can<00:05:06.870> clear<00:05:07.350> certain<00:05:07.980> things

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
like I said you can clear certain things

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.480 
like I said you can clear certain things
you<00:05:08.940> can<00:05:09.360> do<00:05:09.480> general<00:05:09.900> mobbing<00:05:10.230> no<00:05:10.920> problem

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
you can do general mobbing no problem

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.820 
you can do general mobbing no problem
without<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.630> B<00:05:12.780> but<00:05:13.290> if<00:05:13.380> you're<00:05:13.470> going<00:05:13.650> to<00:05:13.740> go

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
without the B but if you're going to go

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.670 
without the B but if you're going to go
take<00:05:14.100> on<00:05:14.310> a<00:05:14.340> raid<00:05:14.700> boss<00:05:15.030> as<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.450> class<00:05:16.380> that's

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
take on a raid boss as a class that's

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.250 
take on a raid boss as a class that's
not<00:05:17.010> Salvador<00:05:17.820> you're<00:05:18.510> gonna<00:05:18.690> have<00:05:19.020> an

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
extremely difficult time because bosses

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.820 
extremely difficult time because bosses
were<00:05:22.410> you<00:05:22.890> know<00:05:23.090> scaled<00:05:24.090> to<00:05:24.480> the<00:05:24.810> different<00:05:25.380> or

pre-sequel they will they won't make
this<00:05:31.770> same<00:05:32.040> mistake<00:05:32.430> they'll<00:05:33.150> balance<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.630> B

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
this same mistake they'll balance the B

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.960 
this same mistake they'll balance the B
around<00:05:33.870> it<00:05:34.350> having<00:05:34.650> no<00:05:34.770> drain<00:05:35.070> by<00:05:35.490> you<00:05:35.880> know

around it having no drain by you know

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.540 
around it having no drain by you know
say<00:05:36.419> it'll<00:05:36.750> have<00:05:36.930> half<00:05:37.260> half<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:38.190> damage<00:05:38.430> or

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
say it'll have half half the damage or

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.340 
say it'll have half half the damage or
probably<00:05:38.760> maybe<00:05:39.180> even<00:05:39.419> less<00:05:39.600> than<00:05:39.660> maybe<00:05:40.050> even

I mean III agree people should be

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.000 
I mean III agree people should be
overpowered<00:05:57.600> but<00:05:58.020> not<00:05:58.260> to<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:58.620> point<00:05:58.650> where

what it was on release that I feel is

too far to the overpowered but at the
same<00:06:12.600> time<00:06:12.840> it<00:06:13.080> shouldn't<00:06:13.410> be<00:06:13.740> to<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.100> point

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
same time it shouldn't be to the point

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.940 
same time it shouldn't be to the point
where<00:06:14.550> they<00:06:15.240> you<00:06:15.780> need<00:06:16.020> to<00:06:16.140> be<00:06:16.230> using<00:06:16.560> a<00:06:16.620> B<00:06:16.770> to

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
where they you need to be using a B to

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.330 
where they you need to be using a B to
take<00:06:17.190> on<00:06:17.400> these<00:06:18.060> powerful<00:06:18.510> enemies<00:06:19.130> it's<00:06:20.130> just

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
take on these powerful enemies it's just

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.650 
take on these powerful enemies it's just
it<00:06:20.490> shouldn't<00:06:20.820> be<00:06:20.910> done<00:06:21.090> like<00:06:21.270> that

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
it shouldn't be done like that

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.270 
it shouldn't be done like that
and<00:06:22.760> like<00:06:23.760> I<00:06:23.880> said<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:24.540> whole<00:06:24.800> the<00:06:25.800> amp<00:06:25.980> shield

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
and like I said the whole the amp shield

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.530 
and like I said the whole the amp shield

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.180 
working in Reverse
they<00:06:27.780> could<00:06:27.990> have<00:06:28.050> done<00:06:28.200> a<00:06:28.410> lot<00:06:28.680> of<00:06:28.860> different

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
they could have done a lot of different

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.400 
they could have done a lot of different
things<00:06:29.430> with<00:06:29.669> amp<00:06:29.970> shields<00:06:30.479> and<00:06:30.630> make<00:06:31.200> them

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
things with amp shields and make them

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.410 
things with amp shields and make them
more<00:06:31.650> unique<00:06:32.100> instead<00:06:32.580> of<00:06:32.700> just<00:06:32.789> having<00:06:32.970> the

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.420 
more unique instead of just having the

more unique instead of just having the

that's another way to do it could they
should<00:07:13.440> they<00:07:13.560> have<00:07:13.620> just<00:07:13.830> buff<00:07:14.010> those<00:07:14.220> instead

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110
