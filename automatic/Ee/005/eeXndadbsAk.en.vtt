and I have an anti-glare if you can see
on<00:04:27.729> there<00:04:28.139> but<00:04:29.139> yeah<00:04:29.290> this<00:04:29.860> is<00:04:30.040> a<00:04:30.100> good<00:04:30.220> case<00:04:30.490> as

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
on there but yeah this is a good case as

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.510 
on there but yeah this is a good case as
you<00:04:30.910> can<00:04:31.030> see<00:04:31.210> like<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:32.889> vile<00:04:33.190> rockers

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
you can see like the the vile rockers

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.250 
you can see like the the vile rockers
are<00:04:33.639> showing<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.090> there's<00:04:34.270> no<00:04:34.510> protection

over it I guess it's easier to push the

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.360 
over it I guess it's easier to push the
buttons<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:38.620> body<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:40.830> vibrations<00:04:41.830> which<00:04:42.220> is

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
buttons the body the vibrations which is

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.969

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
easy to get to the bottom rockers the

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.570 
easy to get to the bottom rockers the
