00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 JAMES GRIME: We are going to break a rule. 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.920
 We are going to break one of the rules of Numberphile 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.410
 The thing we are going to discuss today is not a number. 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.910
 We are going to discuss "unlimited" 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.050
 Unlimited 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.070
 Like I said, it's not a number 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.290
 It is an idea 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.270
 a concept 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.110
 Is an infinite concept that will last forever 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.860
 I think everyone is familiar with the concept of infinity. 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.320
 Even a child 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
 You will start counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.180
 Now you may be five years old, but you will start thinking 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.230
 What is the biggest number I can imagine? 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.310
 You will say, oooh, is 20 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.880
 When you are older, you will say that it may be 1 million. 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.430
 It will end forever, isn't it? Because you can always add 1 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.600
 So that is the concept of infinity 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.170
 The number is infinite 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.530
 However, I want to tell you a surprising fact 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.490
 About infinity 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.180
 There are many kinds of infinity 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
 Some infinity is infinitely larger than others 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.620
 Let's take a look 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.590
 The first type of infinity is called "countable" 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.610
 But I don't really like the name "countable" 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.940
 Then Brady gave me some...hmm is like that 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.270
 Because when you say infinity, you can't 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.880
 Calculate unlimited, right? 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.660
 Should be infinite 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.030
 I think that is a bad name. 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.200
 I prefer to call it "listable" 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.310
 Can we list these numbers? 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.980
 Come on, let's use some simple numbers. 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.340
 BRADY HARAN: Do you want to list them all? 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.660
 JAMES GRIME: 4 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.110
 How long have we been recorded? 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.020
 BRADY HARAN: (haha) 10 minutes 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.902
 JAMES GRIME: Okay. 

00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:31.190
 5,6-- 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.580
 So you can list these numbers 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.220
 So this is called "countable" 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.200
 I prefer to call it "executable" 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.310
 What about the integer? 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.100
 All integers 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.920
 Also contains negative numbers 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.450
 So there is a 0 here. 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.900
 Let's try 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.140
 There are 1, -1, 2, -2 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.190
 3,-3 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.380
 Now, this is also unlimited 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.720
 In a sense, it is twice as big because it seems 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.680
 Each number is repeated twice 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.290
 But it is also infinite 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.220
 Both are infinite, both 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.590
 Same kind of infinity 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.139
 Can be enumerated 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.949
 Even more shocking, the score is also 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.160
 Can be enumerated 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.740
 But you have to be a little smarter to understand these 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.520
 Let's try to enumerate the score 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.670
 I have to write the alignment 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.065
 1/1 

00:02:19.065 --> 00:02:19.770
 That is a score 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.580
 [inaudible] 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.480
 Write 2, 3, 4...7 as the numerator denominator 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.120
 Ok, let's continue 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.610
 Let's do the next row and take 2 as a molecule 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.480
 2/1, 2/2, 2/3, 2/4 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.800
 carry on 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.250
 3/1, 3/2 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.770
 4/6, 4/7 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.510
 That can go on, but we have to go on the next step. 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.010
 Here, I sort out an infinite square array 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.710
 Relevant score 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.440
 Now, I made a list like this, so if I 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.990
 If I look at a row, you will encounter some problems. 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.260
 If I look at a row, I see it like this. 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.895
 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7 then 

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:02.640
 I will continue forever. 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.870
 Then, I will never get to the second row. 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.630
 I can't list it anymore. 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.230
 Not using this method 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.380
 You can't use this method to enumerate 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.930
 You will never get to the second row 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.920
 You should use this method 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.340
 Smarter approach 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.590
 To use this diagonal 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.530
 Now, I can guarantee that every score will be drawn at 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.080
 One diagonal 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.730
 You list by each diagonal 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.480
 So this is the first diagonal 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.470
 Then this is the second diagonal you listed 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.480
 Then the third 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.340
 The fourth diagonal, the fifth 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.010
 So every score has to do this 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.210
 Each score will be drawn diagonally, you want 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.850
 Come and list them 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.540
 Now, if you list all the numbers, right? 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.860
 All digit lines 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.325
 Let's try 

00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:44.800
 Ok, let me paint 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.750
 This is an endless number line 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.380
 This is the position on your number line 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.360
 Fill in the middle of the 0 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.130
 Then 1, 2, 3 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.900
 But there will still be 1/3 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.190
 Also include π, e, and all 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.240
 Irrational number 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.360
 Can you list it? 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.130
 How to list it? 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.315
 Start with 0, then 1? 

00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:04.120
 But wait 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.500
 We are missing 0.5 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.690
 So we put in 0.5 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.910
 Waiting, we are still missing 0.25 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.700
 We put in 0.25 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.440
 But we still lack 0.237-- 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.050
 So how should we list the real numbers? 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.329
 The truth is that you can't 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.670
 In fact, quite obvious, I can show you that it doesn’t work. 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.240
 Even if we want to discuss 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.650
 Something as complicated as infinity 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.620
 BRADY HARAN: Do it, dude. 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.645
 JAMES GRIME: We need more paper 

00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:28.885
 BRADY HARAN: We need an unlimited amount of 

00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:30.810
 Paper, I think 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.950
 JAMES GRIME: (hahaha) this question 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.610
 Imagine that we are listing all the numbers on the line, ok? 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.450
 Although in fact, we can't 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.830
 But let's pretend it. 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.970
 What will this become? 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.440
 We have to start from the origin position 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.530
 Let's pick some positions on the line 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.525
 0.121-- 

00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:48.840
 Little bit 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.930
 Let's pick one 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.010
 Suppose the next one is 0.221-- 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.230
 In the next one, we assume that it is 0.31111129-- 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.740
 Then another 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.250
 0.00176-- 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.420
 Now I am creating a number 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.020
 I am going to create this number. 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.780
 I want to pick this diagonal 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.810
 Pick the numbers on this line, this, this and this and this 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.340
 This, this, this 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.160
 Then I have to write them down 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.420
 So which set of numbers was created by me? 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.750
 Is 0.12101-- 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.690
 dot dot dot 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.280
 Now the following is my rule 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.680
 I am going to create a brand new number from this number. 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.840
 That is the number I want to create (the rules) 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.890
 If there is 1, change it to 2 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:52.340
 If there are 2 or other numbers, turn it into 1 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.792
 Ok, let's try 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.970
 So I have to turn this into -- 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.200
 0. 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.400
 If there is 1, it will be converted into 2 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.980
 If there is something else, turn it into 1 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.370
 So this will be 1 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.130
 Turn this 1 into 2 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.830
 Then turn this into 1 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.960
 Then change this to 2, this is my rule. 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.950
 Then I created a new set of numbers 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.240
 Does not exist in these lists 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.210
 Is a different set from other numbers 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.150
 Compare with the list, it is not the first set of numbers because 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.170
 In the first place, it is different. 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.680
 Not the second group because 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.990
 In the second place is different 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.460
 Not the third group because 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.560
 In the third place is different 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.670
 Not the fourth group because 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.060
 In the 4th place is different 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.120
 Not the fifth group because 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.080
 In the 5th place is different 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.340
 You created a brand new number that didn't appear on the table 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.570
 That's why you can't list all the positions in the number line. 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.560
 In this case, infinity is uncountable. 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.820
 Also not listed 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.280
 This shows that this example is a new kind of infinity 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.150
 Bigger infinity 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.770
 BRADY HARAN: No, this should be countable, James. 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.260
 Because as long as we continue to follow your rules, then constantly create numbers 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.950
 Then they are included in the table. 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.660
 Then repeat it all the time, what do we get after that? 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.460
 JAMES GRIME: But you can still create numbers again. 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.580
 Those are no longer on the table 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.960
 I came up with a German mathematician who came up with this. 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.330
 Called Cantor (Georg Cantor) 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.480
 Cantor is a man of the 20th century or so 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.390
 He was ridiculed by others because of this. 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.900
 For this idea that "there is a lot of infinity" 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.910
 He is known as the braque 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.840
 Everyone thinks his words are nonsense. 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.590
 Poor Cantor was squeezed out by mathematicians of the same period 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.810
 He spent a lot of time in his old age. 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.900
 Mental hospital (bipolar disorder), that is where he died 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.860
 This theory was recognized when approaching the end of his life. 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.600
 It is true 

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.600
 It is right
