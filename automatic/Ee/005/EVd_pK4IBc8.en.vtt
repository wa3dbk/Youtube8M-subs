00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
stuck on the tail and with good breeders

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.380 
stuck on the tail and with good breeders
they<00:03:52.690> usually<00:03:53.020> take<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:54.280> shedded<00:03:54.790> animals

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
off the market for that point because

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.040 
off the market for that point because
they<00:03:58.090> don't<00:03:58.210> want<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.390> sure<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.780> breast

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050

to<00:04:02.680> buy<00:04:02.890> anything<00:04:03.220> just<00:04:03.730> because<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.060> might<00:04:04.360> be

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
to buy anything just because it might be

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.510

stuck on shed and you might just think
that<00:04:06.700> it's<00:04:06.820> right<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:07.060> should<00:04:07.240> but<00:04:07.660> that's

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
that it's right you should but that's

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.350 
that it's right you should but that's
not<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.290> got<00:04:08.590> idea<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.730> might<00:04:09.940> think<00:04:09.970> oh<00:04:10.300> I

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
not I got idea and you might think oh I

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.330 
not I got idea and you might think oh I
might<00:04:10.690> have<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.990> moisten<00:04:11.260> up<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.680> cage<00:04:11.920> but

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
might have to moisten up the cage but

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.770 
might have to moisten up the cage but
you<00:04:12.490> don't<00:04:12.820> but<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.300> will<00:04:13.450> be<00:04:13.570> another

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
you don't but that will be another

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.890 
you don't but that will be another
matter<00:04:14.110> so<00:04:14.620> um<00:04:15.430> now<00:04:16.000> if<00:04:16.150> you're<00:04:16.299> asking<00:04:16.630> why

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
matter so um now if you're asking why

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.220 
matter so um now if you're asking why
once<00:04:17.799> again<00:04:18.040> -<00:04:18.280> has<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:18.910> stubby<00:04:19.390> tail<00:04:19.600> let's<00:04:19.900> say

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
once again - has a stubby tail let's say

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:20.580 
once again - has a stubby tail let's say
that

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
that

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.620 
that
it's<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.769> same<00:04:20.980> fact<00:04:21.280> this<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.180> why<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.330> got<00:04:22.510> it

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
it's the same fact this is why I got it

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.140 
it's the same fact this is why I got it
for<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.780> cheaper<00:04:22.840> price<00:04:23.139> she<00:04:23.800> was<00:04:23.949> I<00:04:24.250> was<00:04:24.850> taking

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
a risk by buying her because she could

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.620 
a risk by buying her because she could
have<00:04:26.740> an<00:04:26.830> infection<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.030> looked<00:04:28.270> into<00:04:28.540> it
