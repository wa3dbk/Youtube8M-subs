 July 2011 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.829
 of course that the idea of ​​a pose of 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.270
 prosthesis is something extremely 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.800
 oxygen since it is an act 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.750
 operative this being it is a prosthesis 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.220
 which will bring indolence from where 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.840
 the importance of having a good fight with 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.730
 the healthcare team so with the doctor

 to be fully informed about 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.220
 modalities this surgery and especially of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.260
 post operative suites two years before 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.600
 my operation I flatly stop 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.740
 any sporting activity because I do not 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.390
 could absolutely not stand the 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.370
 pain after the procedure 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.020
 it took me about three months to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.950
 rehabilitation before you can walk 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.410
 normally 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.480
 six months after this intervention I 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.860
 could restart the sport including a 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.350
 ski week during holidays 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.810
 winter and a year after this 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.310
 intervention game 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.860
 repr atik practically sport 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.780
 normally including badminton and 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.090
 golf from time to time before this 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.990
 intervention I had a social life 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.720
 limited because I dreaded 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.350
 always having to walk or do 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.630
 exercise 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.700
 after the intervention I was able to resume 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.470
 social life quite normal there 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.970
 no more apprehension now for 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.240
 meet friends or go out 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.240
 together 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.610
 I must admit that after the intervention 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.110
 the scar is pretty impressive 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.799
 and remind you a little bit this 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.630
 intervention 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.390
 but after a few months she 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.240
 disappears there is also pain 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.130
 muscle following the trauma that in 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.130
 my case disappeared after six months
