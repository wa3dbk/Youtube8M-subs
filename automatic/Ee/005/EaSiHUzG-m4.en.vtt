00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.210
 so that all and also since 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.790
 we are here below the button I am going to 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.730
 tap to make a video about 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.309
 our next step for what is coming 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.950
 being the tuning of our 8 this is not 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.950
 It has to be done so frequently 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.310
 but it's worth it here 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.890
 if we go here on the driver's side 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 in the back right here where 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.540
 is our flexible tube for 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.230
 heating we will find our filter 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.230
 of gasoline and our gas filter 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.650
 I'm like I hope 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.500
 and this one has some arrows 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.110
 so it has to come which means that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.970
 there you have to go to the engine of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.570
 here comes from the gas pump and 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.010
 the engine comes out if it gets in their way 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.630
 a little this can be removed is 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.460
 flexible can be removed by hand 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.460
 measure carefully 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.309
 good 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.619
 one 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.500
 and now he has to follow the other 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.100
 It is such 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.100
 so they can see it better 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.210
 then see how they are they should have 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.530
 have two hours of one on each 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.530
 side here is 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.210
 Now, if I get to ask any questions 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.550
 time because volkswagen did not put some 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.830
 stand or something up here I do not say for 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.260
 that is not hanging because since what 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.780
 I've known since I 've seen it and as 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.310
 I have done it in many others I do not know 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.720
 one in which there is some basis or something 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.380
 to stop it but good 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380
 I dont know 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.600
 then I will not remove it right now 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.479
 because my filter is fine 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.460
 then why should you change 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.830
 because if this filter is blocked 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.650
 there is no such thing as that the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.360
 filter this medium capped or not capped not 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.539
 no, the filter is blocked from that stage 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.850
 if it is plugged, no gasoline goes on, it does not turn on the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.200
 car and you can not move but another of 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.340
 the problems is that if it is 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.569
 dirty and happens can land can 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.489
 pass impurities of gasoline if it passes 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.920
 through here it reaches the injectors and the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.390
 injectors are plugged too and believe me is 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.040
 much cheaper to change a filter 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.030
 gasoline to send wash about 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.550
 injectors or change them 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.210
 when they take us out of the packaging 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.550
 both nozzles bring a cap of 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.890
 beule delgadito and that is to prevent 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.710
 in the during the entry that during the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.420
 transportation and the sale does not get anything at 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.920
 gasoline filter dust and so on 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.970
 etc 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.190
 I'm not going to do it but I'm going to 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.280
 tell how it is that is first 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.080
 screwdriver to remove these two and down 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.630
 a tray where you can drop gas 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.120
 because if gas is going to fall between 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.230
 from here it's going out to gas 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.880
 pressurized from the one that comes from the east not 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.680
 Well it's not pressurized but it can 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.080
 get to have some pressure comes 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.340
 of the gas pump and between 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.830
 that the filter is full of gas 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.250
 then it was going to drop gas what 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.790
 they are going to do is first they are going to remove this 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.480
 this clamp pull out the hose and from 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.190
 immediately connect this hose to the other 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.040
 to the other filter because because if 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.359
 they are going to collide gasoline 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.689
 and this at the same time when they go to 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.000
 put not take away the is the protector 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.099
 which brings this filter from the factory 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.129
 they take it off because it's going to help them 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.439
 stop gasoline they put the 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.680
 protector of forgiveness never leave it to 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:53.540
 remove then what happens how are you are 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.099
 stopping here with him 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.769
 As I told you, the cap mentioned rubber 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.950
 Factory filter my finger Quitate 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.290
 Until then, you are not going to run anything 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.060
 around here there is no such risk and only 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.970
 they will remove it until they go to 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.390
 connect this 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.180
 a lot, very, very careful, do not add 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.800
 too much pressure to this because with the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.100
 time what will happen is that as there 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.470
 too much pressure here this what is going to 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.470
 happen is that they will damage the hose and 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.480
 again time the heat and so on 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.880
 etcetera can start playing gas 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.370
 over here what happened to me happened to me 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.090
 time was that as is the filter here the 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.420
 gasoline began to fall here and started 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.010
 to drain into that hole over there 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.660
 and then he started to smell very hard in the 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.420
 gas station and I did not know why 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.490
 until I looked out then this one nothing 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.690
 more you do not have to press too much 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.400
 point is that it is firm that 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.870
 hose so there are no leaks if 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.980
 they want at once they can change the 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.650
 clamps 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.860
 this filter try to empty it very well 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.150
 of gasoline this preference has to be 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.200
 take it somewhere where they do 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
 Tunings are a mechanical workshop 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.920
 because as the filter has gas 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.870
 inside, it is very dangerous that 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.120
 leave in the trash 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.010
 then once you have ensured that 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.080
 everything is fine I know that very well so that 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.110
 before the before it is finished 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.050
 change with a towel with a towel 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.610
 of paper that is absorbent then what 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.480
 They dry very well and notice that there is no 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.510
 no drip 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.120
 and once they finish then we put 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.760
 you can put your flexible tube back 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.980
 in heating trying to make your 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.420
 filter is up 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.320
 right now if they see me something awkward because 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:41.460
 I'm having the camera but the point 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.730
 is that I think you can remove it 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.730
 as well 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.900
 somehow I hope 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:59.160
 to my hands and already once we put it 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.420
 and we make sure it is fixed 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.700
 we have finished our change 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.960
 of gasoline filter if they want to know 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.480
 the frequency of change 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.130
 check in the light in a video about 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.870
 what says important information or 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.800
 valuable information 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.650
 there's the mileage now a lot of eye 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.210
 if we are in a very dusty place and 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.170
 a lot of land and we are constantly 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.120
 contact with the earth 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.950
 miami that when camps when cast 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.810
 gasoline is not completely hermetic 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.730
 then out there dust can enter 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.670
 Earth etcetera then it's worth it 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.290
 check very well if it is possible to change it 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.760
 a little bit before the mileage that we 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.290
 indicate in this information well for 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.450
 ensure that we are not going to cover our 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.010
 our injectors and we're not going to 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.210
 Stand by a clogged filter 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.590
 true 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.570
 Well, thank you very much for watching 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.990
 I hope I serve you and see you until the 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.990
 next
