00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:10.600
The fear that getting dressed produces is something you savor, 
 because you are enjoying every moment before you bullfight

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:15.959
You dress up in lights and enter the bullring 
 , it's a strong and beautiful feeling.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:18.959
You dress up in lights and enter the bullring 
 , it's a strong and beautiful feeling.

00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:26.482
When you are entering the bullring you are saying: Here I am, 
 I have come to die to feel alive.  

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:55.670
A fighting bull's life on the ranch, if 
 it's going to fight, is four years,

00:01:56.112 --> 00:02:02.610
they live in open and ample spaces, well 
 taken care of and fed balance food.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.040
They don't artificially fatten them like cattle sold for meat.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:17.790
Cattle sold for milk live locked up in feed lots, while 
 six fighting bulls have three or four hectares to themselves

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Cattle sold for meat live on one hectare and there 
 are hundreds of them on top of each other

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.400
The grain they give them (cattle sold for meat) is artificial, full of chemicals 
 to fatten them, in two years they're ready for the slaughter house.

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:09.640
However, let me ask you: what's more cruel? To kill a 
 fattened calf for meat or to kill a fighting bull?

00:03:09.936 --> 00:03:15.340
...a fighting bull that lives three or four years until the day comes...

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.130
that it has to die, because that's the way it is.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.400
The fighting bull is like the name says, 
 a fighter, he is one more gladiator...

00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:31.880
...and the bull sold for meat, the fat bull, 
 well, he dies with no dignity at all.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:39.140
In addition to all this, a fighting bull can kill the bullfighter.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:46.350
I have to be honest,it's a spectacle where there is blood...

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:55.600
however there is a justification because the fighting bull is 
 in the plaza to die, to be sacrificed.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:05.050
If you don't like to see an animal sacrificed 
 then don't watch, but don't eat meat either...

00:04:05.274 --> 00:04:13.270
ah, you don't like to go to bullfights 
 but you like your meat and potatoes.
