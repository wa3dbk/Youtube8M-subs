00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:02.790
 the difference in performance would be much 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.180
 more if our experiment went through 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.670
 at rush hour 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.490
 m 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.949
 administration 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:13.229
 exists 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:14.909
 as steady 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.140
 consciousness of someone their drivers 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.980
 the one that generally goes to 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.900
 automatic boxes 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.730
 consider nominations from 1 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.569

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.089
 he is not given particles of speed is not given 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.349
 feel all the possible cars in my opinion 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.199
 it's not like everybody plays a car 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:29.859
 he needs 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.890
 omens comfort for me is convenience 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.019
 driving for me this driving ease 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:34.670
 although 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.970
 the ease of secretly seeming that 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.160
 in automatic in transmission too 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.770
 their 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.940
 moments of their nuances 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.040
 and in general, as one of mine said 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.380
 familiar director 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.750
 it's not only 9 6 but everything else is two 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.270
 slip you need to be specific 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.150
 for this mechanism if you understand it 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.980
 you will have fun 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.800
 let's talk about economics 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.940
 Americans who love and know how 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.130
 combine 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.320
 conducted a study of the temple scheme 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.970
 qualification conflict 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.120
 driver's gas mileage 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.380
 but if 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.400
 when to use metal band 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.010
 gasoline consumption at a price qualified 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.520
 actions 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.660
 The goal is much higher than the whole kitchen 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.560
 and then used the ability and the number 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.290
 coke 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 the difference has almost disappeared 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.690
 all american side 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.620
 clergy cad with automatic 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.700
 gear box 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.670
 you yourself can see how much 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.340
 easy and simple to drive a car with 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.240
 automatic transmission 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.080
 even may 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 can calmly lead such a scenario 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.340
 and here that they are unlikely ever 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.340
 have seen 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.680
 training so-called specials 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.359
 drivers who carry 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.459
 our government 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.599
 bank 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.600
 heavy in only four centuries 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.019
 and the same 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.359
 automatic transmission and 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.549
 who some say 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.109
 that with them their conditions she 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.799
 not offered 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.799
 reconsider 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:48.609
 it all happens at a speed of 90 x 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.059
 kilometers per hour to japan 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.939
 to 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.439
 reference 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.149
 Have an opportunity 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:23.619
 buy a car with an automatic 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:24.829
 by the box 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.409
 it was not the first place 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.399
 we all begin we wish 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.559
 no it was a holiday because 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:34.469
 I have to 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.829
 driving field wife in particular 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.829
 an atmosphere of action is expected by telephone 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.289
 and the top girl prohibits turnover 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.039
 gently and pull away 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.819
 I know that motorists who 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.399
 say no here's a manual box this 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:51.669
 when you feel the motor 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.059
 but all beautiful talk 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:55.269
 because 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.269
 machine to make the movie more comfortable 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.049
 United Russia in Odessa in the right 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.049
 direction were Brazilians 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.799
 in May 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.909
 already 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.909
 so much 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.259
 Kharkov 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.860
 3 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.370
 every moment 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.680
 around us appeared 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 that needs a lot 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.469
 so man is arranged 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:17.529
 we are all the time 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.169
 No doubt 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.789
 came up with 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.789
 called 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.740
 a monument looking back 3 thousand something from 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.550
 this event 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.819

 I am a woman 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.569
 let's get it right for me 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.469
 enjoy everyone else what does 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.069
