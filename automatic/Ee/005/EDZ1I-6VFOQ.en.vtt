00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello my dear, today I want you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.770
 show her how delicious 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.309
 meat salad with mayonnaise and not 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.750
 turned around in about five minutes 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.700
 that's easy and easy 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.369
 As always, you only need three or four 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.760
 ingredients these are already here 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.710
 you need half a meat sausage three 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.750
 castles I always like to take the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.490
 Gherkins from spreewald taste good to me 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.320
 just very very good two tablespoons 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.380
 miracle is what kind is you 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.450
 leave a pinch of pepper optional 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.910
 Can you still take tomato paprika 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.920
 parsley onions taste everything 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.649
 and everything you like in yours 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.540
 meat salad in it would have been small 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.370
 As always, I take remedies hot 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.350
 loved vig chef says me already 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.760
 has done very well in 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.920
 the last ten years 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.410
 I 'll take the pill from the first time 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 this is a poultry sausage today 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.190
 which cost two euros even one 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.780
 a little more that I think your fell 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.980
 next time I'll see if I am 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.719
 the slightly cheaper in the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.649
 self-service counter so get that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.420
 was very very much 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.640
 You have about two or three of them 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.320
 portions and my kids eat that 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.240
 currently very much like 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.939
 So I had the meat sausage in 3 to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.880
 4 rough pieces and I give then 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.619
 three gherkins as spreewald said 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.659
 I just enjoy it best 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.030
 the cucumbers that taste the best for you 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.180
 meat for these two three portions 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.830
 Salad namely three to four 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.990
 Gherkins there it does not matter if you three 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.150
 or four takes it free 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.310
 snout and free of feeling I had 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.560
 here still small grained pepper 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.119
 It was colorful pepper that had it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.829
 I have my pork fillet from the last one 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.869
 rubbed in and I still had 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.840
 What's left perfect for my meat salad 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.159
 also does chilies or tomatoes 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.530
 what you like you can do right away 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.930
 with and then you move 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.840
 ten to fifteen times around it in 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.920
 time converted about 10 seconds madness 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.920
 no effort at all 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:06.049
 the first result at the first time 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:08.149
 Look inside looks like this if that's you 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.340
 still too crude and you would like it 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.019
 fine I like it finer then 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.849
 Just cover it again and still 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.680
 stir five times six times through the 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.930
 three sharp knives in the quick boss there 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.489
 It works really great and I love it 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.440
 the part just because it is so 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.110
 so fast I like it now 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.880
 consistency so we leave that I could 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.980
 Now just leave that in the container 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.420
 nor are mirakel and cook cover 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.340
 I also have a lid on it 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.110
 so in the fridge 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.480
 but I have decided 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.440
 to use the lime because of the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.120
 just better in my fridge 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.860
 fits in and not so much space 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.450
 takes away like the big bowl whole 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.599
 I also have one for the lime 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.209
 Cover as always I link you all 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.370
 important information and the complete recipe 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.370
 again under this video in the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.069
 infobox yes now i have my little one 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.290
 shredded cucumber and meat sausage 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.720
 in the lime and that comes easy 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.060
 another two tablespoons of miracle vip or 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.010
 Another salad cream that will make you feel good 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.620
 tastes and the beautiful is you can 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.420
 How much mayonnaise you dose here 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.760
 always want to take you can too 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.530
 take less take more I like here 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.400
 two tablespoons comes in my opinion 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.230
 very good 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.639
 so you have no mayonnaise with 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.819
 meat salad but really 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.769
 meat salad with mayonnaise the whole 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.700
 Might mix well again maybe 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.100
 Season 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.079
 as I said take everything that tastes this 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.819
 that it's just a very simple one 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.530
 you can refine it with a suggestion 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.989
 all spices try it 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.000
 Chilli flakes or parsley still 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.850
 or just with paprika tastes great 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.530
 delicious and in a warm fresh stove 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.880
 rolls with us are so warm stove 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.100
 buns that always remind me 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.720
 my childhood earlier and I already have 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.519
