00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
sure my game won't be on steam so then

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.609

moving<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.970> dlc<00:01:08.970> quest<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.510> pretty<00:01:10.140> much<00:01:10.320> good

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
moving on dlc quest is pretty much good

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.250

figure<00:01:53.399> out<00:01:53.610> how<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> run<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> beta<00:01:54.570> through

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
figure out how to run a beta through

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.389 
figure out how to run a beta through
desura<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.619> looks<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> be

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
desura which looks like it's going to be

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.280 
desura which looks like it's going to be
pretty<00:01:56.520> easy<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.600> gather<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.049> some

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
pretty easy and then gather up some

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.530 
pretty easy and then gather up some
users<00:01:58.649> some<00:01:59.460> for<00:01:59.670> Windows<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.180> mostly<00:02:00.450> for

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
users some for Windows but mostly for

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.690 
users some for Windows but mostly for
Mac<00:02:00.869> because<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.159> big<00:02:02.310> unknown

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700

even<00:02:56.380> still<00:02:56.530> dlc<00:02:57.250> quests<00:02:57.580> probably<00:02:58.120> could

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
even still dlc quests probably could

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.690 
even still dlc quests probably could
have<00:02:58.330> come<00:02:58.569> out<00:02:58.690> on<00:02:58.840> pc<00:02:59.100> much<00:03:00.100> earlier<00:03:00.610> than

this and i think if you have a sure

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.840 
this and i think if you have a sure
thing<00:03:04.569> for<00:03:05.230> steam<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.739> by<00:03:06.160> sure<00:03:06.370> thing<00:03:06.610> i<00:03:06.730> mean

thing for steam and by sure thing i mean
like<00:03:07.060> you've<00:03:07.870> already<00:03:08.140> talked<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.590> valve<00:03:08.860> and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
like you've already talked to valve and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.380 
like you've already talked to valve and
they're<00:03:09.250> like<00:03:09.400> yeah<00:03:09.430> we'd<00:03:09.790> love<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:10.090> sell<00:03:10.239> your

game if you have that kind of a sure

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.699 
game if you have that kind of a sure
thing<00:03:12.160> then<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.090> makes<00:03:13.269> sense<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.810> make<00:03:14.500> all

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
thing then it makes sense to make all

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.039 
thing then it makes sense to make all
your<00:03:14.860> launch<00:03:15.100> plans<00:03:15.489> revolve<00:03:16.030> around<00:03:16.239> when<00:03:16.930> it

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
your launch plans revolve around when it

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.910 
your launch plans revolve around when it
gets<00:03:17.200> released<00:03:17.410> on<00:03:17.739> steam<00:03:18.510> otherwise<00:03:19.510> i<00:03:19.959> don't

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
gets released on steam otherwise i don't

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.400 
gets released on steam otherwise i don't
know<00:03:21.070> that<00:03:21.100> it's<00:03:21.459> worth<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:21.880> because<00:03:22.320> when<00:03:23.320> you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
know that it's worth it because when you

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.620 
know that it's worth it because when you
pitch<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.709> game<00:03:23.829> steam<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:25.000> have<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.299> make<00:03:25.420> sure

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
pitch a game steam you have to make sure

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.449 
pitch a game steam you have to make sure
that<00:03:25.810> your<00:03:25.959> game<00:03:26.110> is<00:03:26.320> basically<00:03:26.709> finished

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
that your game is basically finished

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.280 
that your game is basically finished
they're<00:03:28.150> willing<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.480> look<00:03:28.660> at<00:03:28.870> slightly

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
they're willing to look at slightly

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.110 
they're willing to look at slightly
unfinished<00:03:29.860> games<00:03:30.040> but<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.459> has<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.610> be<00:03:30.760> very

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
unfinished games but it has to be very

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.780 
unfinished games but it has to be very
close<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.480> finished<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.650> can't<00:03:32.980> show<00:03:33.519> them

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
close to finished so you can't show them

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.819 
close to finished so you can't show them
something<00:03:34.060> partway<00:03:34.720> through<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.049> project<00:03:35.590> and

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
something partway through a project and

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.800 
something partway through a project and
then<00:03:35.950> continue<00:03:36.880> working<00:03:37.090> on<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.510> while<00:03:37.660> you

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
then continue working on it while you

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.509 
then continue working on it while you
wait<00:03:37.959> for<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.260> response<00:03:38.440> because<00:03:39.220> you'll<00:03:39.370> get

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
wait for a response because you'll get

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.699 
wait for a response because you'll get
something<00:03:39.760> back<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.120> just<00:03:40.359> says<00:03:40.660> no<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.590> you

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
something back that just says no and you

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.199 
something back that just says no and you
won't<00:03:41.890> know<00:03:42.070> if<00:03:42.190> it's<00:03:42.250> because<00:03:42.430> your<00:03:42.760> concept

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
won't know if it's because your concept

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.390 
won't know if it's because your concept
was<00:03:43.329> no<00:03:43.480> good<00:03:43.690> or<00:03:44.079> if<00:03:44.260> your<00:03:44.650> implementation

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
was no good or if your implementation

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.370 
was no good or if your implementation
that<00:03:45.609> you<00:03:45.820> sent<00:03:46.090> them<00:03:46.239> just<00:03:46.299> wasn't<00:03:47.079> up<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.260> par

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
that you sent them just wasn't up to par

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.009 
that you sent them just wasn't up to par
so<00:03:47.859> I<00:03:48.370> will<00:03:48.640> continue<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.120> submit<00:03:49.450> future

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
so I will continue to submit future

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.410 
so I will continue to submit future
games<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.530> steam<00:03:50.769> if<00:03:51.579> I<00:03:51.850> think<00:03:52.150> they<00:03:52.269> have<00:03:52.299> a

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
games to steam if I think they have a

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.300 
games to steam if I think they have a
chance<00:03:52.510> but<00:03:53.500> i<00:03:53.530> don't<00:03:53.680> think<00:03:53.890> i'm<00:03:54.130> going<00:03:54.250> to

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
chance but i don't think i'm going to

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.860 
chance but i don't think i'm going to
wait<00:03:54.489> around<00:03:54.609> for<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.060> response<00:03:55.450> anymore

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
wait around for a response anymore

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.830 
wait around for a response anymore
either<00:03:56.410> i'll<00:03:56.739> try<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.040> send<00:03:57.310> them<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:58.540> far<00:03:58.780> in

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
either i'll try to send them so far in
