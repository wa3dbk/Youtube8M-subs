00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.590
 hello to those staff nou and today I will 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.790
 bring a video talking about the legends of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.610
 gta 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.449
 first of all i'll say sorry 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.850
 for the lack of 2010 these last weeks 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.810
 and in this video and to use my voice 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.070
 normal 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.910
 so let's go practically almost everyone 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.050
 play the gta sandwich the bread - 1 saw speak 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.649
 about it 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.770
 I already played gt 2 that the blood of the mothers 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.370
 the years I already coastal one of the best 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.149
 franchise games at least for me and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.629
 the stresses of gt the years is not compared 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.760
 the same amount of debut in gt so 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.980
 so let's go to our first lena 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.070
 exactly on this point of the map 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.609
 if you go there you will find a 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.890
 person on the side of the road with 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.220
 a camera that person can 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:14.340
 be random as this time was a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:19.290
 typical an old evil they hit the photo and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.140
 is going straight to the sea and so 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.370
 drowned 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.900
 what happens as it is at this point in the 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.880
 map 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:36.050
 they look for the nearest sidewalk 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.920
 in this case and on the other side of the river and 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.500
 so it ends up in the water and dies 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.590
 something quite interesting is 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:52.130
 point on the map that is considered 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:55.610
 more a bug than a legend that kind of 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.479
 you come in with a van exactly 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.140
 on this lake or any vehicle 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:09.800
 she and the cids do not show up when you 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:12.350
 look over but if you look through 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:19.280
 below the water if you can see the vehicle 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:23.890
 but if you turn the camera up you 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.890
 over the water you will not 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:32.120
 and if you're capable and of the vehicle you 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.819
 will see the gay eyelash is coming out of nowhere 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.659
 but the truck did not 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.659
 pops up 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:48.139
 but even if you can not see appel 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.250
 sigeia interacts with the vehicle and fled on 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.810
 grenade 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.359
 This one I messed up but I got it right. 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:01.269
 exploded hood explode again 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.269
 who went to bonache and then her feet 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:09.230
 another legend stays and safilo can be 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:13.400
 in any part of his faithful near the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.989
 but it has to be usually ours and 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.989
 at that exact location 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:26.569
 if it's dark and cloudy 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.939
 you heard listen to 111 and the noise 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:34.509
 of a boat 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:34.509
 in this boat and shampoo as a ghost ship 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:00.220
 where the boat sounds in directions 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:07.630
 where there is nothing 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:12.710
 the next legend is near area 51 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.160
 there will have a dill type a hole and a 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:21.769
 pick one side and inside the hole 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:25.430
 I get several bags that are already 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:29.000
 girls who are ropes 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.110
 nobody knows why these bodies 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.730
 they are there 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.860
 some say it's area 51 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.580
 but simply this is a case that 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.010
 probably will not have a solution because 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.590
 probably rockstar put the 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:54.170
 just to make us curious 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:58.040
 this is more of a bug than a legend 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.270
 if you freak out more suited to the moon and 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.050
 shoot 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:06.080
 I do not say if you shoot her, it's going to increase. 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:11.260
 If you take the aim, it will continue. 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.260
 same way the last shot was 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.190
 So a video of today ends here. 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.300
 If you like what you are and want to see more 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:26.390
 videos to write if that wanted what 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.510
 I made the other video talking about 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:36.730
 some easter eggs from gta san andreas 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:36.730
 only comment ii on the description then spoke
