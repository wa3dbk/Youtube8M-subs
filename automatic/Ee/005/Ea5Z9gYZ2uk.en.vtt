00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.930
 ohrenet what's going on all day 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.349
 quite a while ago we had no such 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.290
 hour holivar perhaps fights 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.519
 Andrew nifodova Yuri Khovanskii well, 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.080
 now on different sides of the barricades 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.100
 proved to be Andrei Nifedov Ilya Madisson 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.310
 sometimes convinced that our 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.039
 there is no internet audience 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.990
 objective position that is, people tend 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.750
 listen to the opinion of only one 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 your own idol for example or 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.810
 Madison or Andrei Nifedov given 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.170
 that is, if Andrei says that 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.360
 and I'm not a stork hamster a little bit a group 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.960
 said so she eat hamsters from camp 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.700
 Andrei Nefedova will run the camp or 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.370
 Madison to breed srach 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.670
 if i say something not very flattering and in 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.690
 Andrei Nefedov's address is the same 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.000
 most hamsters from camp or maize 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.610
 will lead into the camp andrey nifedov breed 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.440
 srach and precisely srach because differently 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.630
 I won't name it 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.800
 because it all comes down comments 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.479
 in the spirit of shit everything you do full 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.510
 shit nobody is interested and 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.770
 will delete your channel on youtube and friends 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.890
 mine if nobody was interested 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.869
 then these people would not have talented 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.130
 people please notice talented people and 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:35.990
 she is both of them signed but there would be no 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.790
 millions of subscribers and to someone it means 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.040
 it 's still interesting if you 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.259
 interesting just don't watch these videos 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.440
 must not be diluted and similar srach but 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.440
 it won't prove it to anyone 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.830
 at least stupid but so here again 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.170
 I repeat 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.840
 talented people because i'm signed 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:59.390
 these two wonderful people write 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.850
 The institution wrote a lot of people that I 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.789
 somehow negative attitude to il 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.479
 Maddison is nothing like that I am very 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:11.060
 respect the opinion of this person is a person 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.100
 who somehow influenced my 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.890
 present life even so to speak because 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.750
 that I have been watching his work for a long time and in 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.709
 I became involved in video blogging 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.450
 watching a video or mason sam nickel and 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.700
 many other bloggers 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.740
 so here I am still signed or have 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.600
 Mason signed by many others 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.560
 great bloggers and i hate 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.550
 when such holivars begin 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.100
 initially my position was generally 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.730
 neutral neutral i just don't 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.340
 I love when as I said when 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.430
 liza someone else's privacy though maybe 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.010
 Yes, we must admit that Andrei can be 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.480
 too little 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.400
 a little more than you should advertise your 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.849
 personal life sooner or later this could 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.870
 to begin 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.580
 but I do not like when there climb such 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.459
 people are all the more like Ilya Madison about 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.510
 oh my god i am like some schoolchildren 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.299
 become like let's say some 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.379
 students developed doctor aimn spread 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:16.849
 urgent so that's what i want to tell everyone 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:19.519
 these have your head on your shoulders and not 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.269
 need to adapt to someone else's opinion about 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.340
 Yes, and here I told you that I am very 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.980
 good attitude to Andrey since Ilya 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.680
 if Andrei wrote the same thing in 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.890
 address or and Ksyush for example I would tell him 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.019
 I wrote like a horseradish 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.959
 doing this kind of garbage is not yours 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.910
 Deal and here is but in this case somehow 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.400
 initiated this conflict 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.890
 Ilya and therefore I am forced to even a little 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.840
 support Andrei in this case 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.780
 in general my position is neutral just not 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.500
 love when there is no other's privacy 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.430
 I already said forced to apologize to 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.540
 pink clinker film kiram 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.970
 hard to pronounce so want to say and 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.750
 gray honestly the word is true and here I am 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:12.379
 slightly incorrectly entered calling him 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.500
 signature breathe and here I bring my 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:18.109
 changes i know if i am wrong 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.150
 i always apologize so i have to 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.220
 to apologize 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.850
 yes as you see all bloggers absolutely 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.700
 anyway familiar with andrew or 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:32.780
 madison has affected this conflict 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.840
 unfortunately everyone has been touched everywhere 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.530
 srach we are going on like a video 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.570
 Andrei and under the video or we are clear 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.030
 it comes to ridiculous just I already wrote 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.130
 on the wall of funny cases 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.900
 of today that I say again 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:55.610
 keep your brains under no one 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.729
 adjust myself here too for example not 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.460
 always agree with Andrei please note 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:05.300
 for example i don't like when he 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.000
 thumps again in his videos because 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.110
 my younger brother for example is watching him 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.110
 school of bloggers and 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.560
 I do not like it but if a person 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.110
 have a head on my shoulders like my brother 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.500
 again he will not go after that after 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.740
 video Andryukha plump padike with his 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.900
 friends you must have your opinion 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.120
 you must not adapt to anyone 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.949
 have your head on your shoulders precisely to 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.710
 this i urge you dear friends not 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:41.610
 it is necessary to rush into madness like this 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:46.560
 fight not understanding true picture of events 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:49.259
 here and I urge you my friends all 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.250
 just a camera friends my friendship is 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:56.819
 magic see understand love your neighbor 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.009
 its not necessary to go breeding srach it 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.710
 happening now it's just not puke 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.900
 studied it terribly did not ask for what 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:08.340
 Now I'm going to hate such here 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.860
 conflict situations here and wish you 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.430

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.370

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.879
 and with you there was a tribute to new meetings and 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.879
 until
