 one more news from germany today at 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.200
 upset feelings are discussing millions 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.630
 those who are eager to get new ones in the iphone 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.370
 5s just three days as received in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.009
 sale to a group of hackers 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.199
 managed to crack the fingerprint scanner 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.779
 fingers which was considered the main chip 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.000
 coveted gadgets and command on the case 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.580
 smart phones super protect wait for lenovo 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.289
 get around this breakthrough technology like 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.849
 reportedly succeeded with the help of henchmen 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.490
 means and long known method 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.410
 having made a simple model but sales 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.210
 The new iphone is all unlikely to be affected and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.280
 plans to buy combat without any 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.290
 new hacker however claims that 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320
 They had a completely different purpose. Alexander 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.180
 Kalinin with details deceive the most 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.860
 the sensitive place of the new iphone is not 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.870
 so difficult some special 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.610
 funds do not need everything you need 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.680
 can be found even in a regular office 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.110
 will need a fingerprint here 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.219
 for example on the kettle a camera and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.320
 laser printer 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.940
 German hackers show how everyone 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.550
 just need to make an imprint first 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.410
 visible powder or ordinary powder 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.030
 super glue then making your way 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.739
 take pictures of the image clean 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.110
 Photoshop and print on a laser printer 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.270
 toner forms on paper a relief with 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.740
 which and make a fake impression of him 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.930
 puts on any finger and voila 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.240
 famous sensor defeated hackers 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.220
 summarize hope it will end 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.640
 all the illusions around biometric 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.740
 data 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.630
 it's just stupid to use for 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.460
 protect what you can't change yes 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.350
 still constantly leave anywhere 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.299
 apple long berths potential 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.320
 buyers of new smartphones sensor 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.840
 fingerprint 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.700
 promising simple but reliable protection now 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.590
 this virtue has turned into flaw 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.420
 however, it is not necessary to be upset 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.189
 users are serious about 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.560
 information security was understood from the very beginning 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.119
 Tachadi sensor is rather a toy and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.670
 marketing move than reliable means 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.100
 volume not any scanner can be hacked 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.860
 it all depends on the technology that will take 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.770
 the manufacturer applies I don't think that 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.520
 iphone did something bad he put in 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.590
 the scanner in the new model seems 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.650
 deciding to give the user maximum 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.570
 convenience because this phone is it 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.690
 all the same 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.729
 personal belongings blame the manufacturer for 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.590
 that he used this particular 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.780
 I think the technology is not worth it 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.760
 experts say biometric sensors 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.410
 guarantees anything but protection 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.030
 Information in one of the schools of Ufa 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.010
 few years ago restored beat 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.140
 small turnstiles schoolchildren were losing all the time 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.120
 passes and fingers are always with them 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.860
 but the system has not justified the sensors 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.540
 often wrong and children could not get 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.760
 to school besides total surveillance 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.920
 caused a flurry of indignation because after 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.320
 each parent read is sent 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.060
 with MSK, the child entered the school or left 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.070
 she eventually returned to the usual 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.080
 magnetic cards in france experience 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.739
 turned out to be more successful there in one of 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.660
 supermarkets 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.489
 fingerprints replaced money and 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.410
 credit cards put your finger to 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.690
 terminal and purchase is robed when we 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.510
 leave fingerprints it is not clear 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.730
 he is most often blurry blurred and so 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.170
 further and find exactly the quality from 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.420
 fingers on which based on 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.450
 the basis of which you can make such 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.730
 the key to your door is extremely hard 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.620
 St. Petersburg deputy vitaliya milonova all 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.269
 this i biometric hype pushes 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.070
 on his conspiracy thoughts 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.480
 he does not advise colleagues to civil servants 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.070
 use new iphone 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.570
 at least until 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.260
 the device will not check the Russian 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.070
 special services 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.959
 if any blonde little Lena 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.130
 send pictures of his beloved 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.350
 dog Jojo 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.760
 then there is no little secret in it 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.470
 no one wants to watch but if 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.349
 military official will 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.909
 tell some plans and you can 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.439
 will instantly identify by 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.390
 his fingerprint and instantly 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.230
 understand that this guy is interesting to us 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.459
 It turns out the picture that we are in 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.750
 separated 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.220
 glass and mirror walls only with 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.110
 our country, it is opaque 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.000
 she can watch us all 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.069
 fingerprint your smartphone this 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.200
 certainly tempting something kind of revived 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.329
 Hollywood fiction but everything in life 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.980
 much easier and to penetrate hits 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.049
 secrets do not have to be
