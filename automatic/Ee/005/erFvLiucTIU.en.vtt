pretty<00:01:19.650> great<00:01:19.860> looking<00:01:20.250> figure<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.880> I

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
pretty great looking figure but I

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.429 
pretty great looking figure but I

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
sure you've all heard this before my

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.749 
sure you've all heard this before my
only<00:01:25.200> real<00:01:25.439> problems<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.009> figure<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
only real problems of the figure are the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.969 
only real problems of the figure are the
lake<00:01:26.909> joints<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.810> don't<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.140> how<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
lake joints I just don't like how the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
lake joints I just don't like how the
leg<00:01:29.210> swings<00:01:30.210> out<00:01:30.390> into<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> side<00:01:30.900> although

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
leg swings out into the side although

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.920 
leg swings out into the side although
it's<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.560> huge<00:01:31.799> issue<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.780> wish

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
it's not a huge issue and I really wish

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.420 
it's not a huge issue and I really wish
you<00:01:34.110> would<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.350> had<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> peg<00:01:34.950> hole<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
you would have had a peg hole in the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.020 
you would have had a peg hole in the
back<00:01:36.110> now<00:01:37.110> y<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> series<00:01:38.549> 6<00:01:38.850> i'm

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
back now y so this is the series 6 i'm

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.420 
back now y so this is the series 6 i'm
like<00:01:39.180> 95%<00:01:40.110> sure<00:01:40.170> one<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.710> advice<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:40.950> loose

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
like 95% sure one for advice and loose

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
like 95% sure one for advice and loose
never<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.030> hundred<00:01:42.630> percent<00:01:42.720> sure<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.409> i

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
never a hundred percent sure but i

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.800 
never a hundred percent sure but i
believe<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.880> only<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.360> that's<00:01:45.570> sort

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
believe this is the only one that's sort

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.359 
believe this is the only one that's sort
of<00:01:45.840> out<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.500> got<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.920> level<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
of out that it's got this level of

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.280 
of out that it's got this level of
articulation<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.950> pretty<00:01:49.950> sure<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.990> terms<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
articulation so pretty sure in terms of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.679 
articulation so pretty sure in terms of
paint<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:53.280> mostly<00:01:53.579> solid<00:01:54.000> tones<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.479> it's

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
paint it's mostly solid tones like it's

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.530 
paint it's mostly solid tones like it's
a<00:01:54.780> solid<00:01:54.990> brown<00:01:55.320> here<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.329> you've<00:01:57.329> got<00:01:57.509> some

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
a solid brown here then you've got some

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.230 
a solid brown here then you've got some
paint<00:01:57.869> variation<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> top<00:01:59.280> where

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
paint variation up here on the top where

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.639

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
appearance here where it's just like a

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.630 
appearance here where it's just like a
little<00:02:18.150> cheap<00:02:18.390> black<00:02:18.660> lines<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.770> made<00:02:20.489> you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
little cheap black lines but I made you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.000 
little cheap black lines but I made you
like<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.000> first<00:02:21.330> appearance<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.140> paint

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
like the first appearance is paint

like the first appearance is paint
variation<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.880> actual<00:02:24.120> costume<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.780> bit

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
variation on the actual costume a bit

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.259 
variation on the actual costume a bit
more<00:02:27.470> um<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.709> terms<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:29.069> articulation<00:02:29.819> by<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
more um in terms of articulation by the

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:37.930 
more um in terms of articulation by the
way<00:02:30.830> difficult<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:36.060> very<00:02:36.300> nice<00:02:36.480> headsculpt

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
way difficult the very nice headsculpt

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.250 
way difficult the very nice headsculpt
in<00:02:38.940> terms<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.269> articulation<00:02:39.959> he<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.200> a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
in terms of articulation he is a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.020 
in terms of articulation he is a
floating<00:02:40.709> shoulder<00:02:41.160> which<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.519> pretty<00:02:41.670> cool

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
floating shoulder which is pretty cool

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.259 
floating shoulder which is pretty cool
but<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:43.349> arm<00:02:43.590> doesn't<00:02:44.220> sort<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.790> link<00:02:45.090> in

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
but the arm doesn't sort of link in

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.750 
but the arm doesn't sort of link in
properly<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.319> um<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.830> mean<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:47.700> just

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
properly so just um I mean it's just

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.190 
properly so just um I mean it's just
like<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.150> takes<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.480> lot<00:02:48.569> of<00:02:48.600> effort<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.080> move

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
like it takes a lot of effort to move

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.520 
like it takes a lot of effort to move
the<00:02:49.410> arm<00:02:49.880> just<00:02:50.880> kind<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.180> downer<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.600> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
the arm just kind of a downer but the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.890 
the arm just kind of a downer but the
floating<00:02:52.980> shoulder<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.819> just<00:02:54.060> essential<00:02:54.630> for

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
floating shoulder is just essential for

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.690 
floating shoulder is just essential for
a<00:02:55.080> lot<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.620> these<00:02:55.739> poses<00:02:56.069> where<00:02:56.459> he's<00:02:56.580> like

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
a lot of these poses where he's like

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.009 
a lot of these poses where he's like
leaping<00:02:57.000> at<00:02:57.299> somebody<00:02:57.720> or<00:02:57.780> anything<00:02:59.840> but<00:03:00.840> on

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
leaping at somebody or anything but on

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.809 
leaping at somebody or anything but on
terms<00:03:01.410> articulation<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:02.430> have<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:04.819> particular

doesn't whoops um app / diaphragm joint
it<00:03:53.090> means<00:03:53.360> more<00:03:53.570> of<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.720> torso<00:03:54.230> actually

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
it means more of a torso actually

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.400 
it means more of a torso actually
because<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.190> whole<00:03:55.370> thing<00:03:55.640> rotates<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:57.230> go

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
because the whole thing rotates and go

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.050 
because the whole thing rotates and go
360<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.580> waist<00:03:58.790> also<00:03:59.180> can<00:03:59.360> go<00:03:59.480> 360<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.000> get

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
360 the waist also can go 360 so you get

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.910 
360 the waist also can go 360 so you get
some<00:04:02.240> funky<00:04:02.480> poses<00:04:02.990> out<00:04:03.140> of<00:04:03.260> that<00:04:05.320> leg<00:04:06.320> /<00:04:06.560> hips

a<00:04:07.100> little<00:04:08.500> let<00:04:09.500> me<00:04:09.530> does<00:04:09.920> do<00:04:10.430> what<00:04:10.580> it's

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
a little let me does do what it's

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.190 
a little let me does do what it's
supposed<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:11.300> but<00:04:11.540> just<00:04:11.720> takes<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:12.020> lot<00:04:12.170> of

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
supposed to but just takes a lot of

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.810 
supposed to but just takes a lot of
effort<00:04:12.500> for<00:04:12.530> some<00:04:12.800> reason<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.280> know<00:04:13.340> maybe<00:04:13.640> it's

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
effort for some reason I know maybe it's

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.380 
effort for some reason I know maybe it's
just<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.090> condition<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.600> figures<00:04:14.930> in<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:17.239> of

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
just the condition the figures in and of

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.970 
just the condition the figures in and of
course<00:04:17.739> this<00:04:18.739> can<00:04:18.920> rotate<00:04:19.370> if<00:04:20.620> put<00:04:21.620> your<00:04:21.799> nail

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
course this can rotate if put your nail

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.170 
course this can rotate if put your nail
on<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.190> joint<00:04:22.520> but<00:04:22.790> I<00:04:23.030> don't<00:04:23.600> want<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.810> do<00:04:23.870> that
