 color is the flavor then I looked at the 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.310
 technique for lasagna is the following 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:25.180

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.710
 here in our day 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.520
 we continue with another sheet of pasta 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.250
 previously cooked and al dente 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:14.530

 more than that we can put here cheese 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:34.230

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.360

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.760

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:12.010
