00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.110
 Hello everyone I'm from +6 basket begin 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.990
 this time I bring you a video of 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.879
 questions and answers throughout the 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.920
 I've been receiving a lot of time 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.960
 your questions I wanted to make a 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.880
 compilation answering some of 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.830
 I encourage you to send me more 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.199
 questions in case I do a second part 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.359
 thank you very much before you start 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.910
 answer questions I encourage you to see 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.980
 my last blog is a very special blog 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.840
 where I talk about lebron james and the 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.880
 day I could meet him in people 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.940
 in a blog that I think you'll like a lot 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.690
 and now your first question is without 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.210
 no order 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.060
 I'm going to say nivelan cavaliers san 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.680
 antonio spurs golden state-warriors 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.470
 angels clippers and other forms city 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.080
 thunder the caps come back again with 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.870
 that very interesting project in the form of 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.600
 big three sky by irving lebron james and 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.940
 kevin also have more 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.379
 players is not just this district 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.110
 they have complementary players 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.450
 that can help them a lot 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.159
 antonio go back to the load 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.159
 if they had ever left 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.560
 they are candidates to all having a good 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.750
 Team with Tony Parker and Ginobili Kawaii 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.390
 leonard tim duncan if we add to this 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.860
 to lamarcus aldridge and also the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.480
 coach that they have that is a teacher 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.170
 that knows how to complement the 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.780
 pieces 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.480
 gregg popovich and from there something can come out 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.670
 very good something very interesting maybe 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.370
 we could talk about another ring the 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.560
 stars are candidates for all 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.900
 warriors and they did a great season and 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.270
 this year they continue to have very good 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.820
 Players also have the stake 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.200
 tip en garde and with this player everything is 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.030
 possible 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.190
 The thunder have one of the best 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.740
 couples of all the friend russell 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.390
 westbrook and kevin during players 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.940
 that could be live and every season 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.280
 if they wanted to like drums 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.590
 lethal with a lot of character and who want 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.630
 win at all costs if the injuries 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.940
 respect this team could win the 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.280
 ring also have good pieces 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.190
 secondary like enes kánter or sergi 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.770
 ibaka and finally the angels clippers 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.530
 this year to see if another 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.360
 Pasito surprise us a little more 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.290
 They have a core of players very 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.350
 good and very interesting chris paul 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.040
 reding jamal crawford oblivion 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.040
 Andrew 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.560
 I really want to see the 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.750
 milwaukee bucks from a team that 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.550
 last season he already did very well and 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.920
 this year I'm sure they will do it a lot 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.560
 better because it's a project with many 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.989
 young people very good and trained 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.090
 by Jason Kidd a coach that looks 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.160
 that is doing very well in addition to 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.060
 that team has great players 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.060
 with a lot of future 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.160
 and that they will win another ring again 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.230
 they need time since a few 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.480
 seasons began this process of 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.310
 reconstruction and at the moment they already count 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.380
 with young players of much future 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.040
 like russell 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.040
 or clarkson 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.300
 the very good players and with a lot 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.920
 quality 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.860
 my favorite to win the rookie of the year 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.960
 it's go for an inside player that to me 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.090
 it reminds me of white team 50 with 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.280
 very good movements in the post and that 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.910
 can dominate the league okafor has a 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.910
 bright future 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.620
 I want to see two players who 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.570
 they come from the ac 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.850
 mario gerson ya and kristaps for thing 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.520
 it's already a very young player 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.410
 talented and high quality but 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.070
 Sometimes her head plays tricks 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.880
 if Mario concentrates 100% and grows as 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.250
 eye player sonia can be very good at 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.980
 reference to porfin guix is a player 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.570
 which measures 2 meters 15 even more is 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.330
 very high I have seen it live and 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.670
 Surprise is very high although it is very 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.100
 thin by the air in the nba always 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.260
 the physical yeah works very well 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.140
 and after a few years they become 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.250
 Authentic cabinets is also very fast 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.850
 He is agile and has a very good hand 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.850
 here 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.240
 in doubt ray allen the maximum triplist of 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.400
 the whole story of the nba has a shot 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.469
 very fast and a shot that transmits a lot 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.360
 trust and always in the moments 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:40.849
 key our triples that give the 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:43.580
 victory I am not from any team I am a 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.590
 great fan of the nba I like them all but 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.990
 If I have to choose one, I would choose the 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.180
 san antonio spurs is a team with a 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.120
 game philosophy that I love is a 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.099
 very colorful game with many passes 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.349
 you can always take this last step that 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.270
 facilitate the basket they achieve without any 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.879
 problem there are no individualities 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.650
 and that's why the experts are one of 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:07.569
 the best teams in all of history 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.129
 he is a good physicist of lebron james 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.289
 winning character of kobe bryant you 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.900
 talent of Michael Jordan has the magic 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.210
 of magic johnson the intelligence of 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.250
 steve nash the dolls of stephen cardinal 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:25.699
 and the dominant power of shaquille o'neal 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:27.680
 and Bryant is a big fan of the club and he does 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.569
 Little said he would love to finish his 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:35.330
 career in that team 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:37.429
 possible next to valverdón that yes only 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.159
 can choose young people I would build my 

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:42.649
 team around anthony davis a 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.879
 very young player with a lot of future and who 

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:45.740
 has already shown that it is one of the 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.330
 best of the nba and that you can 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.249
 turn into something else 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.229
 Kobe Bryant said that Davis has the 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:52.819
 talent in quality to become 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.909
 in one of the largest of all the 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:54.909
 history 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.849
 wimax and minnesota timberwolves two of 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:04.099
 teams two projects with young people 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.180
 talented who want to do something 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.180
 important in this life 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:13.729
 recently there was a virtual video between 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.740
 shaquille o'neal and scottie pippen with him 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.349
 he said that the best quintet of the lakers 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.389
 I would win from Paris to the bulls I would not 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.099
 I know if there would be much difference but what 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.089
 that I do know is that it would be an authentic 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.889
 great match 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:27.399
 my vote also goes for the quintet of 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.399
 the Lakers 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.749
 both are great players both have 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:36.939
 been champions in viby all-star between 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:39.430
 other many more things if I have to 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:41.740
 choose one I choose tim duncan one of 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.870
 the favorite players tankan in a 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.210
 very calm player very calm that not 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.060
 they make too much noise but the view is 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.860
 lethal tankan for me and for many of 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.999
 you are surely the best 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.999
 power forward of all history 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:01.379
 gregg popovich a basketball master 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.379
 a legend of the nba 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:13.889
 I think it's more likely to touch you 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.229
 the lottery this has been all I hope that 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:17.940
 I liked you, I would appreciate it very much 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:20.340
