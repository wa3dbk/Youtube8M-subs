00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.359 
flag rest ligand that for a couple of
reasons<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.570> think<00:00:15.780> all<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.230> know<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:17.160> have

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
reasons I think all of you know we have

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.400 
reasons I think all of you know we have
a<00:00:17.670> ancient<00:00:17.970> tradition<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.750> pushy<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.230> this

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
a ancient tradition of pushy in this

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.010 
a ancient tradition of pushy in this
country<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.609> permeates<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.480> corners

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
country and that permeates all corners

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.679 
country and that permeates all corners
of<00:00:22.080> our<00:00:22.380> lab<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.210> an<00:00:24.359> extension

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
of our lab and so this is an extension

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.109

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
of that but second I think also the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.509 
of that but second I think also the
recent<00:00:27.510> years<00:00:27.750> our<00:00:28.050> wrestlers<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.710> our<00:00:28.980> boxes

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
recruit from the country so i think our

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.490 
recruit from the country so i think our
first<00:04:33.370> step<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.639> to<00:04:33.849> see<00:04:34.150> what<00:04:34.300> we<00:04:34.419> can<00:04:34.630> get<00:04:34.780> see
