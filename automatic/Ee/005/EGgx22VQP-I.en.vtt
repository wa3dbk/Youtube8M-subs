guitar you know Kenny Baker was a fiddle
player<00:00:47.290> so<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:49.000> it's<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.690> one<00:00:49.870> that<00:00:50.079> starts

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
player so and it's the one that starts

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.020 
player so and it's the one that starts
on<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:50.800> third<00:00:51.010> string<00:00:51.340> here<00:00:51.610> and<00:00:51.640> it<00:00:51.790> sounds

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
on the third string here and it sounds

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.369 
on the third string here and it sounds

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.229 

so<00:00:56.679> we'll<00:00:57.010> walk<00:00:57.190> through<00:00:57.219> that<00:00:57.519> slow<00:00:57.789> step<00:00:58.210> by

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
so we'll walk through that slow step by

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.819 
so we'll walk through that slow step by
step<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:58.839> see<00:00:59.140> if<00:00:59.230> we<00:00:59.320> can<00:00:59.469> get<00:00:59.559> it<00:00:59.649> figured

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
step and see if we can get it figured

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.360 
step and see if we can get it figured
out<00:01:01.079> okay<00:01:02.079> so<00:01:02.109> I'm<00:01:02.379> going<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.589> walk<00:01:03.190> you

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
through this lick here and I'll be doing

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.789 
through this lick here and I'll be doing
so<00:01:06.939> I'll<00:01:07.330> be<00:01:07.540> trying<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.080> get<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.229> strings<00:01:08.560> up

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
so I'll be trying to get the strings up

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.830 
so I'll be trying to get the strings up
here<00:01:09.040> on<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.909> neck<00:01:10.090> so<00:01:10.299> you<00:01:10.360> can<00:01:10.540> see<00:01:10.659> which

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
here on the neck so you can see which

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.690 
here on the neck so you can see which
which<00:01:11.170> strand<00:01:11.439> hit<00:01:11.680> at<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.890> same<00:01:11.950> time<00:01:12.310> as<00:01:12.490> the

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
which strand hit at the same time as the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.749 
which strand hit at the same time as the
fingering<00:01:14.159> naturally<00:01:15.159> you<00:01:15.280> would<00:01:15.430> want<00:01:15.670> to

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
fingering naturally you would want to

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.070 
fingering naturally you would want to
play<00:01:16.060> it<00:01:16.180> like<00:01:16.330> this<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.630> want<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.810> play<00:01:16.960> with

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
your hand closer back to working bridge

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.550 
your hand closer back to working bridge
but<00:01:18.759> it's<00:01:19.450> just<00:01:19.539> so<00:01:19.659> we've<00:01:19.810> seen<00:01:20.049> in<00:01:20.110> context

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
but it's just so we've seen in context

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.440 
but it's just so we've seen in context
what's<00:01:20.710> going<00:01:20.920> on<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.549> lick<00:01:21.759> starts<00:01:22.240> on<00:01:22.360> the

same string which is a b-flat note and

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.520 
same string which is a b-flat note and
you're<00:01:38.619> going<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.770> slide<00:01:39.130> into<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.909> B<00:01:40.090> note

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
you're going to slide into the B note

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.120 
you're going to slide into the B note
like<00:01:41.530> this<00:01:43.319> and<00:01:44.319> what<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.500> slide<00:01:44.740> is<00:01:44.920> you're

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
like this and what a slide is you're

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.949 
like this and what a slide is you're
getting<00:01:45.340> two<00:01:45.700> notes<00:01:45.970> essentially<00:01:46.509> with<00:01:46.659> one

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
getting two notes essentially with one

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.309 
getting two notes essentially with one
stroke<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:47.740> pick<00:01:47.979> so<00:01:48.990> I'll<00:01:49.990> be<00:01:50.110> picking

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
stroke of the pick so I'll be picking

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.639 
stroke of the pick so I'll be picking
that<00:01:50.500> fretted<00:01:51.220> note

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that fretted note

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.590 
that fretted note
and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:53.100> keeping<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.759> downward<00:01:54.179> pressure<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and then keeping a downward pressure I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.419 
and then keeping a downward pressure I
just<00:01:54.869> moved<00:01:55.079> my<00:01:55.200> hand<00:01:55.469> up<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:55.950> next<00:01:56.130> fret

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
just moved my hand up to the next fret

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.169 
just moved my hand up to the next fret
which<00:01:57.149> gives<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.539> nice<00:01:58.789> slurred<00:01:59.789> sound

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
which gives you a nice slurred sound

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.950 
which gives you a nice slurred sound
kind<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:03.060> play<00:02:03.240> those<00:02:03.479> three<00:02:03.659> notes<00:02:03.780> in

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
kind of so to play those three notes in

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.880 
kind of so to play those three notes in
context<00:02:04.439> would<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:09.259> following<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:10.709> just

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
context would be following that we just

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.650 
context would be following that we just
kind<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.190> put<00:02:11.580> our<00:02:11.670> fingers<00:02:12.030> down<00:02:12.180> here<00:02:12.480> where

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
kind of put our fingers down here where

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.309 
kind of put our fingers down here where

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
going to go at which point we go back up

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330 
going to go at which point we go back up
