00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
we haven't even seen a full strength yet

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.960 
we haven't even seen a full strength yet
and<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.950> already<00:00:50.130> know<00:00:50.310> that<00:00:50.399> she<00:00:50.550> strong<00:00:50.820> as

and we already know that she strong as
 but<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.170> pretty<00:00:52.530> amazing<00:00:52.770> pretty<00:00:53.579> like

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
 but it's pretty amazing pretty like

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.150 
 but it's pretty amazing pretty like
this<00:00:54.059> interesting<00:00:54.660> how<00:00:55.470> to<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> training

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
this interesting how to do the training

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.910 
this interesting how to do the training
thing<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:57.570> show<00:00:57.840> important<00:00:58.530> parts<00:00:58.860> of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
thing like they show important parts of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.290 
thing like they show important parts of
the<00:00:58.980> training<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.760> they'll

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the training but then they'll

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
the training but then they'll
fast-forward<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.110> month<00:01:01.590> later<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.130> a<00:01:02.160> couple

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
fast-forward a month later or a couple

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.819 
fast-forward a month later or a couple
days<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.300> complete<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.930> that's<00:01:04.619> good

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
days to get a complete and that's good

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.370 
days to get a complete and that's good
because<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.100> don't<00:01:05.250> want<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.840> have<00:01:06.840> episode

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
because you don't want to have episode

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.350 
because you don't want to have episode
after<00:01:07.469> episode<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:08.130> training<00:01:08.579> but<00:01:09.149> you<00:01:09.210> want

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
after episode of training but you want

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
after episode of training but you want
to<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.570> show<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.869> least<00:01:10.020> important<00:01:10.530> parts<00:01:10.799> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
to like show at least important parts of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.319 
to like show at least important parts of
the<00:01:10.979> training<00:01:11.340> basically<00:01:11.789> in<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.060> episode

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
the training basically in this episode

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:13.910 
the training basically in this episode
they<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.899> learn<00:01:12.990> how<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.200> strategize<00:01:13.499> her

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
they have to learn how to strategize her

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.469 
they have to learn how to strategize her
techniques<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:15.149> it's<00:01:15.240> pretty<00:01:15.359> funny

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
techniques but I think it's pretty funny

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.300 
techniques but I think it's pretty funny
because<00:01:15.959> when<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.499> say<00:01:16.649> they<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.859> learned<00:01:17.249> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
because when I say they have learned to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.219 
because when I say they have learned to
strategize<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.149> I<00:01:18.359> think<00:01:18.929> they've<00:01:19.079> been

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
strategize but I think they've been

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.889 
strategize but I think they've been
doing<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.479> throughout<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> series

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
doing this for throughout the series

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.300 
doing this for throughout the series
this<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.350> my<00:01:22.439> opinion<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.889> seems<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.219> they

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this in my opinion it seems like they

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.519 
this in my opinion it seems like they
always<00:01:23.459> has<00:01:24.179> some<00:01:24.359> type<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.539> strategy<00:01:25.139> when<00:01:25.499> it

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:25.529 
always has some type of strategy when it

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:27.620 
always has some type of strategy when it
comes<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.859> fighting<00:01:26.069> that's<00:01:26.639> just<00:01:26.850> me<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.420> I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
comes to fighting that's just me so I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.120 
comes to fighting that's just me so I
thought<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.899> was<00:01:28.049> kind<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.259> playing<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.679> they

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
thought I was kind of playing that they

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.219 
thought I was kind of playing that they
actually<00:01:29.219> doing<00:01:30.209> the<00:01:30.299> legit<00:01:30.689> learning<00:01:31.109> of

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
actually doing the legit learning of

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
actually doing the legit learning of
strategize<00:01:31.709> so<00:01:31.950> biscay<00:01:32.429> realizes<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:32.969> kill

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
strategize so biscay realizes that kill

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.910 
strategize so biscay realizes that kill
blood<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.630> stronger<00:01:34.139> when<00:01:34.319> it<00:01:34.560> comes<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
blood is stronger when it comes to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.399 
blood is stronger when it comes to
physical<00:01:35.189> strength<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.939> analysis<00:01:36.599> but<00:01:37.170> gone

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
physical strength and analysis but gone

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.980 
physical strength and analysis but gone
also<00:01:37.709> has<00:01:38.069> good<00:01:38.429> concentration<00:01:38.819> a<00:01:39.420> really

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990

amazing<00:01:40.799> recovery<00:01:41.520> speed<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.179> I<00:01:42.420> pray

techniques<00:01:52.289> at<00:01:52.469> least<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.099> have<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> heart<00:01:53.819> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
techniques at least I have a heart of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.480 
techniques at least I have a heart of
these<00:01:53.999> before<00:01:54.179> one<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.929> them<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.259> co<00:01:55.529> they

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
these before one of them is co they

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.859 
these before one of them is co they
pretty<00:01:56.639> much<00:01:56.759> do<00:01:56.999> Co<00:01:57.329> training<00:01:57.749> that's

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
pretty much do Co training that's

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.050 
pretty much do Co training that's
putting<00:01:58.259> energy<00:01:58.439> into<00:01:58.649> one<00:01:59.009> shot<00:01:59.279> or<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.909> one

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
putting energy into one shot or in one

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.480 
putting energy into one shot or in one
area<00:02:00.299> pretty<00:02:00.810> much<00:02:00.929> what<00:02:01.409> up<00:02:01.590> gonz<00:02:02.039> been<00:02:02.279> doing

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
area pretty much what up gonz been doing

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.559 
area pretty much what up gonz been doing
for<00:02:02.639> a<00:02:02.700> while<00:02:02.819> when<00:02:02.999> he<00:02:03.060> puts<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.329> whole

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
for a while when he puts that whole

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.510 
for a while when he puts that whole
energy<00:02:03.749> in<00:02:03.989> this<00:02:04.049> fist<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.859> practice<00:02:05.279> that

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
energy in this fist they practice that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.359 
energy in this fist they practice that
and<00:02:05.789> they're<00:02:06.779> able<00:02:06.959> to<00:02:07.289> all<00:02:07.590> secure<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.099> able

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and they're able to all secure is able

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.919 
and they're able to all secure is able
to<00:02:08.580> use<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.759> right<00:02:08.970> now<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.330> well<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.750> they<00:02:09.869> were

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to use it right now as well so they were

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.510 
to use it right now as well so they were
doing<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.229> couple<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.619> code<00:02:11.130> technique

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
doing a couple of code technique

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040 
doing a couple of code technique
training<00:02:11.670> another<00:02:12.390> technique<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.780> uses

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
training another technique that uses

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.650 
training another technique that uses
Kent<00:02:13.709> which<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.280> Rio<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:15.180> which<00:02:15.750> is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
Kent which is Rio this which is

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.370 
Kent which is Rio this which is
I<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:17.980> basically<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.460> long-term<00:02:19.120> Ren<00:02:19.750> so

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
I can is basically a long-term Ren so

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.720 
I can is basically a long-term Ren so
after<00:02:20.470> using<00:02:20.740> ran<00:02:20.950> for<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.160> long<00:02:21.280> time<00:02:21.520> because

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
after using ran for a long time because

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.390 
after using ran for a long time because
of<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.000> Ken<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.510> then<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.530> riu<00:02:23.920> new

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
of the Ken and then the riu new

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.430 
of the Ken and then the riu new
technique<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:25.000> pretty<00:02:25.240> much<00:02:25.420> being<00:02:25.960> able<00:02:26.260> to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
technique is pretty much being able to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.070 
technique is pretty much being able to
put<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.800> certain<00:02:27.070> amount<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.460> powell<00:02:28.300> within<00:02:28.990> a

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
put a certain amount of powell within a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.050 
put a certain amount of powell within a
certain<00:02:29.260> you'll<00:02:29.980> punch<00:02:30.430> you're<00:02:30.610> like<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.790> fun

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
certain you'll punch you're like a fun

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.330 
certain you'll punch you're like a fun
to<00:02:31.180> what<00:02:31.300> all<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.510> good<00:02:31.690> stuff<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.770> lot<00:02:33.310> of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
to what all the good stuff so a lot of

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.130 
to what all the good stuff so a lot of
technical<00:02:33.730> techniques<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.630> stuff<00:02:34.900> being

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
technical techniques of stuff being

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.320 
technical techniques of stuff being
learning<00:02:35.530> strategies<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.610> episode<00:02:36.910> and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
learning strategies in this episode and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.600 
learning strategies in this episode and
I'm<00:02:38.230> just<00:02:38.500> wondering<00:02:38.650> how<00:02:38.920> strong<00:02:39.190> enemies

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
I'm just wondering how strong enemies

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.860 
I'm just wondering how strong enemies
are<00:02:39.730> going<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:40.090> later<00:02:40.300> on<00:02:40.510> because<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
are going to be later on because the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.060 
are going to be later on because the
bench<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.170> they're<00:02:41.320> trained<00:02:41.530> for<00:02:41.740> something

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
bench that they're trained for something

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.170 
bench that they're trained for something
you're<00:02:42.160> not<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.460> training<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
you're not just training this for the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.840 
you're not just training this for the
fun<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:44.370> whoever<00:02:45.370> they're<00:02:45.610> going<00:02:45.790> to

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
fun of it so whoever they're going to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.900 
fun of it so whoever they're going to
fight<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.240> going<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.510> be<00:02:46.600> tough<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.520> yeah<00:02:48.520> just

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
fight is going to be tough and yeah just

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.810 
fight is going to be tough and yeah just
hope<00:02:49.060> they<00:02:49.330> uh<00:02:49.920> more<00:02:50.920> training<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.610> next

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
hope they uh more training in the next

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.510 
hope they uh more training in the next
episode<00:02:52.180> most<00:02:52.420> likely<00:02:53.160> now<00:02:54.160> scene<00:02:54.370> we're

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
episode most likely now scene we're

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.680 
episode most likely now scene we're
going<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.730> get<00:02:54.820> another<00:02:54.970> training<00:02:55.300> episode

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
going to get another training episode

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.630 
going to get another training episode
most<00:02:56.320> likely<00:02:56.500> because<00:02:56.620> they<00:02:56.890> reach<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.340> final

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
most likely because they reach the final

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.120 
most likely because they reach the final
stage<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:57.880> training<00:02:58.150> which<00:02:58.810> was<00:02:59.020> so<00:02:59.530> Jane<00:02:59.890> only

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
stage of training which was so Jane only

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.370 
stage of training which was so Jane only
took<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:00.310> what<00:03:00.670> 23<00:03:01.420> episodes<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.020> not<00:03:02.200> that

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
took like what 23 episodes so not that

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.410 
took like what 23 episodes so not that
bad<00:03:02.620> so<00:03:03.310> now<00:03:03.460> we<00:03:03.520> come<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.850> heck<00:03:04.060> other

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
bad so now we come to the heck other

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.670 
bad so now we come to the heck other
half<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:04.990> episode<00:03:05.550> when<00:03:06.550> ginn<00:03:07.300> true<00:03:07.680> AK

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
half of the episode when ginn true AK

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.310 
half of the episode when ginn true AK
the<00:03:08.920> Bombur<00:03:09.600> basically<00:03:10.600> threatens<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.170> rest

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
the Bombur basically threatens the rest

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.710 
the Bombur basically threatens the rest
of<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.560> hunters<00:03:11.980> other<00:03:12.280> guys<00:03:12.520> saying<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.510> he

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
of the hunters other guys saying that he

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.510 
of the hunters other guys saying that he
will<00:03:13.870> he<00:03:13.990> wants<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.320> pink<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:14.800> was<00:03:14.890> like<00:03:15.010> 80<00:03:15.250> and

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
will he wants a pink it was like 80 and

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.360 
will he wants a pink it was like 80 and
90<00:03:15.820> restricted<00:03:16.660> cards<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.380> if<00:03:17.950> he<00:03:18.070> didn't

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
90 restricted cards and if he didn't

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.590 
90 restricted cards and if he didn't
give<00:03:18.490> them<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.910> cars<00:03:19.120> he<00:03:19.300> would<00:03:19.420> basically

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
give them the cars he would basically

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.890 
give them the cars he would basically
kill<00:03:19.990> everyone<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:21.360> he's<00:03:22.360> called<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.660> bomber

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
kill everyone and he's called the bomber

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.510 
kill everyone and he's called the bomber
because<00:03:23.200> he<00:03:23.320> has<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.440> ability<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.160> ignite

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
because he has to ability to ignite

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.330 
because he has to ability to ignite
bombs<00:03:24.910> with<00:03:25.300> his<00:03:25.450> hand<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:25.990> he<00:03:26.650> also<00:03:26.800> has<00:03:26.950> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
bombs with his hand and he also has the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.270 
bombs with his hand and he also has the
power<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:27.670> disarm<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.450> bombs<00:03:28.830> if<00:03:29.830> you<00:03:30.070> touch

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
power to disarm the bombs if you touch

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.400 
power to disarm the bombs if you touch
his<00:03:30.520> body<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.000> say<00:03:31.240> I've<00:03:31.510> caught<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.140> bomb

also<00:04:56.310> at<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.520> very<00:04:56.759> end<00:04:56.939> we<00:04:57.090> did<00:04:57.270> see<00:04:57.479> the

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
also at the very end we did see the

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.899 
also at the very end we did see the
phantom<00:04:57.990> fruit<00:04:58.289> bay<00:04:58.439> at<00:04:58.800> least<00:04:58.949> like<00:04:59.520> three<00:04:59.819> or

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
phantom fruit bay at least like three or

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.700 
phantom fruit bay at least like three or
four<00:04:59.969> of<00:05:00.210> them<00:05:00.360> finally<00:05:01.050> reached<00:05:01.349> agree<00:05:01.560> down

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
four of them finally reached agree down

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.499 
four of them finally reached agree down
so<00:05:01.949> maybe<00:05:02.219> we'll<00:05:02.639> see<00:05:02.879> them<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.090> little<00:05:03.360> bit
