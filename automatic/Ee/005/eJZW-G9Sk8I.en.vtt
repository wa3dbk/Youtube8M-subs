00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
distinctly star wars that in fact looks

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.170 
distinctly star wars that in fact looks
distinctly<00:03:49.190> star<00:03:49.490> wars<00:03:49.700> in<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:49.850> Old<00:03:50.090> Republic

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
distinctly star wars in the Old Republic

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.990 
distinctly star wars in the Old Republic
