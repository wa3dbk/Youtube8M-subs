00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.070

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:19.140
 different motives how do you see that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.220

 then we do not have it when I feel 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:58.360
 to 100 percent safe plant Schiri 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:03.160
 Chef is easy to open again 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:07.980

 or her and james may queen 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.830
 This can be so hard to open again 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.830
 that is very bewitched here 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.820
 Let's see who's expecting us it's rafa 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.440
 but had lived in brandenburg 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.240

 you can somehow turn the nama on ten 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.090
 speak different ways 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.120
 this bus connections promo poster or 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.930
 this without barcode is somehow different 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:18.829
 that we are the ones at the staples at 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:23.169

 do not pronounce and h sa 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.190
 We already have it as limited or 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.040
 people therefore denied in any case 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:42.940
 There are also limited and at 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.940
 that's another thing 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.320
 I think we do not have it yet 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:53.540
 I'll buy that for sure only 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:05:02.000

 of course comes to an end 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.730
 that 's cool that i am celebrating this now 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.680

 I can double now I can swap 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.550
 that's worth a lot 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:38.160
 so more than one other cards 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:40.830

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.760
 otherwise in there all the cards are there 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.790
