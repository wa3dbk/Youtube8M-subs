then I had a little leftover so then I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.920 
then I had a little leftover so then I
made<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> little<00:01:33.119> cupcake<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:35.720> this<00:01:36.720> will

I<00:02:29.819> think<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.690> estimation<00:02:31.349> is<00:02:31.500> about<00:02:31.739> four<00:02:32.040> to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
I think the estimation is about four to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.199 
I think the estimation is about four to
six<00:02:32.190> months<00:02:32.970> I'm<00:02:33.569> not<00:02:34.080> sure<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.580> do<00:02:35.700> live<00:02:36.180> in

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
if the anticipation I think is what's

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.289 
if the anticipation I think is what's
what<00:03:00.840> kills<00:03:01.230> me<00:03:01.610> because<00:03:02.610> I'm<00:03:02.730> not<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.970> patient

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299
