00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
customers were very positive in the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
customers were very positive in the
sense<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:57.930> said<00:00:58.260> great<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
sense that they said great to have the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.430 
sense that they said great to have the
understanding<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.269> really<00:01:00.780> where<00:01:00.929> we<00:01:01.050> are<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
understanding of really where we are and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.820 
understanding of really where we are and
the<00:01:01.800> way<00:01:01.829> forward<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> really<00:01:04.410> what<00:01:04.680> was

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the way forward and so really what was

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.130 
the way forward and so really what was
positive<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.549> sense<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.119> would<00:01:06.900> say<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
positive in that sense I would say the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.840 
positive in that sense I would say the
major<00:01:07.380> highlight<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> week<00:01:08.070> has<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.549> be

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
major highlight of the week has to be

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
major highlight of the week has to be
though<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> fact<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.509> we<00:01:09.780> achieved<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.619> major

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
though the fact that we achieved a major

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.460 
though the fact that we achieved a major
milestone<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.759> program<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.720> now<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.170> more

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
milestone the program we now have more

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.640 
milestone the program we now have more
than<00:01:13.650> 500<00:01:14.009> orders<00:01:14.700> which<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.570> great<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
than 500 orders which is great for a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.990 
than 500 orders which is great for a
couple<00:01:16.920> reasons<00:01:16.950> early<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.820> program

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
couple reasons early in the program

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.359 
couple reasons early in the program
still<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.960> many<00:01:19.110> orders<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
still to have so many orders and the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.039 
still to have so many orders and the
other<00:01:20.490> point<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.000> would<00:01:21.060> say<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> really

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
other point I would say that it really

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.109 
other point I would say that it really
shows<00:01:22.380> confidence<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.369> program<00:01:23.729> from<00:01:23.909> our

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
