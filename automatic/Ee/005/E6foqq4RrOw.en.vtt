00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.850 
missing
some<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> believe<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.239> one<00:02:15.390> or<00:02:15.540> two<00:02:15.659> left<00:02:15.900> 2

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
some so I believe it's one or two left 2

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.649 
some so I believe it's one or two left 2
DLC<00:02:17.250> packs<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.610> they<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.879> left<00:02:18.060> car<00:02:18.420> packs

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
DLC packs that they have left car packs

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.869 
DLC packs that they have left car packs
left<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.860> Forza<00:02:20.129> horizon<00:02:20.220> 2<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.640> come<00:02:20.760> out

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
left for Forza horizon 2 to come out

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.699 
left for Forza horizon 2 to come out
which<00:02:21.299> is<00:02:21.329> kind<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.629> weird<00:02:21.810> which<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.470> kind<00:02:22.680> of

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
which is kind of weird which is kind of

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.800 
which is kind of weird which is kind of
weird<00:02:22.860> they<00:02:23.250> announced<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.610> new<00:02:23.760> game<00:02:24.000> before

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
weird they announced a new game before

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.380 
weird they announced a new game before
the<00:02:24.989> one<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.290> they<00:02:25.319> made<00:02:25.530> previously<00:02:25.950> is

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
the one that they made previously is

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.479 
the one that they made previously is
finished<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.689> also<00:02:28.409> assume<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:29.040> Forza

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
finished I also assume that Forza

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.399 
finished I also assume that Forza
horizon<00:02:29.579> 2<00:02:29.879> has<00:02:30.150> some<00:02:30.420> type<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.629> expansion

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
horizon 2 has some type of expansion

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.830 
horizon 2 has some type of expansion
with<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:31.769> well<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.939> gonna<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.239> kind<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
with it as well so it's gonna be kind of

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.449 
with it as well so it's gonna be kind of
interesting<00:02:34.079> I<00:02:34.349> don't<00:02:34.590> really<00:02:34.739> know<00:02:34.920> what<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
interesting I don't really know what the

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.399 
interesting I don't really know what the
timing<00:02:35.819> was<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.150> see<00:02:36.569> which<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:36.870> Ford<00:02:37.230> had

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
timing was I see which because Ford had

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.539 
timing was I see which because Ford had
some<00:02:37.560> extra<00:02:37.739> money<00:02:37.890> laying<00:02:38.069> around<00:02:38.189> and<00:02:38.370> said
