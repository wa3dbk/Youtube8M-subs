00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
bottom line is that this is a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
bottom line is that this is a
challenging<00:01:14.700> exercise<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.869> see

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
challenging exercise and you can see

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.330 
challenging exercise and you can see
that<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> athletes<00:01:16.770> are<00:01:16.890> struggling<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.310> bit

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that the athletes are struggling a bit

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.219 
that the athletes are struggling a bit
this<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> pretty<00:01:18.479> simple<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.930> call<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
this one is pretty simple it's call the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.780 
this one is pretty simple it's call the
med<00:01:19.409> ball<00:01:19.560> hamstring<00:01:19.979> fat<00:01:20.100> well<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.430> simple

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
med ball hamstring fat well it's simple

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.510 
med ball hamstring fat well it's simple
once<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.150> once<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> rhythm<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
once you once you get the rhythm of it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
once you once you get the rhythm of it
so<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.060> obviously<00:01:24.570> need<00:01:24.720> two<00:01:24.869> people<00:01:25.080> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
so you obviously need two people you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
so you obviously need two people you
basically<00:01:26.130> roll<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> ball<00:01:26.880> down<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> person's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
basically roll the ball down a person's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.899 
basically roll the ball down a person's
backside<00:01:28.110> when<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.770> hits<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> ankle<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.640> want

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
backside when it hits the ankle you want

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.969 
backside when it hits the ankle you want
to<00:01:30.000> flip<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.630> quick<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.049> possible<00:01:31.079> that

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
to flip it up as quick as possible that

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.380 
to flip it up as quick as possible that
red<00:01:32.280> medicine<00:01:32.640> ball<00:01:32.939> weighs<00:01:33.210> 8<00:01:33.509> pounds<00:01:33.890> this

red medicine ball weighs 8 pounds this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.590 
red medicine ball weighs 8 pounds this
it's<00:01:36.390> totally<00:01:36.900> realistic<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
it's totally realistic that a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.840 
it's totally realistic that a
recreational<00:01:39.600> 5k<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.259> 10k<00:01:40.290> runner<00:01:40.799> could<00:01:41.729> do

but good athletes who you know prior to

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.690 
but good athletes who you know prior to
being<00:03:42.200> runners<00:03:42.620> had<00:03:42.890> have<00:03:43.160> done<00:03:43.190> other

being runners had have done other

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.100 
being runners had have done other
activities<00:03:44.240> should<00:03:44.360> be<00:03:44.420> able<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.690> throw<00:03:44.930> this

activities should be able to throw this
really<00:03:45.350> well<00:03:45.530> but<00:03:46.310> but<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.580> reason<00:03:46.910> this<00:03:47.000> is

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
really well but but the reason this is

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.970 
really well but but the reason this is
so<00:03:47.330> important<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:47.959> you're<00:03:48.230> using<00:03:48.620> your

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
so important is that you're using your

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.340 
so important is that you're using your
ankle<00:03:49.490> your<00:03:49.790> knee<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.360> your<00:03:50.570> hip<00:03:50.600> joint<00:03:51.080> and

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
ankle your knee and your hip joint and

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.100 
ankle your knee and your hip joint and
you're<00:03:51.920> getting<00:03:52.310> what<00:03:52.490> weightlifting<00:03:53.270> people

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
you're getting what weightlifting people

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.690 
you're getting what weightlifting people
and<00:03:54.230> strength<00:03:54.470> coaches<00:03:54.709> would<00:03:55.010> call<00:03:55.190> triple

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
and strength coaches would call triple

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
and strength coaches would call triple
extension<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.300> we're<00:03:56.420> gonna<00:03:56.510> do<00:03:56.690> a

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
extension so we're gonna do a

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.590 
extension so we're gonna do a
freeze-frame<00:03:57.050> right<00:03:57.440> here<00:03:57.650> BAM<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:59.209> can<00:03:59.360> see

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
freeze-frame right here BAM you can see

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.110 
freeze-frame right here BAM you can see
that<00:03:59.870> he's<00:04:00.200> got<00:04:00.230> triple<00:04:00.860> extension<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.610> those

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
that he's got triple extension in those

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.090 
that he's got triple extension in those
three<00:04:02.360> joints<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:03.230> you<00:04:03.410> might<00:04:03.560> ask<00:04:03.709> yourself

three joints and you might ask yourself

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.830 
three joints and you might ask yourself
well<00:04:04.310> why<00:04:04.550> is<00:04:04.610> this<00:04:05.000> important<00:04:05.450> why<00:04:05.570> do<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.780> care
