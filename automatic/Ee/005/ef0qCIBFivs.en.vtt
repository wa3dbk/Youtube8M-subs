00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.200
Hi, I'm Kathy Santo with Iams,
and today, we're going to talk

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.330
about how to crate
train your puppy.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.980
We'll begin with a general
discussion on the philosophy

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.780
supporting the crate
training method.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.290
We'll review what you'll need,
the steps involved in the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.020
process itself, and some
possible troubles you may

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.760
encounter along the way.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.720
Before you begin crate
training, it helps to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.270
understand the philosophy
behind this method.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.040
If your dog is properly crate
trained, he'll view his crate

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.640
as a private room with a view, a
safe haven can call his own,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.670
and a quiet place
he can relax in.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.570
He won't see it as a rigid
structure of confinement and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.390
punishment.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.860
In fact, it'll be just
the opposite.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.270
In nature, wild dogs seek out
and use their den as a home

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.600
where they can hide from
danger, sleep,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.950
and raise their young.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.640
In your home, the crate becomes
your puppy's den, an

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.500
ideal spot to sleep and stay
out of harm's way.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470
And for you the benefits
of crate

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.350
training are house training.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.100
Because your puppy won't
like to soil the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.700
area where he sleeps.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.310
Limited access to the rest of
the house, where he learns the

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.370
house rules.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.470
And transporting safely
and easily in the car.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.270
Start crate training a
few days after your

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.670
puppy settles in.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.060
Before you can start crate
training, you and your family

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.760
members must understand that
the crate can never be used

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.290
for punishment.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.250
Never leave your young puppy
under six months in his crate

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.860
for more than three hours.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.480
He'll get bored, have to go
to the bathroom, and won't

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.580
understand why he's been left
alone in discomfort.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.540
As your dog gets older, he can
be crated for longer periods

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.560
of time because his bladder
isn't as small.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.210
But keep in mind, he still needs
a healthy portion of

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.610
exercise and attention daily.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.780
If you and your family are
unable to accommodate your

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.990
puppy's exercise, feeding, and
bathroom needs, consider

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.610
hiring a dog walker or asking
a neighbor or friend for

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.910
assistance.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.320
After that, the crate should
be a place he goes into

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.170
voluntarily, with the
door always open.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.870
There are a variety of crates
available for purchase these

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.300
days, each of which is designed
for a different

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.470
lifestyle need.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.010
When selecting a crate, you want
to make sure it's just

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.650
large enough for your puppy to
be able to stand up, turn

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.640
around, and lie down
in comfortably.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.440
Because your puppy will grow
quickly, I often recommend

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.860
getting a crate that fits the
size you expect your puppy to

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.500
grow too and simply block off
the excess crate space so your

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.680
dog can't eliminate at one end
and retreat to the other.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.160
Now for the crate training
process.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.480
The two most important things
to remember while crate

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.680
training are that it should be
associated with something

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.390
pleasant and take place in
a series of small steps.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.380
The first step is to introduce
your puppy to his crate.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.410
This will serve as
his new den.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.165
Put bedding and chew toys
in his crate and let him

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:39.360
investigate his area.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.310
If he chews or urinates
on his bedding,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.890
permanently remove it.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.370
Observe and interact with your
puppy while he's acclimating

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.620
to his crate.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.580
This will help forge a sense of
pack and establish you as

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.790
the pack leader.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.710
Encourage him to enter
the crate with soft

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.710
words and some treats.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.500
You can also pre-place some
treats in the back corner and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.470
under the blankets to help make
it a pleasant experience.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.065
Step two is to start feeding
your puppy in his crate.

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:06.000
Begin with the bowl near the
opening of the crate.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.200
As your puppy becomes less
reluctant to enter, slowly

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.625
inch the food back every feeding
until you're placing

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:13.570
it all the way in the back.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.400
When you get to the point
where your puppy happily

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.470
enters the crate and stands in
the back to eat, begin gently

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.190
closing the crate door behind
him while he's eating.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.320
At first, open the door
immediately after he finishes.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.330
But after that, begin leaving
the door closed a bit longer

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.460
every time.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.450
If your puppy cries, you may
have increased the time too

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.290
fast, so decrease the length of
it, and then slowly begin

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.630
increasing it again.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.010
When he does cry, do not let
him out until he stops, or

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.130
he'll always do this
to get his way.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.490
Once your puppy is used to
eating his meals and waiting

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.640
to be let out with no anxiety
or crying, you can start

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.810
confining him longer
when you're home.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.500
To do so, call him over with
a treat and give it

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.620
to him in his crate.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.100
Associating a command, such as
kennel, is important so he

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.360
understands the reward is a
result of going in the crate.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.850
At first, you'll need to sit
quietly next to him.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.860
If he's fine after 10
minutes, go into the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.730
other room for a bit.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.830
And then come back and let
him out only if he is

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.360
calm and not crying.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.060
If he is crying, you'll have
to wait until he's calm.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.280
Once you can leave him for about
30 minutes at a time

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.300
without him getting upset,
you can start

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.820
leaving him there longer.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.380
Eventually, decrease the amount
of reward you give him

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.930
for entering the crate, so that
saying the command word

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.130
is sufficient.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.620
When you get home after being
away for a long time, your

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.410
puppy will likely be very
excited to see you.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.730
It's important not reward this
behavior, or anticipating your

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.330
arrival every day may be
stressful for him.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.470
And lastly, make sure to crate
your dog for short periods of

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.320
time while your home, or else he
will associate crating with

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.780
being left alone.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.310
I'm Kathy Santo with Iams, and
I hope that you found this

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.500
helpful as you welcome your new
addition to your family.
