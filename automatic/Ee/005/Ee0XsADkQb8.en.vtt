bees will come and visit one of these
flowers<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:03.000> need<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> B<00:01:04.320> come<00:01:04.619> to

flowers we need to have the B come to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.609 
flowers we need to have the B come to
that<00:01:04.860> flower<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.339> develop<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.240> apple<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:07.350> can't

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that flower to develop an apple we can't

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.340 
that flower to develop an apple we can't
just<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.430> pollen<00:01:09.119> from<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.630> block<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> Red

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
just have pollen from this block a Red

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.290 
just have pollen from this block a Red
Delicious<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.100> make<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.430> Apple<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:12.000> need<00:01:12.180> to

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
Delicious to make that Apple we need to

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.170 
Delicious to make that Apple we need to
have<00:01:12.420> what's<00:01:12.690> called<00:01:12.870> cross<00:01:13.290> pollenization

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
have what's called cross pollenization

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.140 
have what's called cross pollenization
so<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.900> bees<00:01:16.170> will<00:01:16.409> transfer<00:01:17.040> pollen<00:01:17.640> from

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
so the bees will transfer pollen from

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.440 
so the bees will transfer pollen from
another<00:01:18.870> varieties<00:01:19.530> say<00:01:19.920> Gala<00:01:20.370> or<00:01:20.940> Macintosh

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
another varieties say Gala or Macintosh

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.200 
another varieties say Gala or Macintosh
or<00:01:22.080> whatever<00:01:22.470> might<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> proximity<00:01:24.180> of

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
or whatever might be in the proximity of

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.350 
or whatever might be in the proximity of
the<00:01:24.420> orchard<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:25.560> tend<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.190> mix<00:01:26.430> our<00:01:26.700> varieties

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the orchard we tend to mix our varieties

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.649 
the orchard we tend to mix our varieties
in<00:01:28.140> blocks<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.850> accomplish<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
in blocks so that we accomplish this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.920 
in blocks so that we accomplish this
cross<00:01:30.990> pollenization<00:01:32.090> very<00:01:33.090> important<00:01:33.690> that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
cross pollenization very important that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.789 
cross pollenization very important that
we<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.350> things<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.340> bloom<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> same

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
we have things that bloom in the same

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.250 
we have things that bloom in the same
timeframe<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.760> if<00:01:38.940> we<00:01:39.150> had<00:01:39.420> something<00:01:40.110> that

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
timeframe so if we had something that

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.230 
timeframe so if we had something that
bloomed<00:01:40.619> very<00:01:40.950> early<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> variety<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
bloomed very early with a variety that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.960 
bloomed very early with a variety that
Froome<00:01:42.600> blooms<00:01:43.170> very<00:01:43.470> late<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:44.250> may<00:01:44.460> miss<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
Froome blooms very late we may miss the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.880 
Froome blooms very late we may miss the
overlap<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> bloom<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.650> cross

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
overlap of the bloom and that the cross

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.380 
overlap of the bloom and that the cross
pollenization<00:01:47.479> wouldn't<00:01:48.479> occur<00:01:50.030> in<00:01:51.030> each<00:01:51.180> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390

pollenization wouldn't occur in each of
these<00:01:51.479> clusters<00:01:51.720> there's<00:01:52.260> typically<00:01:52.619> five

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
these clusters there's typically five

that<00:02:17.500> would<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:17.860> way<00:02:18.250> way<00:02:18.640> too<00:02:19.000> many<00:02:19.180> apples<00:02:19.690> on

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900

the tree we'd have small fruit and it
