00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
parking lot but I'm not getting a like a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.080 
parking lot but I'm not getting a like a
focus<00:00:58.829> center<00:00:59.129> beam<00:00:59.340> because<00:00:59.730> there's<00:00:59.940> not

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
focus center beam because there's not

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.610 
focus center beam because there's not
even<00:01:00.449> though<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> bunch<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> throw

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
even though it's a bunch of throw

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
even though it's a bunch of throw
inherently<00:01:02.219> from<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> power<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> light

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
inherently from the power of the light

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.719 
inherently from the power of the light
there's<00:01:04.019> not<00:01:04.199> really<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:05.040> real<00:01:05.369> strong

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
there's not really that that real strong

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.539 
there's not really that that real strong
center<00:01:06.119> beam<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.590> spill<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.070> literally<00:01:08.460> as

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
center beam so the spill is literally as

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.730 
center beam so the spill is literally as
wide<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> entire<00:01:09.299> parking<00:01:09.689> lot<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.110> as<00:01:10.619> I
