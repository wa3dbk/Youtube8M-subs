and<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:32.040> plan<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> add<00:02:32.550> two<00:02:32.790> more<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.120> each<00:02:33.380> i'm

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
and I plan to add two more in each i'm

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.680 
and I plan to add two more in each i'm
going<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.620> add<00:02:34.709> them<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.010> pairs<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:36.330> reason

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
going to add them in pairs the reason

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.020 
going to add them in pairs the reason
being<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.170> one<00:02:37.590> functions<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.430> my

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
being is that one functions as my

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.170 
being is that one functions as my
primary<00:02:39.270> storage<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.580> other<00:02:41.580> functions

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
primary storage and the other functions

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.900 
primary storage and the other functions
