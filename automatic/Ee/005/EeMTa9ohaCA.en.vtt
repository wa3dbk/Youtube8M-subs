he<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.729> good<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.180> think<00:01:09.479> you

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
he is really really good I think you

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.810 
he is really really good I think you
could<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:09.750> buying<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.229> 1k<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.710> even<00:01:11.369> she's

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
could go buying for 1k so even she's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.580 
could go buying for 1k so even she's
probably<00:01:12.150> even<00:01:12.360> cheaper<00:01:12.750> than<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.020> but

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
probably even cheaper than that but

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.980 
probably even cheaper than that but
overall<00:01:13.920> he's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> solid<00:01:14.729> defender<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> he<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
overall he's a solid defender and he is

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.929

Luiz<00:02:32.640> he<00:02:33.030> has<00:02:33.240> awesome<00:02:33.540> shooting<00:02:34.230> sometimes

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
Luiz he has awesome shooting sometimes

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.710 
Luiz he has awesome shooting sometimes
as<00:02:34.800> well<00:02:34.830> it's<00:02:35.280> inconsistent<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:36.360> for<00:02:36.690> a

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
as well it's inconsistent but for a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.600 
as well it's inconsistent but for a
centre-back<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.410> good<00:02:37.680> enough<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.100> think<00:02:38.520> he

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
centre-back is good enough I think he

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.910 
centre-back is good enough I think he
has<00:02:38.700> okay<00:02:39.240> free-kick<00:02:39.720> stats<00:02:40.020> not<00:02:40.350> it's<00:02:40.770> not

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
has okay free-kick stats not it's not

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.370

entirely<00:02:41.280> amazing<00:02:41.970> but<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.330> okay<00:02:42.690> what<00:02:43.200> that

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
entirely amazing but it's okay what that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.930 
entirely amazing but it's okay what that
