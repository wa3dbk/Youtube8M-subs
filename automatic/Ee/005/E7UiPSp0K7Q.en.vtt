 practice summary practice 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.880
 was to observe the series of 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.400
 metal activity through the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.390
 experimentation in a solution of 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.970
 2 to 0.1 molar copper sulfate of three 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.580
 zinc grenades scoring changes 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.230
 seen for an hour and taking out 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.320
 conclusions on the subject 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.320
 ah 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.109
 and 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.600
 and experimental development was added 5 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.630
 milliliters of a sulphate solution of 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.440
 2 to 0.1 molar copper in a tube of 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.570
 test 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.840
 then the same amount of the 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.000
 same solution in another three were added 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.680
 grenades zinc in either 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.020
 two previous test tubes 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.240
 using a clamp for this 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.280
 crucible the changes were observed 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.010
 submitted for an hour and they were noticed in 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.200
 the pre-report notebook elapsed 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.570
 one hour the grenades were removed 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.020
 using the tong for crucible 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.910
 test tube the deposit generated is 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.470
 retired with a paper and the 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.470
 presented variations 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.250
 - Results shown below 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.520
 the results obtained and will be reading 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.540
 of them for your greater understanding

 lentil- shaped gray 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.980
 observations two minutes changes the 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.530
 intensity of color and grana 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.170
 four minutes are observed certain 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.820
 bubbles over the great area six minutes 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.740
 They are becoming more the bubbles 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.680
 adhere to the large area in the solution 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.720
 of copper sulfate eight minutes the great 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.130
 area they become darker and darker their 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.590
 grayish color has changed 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.300
 progressively to a black one and the bubble 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.360
 around them they make them look 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.430
 pearly 12 minutes you notice certain 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.200
 food of gray color in the background and 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.540
 small particles of sealing anaya it 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.220
 they see on the surface of the solution the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.360
 color of the pomegranate already on the surface 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.360
 it's between black and gold 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.510
 19 minutes you see background particles 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.180
 going up they are tiny and they get together with 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.550
 those that are up 27 minutes 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.030
 the particles rise with increasing 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.310
 quickly 31 minutes are becoming more and more 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.609
 hard the surface of the solution the 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.950
 black color is made I have 36 minutes the 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.810
 golden surface was transparently ssa and 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.710
 you notice more and more the bubble of the 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.210
 great airs 43 minutes are noticed on the 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.430
 grenades some small particles 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.169
 dark as brown and the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.620
 surface is getting harder and 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.540
 transparent 50 minutes look small 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.950
 golden particles up and its 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.290
 around a whitish golden color 56 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.840
 minutes have been progressively noticed 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.550
 that the copper sulfate solution has 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.370
 changed the intensity of its color 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.370
 initial blue to one more tenuous 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.480
 after removing the grenades from the tube 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.190
 assay in which tracks of 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.190
 large area and the sulfate solution 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.140
 copper is obviously clearer when 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.420
 the grenades were placed on paper 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.180
 napkin was noticed a black sediment 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.040
 as if they were waste noticeably 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.410
 gave a change of color from a gray to 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.410
 black with grayish pinches 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.009
 what happened we can conclude that at 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.289
 react the large area of zinc with the 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.749
 copper sulfate solution 2 was given 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.300
 a simple displacement reaction the 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:27.520
 zinc exchanges place with copper without 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.069
 But copper does not change the place with 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.439
 5 concluding that zinc is more 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.999
 active than copper and this is because 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:37.169
 the activity of a metal is 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:39.580
 related to electronic affinity 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.169
 investigating about the subject we found 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.360
 also that there is a reaction 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:45.360
 exothermic since heat is delivered 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.210
 conclusions the conclusions of this 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.490
 practice are yours in the item of 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.260
 general discussion as consulted 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.000
 before carrying out the experience and 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.920
 according to her the results 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.150
 obtained were the expected ones since 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.880
 the color of the solution changed 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.100
 initially blue to one more tenuous 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.830
 perforations were also 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.830
 on 5 both changes were expected
