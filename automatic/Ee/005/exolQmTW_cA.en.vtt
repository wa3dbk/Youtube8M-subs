00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:58.309 
resembles greenery on earth under
sunlight

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.960 

here<00:02:59.319> on<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> Mars<00:02:59.830> screen<00:03:00.250> i<00:03:00.430> found<00:03:00.790> this

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
here on the Mars screen i found this

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.660 
here on the Mars screen i found this
tower<00:03:01.270> sticking<00:03:01.810> possibly<00:03:02.290> 200<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.040> 300<00:03:03.640> feet

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
tower sticking possibly 200 to 300 feet

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.880 
tower sticking possibly 200 to 300 feet
above<00:03:04.030> surface<00:03:04.629> level<00:03:04.870> which<00:03:05.170> was<00:03:05.379> very<00:03:05.620> very

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
above surface level which was very very

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:24.330 
above surface level which was very very
unusual

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.420 

I<00:03:24.750> could<00:03:25.750> not<00:03:25.930> find<00:03:26.260> an<00:03:26.410> explanation<00:03:26.800> as<00:03:27.310> it

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
I could not find an explanation as it

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.979 
I could not find an explanation as it
was<00:03:27.580> merely<00:03:27.819> sticking<00:03:28.300> up<00:03:28.450> from<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.810> surface

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
was merely sticking up from the surface

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.259 
was merely sticking up from the surface
with<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.440> shadow<00:03:29.739> going<00:03:30.280> down<00:03:30.489> its<00:03:30.700> side<00:03:31.000> in<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
with a shadow going down its side in the

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.300 
with a shadow going down its side in the
position<00:03:31.870> matching<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.410> other<00:03:32.560> shadows<00:03:32.860> of

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
position matching the other shadows of

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:47.500 
position matching the other shadows of
the<00:03:33.430> Sun

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.960
