frozen<00:04:02.590> bananas<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.550> don't<00:04:03.700> think<00:04:03.880> they<00:04:04.030> freeze

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
frozen bananas I don't think they freeze

frozen bananas I don't think they freeze
there<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:04.780> but<00:04:04.990> I<00:04:05.230> like<00:04:05.890> mine<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.160> be<00:04:06.370> like<00:04:06.880> a

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
there is but I like mine to be like a

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.220 
there is but I like mine to be like a
milkshake<00:04:08.590> more<00:04:09.130> than<00:04:09.460> just<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.880> warm<00:04:10.660> smoothie

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
milkshake more than just a warm smoothie

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.830 
milkshake more than just a warm smoothie
so<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.740> take<00:04:12.370> two<00:04:12.580> bananas<00:04:13.060> put<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.690> on<00:04:13.780> a

so I take two bananas put it on a
plastic<00:04:14.320> bag<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.770> freeze<00:04:14.980> them<00:04:15.160> now<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.370> lot<00:04:15.550> of

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
plastic bag and freeze them now a lot of

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.009 
plastic bag and freeze them now a lot of
people<00:04:15.700> will<00:04:16.000> tell<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.209> don't<00:04:16.510> freeze<00:04:16.810> in

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
people will tell you don't freeze in

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.620 
people will tell you don't freeze in
plastic<00:04:17.530> because<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.880> bad<00:04:19.090> thing<00:04:19.329> is<00:04:19.359> going

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
plastic because the bad thing is going

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.470 
plastic because the bad thing is going
to<00:04:19.780> do<00:04:19.870> it<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.140> that's<00:04:20.230> probably<00:04:20.920> true<00:04:21.280> but<00:04:21.640> we

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
to do it and that's probably true but we

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.990 
to do it and that's probably true but we
have<00:04:22.660> we<00:04:22.870> are<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:23.050> MCD<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:24.040> takes<00:04:24.280> toxins<00:04:24.760> back

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
have we are a MCD that takes toxins back

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.760 
have we are a MCD that takes toxins back
out<00:04:25.240> of<00:04:25.420> it<00:04:25.540> so<00:04:25.720> we<00:04:25.840> don't<00:04:25.870> worry<00:04:26.200> about<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.590> too

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
out of it so we don't worry about it too

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.530 
out of it so we don't worry about it too
much<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.940> very<00:04:28.210> convenient<00:04:30.180> we<00:04:31.180> don't<00:04:31.390> use

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
much it's very convenient we don't use

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.190 
much it's very convenient we don't use
the<00:04:31.720> microwave<00:04:32.140> because<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.800> destroys<00:04:33.250> food

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
the microwave because that destroys food

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.110 
the microwave because that destroys food
but<00:04:35.200> we<00:04:35.320> will<00:04:35.530> use<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.070> plastic<00:04:36.310> bags<00:04:36.790> in<00:04:37.030> the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
but we will use the plastic bags in the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.210 
but we will use the plastic bags in the
freezer<00:04:37.650> crank<00:04:38.650> that<00:04:38.830> down

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.830 

if<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.580> don't<00:04:44.790> have<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.030> writer<00:04:45.390> makes<00:04:45.660> you

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
if you don't have a writer makes you

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.020 
if you don't have a writer makes you
probably<00:04:46.110> don't<00:04:46.650> want<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.920> put<00:04:47.190> frozen<00:04:47.520> things

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
probably don't want to put frozen things

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.660 
probably don't want to put frozen things
in<00:04:48.330> your<00:04:48.570> blender<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:49.680> do<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:50.370> could

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
in your blender to do that that could

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:57.950 
in your blender to do that that could
kill

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.309

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.200 

Vitamix<00:05:26.439> don't<00:05:26.770> worry<00:05:27.069> about<00:05:27.400> that<00:05:27.699> you<00:05:27.909> can't

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
Vitamix don't worry about that you can't

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.270 
Vitamix don't worry about that you can't
hurt<00:05:28.449> that<00:05:28.659> they<00:05:28.840> could<00:05:29.169> put<00:05:29.379> two<00:05:29.530> by<00:05:29.710> fours<00:05:30.069> in

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
hurt that they could put two by fours in

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:53.800 
hurt that they could put two by fours in
there<00:05:30.460> if<00:05:30.520> you<00:05:30.639> wanted

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810
