00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
and see what this thing is like whether

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.760 
and see what this thing is like whether
it<00:00:30.669> justifies<00:00:31.210> its<00:00:31.450> price<00:00:31.750> tag<00:00:32.079> if<00:00:32.619> it's

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
it justifies its price tag if it's

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.229 
it justifies its price tag if it's
anything<00:00:33.040> like<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.340> case<00:00:33.670> that<00:00:33.910> came<00:00:34.059> with

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
anything like the case that came with

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.810 
anything like the case that came with
the<00:00:34.360> iphone<00:00:34.780> 5<00:00:35.140> it<00:00:35.860> will<00:00:35.890> be<00:00:36.070> very<00:00:36.250> well<00:00:36.519> built

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
the iphone 5 it will be very well built

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.299 
the iphone 5 it will be very well built
but<00:00:37.300> still<00:00:37.570> leaving<00:00:38.289> me<00:00:38.410> questioning<00:00:39.010> whether

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
but still leaving me questioning whether

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.279 
but still leaving me questioning whether
or<00:00:39.579> not<00:00:39.670> it<00:00:39.850> should<00:00:39.879> be<00:00:40.179> priced<00:00:40.480> as<00:00:40.780> such<00:00:41.019> a

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
or not it should be priced as such a

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.459 
or not it should be priced as such a
high<00:00:41.920> price<00:00:42.309> point<00:00:43.109> packaging<00:00:44.109> comes<00:00:44.320> off

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
high price point packaging comes off

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.430 
high price point packaging comes off
relatively<00:00:44.859> easily<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.539> this<00:00:46.719> is<00:00:46.929> the<00:00:47.199> case

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
relatively easily and this is the case

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.529 
relatively easily and this is the case
you<00:00:47.620> can<00:00:47.739> see<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:48.039> front<00:00:48.309> folds<00:00:49.030> into<00:00:49.179> three

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
you can see the front folds into three

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.930 
you can see the front folds into three
segments<00:00:50.109> it<00:00:50.920> will<00:00:51.039> fall<00:00:51.219> back<00:00:51.429> on<00:00:51.609> itself

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
segments it will fall back on itself

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.680 
segments it will fall back on itself
like<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.670> that<00:00:54.850> will<00:00:54.999> form<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.329> stand

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
like so and that will form the stand

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.189 
like so and that will form the stand
once<00:00:55.929> your<00:00:56.170> iPad<00:00:56.559> is<00:00:56.710> inside<00:00:57.719> inside<00:00:58.719> here<00:00:59.170> is

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
once your iPad is inside inside here is

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.079 
once your iPad is inside inside here is
coated<00:00:59.920> with<00:00:59.949> a<00:01:00.100> really<00:01:00.460> nice<00:01:00.640> soft<00:01:00.999> touch

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
coated with a really nice soft touch

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.079

material<00:01:01.870> and<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.829> outside<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.489> entirely

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
material and the outside is entirely

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.420 
material and the outside is entirely
leather<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:05.320> what<00:01:05.500> gives<00:01:05.680> it<00:01:05.860> its<00:01:06.040> rigidity

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
leather and what gives it its rigidity

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.450 
leather and what gives it its rigidity
inside<00:01:07.120> is<00:01:07.330> normally<00:01:07.840> just<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.230> slim<00:01:08.800> piece<00:01:09.190> of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
inside is normally just a slim piece of

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.630 
inside is normally just a slim piece of
plastic<00:01:10.030> or<00:01:10.270> polycarbonate<00:01:10.900> as<00:01:11.490> you'd<00:01:12.490> expect

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
plastic or polycarbonate as you'd expect

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.910 
plastic or polycarbonate as you'd expect
cutouts<00:01:13.450> are<00:01:13.720> in<00:01:13.900> all<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.140> right<00:01:14.230> places<00:01:14.290> but

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
cutouts are in all the right places but

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.700 
cutouts are in all the right places but
let's<00:01:15.100> just<00:01:15.160> get<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.550> ipad<00:01:15.910> in<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:16.930> we'll<00:01:17.200> see

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
let's just get the ipad in and we'll see

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.590 
let's just get the ipad in and we'll see
what<00:01:17.890> it<00:01:18.010> looks<00:01:18.220> like<00:01:18.430> with<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.150> tablet

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
what it looks like with the tablet

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.300 
what it looks like with the tablet
inside<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.470> case<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:26.590> can<00:01:26.740> see<00:01:26.890> just<00:01:27.190> from

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
inside the case so you can see just from

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.130 
inside the case so you can see just from
looking<00:01:27.730> at<00:01:27.820> it<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.120> the<00:01:28.270> case<00:01:28.480> fits<00:01:28.870> very

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
looking at it that the case fits very

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.310 
looking at it that the case fits very
snugly<00:01:29.710> around<00:01:29.800> all<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.400> edges<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.930> i<00:01:32.050> close

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
snugly around all the edges if i close

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.610 
snugly around all the edges if i close
the<00:01:32.650> cover<00:01:32.860> like<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.540> we've<00:01:34.540> take<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.780> look<00:01:35.080> at

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
the cover like so we've take a look at

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.680 
the cover like so we've take a look at
the<00:01:35.920> case<00:01:36.130> itself<00:01:36.550> all<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.850> way<00:01:37.000> around<00:01:37.150> at

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
the case itself all the way around at

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.630 
the case itself all the way around at
the<00:01:37.870> bottom<00:01:38.260> you<00:01:38.470> have<00:01:38.500> machine<00:01:39.100> calls<00:01:39.400> that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
the bottom you have machine calls that

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.020 
the bottom you have machine calls that
match<00:01:40.380> exactly<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.740> holes<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.400> are<00:01:42.430> in<00:01:42.730> the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
match exactly the holes that are in the

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.720 
match exactly the holes that are in the
speaker<00:01:43.510> ports<00:01:43.870> on<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.170> bottom<00:01:44.560> edge<00:01:44.830> and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
speaker ports on the bottom edge and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.060 
speaker ports on the bottom edge and
also<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.120> nice<00:01:46.600> hole<00:01:46.900> there<00:01:47.170> for<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.620> Lightning

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070
