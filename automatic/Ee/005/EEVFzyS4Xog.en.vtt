00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
welcome tactics tutorial I'm going to

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.170 
welcome tactics tutorial I'm going to
show<00:00:02.700> you<00:00:02.909> today<00:00:03.120> some<00:00:03.480> basic<00:00:03.510> UV<00:00:04.290> unwrapping

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.180 
show you today some basic UV unwrapping

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.670 
show you today some basic UV unwrapping
for<00:00:06.180> skinning<00:00:06.540> purposes<00:00:06.990> as<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.259> can<00:00:07.379> see<00:00:07.529> I'm

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
for skinning purposes as you can see I'm

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.310 
for skinning purposes as you can see I'm
in<00:00:07.890> blender<00:00:08.429> right<00:00:08.580> now<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.059> have<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.080> new

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
in blender right now I have the new

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.259 
in blender right now I have the new
screen<00:00:10.620> open<00:00:10.920> what's<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.280> beautiful<00:00:12.059> cube

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
screen open what's the beautiful cube

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.480 
screen open what's the beautiful cube
placed<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.929> middle<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.380> what<00:00:14.370> we're

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
placed in the middle of it what we're

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.960 
placed in the middle of it what we're
going<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.670> do<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:15.389> mark<00:00:16.049> some<00:00:16.379> scenes<00:00:16.970> so

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
going to do is first mark some scenes so

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.080 
going to do is first mark some scenes so
that<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.480> computer<00:00:19.140> knows<00:00:19.320> what<00:00:20.100> polygons

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
that the computer knows what polygons

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.970 
that the computer knows what polygons
it's<00:00:21.330> okay<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.660> separate<00:00:22.289> which<00:00:22.619> one's<00:00:22.859> it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
it's okay to separate which one's it

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.980 
it's okay to separate which one's it
needs<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.279> keep<00:00:23.400> together<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:24.630> let's<00:00:24.810> go<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
needs to keep together so let's go and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.349 
needs to keep together so let's go and
go<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.199> edit<00:00:25.380> mode<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.099> when<00:00:26.760> will<00:00:26.970> actually

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
go to edit mode and when will actually

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.810 
go to edit mode and when will actually
want<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.710> go<00:00:28.710> into<00:00:29.570> sorry<00:00:31.430> go<00:00:32.430> into<00:00:34.820> edges

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
want to go into sorry go into edges

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.690 
want to go into sorry go into edges
mother<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.870> first<00:00:37.410> aid<00:00:37.649> unselect<00:00:38.219> everything

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
mother and first aid unselect everything

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.130 
mother and first aid unselect everything
everything<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.660> don't<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.930> anything

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
everything so we don't have anything

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.950 
everything so we don't have anything
selected<00:00:40.640> what<00:00:41.640> we're<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.329> we

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
selected what we're going to do is we

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.450 
selected what we're going to do is we
want<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> way<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.309> has

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
want to think of the way that this has

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.130 
want to think of the way that this has
been<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:44.700> unwrapped<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.420> when<00:00:45.629> you'll<00:00:45.780> see<00:00:45.989> how

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
been an unwrapped so when you'll see how

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.850 
been an unwrapped so when you'll see how
it<00:00:46.289> does<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> moment<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.820> ahead<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
it does it in a moment go ahead and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
it does it in a moment go ahead and
click<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.920> seems<00:00:51.199> like<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.410> doing<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.449> so

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
click the seems like I'm doing here so

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
click the seems like I'm doing here so
that<00:00:54.629> these<00:00:54.930> four<00:00:55.350> sighs<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.399> vertical<00:00:56.760> edges

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
that these four sighs the vertical edges

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.959 
that these four sighs the vertical edges
are<00:00:57.629> all<00:00:57.780> selected<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.620> when<00:00:59.039> hit<00:00:59.190> control<00:00:59.640> e

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
are all selected and when hit control e

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.650 
are all selected and when hit control e
and<00:01:00.710> Mark<00:01:01.710> seemed<00:01:02.039> under<00:01:02.340> edge<00:01:02.489> specials<00:01:03.000> this

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and Mark seemed under edge specials this

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.570 
and Mark seemed under edge specials this
is<00:01:03.780> alou<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.949> change<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.339> into<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
is alou is you know so change it into a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.740 
is alou is you know so change it into a
sort<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:07.400> multicolored

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
sort of this multicolored

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.350 
sort of this multicolored
black<00:01:09.490> lions<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.670> what<00:01:10.760> that<00:01:10.880> means<00:01:11.060> it's<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
black lions and what that means it's the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.930 
black lions and what that means it's the
computer<00:01:11.720> knows<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:12.080> okay<00:01:12.470> if<00:01:12.650> these<00:01:13.340> edges

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
computer knows it's okay if these edges

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.520 
computer knows it's okay if these edges
are<00:01:14.150> not<00:01:14.300> connected<00:01:14.750> when<00:01:14.930> we<00:01:15.080> actually<00:01:15.230> do

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
are not connected when we actually do

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.820 
are not connected when we actually do
the<00:01:15.680> UV<00:01:16.360> to<00:01:17.360> further<00:01:17.810> help<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.350> will<00:01:18.560> have<00:01:18.740> to

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
the UV to further help it will have to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.530 
the UV to further help it will have to
mark<00:01:19.040> a<00:01:19.160> few<00:01:19.370> other<00:01:19.520> seems<00:01:19.910> that<00:01:20.210> otherwise

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
mark a few other seems that otherwise

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.180 
mark a few other seems that otherwise
it'd<00:01:20.750> be<00:01:20.900> some<00:01:21.110> weird<00:01:21.350> stretching<00:01:21.920> on<00:01:22.040> its

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
it'd be some weird stretching on its

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.160 
it'd be some weird stretching on its
unwrapped<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:22.880> I'll<00:01:22.970> select<00:01:23.120> these<00:01:23.420> three<00:01:23.960> on

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
unwrapped so I'll select these three on

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.910 
unwrapped so I'll select these three on
the<00:01:24.320> top<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.910> mark<00:01:25.910> those<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:27.320> notice<00:01:27.619> this

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
the top and mark those you notice this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.980 
the top and mark those you notice this
one<00:01:28.160> is<00:01:28.700> mark<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.570> means<00:01:29.720> when<00:01:29.869> it's

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
one is mark that means when it's

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.770 
one is mark that means when it's
unwrapped<00:01:30.350> its<00:01:30.890> top<00:01:31.220> one<00:01:31.520> as<00:01:31.729> well<00:01:32.450> as<00:01:32.600> this

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
unwrapped its top one as well as this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.230 
unwrapped its top one as well as this
side<00:01:33.050> one<00:01:33.320> will<00:01:33.740> still<00:01:33.920> be<00:01:34.070> connected<00:01:34.430> we<00:01:35.090> need

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
side one will still be connected we need

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.640 
side one will still be connected we need
to<00:01:35.330> do<00:01:35.450> something<00:01:35.479> similar<00:01:35.930> for<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.320> bottom

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
to do something similar for the bottom

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.160 
to do something similar for the bottom
as<00:01:36.800> well<00:01:37.270> otherwise<00:01:38.270> they<00:01:38.600> would<00:01:38.750> be<00:01:38.930> wrapped

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
as well otherwise they would be wrapped

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.170 
as well otherwise they would be wrapped
properly<00:01:39.770> they're<00:01:40.369> actually<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:40.820> know<00:01:40.940> it's

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
properly they're actually you know it's

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.370 
properly they're actually you know it's
already<00:01:43.960> this<00:01:44.960> one<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.380> unwrapped<00:01:46.869> so<00:01:47.869> we<00:01:48.170> will

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
already this one is unwrapped so we will

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.670 
already this one is unwrapped so we will
mark<00:01:49.060> no<00:01:50.060> more<00:01:50.240> we're<00:01:50.990> good<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.140> go<00:01:51.229> i<00:01:51.350> believe

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
mark no more we're good to go i believe

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.680 
mark no more we're good to go i believe
one<00:01:52.369> last<00:01:52.580> thing<00:01:52.759> we<00:01:52.880> want<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.149> do<00:01:53.300> so<00:01:53.479> we<00:01:53.570> can

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
one last thing we want to do so we can

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.330 
one last thing we want to do so we can
actually<00:01:53.810> see<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.410> results<00:01:54.800> of<00:01:54.830> our<00:01:54.979> unreal

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
actually see the results of our unreal

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.170 
actually see the results of our unreal
and<00:01:55.970> it's<00:01:56.119> to<00:01:56.360> change<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:57.080> a<00:01:57.320> window<00:01:58.190> as<00:01:58.399> UV

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
and it's to change to a window as UV

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.910 
and it's to change to a window as UV
settings<00:01:59.600> in<00:01:59.720> order<00:01:59.869> to<00:01:59.960> do<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.470> can

whatever<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.170> want<00:03:16.350> we<00:03:16.590> can<00:03:16.709> grab<00:03:16.950> them<00:03:17.130> you

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
whatever you want we can grab them you

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.809 
whatever you want we can grab them you
can<00:03:17.880> scale<00:03:18.150> them<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.989> can<00:03:19.140> rotate<00:03:19.290> them<00:03:19.819> and

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
can scale them you can rotate them and

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.780 
can scale them you can rotate them and
scale<00:03:21.090> them<00:03:21.180> back<00:03:21.390> up<00:03:21.630> do<00:03:22.170> whatever<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.500> want

scale them back up do whatever you want

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.400 
scale them back up do whatever you want
this<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.940> useful<00:03:24.150> because<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.810> make<00:03:25.290> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
this is useful because you can make the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.960 
this is useful because you can make the
different<00:03:25.739> pieces<00:03:25.890> take<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> difference<00:03:26.819> in

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
different pieces take a difference in

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.130 
different pieces take a difference in
the<00:03:27.030> amount<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.360> space<00:03:27.569> depending<00:03:28.049> in<00:03:28.110> how

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
the amount of space depending in how

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.259 
the amount of space depending in how
much<00:03:28.380> details<00:03:28.890> needed<00:03:29.190> form<00:03:29.580> on<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.849> texture

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
much details needed form on the texture

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.289 
much details needed form on the texture
something<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.170> gets<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.500> lot<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.799> viewings

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
something that gets a lot of viewings

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.449 
something that gets a lot of viewings
maybe<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.630> top<00:03:33.870> /<00:03:34.560> roof<00:03:34.799> of<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.099> house<00:03:35.250> or

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
maybe the top / roof of the house or

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.190 
maybe the top / roof of the house or
something<00:03:35.670> could<00:03:36.299> have<00:03:36.450> more<00:03:36.660> detail<00:03:37.019> by

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
something could have more detail by

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.229 
something could have more detail by
taking<00:03:37.530> up<00:03:37.590> more<00:03:37.739> space<00:03:38.030> therefore<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.120> gets

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
taking up more space therefore it gets

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.410 
taking up more space therefore it gets
more<00:03:39.390> pixels<00:03:40.160> something<00:03:41.160> less<00:03:41.730> detailed<00:03:42.209> may

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420

save the UV face lab what this will do

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.050 
save the UV face lab what this will do
is<00:05:22.569> actually<00:05:22.810> give<00:05:23.680> you<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.919> option<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.550> the

things easy and usually what you want to
do<00:06:32.910> is<00:06:33.120> what<00:06:33.480> i<00:06:33.510> like<00:06:33.780> to<00:06:33.870> do<00:06:33.990> is<00:06:34.140> for<00:06:34.530> instance

do is what i like to do is for instance

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:41.030 
do is what i like to do is for instance
cube<00:06:35.310> and<00:06:36.380> UV<00:06:37.550> layout<00:06:38.810> do<00:06:39.810> that<00:06:40.020> so<00:06:40.290> that<00:06:40.320> i<00:06:40.770> can

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
cube and UV layout do that so that i can

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.040 
cube and UV layout do that so that i can
always<00:06:41.310> identify<00:06:41.430> what<00:06:42.210> the<00:06:42.330> file<00:06:42.540> is<00:06:42.750> because

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
always identify what the file is because

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.380 
always identify what the file is because
when<00:06:43.200> i<00:06:43.260> actually<00:06:43.440> edit<00:06:43.860> it<00:06:44.060> save<00:06:45.060> it<00:06:45.090> as<00:06:45.360> a

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
when i actually edit it save it as a

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.960 
when i actually edit it save it as a
cube<00:06:45.810> skin<00:06:46.680> that<00:06:47.190> way<00:06:47.340> i<00:06:47.370> know<00:06:47.520> what<00:06:47.850> the

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
cube skin that way i know what the

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.910 
cube skin that way i know what the
original<00:06:48.060> layout<00:06:48.480> was<00:06:48.960> and<00:06:49.380> I<00:06:49.440> can<00:06:49.620> hold<00:06:49.800> up

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 
original layout was and I can hold up

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.190 
original layout was and I can hold up
anytime<00:06:50.160> there<00:06:50.520> mom<00:06:50.700> back<00:06:51.030> above<00:06:51.360> it<00:06:51.510> you<00:06:51.780> can

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
anytime there mom back above it you can

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.140 
anytime there mom back above it you can
react<00:06:52.500> for<00:06:52.740> 10etime<00:06:53.010> but<00:06:53.460> certainly<00:06:53.940> it's

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
react for 10etime but certainly it's

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.690 
react for 10etime but certainly it's
handy<00:06:54.540> have<00:06:55.230> the<00:06:55.560> original<00:06:56.540> save<00:06:58.370> it's<00:06:59.370> saved

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
handy have the original save it's saved

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.060 
handy have the original save it's saved
and<00:07:00.180> then<00:07:00.720> I<00:07:00.900> could<00:07:01.140> for<00:07:01.320> instance<00:07:01.350> going<00:07:01.920> to

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
and then I could for instance going to

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.110 
and then I could for instance going to

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 
layer that's transparent and they do UV

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.530 
layer that's transparent and they do UV
in<00:07:49.740> the<00:07:49.830> background<00:07:50.280> and<00:07:50.490> industry<00:07:51.270> over<00:07:51.480> the

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:51.540 
in the background and industry over the

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.090 
in the background and industry over the
top<00:07:51.720> of<00:07:51.750> it<00:07:51.990> so<00:07:52.050> there's<00:07:52.260> never<00:07:52.410> any<00:07:52.650> confusion

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.100 
top of it so there's never any confusion

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.210 
top of it so there's never any confusion
hope<00:07:54.000> this<00:07:54.150> helps
