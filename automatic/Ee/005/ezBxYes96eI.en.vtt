00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.900
 have the preorder last 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.760
 category belonged to categories 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.830
 discuss devices that have just hit the market 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.929
 test that are not yet on the market though 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.779
 so they are announced together 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.180
 between the announcement and release 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.560
 and we actually look mainly at what 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.930
 interesting devices and not 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.579
 so many really good devices one 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.380
 of those integral devices first 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.369
 samsung galaxy s4 zoom 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.460
 actually it's just a digital 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.110
 camera with an s 4 to 8 glued on with 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.130
 slightly lesser specifications remain 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.780
 the s4 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.860
 the screen is somewhat smaller in the process 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.270
 slows down less 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.650
 all that kind of thing goes well there 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.480
 it is not about the concept 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.730
 from the actual coffin and galaxy camera 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.380
 but then a bit more handy 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.700
 he has is just a zoom lens it is 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.360
 also really has a camera on the 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.300
 side 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.850
 such a bobble we are good at 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.950
 can hold the zoom lens as a camera 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.210
 on that season which is of course unique 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.770
 in a smartphone 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.750
 and for us a very interesting one 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.310
 concept, we see ourselves as fast than 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.410
 with a camera as the primary telephone 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.809
 walk and call on more but that's good 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.240
 of course to the user to 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.650
 determine whether it will really be a success 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.490
 that question was a bit off it is 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.020
 of course also a bit one 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.370
 test balloon from samsung 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.840
 only in this case is it okay 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.700
 interesting concept and would be very curious 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 what will happen to it 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.340
 second is the samsung 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.979
 galaxy s3 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.740
 ps3 is just not yet in store 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.420
 he is not such a whole in terms of specifications 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.030
 also exciting in terms of price 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.659
 not true given the reputation of the one 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.940
 sled 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.950
 in terms of price and each value is 2 now 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.140
 also twice in this list 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.369
 So if gram occurs, you'll see how 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.049
 well the value of 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.490
 the device is also very, very bad 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.210
 curious about the history in that area 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.650
 going to do 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.229
 at this time the advice knit than 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.380
 300 euros that is a bit too much for that 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.270
 300 euros you get a smartphone with ltd 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.920
 a wvg year fencing 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.070
 a quick cry 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.659
 snapdragon processor so all that 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.979
 not so very thundering but we 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.130
 expect that the price will go fast 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.110
 bags to two 150 to 200 euros and 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.240
 passion and that price segment is coming 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.619
 then it becomes interesting and certain 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.570
 if it drops a little further and 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.569
 if he ended up on the price of the 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.290
 Galaxy is 2 hours 160 euros then comes 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.719
 very very interesting and 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.640
 a that is why this galaxy s3 is us 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:19.099
 is a very interesting phone 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.099
 look online first 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.659
 sony device well I the xperia z ultra 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.640
 and what's so interesting about xperia z 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.319
 ultra is the one that it 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.209
 most powerful phone is the one on this 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.739
 moment announced is one the first 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.379
 phone announced with a 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.150
 process or is right over the two gert 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.480
 sense to a qualcomm snapdragon 800 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.609
 processor with 2.2 gerts in 2 gigabytes 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.680
 Of course everything else in RAM memory 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.540
 on him another thing that quite 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.069
 interesting about this phone is that 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.930
 It is a phone that Sony really uses 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.280
 fully addresses the very large 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.139
 screen size 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.909
 Samsung leaves him Galaxy Mega at the door 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.310
 come 6.2 inch screen 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.349
 there is the z ultra has a 6.44 inch 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.239
 screen even slightly larger but it 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.189
 is not that with it like with samsung 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.200
 the galaxy note line is real flexi square 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.389
 with very large screen and the house 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.340
 galaxy mega there with its much 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.739
 larger screen a bit like 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.700
 kind of test balloon at the xperia z 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.709
 ultra it is different 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.150
 as long as you really go full on that 6.44 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.729
 inch screen we are very sorry 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.019
 wonder what that will bring you further 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:20.510
 you operate the screen error with a 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.250
 pencil I would like that 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.440
 and of course the z ultra is again 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.030
 waterproof and so super thin 6.5 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.190
 millimeters so immediately in from the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.229
 thinnest smartphones and of course 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.540
 waterproof all sony function stop 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:34.639
 8 megapixel camera, by the way 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.560
 without LED flash and just a super 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.010
 powerful and very big , we think so 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.010
 interesting
