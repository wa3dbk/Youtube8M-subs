00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
difficult car that I imagined to drive I

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.110 
difficult car that I imagined to drive I
spun<00:00:44.050> it<00:00:44.199> in<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.289> first<00:00:44.649> corner<00:00:44.980> because<00:00:45.219> you

throttle<00:00:47.829> and<00:00:48.489> it's<00:00:48.969> kind<00:00:49.329> of<00:00:49.359> the<00:00:49.480> opposite

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
throttle and it's kind of the opposite

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.660 
throttle and it's kind of the opposite
what<00:00:50.140> I've<00:00:50.260> learned<00:00:50.469> to<00:00:50.559> do<00:00:50.769> racing<00:00:51.339> in<00:00:51.460> rally
