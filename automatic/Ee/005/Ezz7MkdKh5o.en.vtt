of the blade so you have the right edge

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.380 
of the blade so you have the right edge
it's<00:01:07.740> gonna<00:01:07.920> feel<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:35.460 

in<00:01:21.950> our<00:01:22.100> circular<00:01:22.670> motions

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.719 

and<00:01:36.470> I'll<00:01:36.560> switch<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.950> other<00:01:37.159> side<00:01:37.430> just

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
and I'll switch to the other side just

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:55.300 
and I'll switch to the other side just
feel<00:01:40.729> it<00:01:40.909> for<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.299> edge<00:01:53.259> provide<00:01:54.259> sunny<00:01:54.860> South

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310

move on to the finer edge of the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.790 
move on to the finer edge of the
sharpener<00:03:12.290> I'm<00:03:13.290> gonna<00:03:13.440> do<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.920> same<00:03:14.160> thing

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
shavings off the blade first forests are

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.540 
shavings off the blade first forests are
the<00:03:25.920> fine<00:03:26.730> side<00:03:29.360> now<00:03:30.360> we<00:03:30.420> got<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:31.130> nice<00:03:32.130> clean

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550
