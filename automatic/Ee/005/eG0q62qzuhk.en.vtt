00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.400
 but first it began efe 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.439
 and living as little more 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:45.499
 masi 

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:48.559

 i joined everything everything everything everything I saw that I had foreseen 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:15.520
 but 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.539
 you have to know 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.539

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.710
 He was out 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.649
 and in the end he died 

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:31.960
 so 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.300
 Colorin Colorado 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.409
