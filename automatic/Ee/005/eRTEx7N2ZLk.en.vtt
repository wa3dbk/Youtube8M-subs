00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.360
 here are some quick tips 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.480
 to help you start your pile of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.480
 compost 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.940
 the first element actually that is very 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.440
 important is simply good 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.030
 choose the location of your 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.369
 composter so that a few small 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.650
 very simple rules that it takes 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.810
 follow the first I would say would be everything 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.580
 simply to choose the right place 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.750
 level of sunshine so no 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.670
 necessarily have a place that is 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.050
 constantly in the sun but on the other 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.390
 side not a place that is constantly 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.949
 exposed in the shade either so we say 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.960
 actually a place that is semi shaded 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.100
 according to the position of the sun 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.470
 during the day 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.230
 another element too which is important 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.180
 it's to make sure that not place our 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.570
 composter for example down a 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.190
 slope 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.020
 so we'll make sure that way there 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.579
 there will be a large accumulation of water 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.980
 who will get around the composter 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.750
 then that eventually make up the most 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.719
 sure without it a kind of mud is so 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.940
 because we want exactly on 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.890
 a land that is flat also other 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.090
 element that is very important is to 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.930
 place it maybe a place that goes 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.270
 to be close to your environment 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.320
 of use so near the garden near 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.820
 velvet from your flower beds 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.920
 so like that you will not constantly 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.899
 run it to go to fetch 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.619
 compost is obviously good I'm talking 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.270
 accessibility 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.530
 we do not want to east either 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.850
 place at the end of our court 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.250
 behind the shed 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.110
 we want to place a lucky place 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.580
 is near us by finishing one last 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.179
 element that is important in relation to 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.500
 the location 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.569
 it's simply to choose a 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.610
 place that are going to be smiling on the 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.170
 grass or in an environment that is natural 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.610
 finally so to place it the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.020
 problem it's your composter out of two 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.200
 there are gravel on the stap 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.820
 really place it on the grass 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.170
 next element that you on which 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.930
 we want to insist it is simply 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.369
 to turn the grass below 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.460
 composter so the idea is we're going 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.020
 cut them off actually have grass and we 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.360
 will their county tour to ensure 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.640
 that there was a good contact finally 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.530
 between the soil and the materials that we are going 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.880
 put inside the composter so 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.380
 it's going to make sure that the micro 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.319
 organisms and insects are going to be able 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.610
 return more easily once 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.489
 that it is done we are finally ready 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.830
 started the compost as such the idea is 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.810
 we are going to deposit at the bottom of the composter 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.849
 a layer of brown materials 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.489
 in fact we call these dry materials 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.290
 so for example twigs of the 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.090
 earth of dead leaves and so we go 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.630
 to line a good layer at the bottom 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.630
 composter 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.880
 we will go on with a layer of 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.960
 green matter 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.520
 in fact the green materials and the 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.320
 materials that are more humid so by 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.480
 example the leftover table and s of 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.000
 vegetable fruits the eggshells and 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.070
 caetera and we will drop over 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.150
 matter the brown matter and from 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.680
 their good level simply by 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.030
 alternation so a layer of bron a 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.430
 glass layer a layer of bron a 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.020
 layer of glass and actually if you 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.980
 want to know more about 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.810
 what can we put in the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.760
 composter what can we not do 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.560
 conversely in the composter actually 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.380
 invite you to visit our site 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.030
 triple w internet for no echo 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.470
 too much they point to the shepherd then you 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.300
 you can find a memory aid on 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.160
 start a composting that will give you 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.430
 a lot of stuff right there by 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.430
 approval 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.870
 the ratio of funds can be 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.330
 ask how much material 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.290
 going to put in the composter actually this 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.670
 which is important to remember is 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.590
 simply to keep a ratio that 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.210
 is u2 so for twice as many 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.310
 brown materials than green matter 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.100
 that we will drop in the composter and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.320
 and then simply drop a 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.730
 layer of brown materials over 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.900
 every layer of green matter we're going 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.070
 so drop as if we want to avoid 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.510
 that they had bad odors or 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.550
 who helped small fruit flies 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.940
 the example that what emerges from 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.940
 our composter 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.610
 so at the composting level actually 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.040
 as such on a daily basis this is 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.629
 no more complicated than that maybe 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.159
 a few small things that is good 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.439
 to remember the first one in fact this is 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.060
 in relation to humidity what we want 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.349
 in fact it is that microorganisms 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.019
 the insects that are in our 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.760
 composter can have access to a 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.079
 source of water so what we want from a 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.769
 side those who die so that they 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.269
 die of thirst 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.670
 and then along which you speak walnut no 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.250
 more so it's having a quantity 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.989
 of moisture that is adequate 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.099
 the image that we can give in relation to 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.730
 that's maybe the equivalent of a 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.109
 snowball 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.510
 we understand compost for us it's 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.010
 to make a snowball with 6 in 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.780
 making our ball will be happy that it 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.639
 crumbles then it does not fit but at this 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.380
 moment there is that our compost our 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.400
 composter do its content is too much 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.479
 dry 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.919
 what can we do if our 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.539
 compost is too dry in fact it's 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.160
 maybe just to add 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.770
 green matter wet materials 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.960
 in or another solution for example 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.849
 the days the rainy days can 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.389
 to actually drop excuse me we can 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.070
 open the compost bin and all 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.710
 simply leave the rain hanging 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.639
 a relatively short time for 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.740
 rebalance give back a quantity 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.280
 of adequate moisture to the contents of our 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.820
 compost 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.099
 on the other hand if our compost is 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.870
 too much wet so we try to do 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.530
 our ball then we realize that yo 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.570
 flowing water 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.460
 Well, then maybe it's 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.690
 simply be for example the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.389
 sunny days 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.699
 again to leave the lid 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.130
 open or is to add a 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.150
 largest ratio of brown materials to 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.150
 inside the compost 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.450
 other moisture another element that 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.860
 is important to consider 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.670
 if you want to compost 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.030
 domesticated 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.400
 it's the amount of air that our microphones 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.060
 organisms can have in our 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.580
 composter 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.260
 so the idea is to make holes 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.300
 simply with the aed for example 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.060
 an aerator where it can be everything 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.920
 just a fork a shovel a 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.330
 stick that hangs on top so doing 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.800
 holes we will make sure there is a 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.630
 good amount of air that goes into 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.210
 our compost and that's really fine 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.980
 boosted the biological activity up 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.450
 compost level for more 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.910
