00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 but of a demonstration in Naples 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.859
 follows for us alexandra of the world 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.339
 besides together with roberto fico 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.540
 president of the commission of 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.780
 vigilance of the well-found rai ad 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.150
 both gianluca good morning we are a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.530
 bathe a march to regain possession 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.599
 public spaces here where it was 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.210
 taught to be science exactly 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.460
 a year ago where there was the italsider of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.810
 I get wet here a few meters from where we are 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.850
 we find in the auditorium in progress 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.430
 the press conference said the four 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.170
 expulsions that made a lot of noise 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.550
 sign of a split within the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.410
 5 star movement talk about 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.230
 constant intimidation by 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.050
 farmhouse cricket sign of protection 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 that the movement wants to give what it wants 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.610
 give all the citizens they have 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.649
 voted the 5 star movement there not 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.200
 we can afford the formation of 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.660
 internal currents of having their own 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.030
 independent communication to convince 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.500
 other people do other things than I do 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.670
 maybe what the program of 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.289
 5 star movement 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.820
 we presented ourselves in a way 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.710
 we must be consistent with what 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.109
 we have read on all the stages in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.149
 italy if we become like the system 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.170
 and we don't fight it we lost the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.720
 we can't play this game 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.460
 allow and protection for all that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.270
 the people who believed and who have 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.369
 voted in us 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.130
 so the goal movement really is 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.720
 really full of health to the wool color 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.340
 the Baptist 2 of the expelled have said 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.530
 of her and of maio the vice-president of the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.509
 room two boys with a smile that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.990
 they have crushed democracy and freedom 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.450
 we went down heavy or nearly 40 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.030
 I don't feel like a kid today 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.400
 we are here in naples and in 2005 he founded 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.680
 the naples meetup in a very long way 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.780
 coherent and clear here we have formed the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.460
 lists for the regional ones among the first 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.250
 in Italy we have formed lists 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.659
 for municipal elections and no one ever a 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.510
 starting with beppe grillo and gianroberto 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.790
 casaleggio 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.340
 has made no interference in ours 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.330
 compare those are just small talk 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.710
 to hide a bad faith that 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.840
 persistent we do every week 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.600
 parliamentary group meeting 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.040
 we decide things together and then there 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.750
 we stick to what we have decided 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.490
 with difficulty but decided on one 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.500
 majority and you can't go outside 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.619
 always hitting his companions in the back 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.780
 travel colleagues of the movement 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.490
 gianluca you are so the honorable hear you 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.650
 yes maybe a less serious if it is true the 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.350
 crest that made 23 euros that is 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.020
 rules are absolutely not not me 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.790
 leave says will follow that ridge of 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.900
 23 euros that said beppe grillo that her 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.950
 he acted as chairman of the commission 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.260
 rai vigilance 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.690
 This of course that's the joke 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.890
 instead the series joke by president of 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.750
 rai supervisory board 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.460
 in short, we are quite shrewd 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.200
 seen the changes in the transition from 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.450
 read to renzi he noticed something 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.330
 different inside the rai obviously 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.790
 obviously as a commission us 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.810
 let's monitor if there are any 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.540
 unclear passages at this time is 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.360
 still too early but we work at 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.520
 defense and protection of all movements e 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.890
 political parties and citizens who 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.110
 pay and finance the RAI for a 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.920
 billion and 750 million euros 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.820
 when I say protect movements and parties 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.440
 I mean respect to pluralism 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.350
 information that absolutely must 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.300
 comply with current regulations or 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.670
 the par condicio law of 2000 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.989
 certainly good when he speaks of 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.510
 spending review 1 to turn off more 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.530
 obviously possible inside too 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.730
 of state television 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.370
 blaze and absolutely wash something that 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.010
 we are also pointing in the new 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.989
 service contract we are 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.220
 elaborating just in these days in 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.959
 supervision 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.269
 but renzi's spending review should 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.250
 be immediate, for example, on 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.800
 waiver of public funding to 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.060
 parties on the salary cut of the 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.680
 that is, parliamentarians we have given up 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.790
 immediately for 42 million euros i 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.890
 refunds of Italian in half 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.080
 of the compensation and the tenders we do not use 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.360
 will return them 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.460
 we study al in a background for small 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.990
 in fact on average we say about this 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.880
 eating means spending 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.540
 review on this there is some rumor seems 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.680
 that renzi 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.390
 he writes some newspaper either 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.890
 intent on asking for a cut of the 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.760
 salary of 2000 euros cut also 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.290
 other expenses 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.030
 hopefully fine thanks for being cool 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.860
 been with us thanks to alessandra de 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.860
 thank you and let's go
