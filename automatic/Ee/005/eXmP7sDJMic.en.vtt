00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.750
 and must all these baird fees 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.059
 I hope you are in shape 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.050
 so today a video that I you 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.070
 had promised for a while 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.599
 video about anti pig bases so in 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.009
 done i'm going to introduce you my base this 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.599
 is not the current design of my base 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.000
 but it's a dozen that I used 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.290
 for a while especially during 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.419
 trophy hunting to fend off 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.809
 the pig attacks so we get in 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.820
 immediately in the thick of it and 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:38.480
 is actually the premise of this base there 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.540
 is simple enough it's concrete and see 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.860
 a ring first defensive ring so 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.110
 this teenager I'm doing it 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.310
 turn there this ad is too much group 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.290
 most of the defensive structures 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.460
 to send the tones of archers for 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.760
 wizard antiaircraft guns on place 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.320
 also between spaces of bombs 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.880
 and the traps is actually the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.780
 pigs that are attacking you the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.780
 know first and foremost the structures 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.189
 defensives will go around this 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.409
 ring and destroy the structures of 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.119
 this announcement that actually they 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.470
 will be exposed to all 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.130
 defensive structures that are at 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:18.360
 the inside of the base namely the bow 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.520
 x the tesla the towers of hell 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.050
 so here you go tell me but 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.210
 why pigs do not fit in 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.100
 the heart of the base is actually 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.020
 diabolically simple is that the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.550
 pigs mode of operation of 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.990
 pigs makes it always attacks 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.430
 the defensive structure 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.270
 the next most defensive structure 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.010
 close and by creating this ring the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.050
 closest defensive structure 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.420
 still belongs to this year 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.300
 since if you look closely you 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.910
 notice that between this first ring 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.030
 defensive the heart of the base we created 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.300
 in fact a ring called a 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.920
 buffer ring that gathers him so to 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.000
 all that is other structure is to 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.300
 say mines 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.320
 the collectors here for the most part 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.340
 and the supports for the heroes you 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.660
 see there I'm doing the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.280
 turn of this ring and some others 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.259
 buffer in fact not created the distance 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.910
 between the center of the elano base 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.580
 defensive so that pigs 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.620
 systematically go around in 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.160
 made the first ring and for the shot 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.440
 are going to be exposed to structures 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.140
 central so to know arc x 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.510
 tesla is around hell this is it 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.670
 extremely simple but it works 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.180
 terribly good and so I you 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.690
 now proposes to actually illustrate 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.709
 this concept by two examples of attac 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.200
 pigtail I had on the base 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.060
 so we're going to go to the first 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.060
 examples right away 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:03:00.599
 which it is about you will see it a 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:04.290
 Left attack therefore there in a 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:07.440
 first time we have it's pretty classic 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.610
 for a pig attack the attacker 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.040
 who attracts the queen to that it's part 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.290
 waves to say imposed figures 1 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.530
 for a pig attack so he comes 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.010
 to destroy godmother he launches his 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.879
 pigs and you see watching them 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.560
 pigs are attacking 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.829
 the structural ring but you see 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:40.109
 they go around and by the way they are 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:42.270
 exposed around hell to arcs x and 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.540
 you see that already 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.850
 there are more pigs so it's going very 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.770
 very quickly 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.660
 this first ring makes it even more 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.940
 effective if you dispose of your bombs 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.010
 your app 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.290
 it's really going to do some damage 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.640
 considerable on pigs down the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.640
 sail to the aborted attacked 1 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.320
 it was a first example of which 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.450
 did you see a pigs who 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.920
 leave like that on the sides 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.770
 who do the trick that do not come in 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.990
 done on the heart of the base etc 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.190
 believe me very very effective for 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.440
 master this type of attac then a 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.450
 another example really in the same 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.740
 mind one but with someone who has 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.630
 still a little bigger trophies 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.820
 and then you're a better mastery I 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.550
 think pig attacks you have 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.580
 saw that he started by launching a few 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.560
 pigs then presumably for 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.620
 bring out the clan castle 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.960
 pulled the castle of clans the king the queen 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.430
 but then good oddly what he has 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.990
 almost managed to do it for the shot 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.630
 unfortunately he did not benefit 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.740
 but it is because he has deployed his 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.180
 coaches actually she eliminated some 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.590
 of the ring actually as you could 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.720
 see it at the top of your screen and is in 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.230
 it's really the only weakness 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.840
 in fact two of its anti pig bases 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.870
 is that if you succeed in breaking into 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.590
 does the continuity of this ring on on 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.690
 a good distance 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.660
 the risk is that if the attacker 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.419
 weight does the rest of his pigs at 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.130
 same place the pigs are not going anymore 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.160
 follow the ring and they will go 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.450
 directly to the heart of the base like 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.890
 you see it in fact there is none 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.450
 all benefited since it deployed its 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.340
 pigs to another place at the place 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.910
 where noÃ« still perfectly 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.880
 built so you see the pigs 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.229
 are going to be very, very quickly eliminated 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.270
 we are still on someone who 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:40.330
 better control pig attacks 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:43.090
 visibly chi chi times although they 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.130
 times better it's boom and that also has 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.490
 it must be said deployed more than two 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:53.140
 pigs one is on a level where actually 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:55.120
 top of trophies you'll see in 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.080
 does this attack will end with a 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.670
 49% 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:04.630
 so I think he must have had a little 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.560
 little dumplings but because 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.240
 look up at what he is trying 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.980
 to deploy there he after he deployed 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.980
 a few max wizard who go 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.970
 very very badly 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.120
 you will see that unfortunately for 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.950
 it will stop at 49% 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.260
 so here it was two examples actually 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.610
 of attack so I encourage you there is 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.520
 full of possible configurations 1 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.680
 based on this same model so 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.530
 have fun playing with his famous 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.110
 ring so keep it in mind the idea 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.750
 to always have a ring so a 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.370
 first defensive ring a second 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.710
 panel that we call our campaigns 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.150
 and the heart of the base that is supposed to him 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.860
 group the defensive structures 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.310
 the most powerful ones that hurt the most 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.330
 so 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:54.860
 arc x hell ride 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:57.319
 and tesla here we are very quickly 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.960
 with other videos there are particular 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.650
 will talk about the update that took 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.719
 place yesterday 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.729
 I'll see you soon for 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:06.729
 new ciao videos wear well
