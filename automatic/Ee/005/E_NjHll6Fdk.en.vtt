00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
beautiful skin that uses a certain line

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.750 
beautiful skin that uses a certain line
and<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.260> think<00:00:28.410> oh<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:29.160> know<00:00:29.250> let's<00:00:29.490> use<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.849 
and we think oh you know let's use that
skin<00:00:30.150> care<00:00:30.359> product<00:00:31.080> line<00:00:31.230> maybe<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.619> could<00:00:31.769> get

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
skin care product line maybe I could get

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.860 
skin care product line maybe I could get
the<00:00:31.949> same<00:00:32.160> results<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.329> doesn't<00:00:33.600> work<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the same results but it doesn't work the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.360 
the same results but it doesn't work the
same<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.200> us<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.680> that's<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:35.070> our

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
same for us and that's because our

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.639 
same for us and that's because our
genetics<00:00:35.760> may<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.030> different<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.410> that's

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
genetics may be different and so that's

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.560 
genetics may be different and so that's

well absolutely I mean so you know your

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.260 
well absolutely I mean so you know your
lifestyle<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.500> kind<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.860> tidal<00:02:08.310> wave<00:02:08.340> in

lifestyle is kind of a tidal wave in
terms<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.720> determining<00:02:09.869> which<00:02:10.349> to

action your skin is going to actually go
in<00:02:12.590> terms<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.950> aging<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.819> you<00:02:14.300> know<00:02:14.390> having<00:02:14.629> a

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
in terms of aging and you know having a

healthy glow and appearance I mean so

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.280 
healthy glow and appearance I mean so
obviously<00:02:16.819> if<00:02:17.690> you're<00:02:17.810> not<00:02:17.989> getting<00:02:18.200> any

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
obviously if you're not getting any

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.740 
obviously if you're not getting any

sleep if you're not staying hydrated you

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.380 
sleep if you're not staying hydrated you

know if you're a smoker if you're

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.330 
know if you're a smoker if you're
getting<00:02:23.629> a<00:02:23.780> lot<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:23.989> sun<00:02:24.290> exposure<00:02:24.319> all<00:02:25.069> those

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
getting a lot of sun exposure all those

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.210 
getting a lot of sun exposure all those
things<00:02:25.730> are<00:02:26.120> going<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.629> detract<00:02:27.080> from<00:02:27.470> the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
things are going to detract from the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.729 
things are going to detract from the
health<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.640> beauty<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.940> your<00:02:29.090> skin<00:02:29.739> it's

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
health and beauty of your skin it's

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.650 
health and beauty of your skin it's
interesting<00:02:31.069> for<00:02:31.310> instance<00:02:31.819> if<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.120> do<00:02:32.299> a<00:02:32.330> lot

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
interesting for instance if you do a lot

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.839 
interesting for instance if you do a lot
of<00:02:32.870> sun<00:02:33.200> exposure<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:34.160> then<00:02:34.370> you're<00:02:34.519> high

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
of sun exposure and then you're high

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.449 
of sun exposure and then you're high
risk<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.390> sun<00:02:35.720> category<00:02:36.440> that's<00:02:37.129> really

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
risk in that sun category that's really

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.430 
risk in that sun category that's really
kind<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.790> double<00:02:38.120> whammy<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:38.750> know<00:02:38.870> it's<00:02:39.079> an

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
area where you would really want to know

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.119 
area where you would really want to know
hey<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:41.690> important<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:42.290> me<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.470> stay<00:02:42.829> out<00:02:42.860> of

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
hey it's important for me to stay out of

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.210 
hey it's important for me to stay out of
the<00:02:43.340> Sun<00:02:43.579> because<00:02:44.569> I'm<00:02:45.349> already<00:02:45.620> high<00:02:45.829> risk<00:02:46.069> in

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
the Sun because I'm already high risk in

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.860 
the Sun because I'm already high risk in
that<00:02:46.250> category<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:47.510> know<00:02:47.629> for<00:02:47.810> instance

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
that category you know for instance

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.509 
that category you know for instance
antioxidants<00:02:48.859> I<00:02:48.950> mean<00:02:49.069> if<00:02:49.129> you're<00:02:49.250> making<00:02:49.459> a

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
antioxidants I mean if you're making a

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.280 
antioxidants I mean if you're making a
lot<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.670> free<00:02:49.849> radicals<00:02:49.970> from<00:02:50.299> smoking<00:02:51.019> or<00:02:51.170> an

unhealthy diet and your high risk in

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.479 
unhealthy diet and your high risk in
that<00:02:53.359> category<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.680> really<00:02:55.040> want<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.310> think

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
that category you really want to think

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.089 
that category you really want to think
about<00:02:55.579> changing<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.209> things<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:57.650> your<00:02:57.829> slit

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
about changing the things in your slit

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.680 
about changing the things in your slit
lifestyle<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.609> she<00:02:58.670> can<00:02:58.879> do<00:02:59.000> also<00:02:59.359> to<00:02:59.420> make

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
lifestyle that she can do also to make

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.390 
lifestyle that she can do also to make
sure<00:02:59.720> that<00:03:00.079> you<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.890> address<00:03:01.250> those

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
sure that you you address those

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.580 
sure that you you address those
high-risk<00:03:01.670> categories<00:03:02.359> amazing<00:03:02.900> if<00:03:03.200> someone

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
high-risk categories amazing if someone

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.190 
high-risk categories amazing if someone
got<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.859> DNA<00:03:04.040> swab<00:03:04.760> does<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.209> change<00:03:05.510> with<00:03:05.959> age

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
got the DNA swab does it change with age

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.229 
got the DNA swab does it change with age
like<00:03:06.230> let's<00:03:07.040> see<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.250> five<00:03:07.489> years<00:03:07.549> do<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.030> need

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
like let's see in five years do I need

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.930 
like let's see in five years do I need
to<00:03:08.390> do<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.660> again<00:03:08.930> or<00:03:09.230> is<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.670> great<00:03:10.670> question

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
to do it again or is it great question

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.360 
to do it again or is it great question
so<00:03:11.299> your<00:03:11.420> DNA<00:03:11.780> never<00:03:11.989> changes<00:03:12.530> okay<00:03:12.859> so<00:03:13.129> once

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
so your DNA never changes okay so once

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.909 
so your DNA never changes okay so once
we<00:03:13.549> have<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:13.879> information<00:03:14.769> literally<00:03:15.769> this

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
we have this information literally this

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.559 
we have this information literally this
is<00:03:16.099> your<00:03:16.250> genetic<00:03:16.609> programming<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.389> will

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
is your genetic programming that will

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.780 
is your genetic programming that will
stay<00:03:17.750> with<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.989> for<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> lifetime<00:03:18.430> which<00:03:19.430> means

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
stay with you for a lifetime which means

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.960 
stay with you for a lifetime which means
that<00:03:20.049> whenever<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:21.349> decide<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:22.250> do<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.579> DNA

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
that whenever you decide to do that DNA
