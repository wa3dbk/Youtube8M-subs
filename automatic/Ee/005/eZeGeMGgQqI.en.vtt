00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.989
 it seems that everyone has 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.250
 put in agreement metal gear solid 5 is 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.309
 one of best video games of this 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.719
 generation but of the industry itself 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.839
 let's see what notes have put me in 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.950
 different specialized media game you 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:19.770
 has put a 10 said in another 10 well and 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.440
 trailers has given you a 95 game informer 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.210
 a 91 25 she in Spanish pages 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.410
 we can see which band has given him a 9 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.670
 like me 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.470
 I said in Spain the age of a 9.5 things a 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.570
 highlighting in the same analyzes is by 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.370
 example that the history in gamespot is 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.350
 says it's very interesting and that you 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.120
 hook from beginning to end the problem 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.310
 is that maybe at the end of the game 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.700
 had to lose a bit the rhythm 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.290
 in fact ign usa and I did something like that 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.230
 like dir's story is a bit 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.000
 scattered but usually what 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.860
 transmits is that he liked the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.140
 experience to look for ads in the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.280
 different analyzes and then in the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.520
 now it seems that everyone 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.650
 agrees that it is very good for 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 example shows that the report 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.320
 it says something like that some of the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.360
 commands well they are somewhat annoying 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.320
 but what is the basic mechanics of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.960
 cyclical onslaught is very solid in fact and 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.020
 that in the USA it says that it has a quality 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.210
 exceptional sandbox and going back to that my 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.030
 sport says it offers the best in its 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.860
 class in a stealth game and in addition 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.620
 he says he has a huge world 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.480
 open and dense with very possibilities 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.210
 interesting another thing that is praised 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.280
 much that keifer sutherland like new 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.590
 of beatbox although this one does not talk so much 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.030
 as in old speed game go up 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.070
 hater is in fact one thing that 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.930
 comments in analysis that this metal no longer 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.900
 I would have so many mathematics in 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.780
 comparison with others you read the saga and 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.300
 well a little interlacing the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.770
 cinematic and with graphically how 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.229
 see the game as nothing the presence 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.150
 also coincides in this section in 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.160
 English group and here is just great 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.630
 it's great to see metal gear grades in 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.159
 movement and we're going to enjoy it 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.469
 much 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.300
 another thing that stands out a lot in 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:13.110
 others have the music convinced that 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.030
 they are playing inside the game something that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.090
 they always watch a lot of hideo kojima in their 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.349
 productions and to finish this has 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.450
 left a little to the end but 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.580
 the mother page also stands out 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.099
 I mean, she really liked playing with her 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.709
 they say it's kind of like 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.290
 touch of fresh air not within what 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.590
 is the game itself not a small respite 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.840
 something different and what and what good and believes 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.750
 that is very well integrated within the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.769
 same game and good more or less of this 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.739
 it's fine talking about what are the 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.099
 pathetic specialized in order we 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.780
 expected as I say a great game 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.269
 At least I really want to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.880
 play today I have the hype especially 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.410
 uploaded so good 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.110
 so far the video but that I have 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.770
 liked to comment and even more videos 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.770
 goodbye
