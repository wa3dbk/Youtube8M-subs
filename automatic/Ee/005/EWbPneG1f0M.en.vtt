00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello friends now I will show you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.490
 how can you make an electric dryer for 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.910
 do-it-yourself fish to listen to 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.210
 just for 7 hours and so for us 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.850
 it needs 4th . three of which 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.699
 same size a 4 deeper 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.199
 five centimeters but with the perimeter 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.870
 It is the same size as me quietly. 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:39.379
 60 watt light bulb cartridge 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.850
 cord and thermostat for incubator 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.000
 first you points need to do 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.760
 the hole I got them 243 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.059
 you can make a smaller amount but 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.160
 this hole should be bigger 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.899
 so i did all three like that a 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.480
 that's just where will the heating 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.770
 element must be drilled into 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.770
 mostly around the edges 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.790
 It is also necessary to fasten the legs on 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.790
 very easy such 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.740
 in the lid must be done on the sides 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.740
 more holes than in the middle 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.539
 thermostat temperature sensor 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.810
 must be placed at the bottom 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.960
 body. 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.960
 here 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.049
 temperature needed on 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.359
 thermostat leave no more than 40 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.359
 I put 38 degrees 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.780
 passed the 7th number the rope has already wilted us 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.330
 when 3 hours have passed after switching on 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.129
 dryers i have one slice of cuts big 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.340
 but such stripes and in general they already 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.079
 dried out 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.629
 and the big pieces just started 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.060
 It is very important that the fish do not cook and 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:57.290
 you need to do it first 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.599
 many holes at points and second 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.989
 must not exceed the temperature above 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.760
 38 degrees now I decided for myself 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.579
 that the fish will be dried only in this 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.700
 dryers and here such stripes and and 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.099
 cut it will be both quick and better it 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.180
 convenient so friends if you video 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.349

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.959
 per channel 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.930
