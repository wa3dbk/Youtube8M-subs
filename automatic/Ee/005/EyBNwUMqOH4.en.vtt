 cold the bus we unmold and the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.870
 We present on a grid for 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.850
 then to be able to pass some of those 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.790
 glaze over those chocolate glitters 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.740
 usually made with a syrup of 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.560
 chocolate glucose and some gelatin it 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.250
 which calls a dark square or a 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.680
 cocoa dark glaze and then on 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.170
 the edges I'm going to put a bit of the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.690
 same dough the same biscuit cut into 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.180
 cubes and baked to dry well 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.760
 barely toasted and that's going to be the job 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.050
 of the basic decoration we go then 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.670
 to glacier this search keeps going 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.240
 and more 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.240
 ah 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.090
 let's finish with some cubes 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.030
 here we have a 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.629
 mini pears that will help us 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.010
 discover exactly what is the 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:18.230
 content 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.230
 from that in that interior 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:29.400
 and then we will finish over 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.400
 with two or three cubes of the same mass 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.740
 a cocoa seed 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.910
 and we're going to put a little bit of an aerosol 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.910
 silver for 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.340
 so that the bathroom 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.340
 change completely 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.580
 and they want to do it with a cake more than 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.430
 luxury 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.270
 and put a silver leaf as well 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.620
 comes edible gold too 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.620
 we can have 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:20.260
 this is also not anyone is not the 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.290
 silver that is used to 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.720
 the works of frames and pictures but 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.350
 which is a silver that is used to 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.630
 gastronomy 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.630
 we now take the table 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:39.750
 we have 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.229
 this bus that can be something simple or 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.469
 it can be a very luxurious dessert all that 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.599
 it depends on how we go through it but what 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:52.650
 that it is undeniable that the flavors 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:54.950
 combined of the chocolate sandunga 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.760
 of the pears is a 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.820
 product that we can not stop thinking about 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.430
 I wait for you in the next program with 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.000
 more more chocolate recipes and many more 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.000
 techniques 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.570
