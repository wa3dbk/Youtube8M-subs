00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello here reginaldo ferreira director of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.610
 raymarine and aeronautics 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.770
 we recorded a video that sometimes 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.560
 people have asked us what it generates 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.439
 very doubt supply your engine of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.390
 stern in the case for you that has a motor 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.460
 two-stroke stern 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.949
 we 're here with the tank tied me 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 and this tank in the case is used in the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.850
 two-stroke outboard 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.820
 I'll explain now with the sequence 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.710
 what you must do to supply the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.260
 motor 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.370
 you must first put the two oil 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.489
 times 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.140
 if a break-in period is that 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.770
 the proportion that is already in your 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.940
 manual of one liter of oil for 20 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.780
 liters of gasoline 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.680
 soon after the storage period until 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.670
 the 40 hp is for 15 from 18 to 40 and you 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.400
 will use the mixture of a book to 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.729
 40 to 40 liters of gasoline 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.360
 come on first you put the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.090
 oil after you put gas always 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.670
 this tank understands a quarry 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.430
 it is very important you will keep the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.380
 staff tends to ensure that the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.220
 It is done as quickly withdraw this 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 sieve 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.990
 No, she's not here, by any chance, she has. 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.479
 this service that is just filtering 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.490
 which is in the case of dropping some this with 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.270
 something he does not go to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.100
 duration usually your system 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.540
 motor that he has no problem 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.060
 after performance 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.500
 then let sieve put the oil logo 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 after putting gasoline 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.619
 done this procedure I close both 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.810
 just close your sigh and shake it well 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.439
 this tank paid the pope that this 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.450
 gasoline and mix 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.880
 another fact another important detail is 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.320
 that you always use, use with oil 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.630
 indicated by the manufacturer 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.429
 in the case of yamaha is oil and malu 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.650
 bitters and w3 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.200
 I always try to use the oil 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.329
 indicated by the manufacturer this year he 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.610
 undergoes tests, right? 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.349
 it is an oil really that your engine 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.299
 will adapt better to it 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.129
 it improves consumption it decreases 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.890
 carbonization of your engine 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.599
 you will spend less on non-maintenance 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.569
 it's worth you to invest in oil 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.370
 quality then there is our tip neither 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.950
