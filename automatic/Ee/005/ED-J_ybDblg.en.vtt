so<00:04:32.759> whenever<00:04:32.910> Barack<00:04:33.330> Obama<00:04:33.690> comes<00:04:33.990> out<00:04:34.259> and

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
so whenever Barack Obama comes out and

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.409 
so whenever Barack Obama comes out and
says<00:04:34.979> about<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.340> government<00:04:35.699> shut<00:04:35.880> shut<00:04:36.210> down

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
says about the government shut shut down

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:44.379 
says about the government shut shut down
says<00:04:36.690> this<00:04:42.259> that<00:04:43.259> the<00:04:43.380> government<00:04:43.830> shutdown

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.490 
says this that the government shutdown
happens<00:04:45.389> to<00:04:45.570> be<00:04:45.690> on<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.960> background<00:04:46.410> of

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
happens to be on the background of

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.279 
happens to be on the background of
broader<00:04:46.770> changes<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.660> think<00:04:48.660> he's<00:04:48.810> right<00:04:49.050> I

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
broader changes I think he's right I

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.990 
broader changes I think he's right I
think<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:49.830> government<00:04:50.460> shutdown<00:04:50.820> is

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
think this government shutdown is

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.589 
think this government shutdown is
setting<00:04:51.330> up<00:04:51.479> or<00:04:51.720> or<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.830> certainly<00:04:53.340> part<00:04:53.639> of<00:04:53.789> a

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
setting up or or is certainly part of a

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.310 
setting up or or is certainly part of a
bigger<00:04:54.840> change<00:04:55.199> that's<00:04:55.500> coming<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:55.979> sure<00:04:56.520> do<00:04:57.320> so

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
bigger change that's coming I sure do so

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.170 
bigger change that's coming I sure do so

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
are but at least once maybe twice a week

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.540

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
for sure they go out there and spray in

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.760 
for sure they go out there and spray in
front<00:05:23.729> of<00:05:23.789> that<00:05:23.849> Sun<00:05:24.120> big<00:05:24.389> time<00:05:24.599> I<00:05:24.900> don't<00:05:25.710> know

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
front of that Sun big time I don't know

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.230 
front of that Sun big time I don't know
if<00:05:25.889> they're<00:05:26.039> trying<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.400> set<00:05:26.580> something<00:05:26.849> up<00:05:27.060> I

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
if they're trying to set something up I

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.450 
if they're trying to set something up I
started<00:05:27.840> tried<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.169> stage<00:05:28.409> an<00:05:28.590> event<00:05:28.680> or<00:05:29.039> if

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
started tried to stage an event or if

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.040 
started tried to stage an event or if
they're<00:05:29.610> trying<00:05:29.880> to<00:05:29.940> hide<00:05:30.150> an<00:05:30.300> event<00:05:30.599> but<00:05:30.930> they

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
they're trying to hide an event but they

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.899 
they're trying to hide an event but they
are<00:05:31.169> definitely<00:05:31.380> definitely<00:05:32.220> spraying<00:05:32.789> it

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
are definitely definitely spraying it

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.189 
are definitely definitely spraying it
from<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.210> Sun<00:05:33.419> I<00:05:33.599> used<00:05:33.810> to<00:05:33.870> think<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.139> was

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
from the Sun I used to think it was

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.540 
from the Sun I used to think it was
definitely<00:05:34.620> just<00:05:34.710> all<00:05:34.889> part<00:05:35.099> of<00:05:35.220> blue<00:05:35.370> beam

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
definitely just all part of blue beam

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.149 
definitely just all part of blue beam
but<00:05:35.820> obviously<00:05:36.719> something<00:05:37.530> about<00:05:37.710> it<00:05:37.889> must<00:05:38.039> be

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
but obviously something about it must be

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.399 
but obviously something about it must be
real<00:05:38.400> if<00:05:38.639> things<00:05:39.449> are<00:05:39.599> crashing<00:05:40.020> into<00:05:40.199> houses

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
real if things are crashing into houses

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.140 
real if things are crashing into houses
and<00:05:40.710> setting<00:05:40.949> them<00:05:41.009> on<00:05:41.099> fire<00:05:41.159> so<00:05:41.759> that's<00:05:41.969> not<00:05:42.090> a

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
and setting them on fire so that's not a

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.089 
and setting them on fire so that's not a
hologram<00:05:42.449> but<00:05:42.960> who<00:05:43.259> know<00:05:43.650> who<00:05:43.800> seriously
