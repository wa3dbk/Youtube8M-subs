00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
circular motions and I find that works

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.150 
circular motions and I find that works
well<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:33.040> with<00:02:33.850> soap<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.360> water<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.800> thing<00:02:36.010> I

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
well and with soap in water the thing I

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.640 
well and with soap in water the thing I
hate<00:02:36.400> about<00:02:36.430> doing<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.180> using<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.020> one<00:02:38.350> sock

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
hate about doing it using that one sock

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.120 
hate about doing it using that one sock
liners<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.760> feel<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.080> pushes<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
liners is I feel that it just pushes the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.780 
liners is I feel that it just pushes the
dirt<00:02:42.850> around<00:02:43.270> like<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.140> more<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.410> brush<00:02:44.800> with

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
dirt around like the more I brush with

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.010 
dirt around like the more I brush with
the<00:02:46.060> soap<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.570> water

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
the soap and water

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.190 
the soap and water
you<00:02:47.560> know<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:47.800> will<00:02:48.100> see<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.510> original

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
you know I will see the the original

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.670 
you know I will see the the original
white<00:02:50.560> or<00:02:50.860> color<00:02:51.220> start<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.790> come<00:02:52.030> back<00:02:52.380> but<00:02:53.380> as

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
white or color start to come back but as

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.070 
white or color start to come back but as
I<00:02:53.890> push<00:02:54.220> away<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.550> dirt<00:02:55.030> but<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.420> find<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.930> it

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
I push away that dirt but I find that it

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.620 
I push away that dirt but I find that it
just<00:02:56.290> goes<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.220> whatever<00:02:57.550> direction<00:02:57.820> I<00:02:58.330> push

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
just goes in whatever direction I push

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.520 
just goes in whatever direction I push
and<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.140> tends<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.560> get<00:02:59.860> trapped<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:02.440> know

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
and it tends to get trapped so you know

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.190 
and it tends to get trapped so you know
that<00:03:02.769> is<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.370> one<00:03:03.610> negative<00:03:04.090> thing<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.720> don't

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
that is the one negative thing I don't

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.020 
that is the one negative thing I don't
like<00:03:05.350> about<00:03:05.470> soap<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.250> water<00:03:06.459> when<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.820> comes

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
like about soap and water when it comes

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.060 
like about soap and water when it comes
to<00:03:07.209> sock<00:03:07.480> liners<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.440> that's<00:03:08.650> why<00:03:08.799> I<00:03:08.830> usually

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
to sock liners so that's why I usually

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.910 
to sock liners so that's why I usually
just<00:03:09.459> use<00:03:09.580> these<00:03:10.200> two<00:03:11.200> products<00:03:11.680> made<00:03:11.890> by
