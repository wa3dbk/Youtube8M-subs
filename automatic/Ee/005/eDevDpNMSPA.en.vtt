00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
package would get installed onto the OS
and<00:01:06.479> then<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.560> applications<00:01:08.100> which<00:01:08.280> are

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and then the applications which are

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.609 
and then the applications which are
pre-installed<00:01:09.330> onto<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.900> device<00:01:10.049> would<00:01:10.380> get

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
pre-installed onto this device would get

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.469 
pre-installed onto this device would get
optimized<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.580> new<00:01:11.790> firmware<00:01:12.119> update

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
optimized for this new firmware update

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.929 
optimized for this new firmware update
so<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> take<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.530> while<00:01:13.830> maybe<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.549> around<00:01:14.640> 3

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
so to take a while maybe like around 3

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.550 
so to take a while maybe like around 3
to<00:01:15.060> 4<00:01:15.090> minutes<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.020> process<00:01:16.470> to

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
to 4 minutes for this process to

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.410 
to 4 minutes for this process to
complete<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.100> let<00:01:17.250> me<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.580> move<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.210> part

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
complete so let me just move to the part

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.850 
complete so let me just move to the part
where<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:18.930> taken<00:01:19.259> back<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.650> home

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
where we are taken back to the home

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.210 
where we are taken back to the home
screen<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> firmware<00:01:22.200> has<00:01:22.350> been<00:01:22.590> updated

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
screen so the firmware has been updated

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.010 
screen so the firmware has been updated
to<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> version<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.750> had<00:01:24.990> shown

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to the version which we had shown

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.730 
to the version which we had shown
earlier

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
earlier

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.550 
earlier
and<00:01:25.970> now<00:01:26.970> all<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> applications<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.140> come

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and now all the applications which come

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.899 
and now all the applications which come
additionally<00:01:29.220> installed<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.850> device

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
additionally installed on this device

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
additionally installed on this device
are<00:01:30.329> being<00:01:30.600> reinstalled<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> new

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
are being reinstalled because of the new

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
are being reinstalled because of the new
update<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.630> would<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.930> taken<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
update and then we would be taken to the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.080 
update and then we would be taken to the
home<00:01:34.710> screen<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> home<00:01:35.970> screen

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
home screen so this is the home screen

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.719 
home screen so this is the home screen
here<00:01:36.240> let<00:01:37.079> me<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.860> settings<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
here let me just go to the settings and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.920 
here let me just go to the settings and
check<00:01:39.390> out<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:40.280> current<00:01:41.280> OS<00:01:41.790> version<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.810> it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
check out the current OS version so it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.740 
check out the current OS version so it's
the<00:01:43.020> same<00:01:43.200> OS<00:01:43.590> version<00:01:44.100> which<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.880> open<00:01:45.210> 1.2
