00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.799
 my name is Juan Manuel today I'm going to 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.810
 tell why I like to ride crossings 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.200
 also known as bananas or mini 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.200
 boards 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.900
 do not 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.930
 to a cross is a small board like 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.090
 we can see the little cruiser of 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.220
 trip to walk around the city ​​so 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.030
 light and so small are perfect 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.030
 bands through the city 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.900
 It consists of some silicone wheels 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 soft so that the pavement is 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.129
 like feel with sun or 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.720
 shoulder which is that it feels as if 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.210
 out butter the pavement the 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.070
 address that has a banana is is 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.580
 much more than a skateboard to be 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.130
 feel to give the similar feeling 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.509
 when surfing it is a polypropylene board 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.180
 resistant reinforced software maybe 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:19.409
 perfectly 95 kilos approximately 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.409
 is supporting a table of this 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.090
 Washington 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.750
 where the idea of ​​being encouraged and the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.880
 crosses the crosses are born let's say when 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.479
 It's something very old since the 70's 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.040
 using in california the surfers arrive 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.740
 in good we want to put the 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.330
 sun board a few rims to see if 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.530
 we have the same sensation of sipping in 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.660
 someone the street while we 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.100
 we transport we can go practicing what 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.200
 they put some tires on a table 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.619
 surfing and it's when the crosses are born in 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.619
 70 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.010
 Y 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.590
 also the great utility that this has 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.930
 type of tables is that you can shoot 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.000
 as if to be a wolf thus make 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.880
 tricks like they look like a skate 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.650
 puts the plastic part more you can 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.140
 put sanding as the person wants or 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.480
 complete or put the sanding lines and 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.180
 the table enlarges its possibilities where 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.420
 you can do one where you can do 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.480
 bowles management in the village anda super 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.310
 fast two very good effects in the bowl 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.310
 It is a very versatile table 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.930
 from all this the idea of 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.610
 mount a brand I started looking 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.040

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.910
 get to ride my brand of mini words and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.330
 we came to a group friends we got to 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.540
 that to a first name that was flipping 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.540

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.219
 in a group of friends it became 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.409
