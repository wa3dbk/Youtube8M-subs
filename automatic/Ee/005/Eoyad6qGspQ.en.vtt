00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.350
 hello everyone today I you 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.710
 found for a Christmas video contest 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.529
 and confuse and 100 subscribers that makes 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.220
 super long time I've gone over 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.900
 100 subscribers but I was a bit late and there 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.590
 I had an opportunity that does not refuse 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.530
 not so for Christmas I will spoil you 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.960
 of course there are conditions for 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.540
 able to validate your participation in 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160
 contest so the first good 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.699
 obviously it is to subscribe to the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.340
 chain then it's to share the 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.440
 contest video on your page 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.329
 facebook twitter one gets alarmed what you 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.420
 want but then you share 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.609
 put a comment 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.010
 like what are you then participating in 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.820
 just I participate no take when 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.350
 even a little more vocabulary than 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.600
 it is against it will be a comment 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.060
 for the duration of the contest so 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.700
 be careful put only one 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.729
 comments under the video never forgotten 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.189
 to clarify that when you put the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.979
 commentary of participations precise and 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.229
 me if you prefer to have the neck and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.329
 of basic the niquer of houla nick is a 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.899
 because it is highly possible that 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.439
 you already have one of the three ways 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:41.610
 then has the cuckoo is open to 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.530
 international and as well as to minors 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.740
 during the draw that I will do in 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.160
 direct if one of the people who is 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.440
 chosen is a minor I will ask 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.360
 that time parental permission this 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.380
 which is normal for the disclosure of 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.240
 the address of the person 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.540
 that's otherwise everyone can 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.630
 participate no worries for reasons 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.410
 of frau all that as I saw on the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.430
 latest videos from youtube buzz 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.860

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.060
 to a beautiful patient he will have time from home 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.450
 because of cosmetics talk with 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.810
 a whole package at all a little package 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.680

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.250
 brand products 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.229
 cosmetics which really allows 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.830
 to be able to test all their products 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.930
 that I find very very well so that's it 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:32.210

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:36.169
