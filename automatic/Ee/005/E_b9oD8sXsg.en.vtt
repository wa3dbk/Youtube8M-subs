00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
device and because this is dual systems

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.859 
device and because this is dual systems
is<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:13.650> share<00:01:14.220> each<00:01:14.369> other's

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
is it will not share each other's

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
is it will not share each other's
performances<00:01:15.869> or<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.560> storage<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.430> all

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
separate and then here the reason skull

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.510 
separate and then here the reason skull
transformer<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.530> pull<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:26.310> will

most innovative machining this year and

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.360 
most innovative machining this year and
because<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:07.569> got<00:03:07.690> dual<00:03:08.019> system<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.890> also<00:03:09.069> has

wish<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.640> we<00:03:12.820> can<00:03:13.060> turn<00:03:13.390> android<00:03:14.380> pad<00:03:14.650> here

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
wish that we can turn android pad here

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.960 
wish that we can turn android pad here
into<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.030> windows<00:03:16.510> pad<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.739> basically<00:03:18.100> through

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
into a windows pad so basically through

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.900 
into a windows pad so basically through
wireless<00:03:19.500> connections<00:03:20.500> we<00:03:21.340> can<00:03:21.489> turn<00:03:21.730> this

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
wireless connections we can turn this

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.569 
wireless connections we can turn this
into<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.359> windows<00:03:23.260> pad<00:03:23.500> however<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.160> software

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
into a windows pad however the software

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.069 
into a windows pad however the software
is<00:03:24.670> still<00:03:24.850> tuned<00:03:25.060> right<00:03:25.480> now<00:03:25.690> which<00:03:25.930> would

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
is still tuned right now which would

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.069 
is still tuned right now which would
optimize<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.560> software<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.459> so<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.180> when

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
optimize the software so so that when

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.229 
optimize the software so so that when
your<00:03:29.230> twin<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.530> actually<00:03:30.100> released<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:31.150> the

public that will download function or

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.110 
public that will download function or
that<00:03:33.850> feature<00:03:34.060> will<00:03:34.359> work<00:03:34.540> very<00:03:34.569> well<00:03:35.069> cool

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120
