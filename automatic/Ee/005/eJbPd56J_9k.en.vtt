00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.579 

what's<00:00:10.910> up<00:00:11.090> in<00:00:11.240> one<00:00:11.450> as<00:00:11.929> you<00:00:12.080> can<00:00:12.200> see<00:00:12.349> i<00:00:12.379> got

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:12.589 
what's up in one as you can see i got

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.940 
what's up in one as you can see i got
the<00:00:12.860> bankroll<00:00:13.700> sitting<00:00:14.299> right<00:00:14.450> there

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
the bankroll sitting right there

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.350 
the bankroll sitting right there
actually<00:00:15.950> loose<00:00:16.250> right<00:00:16.580> now<00:00:16.610> and<00:00:17.030> it's<00:00:17.150> just

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
actually loose right now and it's just

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.029 
actually loose right now and it's just
for<00:00:17.539> lining<00:00:17.990> up<00:00:18.140> some<00:00:18.289> stuff<00:00:18.500> since<00:00:18.770> i<00:00:18.920> have

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
for lining up some stuff since i have

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.000 
for lining up some stuff since i have
planed<00:00:19.310> on<00:00:19.460> placing<00:00:20.330> a<00:00:20.420> faint<00:00:20.750> beneath<00:00:21.590> it<00:00:21.830> and

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
planed on placing a faint beneath it and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.010 
planed on placing a faint beneath it and
figure<00:00:22.760> out<00:00:22.790> that<00:00:23.120> it's<00:00:23.210> enough<00:00:23.480> spacing

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
figure out that it's enough spacing

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.580 
figure out that it's enough spacing
between<00:00:24.620> the<00:00:25.550> power<00:00:26.030> supply<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:26.570> blade<00:00:27.380> up

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
between the power supply and blade up

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.970 
between the power supply and blade up
here<00:00:27.860> so<00:00:28.040> those<00:00:28.420> about<00:00:29.420> this<00:00:29.840> size<00:00:30.260> space<00:00:30.710> but

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
here so those about this size space but

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.709 
here so those about this size space but
i<00:00:31.010> actually<00:00:31.160> put<00:00:31.520> up<00:00:31.790> a<00:00:31.940> faint<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.509> main

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
i actually put up a faint and the main

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.080 
i actually put up a faint and the main
reason<00:00:32.750> is<00:00:33.260> because<00:00:33.559> i<00:00:34.160> want<00:00:34.399> to<00:00:34.460> have<00:00:34.670> a<00:00:34.700> fan

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
reason is because i want to have a fan

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.770 
reason is because i want to have a fan
to<00:00:35.329> blow<00:00:35.480> out<00:00:35.809> about<00:00:36.320> over<00:00:36.769> the<00:00:36.949> graphic<00:00:37.399> cards

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
to blow out about over the graphic cards

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.910 
to blow out about over the graphic cards
it<00:00:38.780> might<00:00:39.140> or<00:00:39.469> might<00:00:39.829> not<00:00:40.429> give<00:00:41.059> a<00:00:41.920> cooling

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
it might or might not give a cooling

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.209 
it might or might not give a cooling
performance<00:00:43.100> but<00:00:43.850> i<00:00:44.089> hope<00:00:44.480> so<00:00:44.749> since<00:00:45.019> i<00:00:45.739> don't

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
performance but i hope so since i don't

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.889 
performance but i hope so since i don't
know<00:00:46.399> if<00:00:46.519> you<00:00:46.640> guys<00:00:46.789> remember<00:00:46.850> my<00:00:47.449> one<00:00:47.780> of<00:00:47.809> my

at<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.329> use<00:02:17.450> with<00:02:17.629> it<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.650> plan<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:19.099> to

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
at the use with it and the plan is to

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.809 
at the use with it and the plan is to
mount<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.970> hard<00:02:20.180> drive<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.959> SSDs<00:02:21.829> on<00:02:22.129> this

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
mount the hard drive the SSDs on this

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.780 
mount the hard drive the SSDs on this
one<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:24.189> cut<00:02:25.189> it<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.150> fits<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:28.340> holders

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
one and cut it in so it fits the holders

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.350 
one and cut it in so it fits the holders
right<00:02:29.060> down<00:02:29.329> here<00:02:30.159> so<00:02:31.159> it<00:02:31.670> will<00:02:31.819> look<00:02:31.849> better

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
right down here so it will look better

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.500 
right down here so it will look better
and<00:02:33.230> probably<00:02:33.680> also<00:02:33.950> get<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.459> piece<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.269> a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
and probably also get a piece of a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.589 
and probably also get a piece of a
marrow<00:02:36.189> we<00:02:37.189> got<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.370> name<00:02:37.549> arakata<00:02:38.030> out<00:02:38.329> in<00:02:38.510> the

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
marrow we got a name arakata out in the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.140 
marrow we got a name arakata out in the
workshop<00:02:39.049> so<00:02:39.409> get<00:02:40.069> a<00:02:40.099> mirror<00:02:40.340> down<00:02:40.670> here<00:02:40.939> so

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
workshop so get a mirror down here so

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.819 
workshop so get a mirror down here so
when<00:02:41.299> you<00:02:41.420> look<00:02:41.569> inside<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.140> computer<00:02:42.470> the

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
when you look inside the computer the

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.970 
when you look inside the computer the
SSD<00:02:43.430> will<00:02:43.730> go<00:02:44.629> in<00:02:44.840> reflection<00:02:45.470> down<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.920> you

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
SSD will go in reflection down and you

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.699 
SSD will go in reflection down and you
like<00:02:46.189> to<00:02:46.340> see<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.640> reflection<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.709> this

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
like to see the reflection of the this

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.860 
like to see the reflection of the this
is<00:02:48.859> t<00:02:49.010> when<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.340> look<00:02:49.519> down<00:02:49.879> to<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.299> but<00:02:50.569> I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
is t when you look down to this but I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.899 
is t when you look down to this but I
don't<00:02:51.859> know<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.159> I'm<00:02:52.280> going<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.549> do<00:02:52.639> something

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
don't know if I'm going to do something

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.580 
don't know if I'm going to do something
here<00:02:53.299> probably<00:02:53.720> i'm<00:02:53.930> going<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.139> put<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.319> mirror

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
here probably i'm going to put a mirror

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.619 
here probably i'm going to put a mirror
as<00:02:54.739> well<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.459> would<00:02:55.609> give<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> reflection<00:02:56.420> of

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
as well so it would give a reflection of

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.300 
as well so it would give a reflection of
the<00:02:56.959> motor<00:02:57.200> boat<00:02:57.379> itself<00:02:57.680> when<00:02:57.859> you<00:02:57.950> look<00:02:58.129> down

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
the motor boat itself when you look down

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.670 
the motor boat itself when you look down
on<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.879> you<00:02:59.299> also<00:02:59.540> be<00:02:59.840> able<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.109> see<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.440> fans

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
on and you also be able to see the fans

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.979 
on and you also be able to see the fans
spinning<00:03:01.099> on<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.819> graphic<00:03:02.389> artist<00:03:02.780> right

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
spinning on the graphic artist right

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.390 
spinning on the graphic artist right
beneath<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:04.159> is<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.549> plan<00:03:04.790> for<00:03:04.849> now<00:03:06.400> anyways

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
beneath that is the plan for now anyways

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.990 
beneath that is the plan for now anyways
i<00:03:07.579> got<00:03:07.730> my<00:03:07.909> hands<00:03:08.299> on<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:08.540> whole<00:03:09.409> soul<00:03:10.000> which

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
i got my hands on the whole soul which

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.160 
i got my hands on the whole soul which
is<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.680> 100-meter<00:03:12.879> 120<00:03:13.879> min<00:03:14.030> affect<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.480> wide

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
is a 100-meter 120 min affect the wide

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.330 
is a 100-meter 120 min affect the wide
and<00:03:15.739> stuff<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:17.200> well<00:03:18.200> as<00:03:18.650> your<00:03:18.859> proper<00:03:19.129> can

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
and stuff and well as your proper can

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.210 
and stuff and well as your proper can
guess<00:03:19.549> this<00:03:19.849> is<00:03:20.030> my<00:03:20.780> lineup<00:03:21.199> figure<00:03:21.829> right<00:03:22.010> now

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
guess this is my lineup figure right now

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.250 
guess this is my lineup figure right now
where<00:03:22.699> I<00:03:22.730> wanted<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.150> put<00:03:23.239> I<00:03:23.660> don't<00:03:24.049> want<00:03:24.169> to

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
where I wanted to put I don't want to

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.470 
where I wanted to put I don't want to
put<00:03:24.379> it<00:03:24.500> as<00:03:24.650> closest<00:03:25.129> that<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.879> the<00:03:26.000> whole<00:03:26.150> set

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
put it as closest that to the whole set

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.819 
put it as closest that to the whole set
because<00:03:26.660> also<00:03:27.139> one<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.319> have<00:03:27.500> two<00:03:27.620> rubber<00:03:29.650> but<00:03:30.650> I

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
because also one I have two rubber but I

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.649 
because also one I have two rubber but I
definitely<00:03:31.069> hope<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:31.669> it's<00:03:32.389> going<00:03:32.540> to

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
definitely hope it's it's going to

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.479 
definitely hope it's it's going to
improve<00:03:32.780> just<00:03:33.349> a<00:03:33.440> little<00:03:33.709> I'm<00:03:34.099> not<00:03:34.220> going<00:03:34.370> to

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
improve just a little I'm not going to

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.369 
improve just a little I'm not going to
place<00:03:34.730> up<00:03:34.940> some<00:03:35.299> things<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> acrylic<00:03:36.079> side

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
place up some things on the acrylic side

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.039 
place up some things on the acrylic side
panel<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:37.269> it's<00:03:38.269> going<00:03:38.419> to<00:03:38.480> hide<00:03:38.690> away<00:03:38.870> the

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
panel so it's going to hide away the

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.869 
panel so it's going to hide away the
graphic<00:03:39.409> arts<00:03:39.620> wanna<00:03:39.829> watch<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.579> have<00:03:40.730> two
