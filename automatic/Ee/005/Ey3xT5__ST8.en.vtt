seen my other two episodes you might
have<00:05:18.720> noticed<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.200> changed<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.620> name<00:05:19.770> of

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
have noticed that I changed the name of

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.590 
have noticed that I changed the name of
the<00:05:19.950> series<00:05:20.280> that's<00:05:20.940> because<00:05:21.240> with<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.480> new

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
the series that's because with the new

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.600 
the series that's because with the new
season<00:05:21.840> three<00:05:22.200> ranking<00:05:22.590> system<00:05:23.010> elos<00:05:23.400> no

longer<00:05:23.940> what<00:05:24.090> measures<00:05:24.360> your<00:05:24.480> play<00:05:24.720> bracket

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
longer what measures your play bracket

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.810 
longer what measures your play bracket
so<00:05:25.650> I<00:05:25.680> figured<00:05:26.130> a<00:05:26.190> name<00:05:26.370> change<00:05:26.580> would<00:05:26.790> be

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
so I figured a name change would be

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.520 
so I figured a name change would be
appropriate<00:05:27.150> if<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.810> didn't<00:05:28.020> know<00:05:28.110> before<00:05:28.260> it

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
appropriate if you didn't know before it

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.380 
appropriate if you didn't know before it
was<00:05:28.590> called<00:05:28.740> loi<00:05:29.040> low<00:05:29.340> guides<00:05:29.580> so<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.210> just

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
was called loi low guides so I just

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.490 
was called loi low guides so I just
wanted<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.630> change<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:30.960> to<00:05:31.080> something<00:05:31.260> that's

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
wanted to change it to something that's

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.540 
wanted to change it to something that's
a<00:05:31.560> little<00:05:31.620> more<00:05:31.770> relevant<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.400> current
