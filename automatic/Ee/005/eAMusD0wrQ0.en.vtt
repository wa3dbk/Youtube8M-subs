00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.770
 I was going to tell him we would have a 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.330
 reporter aware of every detail of what 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.699
 what is happening there in taiwan and in 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.650
 this moment I am referring to gillian cedeÃ±o 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.420
 and read welcome, you know this is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.730
 your space and then we listen to you with the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.279
 details thank you for hello good afternoon 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.470
 put as comment 7 that still in 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.779
 a global store we reach in this 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.419
 event that was yesterday were talks against 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.669
 the morning local time on Wednesday in 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.410
 taiwan but we still did not reach yesterday and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.750
 the moment was recorded only the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.879
 accident when the plane had fallen to 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.890
 river but had not specified the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.629
 magnitude of the event that is still going to 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.850
 know that in these weights 31 the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.070
 people who could be dead and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 could increase the figure well as well 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.969
 mentioned and others disappeared and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.440
 believe or rather informed the 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.170
 authorities that some of the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.670
 rescuers were able to remove bodies of 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 people who were trapped in the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.920
 device at the time of trying to 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.870
 escape from it or else it is chance 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.489
 we do not know the advanced technology 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.010
 that is there the fundamental thing that they are 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.380
 now smartphones for 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.970
 report this type of events the boy 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.100
 the first one who uploaded the video 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.290
 recording precisely as it goes up 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.210
 Speed â€‹â€‹your car and travel 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.310
 I was carrying because it was in a 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.860
 highway and here is the moment in 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.780
 the one that the plane that lost control 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.390
 of the engine the pilot was reached 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.640
 listen when you still report the signal 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.040
 of aid and indicates that the engine had 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.800
 stopped working and although normally 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.290
 it is believed that with a broken engine the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.510
 another may be working and finish 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.130
 the flight in this case was not completed 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.020
 investigations right now they have started 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.550
 but it is not known to what should be the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.640
 another engine has not followed in its 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.800
 entirety with the function but when the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 pilot give him indication good he was going 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.330
 descending they went flying at low altitude 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.160
 that made us mention it because the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.619
 new height the correct one for an airplane 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.600
 then when the plane rises in the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.910
 camera captures just when one of 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.970
 his wings manages to reach a taxi that was going 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.540
 circulating on that highway and still 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.790
 hits the vehicular bridge that is in that 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.740
 road since there is in the river of 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.540
 immediately some people could be pulled out 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.370
 some managed to escape but others 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.819
 they were trapped as happens in many 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.489
 assets 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.499
 between the seats that were placed 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.319
 the belt mostly found 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:27.269
 some of the bodies then still 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.859
 glued to the seats then also 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.659
 it should be mentioned that it is not 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.060
 first time this happens to the 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.430
 airline in seven months is the second 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.189
 tragedy that live the previous one also 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.439
 I had the accident in which two died 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.810
 passengers and it was due to the same failures 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.819
 in the engine then it is already the incidence 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.249
 number two in seven months in this 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.769
 airline that lived however also 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:52.139
 in the media well 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.299
 there is a doubt and it is the level of expertise 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.159
 of the pilot because right now he mentions us 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.819
 the engine is provided but you also know 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.739
 that the plane had less than a year 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.709
 of seniority and had completed the 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.799
 minus your latest security review 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.290
 just last January 26 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.139
 well the plane and good to travel in 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.939
 this type of flights that was a 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.010
 little bit broad and do not consider it 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.139
 right he had as well says in less 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.780
 one year of service last week 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.630
 the review was done and surely 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.970
 they said it was correct 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.520
 its aspects but the pilot had 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.500
 only 14 thousand hours of last flight 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.510
 that authorities are talking about 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.700
 for this kind of distance then it 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.680
 you need the pilot to have covers 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.160
 more flight hours at least 25,000 hours 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.530
 of flight in the case of the airplane that 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.150
 star in taiwan good the pilot just 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.970
 had 14 thousand flight hours and the 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.250
 co-pilot 4,000 nothing else a co-pilot must 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.200
 have at least for that 10 thousand travel 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.990
 hours of flight which almost had the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.490
 pilot of this option and that in large 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.140
 part what was happening in that 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.270
 moment exactly when 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.340
 authorities and day right now 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.110
 precisely in the morning they come out to say 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.970
 that they were very well trained that 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.340
 In fact, as any 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.780
 commissioned or any airline that 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.020
 They are very well trained to 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.270
 respond to an emergency an event 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.100
 so eventual that if they were prepared 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.500
 but they did not manage to do it when they call 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.450
 in the emergency service when 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.250
 they ask for help this was too late 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.930
 because the plane had already lengthened and 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.920
 it was when they hit the vehicular bridge 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.170
 and crashes for the question 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.320
 of paula area is not the first tragedy 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.660
 remember that so far in 2015 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.490
 they have three plane crashes and the year 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.010
 past there were several that were 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.130
 for which they have bad luck malaysia 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.840
 airlines two accidents is also not the 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.830
 first thing that is being lived in this 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.930
 aspect the aerial tragedies are at 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.090
 order I do not totally believe that the latter 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.740
 point that you touch is something that we all 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.050
 It attracts a lot of attention because it seems 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.510
 that flying is increasingly dangerous but 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.400
 also interesting articles about what 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.290
 that you mention that already the statistics 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.290
 they are pointing out that although last year 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.510
 occurred in total 21 accidents were 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.180
 there are 21 obviously deadly accidents 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.550
 of airplane that figure is a minimum 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.550
 historical and we are very shocked by this 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.070
 because according to this report that we read 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.230
 previously 50 years ago only 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.600
 there were 5 percent of the flights 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.690
 commercials that exist today but 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.050
 there was at that moment the fourfold 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.710
 incidents obviously all in percentage 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.690
 so and 7 that apart from the figures that have 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.039
 gone on rise as a tooth have 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.750
 increased the number of flights that 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.789
 offer the airlines but has also 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.340
 increased the number of aircraft that did not 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.440
 They are made with the same material as 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.710
 were the previous ones and that apparently 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.030
 they are better but he answers something that 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.819
 they should be questioning the 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.490
 airlines because when an engine fails 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:58.220
 the other does not work when that did not happen 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.440
 as you said a few decades ago in 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.930
 the case of that then consider it 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.319
 climatic sanz affected much the 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.120
 malaysia airlines the good 7 771 fell by 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:11.960
 other causes with the firing of a missile 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.930
 but in the case of 30 made by them 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.250
 in both devices were in a fell 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.349
 and were affected by the 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.960
 climatic conditions something that does not 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.969
 Paola passed something that the pilots had 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.469
 dodge when this storms comes 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.810
 electrical and everyone knew how to do 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:28.520
 now the weather conditions are 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.500
 Affecting and provoking directly 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.490
 accidents this is low cause 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.069
 visibility in the case of yesterday 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:38.069
 and the rising water in the river where 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:39.539
 this fell as it hindered and rescue of 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.759
 those who might have been trapped 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:43.770
 then it is not known yet if they can 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:46.380
 be rescued or not but if you are 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.180
 greatly harming the climate to another 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.759
 called that is made to the question of 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.220
 climate change I do not know how it is the same 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:55.470
 that those who flew 10 years ago with the 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.270
 climatic conditions it represents 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.039
 Now fly now we can continue 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.940
 questioning the information with 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.940
 following videos
