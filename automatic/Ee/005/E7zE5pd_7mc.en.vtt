00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
to cut it up the grandeur and then make

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.120 
to cut it up the grandeur and then make
a<00:01:16.080> little<00:01:16.460> rectangular<00:01:17.630> tube<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:22.130> cut

off these things there grind it back and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.910 
off these things there grind it back and
then<00:01:25.680> weld<00:01:25.890> them<00:01:26.040> onto<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.369> new<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.829> then

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
then weld them onto the new one and then

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.310 
then weld them onto the new one and then
drill<00:01:29.250> holes<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.820> bearing<00:01:30.119> box<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:31.049> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
drill holes for the bearing box now that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.770 
drill holes for the bearing box now that
and<00:01:31.560> then<00:01:31.650> make<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> new<00:01:32.070> motor<00:01:32.340> mount<00:01:32.780> this

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and then make a new motor mount this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.230 
and then make a new motor mount this
plate<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.409> fine<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.939> thing<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
plate is fine it's just this thing that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
plate is fine it's just this thing that
holds<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.869> I've<00:01:37.049> got<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> make<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.500> stronger

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
holds it I've got to make it stronger

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.929 
holds it I've got to make it stronger
because<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.549> twists<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> big<00:01:41.490> beefy

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
I'll do is cut this to size now because

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.180 
I'll do is cut this to size now because
I<00:02:29.870> am<00:02:30.080> cutting<00:02:31.040> these<00:02:31.220> two<00:02:31.459> sighs<00:02:31.700> now<00:02:33.010> what<00:02:34.010> I

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
I am cutting these two sighs now what I

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.850 
I am cutting these two sighs now what I
was<00:02:34.549> thinking<00:02:35.090> is<00:02:35.420> well<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.200> can<00:02:36.470> make<00:02:36.620> whole

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
was thinking is well I can make whole

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.300 
was thinking is well I can make whole
new<00:02:37.010> design<00:02:37.220> now<00:02:37.849> of<00:02:38.750> my<00:02:38.959> chassis<00:02:40.390> so<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:42.310> don't

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
new design now of my chassis so I don't

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.120 
new design now of my chassis so I don't
know<00:02:43.400> I'm<00:02:43.519> just<00:02:43.700> sort<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.680> I'm<00:02:45.680> going<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.980> leave

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
know I'm just sort of I'm going to leave

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.509 
know I'm just sort of I'm going to leave
the<00:02:46.250> chassis<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:49.840> well<00:02:50.840> sort<00:02:51.319> of<00:02:51.410> stages<00:02:51.920> I

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
the chassis in well sort of stages I

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.610 
the chassis in well sort of stages I
guess<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.230> can<00:02:54.680> change<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.519> in<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.670> future

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
guess so I can change it in the future

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.990 
guess so I can change it in the future
but<00:02:57.620> I'm<00:02:57.739> going<00:02:57.859> to<00:02:57.890> think<00:02:58.069> about<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.459> first

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
but I'm going to think about it first

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.229 
but I'm going to think about it first
before<00:02:59.359> I<00:02:59.540> start<00:02:59.600> welding<00:03:00.049> it<00:03:00.230> up<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:01.519> what<00:03:02.209> I

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
before I start welding it up of what I

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.720 
before I start welding it up of what I
want<00:03:03.010> fun<00:03:04.010> enough<00:03:04.190> I'm<00:03:04.310> going<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.519> mount<00:03:04.670> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
want fun enough I'm going to mount the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.110 
want fun enough I'm going to mount the
engine<00:03:04.760> at<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.120> back<00:03:05.290> like<00:03:06.290> there<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.940> those

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
engine at the back like there in those

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.750 
engine at the back like there in those
two<00:03:08.359> ones<00:03:11.980> doesn't<00:03:12.980> have<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.280> front<00:03:13.489> wheels

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
two ones doesn't have the front wheels

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.530 
two ones doesn't have the front wheels
over<00:03:13.970> there<00:03:15.549> or<00:03:16.549> if<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.090> just<00:03:17.299> have<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:19.540> like

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
over there or if I just have it like

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.220 
over there or if I just have it like
this

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.840 

with<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.620> bar<00:03:27.069> across<00:03:27.220> there<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.580> then

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
with the bar across there and then

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.770 
with the bar across there and then
chopped<00:03:28.240> off<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.810> then<00:03:29.800> only<00:03:30.040> cut<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.490> -<00:03:30.780> yeah

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
chopped off and then only cut it - yeah

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.340 
chopped off and then only cut it - yeah
now<00:03:31.990> the<00:03:32.050> engine<00:03:32.410> on<00:03:32.530> these<00:03:32.740> ons<00:03:33.240> and<00:03:35.069> then

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
now the engine on these ons and then

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.040 
now the engine on these ons and then
have<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.500> frame<00:03:38.740> -<00:03:38.950> they're<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:40.050> mainly

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
have the frame - they're just mainly

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.620 
have the frame - they're just mainly
that<00:03:41.320> short<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.950> know<00:03:42.570> there's<00:03:43.570> all

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
that short you know there's all

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.990 
that short you know there's all
different<00:03:43.750> things<00:03:44.080> I<00:03:44.380> can<00:03:44.560> do<00:03:44.709> now<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.940> I'm

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
different things I can do now so I'm

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.790 
different things I can do now so I'm
just<00:03:46.060> thinking<00:03:46.330> of<00:03:46.720> because<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:47.350> stuff<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:47.740> a

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
just thinking of because this stuff is a

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.460 
just thinking of because this stuff is a
lot<00:03:47.980> heavier<00:03:48.220> I<00:03:48.700> need<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.570> figure<00:03:49.870> out<00:03:50.140> ways<00:03:50.830> of

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
lot heavier I need to figure out ways of

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.130 
lot heavier I need to figure out ways of
making<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.560> lighter<00:03:54.600> it's<00:03:55.600> pretty<00:03:55.810> cool<00:03:55.959> looks

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
making it lighter it's pretty cool looks

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:04.320 
making it lighter it's pretty cool looks
like<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> dragster<00:04:02.580> all<00:04:03.580> right<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:03.910> I'll<00:04:03.970> shoot

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
like a dragster all right so I'll shoot

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.640 
like a dragster all right so I'll shoot
the<00:04:04.480> frame<00:04:04.780> down<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:06.250> it's<00:04:06.459> down<00:04:07.269> to

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
the frame down so it's down to

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.540 
the frame down so it's down to
everything<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.709> need<00:04:08.860> to<00:04:08.920> cuddle

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
everything I need to cuddle

gonna cut this off here and weld that to

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.490 
gonna cut this off here and weld that to
the<00:04:31.030> frame<00:04:31.270> I'll<00:04:31.479> get<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:31.900> in<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.050> second

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
the frame I'll get to that in a second

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.530 
the frame I'll get to that in a second
and<00:04:33.310> then<00:04:33.400> everything<00:04:33.820> else<00:04:34.000> I'm<00:04:34.240> just<00:04:34.270> gonna

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
and then everything else I'm just gonna

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.860 
and then everything else I'm just gonna
leave<00:04:34.900> on<00:04:35.110> there<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:38.200> this<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:39.450> new<00:04:40.450> one

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
leave on there so this is the new one

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.719 
leave on there so this is the new one
so<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.650> frame<00:04:41.890> is<00:04:42.040> gonna<00:04:42.130> be<00:04:42.220> about<00:04:42.430> that

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
so the frame is gonna be about that

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.600 
so the frame is gonna be about that
widths<00:04:43.150> apart<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.890> mode<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:45.160> what<00:04:45.430> I'm<00:04:45.490> going

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
widths apart the mode I what I'm going

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.890 
widths apart the mode I what I'm going
to<00:04:45.640> do<00:04:45.760> with<00:04:45.940> that<00:04:46.090> little<00:04:46.240> piece<00:04:46.540> that<00:04:46.600> I

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
to do with that little piece that I

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.290 
to do with that little piece that I
chopped<00:04:47.200> off<00:04:47.380> up<00:04:47.560> there<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.790> then<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.000> whirl

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
chopped off up there and then a whirl

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.840 
chopped off up there and then a whirl
run<00:04:49.510> to<00:04:49.690> here<00:04:50.520> hopefully<00:04:51.520> it's<00:04:51.640> long<00:04:51.820> enough

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
run to here hopefully it's long enough

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.340 
run to here hopefully it's long enough
if<00:04:52.210> it's<00:04:52.390> not<00:04:52.510> I'll<00:04:52.630> just<00:04:52.780> have<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.020> make<00:04:53.140> a<00:04:53.169> new

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
if it's not I'll just have to make a new

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.570 
if it's not I'll just have to make a new
one<00:04:53.500> lower<00:04:54.310> onto<00:04:54.550> there<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:55.060> that'll<00:04:56.580> screw

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
one lower onto there and that'll screw

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.770 
one lower onto there and that'll screw
like<00:04:57.790> that<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:59.940> don't<00:05:00.940> bowls<00:05:01.240> on<00:05:01.450> there<00:05:01.630> like

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
like that I don't bowls on there like

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.469 
like that I don't bowls on there like
that<00:05:02.020> something<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:04.000> what<00:05:04.180> I'm<00:05:04.270> gonna<00:05:04.360> have

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
a tiny little piece comes up just a

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.450 
a tiny little piece comes up just a
little<00:05:36.580> bit<00:05:36.850> of<00:05:36.970> sheet<00:05:37.210> metal<00:05:37.389> will<00:05:37.660> do

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
little bit of sheet metal will do

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.460 
little bit of sheet metal will do
that'll<00:05:39.460> come<00:05:39.639> up<00:05:39.669> there<00:05:40.060> and<00:05:40.270> scratch<00:05:41.200> that

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
that'll come up there and scratch that

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.700 
that'll come up there and scratch that
screw<00:05:42.160> there<00:05:42.370> that'll<00:05:43.360> hold<00:05:43.540> it<00:05:43.660> enough<00:05:43.930> if

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
screw there that'll hold it enough if

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.140 
screw there that'll hold it enough if
it's<00:05:44.860> not<00:05:45.070> I'll<00:05:45.190> just<00:05:45.220> make<00:05:45.490> a<00:05:45.520> little<00:05:45.700> L<00:05:45.910> piece

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
it's not I'll just make a little L piece

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.970 
it's not I'll just make a little L piece
that<00:05:46.330> comes<00:05:46.540> down<00:05:46.750> here<00:05:46.810> and<00:05:47.500> screw<00:05:47.770> since

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
that comes down here and screw since

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.810 
that comes down here and screw since
that<00:05:48.190> one<00:05:48.310> on<00:05:48.400> top<00:05:49.500> that's<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.590> tank<00:05:50.830> done<00:05:51.040> the

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
that one on top that's the tank done the

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.670 
that one on top that's the tank done the
bearing<00:05:52.060> box<00:05:52.300> that<00:05:52.600> holes<00:05:53.140> already<00:05:53.350> there<00:05:53.650> so

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
bearing box that holes already there so

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.130 
bearing box that holes already there so
that's<00:05:54.040> fine<00:05:54.419> this<00:05:55.419> broke<00:05:55.660> it<00:05:55.810> up<00:05:55.870> and<00:05:56.050> now

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
that's fine this broke it up and now

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.840 
that's fine this broke it up and now
just<00:05:56.169> because<00:05:56.800> I've<00:05:56.950> made<00:05:57.070> that<00:05:57.250> nice<00:05:57.430> pocket

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
mount the frame I'm gonna make it really

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.870 
mount the frame I'm gonna make it really
short<00:06:01.450> just<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:02.560> minimize<00:06:02.830> I'm<00:06:03.310> waiting<00:06:03.730> I

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
short just to minimize I'm waiting I

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.010 
short just to minimize I'm waiting I
mean<00:06:04.030> I<00:06:04.090> don't<00:06:04.210> really<00:06:04.390> need<00:06:04.570> it<00:06:04.630> that<00:06:04.840> long

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
mean I don't really need it that long

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:11.430 
mean I don't really need it that long
anyway<00:06:05.320> so<00:06:05.770> we're<00:06:06.070> gonna<00:06:06.190> do<00:06:06.340> is<00:06:06.669> have<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:10.440> have

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440

anyway so we're gonna do is have it have
it<00:06:11.470> about<00:06:11.710> that<00:06:11.890> long<00:06:12.900> so<00:06:13.900> it's<00:06:14.020> gonna<00:06:14.140> be

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
it about that long so it's gonna be

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.020 
it about that long so it's gonna be
quite<00:06:14.610> quite<00:06:15.610> short<00:06:16.000> now<00:06:17.610> because<00:06:18.610> I<00:06:18.639> have<00:06:18.850> the

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
quite quite short now because I have the

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.810 
quite quite short now because I have the
engine<00:06:19.540> mounted<00:06:20.080> so<00:06:20.500> far<00:06:21.010> on<00:06:21.220> the<00:06:21.310> back<00:06:21.490> wheels

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
engine mounted so far on the back wheels

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:40.170 
engine mounted so far on the back wheels
I<00:06:22.710> don't<00:06:23.710> need<00:06:23.950> the<00:06:24.310> frame<00:06:24.550> so<00:06:24.790> long<00:06:27.180> so

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.700 

yeah<00:06:41.180> that<00:06:41.389> a<00:06:41.419> little<00:06:41.690> tike<00:06:41.930> so<00:06:42.229> hopefully

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
yeah that a little tike so hopefully

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.279 
yeah that a little tike so hopefully
that'll<00:06:42.889> be<00:06:42.979> good<00:06:43.300> custom<00:06:44.300> exhaust<00:06:45.490> and<00:06:46.490> yeah

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
that'll be good custom exhaust and yeah

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:52.560 
that'll be good custom exhaust and yeah
so<00:06:48.289> hopefully<00:06:49.039> she'll<00:06:49.400> be<00:06:50.350> all<00:06:51.350> together<00:06:51.620> soon

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
so hopefully she'll be all together soon

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.230 
so hopefully she'll be all together soon
we'll<00:06:53.570> try<00:06:53.750> to<00:06:53.810> cut<00:06:53.990> it<00:06:54.080> up<00:06:54.139> now<00:06:54.410> because<00:06:54.560> it's

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
we'll try to cut it up now because it's

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.629 
we'll try to cut it up now because it's
the<00:06:56.240> moon's<00:06:56.479> out<00:06:57.130> it's<00:06:58.130> getting<00:06:58.280> pretty<00:06:58.520> dark

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 
the moon's out it's getting pretty dark

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:00.850 
the moon's out it's getting pretty dark
so<00:06:59.300> I'll<00:06:59.389> try<00:06:59.600> to<00:06:59.660> cut<00:06:59.840> this<00:06:59.930> upcycling<00:07:00.590> world

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
so I'll try to cut this upcycling world

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.189 
so I'll try to cut this upcycling world
its<00:07:01.009> wording<00:07:01.400> doesn't<00:07:01.669> it's<00:07:02.300> not<00:07:02.419> that<00:07:02.539> loud

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 
its wording doesn't it's not that loud

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.860 
its wording doesn't it's not that loud
then<00:07:03.590> I<00:07:03.710> can<00:07:03.889> go<00:07:04.850> out<00:07:05.150> and<00:07:05.300> put<00:07:05.479> all<00:07:05.570> together

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
then I can go out and put all together

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.289 
then I can go out and put all together
night
