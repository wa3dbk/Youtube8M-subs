of<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:17.010> gun<00:00:17.279> motion<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.760> my<00:00:17.850> nvidia<00:00:18.090> shield

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
of my gun motion to my nvidia shield

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.220 
of my gun motion to my nvidia shield
anyways<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.090> streaming<00:00:21.090> over<00:00:21.330> proxy<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
anyways it is a streaming over proxy and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.320 
anyways it is a streaming over proxy and
it<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.250> originally<00:00:23.699> thought<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
it was originally thought that the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.029 
it was originally thought that the
shield<00:00:24.539> could<00:00:24.689> only<00:00:24.869> stream<00:00:25.289> while<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.859> your

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
shield could only stream while on your

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.029 
shield could only stream while on your
home<00:00:26.189> Wi-Fi<00:00:26.400> network<00:00:26.910> that's<00:00:27.240> untrue<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.170> she

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
home Wi-Fi network that's untrue and she

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.650 
home Wi-Fi network that's untrue and she
wants<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.310> pan<00:00:29.550> around<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:30.090> me<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.480> will

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
wants to pan around to me I will

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.770 
wants to pan around to me I will
demonstrate<00:00:31.369> now<00:00:32.369> right<00:00:32.730> now<00:00:32.850> I'm<00:00:32.880> running

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
around sanctuary you can see that the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.330 
around sanctuary you can see that the
controls<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:36.120> quite<00:00:36.480> responsive<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.340> I'll

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
controls are quite responsive and I'll

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.920 
controls are quite responsive and I'll
go<00:00:38.550> ahead<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.700> hit<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.969> jump<00:00:39.210> button<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
go ahead and hit the jump button and you

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
go ahead and hit the jump button and you
can<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.260> there<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.559> little<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.309> even<00:00:41.610> no

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
can see that there is little to even no

you're<00:02:20.630> probably<00:02:20.870> wondering<00:02:21.620> how<00:02:21.860> this<00:02:22.100> is

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
you're probably wondering how this is

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.400 
you're probably wondering how this is
possible<00:02:22.610> now<00:02:23.390> what<00:02:23.660> it's<00:02:23.780> doing<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.200> it's

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
possible now what it's doing is it's

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.250 
possible now what it's doing is it's
using<00:02:24.769> some<00:02:25.070> proxy<00:02:25.910> technology<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.720> push<00:02:27.019> the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
using some proxy technology to push the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.770 
using some proxy technology to push the
video<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.800> audio<00:02:27.920> stream<00:02:28.489> over<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.150> Internet

video and audio stream over the Internet

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.530 
video and audio stream over the Internet
this<00:02:30.620> works<00:02:30.890> reasonably<00:02:31.489> well<00:02:31.580> as<00:02:32.030> long<00:02:32.330> as

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
this works reasonably well as long as

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.150 
this works reasonably well as long as
you<00:02:32.720> are<00:02:32.989> within<00:02:33.579> 100<00:02:34.579> miles<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.660> your<00:02:36.410> home<00:02:36.650> pc

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
you are within 100 miles of your home pc

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.949 
you are within 100 miles of your home pc
now<00:02:37.370> that's<00:02:37.610> that's<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.299> lot<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.540> wiggle<00:02:38.780> room

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
now that's that's a lot of wiggle room

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.699 
now that's that's a lot of wiggle room
to<00:02:39.380> work<00:02:39.980> with<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.840> want<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.870> thank<00:02:41.930> forum<00:02:42.470> user
