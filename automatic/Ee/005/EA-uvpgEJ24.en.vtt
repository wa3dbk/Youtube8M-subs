00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
going to search somewhat keep away one

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.370 
going to search somewhat keep away one
versus<00:00:36.670> one<00:00:36.699> at<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.059> same<00:00:37.239> time<00:00:37.480> it<00:00:37.989> has<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.200> low

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
to destroy you ever basis and because

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.700 
to destroy you ever basis and because
she<00:01:04.030> shot<00:01:04.210> him<00:01:04.330> before<00:01:04.449> if<00:01:05.050> supply<00:01:05.289> pads

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710

a<00:01:07.539> lot<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.810> supplies<00:01:08.229> for<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.740> boosting<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.340> get

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:09.459 
a lot of supplies for a boosting and get

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:12.059 
a lot of supplies for a boosting and get
some<00:01:09.580> orcs<00:01:09.850> be<00:01:10.060> easier<00:01:10.509> so<00:01:11.319> I<00:01:11.350> just<00:01:11.740> making

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:12.069 
some orcs be easier so I just making

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:13.800 
some orcs be easier so I just making
your<00:01:12.190> supplies<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.520> your<00:01:12.940> main<00:01:13.090> base<00:01:13.300> let's

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
your supplies and your main base let's

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.719 
your supplies and your main base let's
make<00:01:13.990> some<00:01:14.200> for<00:01:14.500> war<00:01:14.679> hogs<00:01:14.890> or<00:01:15.069> something<00:01:15.429> make

sort of upgrade it and go and take some

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.190 
sort of upgrade it and go and take some
more<00:01:17.470> basis<00:01:21.030> depending<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.479> what<00:01:22.660> map<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.990> get

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
more basis depending on what map you get

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.139 
more basis depending on what map you get
they<00:01:24.039> have<00:01:24.160> a<00:01:24.220> different<00:01:24.490> amount<00:01:24.610> of<00:01:24.729> bases

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
they have a different amount of bases

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.150 
they have a different amount of bases
but<00:01:25.330> make<00:01:25.509> sure<00:01:25.539> Bofur<00:01:26.170> worker<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.830> XP
