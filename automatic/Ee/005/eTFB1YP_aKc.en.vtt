00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
now so that's like where a lot of the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
now so that's like where a lot of the
inspiration<00:01:20.220> came<00:01:20.250> from<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.750> at

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
inspiration came from as you know at

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
inspiration came from as you know at
that<00:01:21.960> point<00:01:22.110> my<00:01:22.409> brother<00:01:22.740> starts<00:01:23.549> going

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
that point my brother starts going

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.920 
that point my brother starts going
through<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> internet<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.509> pulling<00:01:24.869> up

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
through the internet and pulling up

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.350 
through the internet and pulling up
motorcycle<00:01:25.590> jackets<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.310> taking<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> skulls

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
motorcycle jackets and taking the skulls

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.210 
motorcycle jackets and taking the skulls
from<00:01:27.630> those<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.200> different<00:01:28.500> design<00:01:28.770> elements

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
from those and different design elements

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.039 
from those and different design elements
and<00:01:29.340> then<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.579> add<00:01:29.970> them<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> t-shirts<00:01:30.750> or

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and then we add them on the t-shirts or

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.230 
and then we add them on the t-shirts or
you<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.590> he'll<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.250> redraw<00:01:32.729> something<00:01:33.119> in

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
you know he'll like redraw something in

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.700 
you know he'll like redraw something in
a<00:01:33.329> certain<00:01:33.540> way<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:34.079> become<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> new

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
a certain way and now become a new

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.000 
a certain way and now become a new
graphic<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.210> all<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
graphic but it all kind of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.590 
graphic but it all kind of
yeah<00:01:37.280> it's<00:01:37.430> inspired<00:01:37.790> by<00:01:37.940> what<00:01:38.120> we're<00:01:38.270> into<00:01:38.510> at

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
yeah it's inspired by what we're into at

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.270 
yeah it's inspired by what we're into at
the<00:01:38.720> time<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.530> think<00:01:39.800> that's<00:01:40.070> what's

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the time so I think that's what's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.680 
the time so I think that's what's
crucial<00:01:40.490> about<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.000> line<00:01:41.180> is<00:01:41.390> it's<00:01:41.510> always

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
crucial about the line is it's always
