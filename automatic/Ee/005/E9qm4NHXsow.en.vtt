 hello friends of people online was consoled 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.160
 guzmÃ¡n personal chopper and today I 'm going to 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.720
 talk about the 10 accessories that do not 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.050
 They may be missing for this season 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.050
 Beach 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.820
 well let's start talking about the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.250
 hair accessories that we need 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.110
 for those trips to the beach the first thing 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.910
 a hat I recommend a hat 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
 for example Panamanian because with him 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.140
 We can put together beach looks or also 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.720
 more formal looks when we go from 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.150
 visit and we walk knowing that city 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.250
 when we go shopping is a hat 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.940
 that tends to look elegant and we can 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.160
 use it in casual looks or looks more 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.930
 informal I also recommend a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.580
 turban because because when we are in 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.860
 climates so warm the first thing he does 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.990
 affects is the hair and more is that all the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.000
 frizz that that produces moisture 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.000
 these beaches or this city 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.820
 for the beach add-on that can not 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.250
 missing are the glasses carry several 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.800
 glasses styles because some more formal 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.900
 some informal sports and in the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.180
 case of glasses for the beach them 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.830
 I recommend that they be for example frame 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.540
 plastic that are very fashionable that 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.880
 they can be white they can be oranges 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.850
 and that funny touch 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.470
 to your outfits you should also remember already 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.710
 do not encourage us long for the night and 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.970
 some short or small earrings for 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.970
 afternoon or for the beach 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.080
 another of the accessories that can not 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.210
 missing in the suitcase for that trip to the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.430
 beach is a portfolio in this case it 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.230
 I recommend bringing two large wallets 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.790
 which in this case would be a basket that 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.680
 It gives us the informality to be able to carry 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.590
 things to the beach but also to 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.570
 visit in the afternoon a place to go to 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.790
 a restaurant with evening looks 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.950
 we are doing very well and one on an envelope 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.410
 elegant can have brightness can have 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.990
 Ethnic touches can be stamped to 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.670
 those appointments or those meetings that we have 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.280
 at night in a restaurant or something 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.050
 much more formal and something that can not 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480
 miss when we go to this kind of 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.000
 climates that hits us a lot the heat 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.190
 is a fan is a very complement 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.830
 nice is an elegant complement that 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.780
 I recommend that you have stamped 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.210
 although it also has brightness or have 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.120
 lace that is an elegant element and 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.110
 that will help us to see each other very well 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.110
 when we are very hot 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.340
 you can not forget a set of 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.290
 bracelets that are six or seven equal and 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.120
 take apart a few years that have 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.980
 stones or have technical touches and 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.390
 can combine so they give that touch of 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.390
 originality to your life 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.670
