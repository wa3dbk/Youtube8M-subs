in his desperation he attacks it seeing
his<00:03:16.489> action<00:03:16.849> is<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.090> only<00:03:17.209> possible<00:03:17.780> way<00:03:17.840> to

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
his action is the only possible way to

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.570 
his action is the only possible way to
survive

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.670 

we<00:03:23.580> only<00:03:23.820> had<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> very<00:03:24.210> small<00:03:24.510> set<00:03:25.050> so<00:03:25.350> we<00:03:25.530> were

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
we only had a very small set so we were

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.770 
we only had a very small set so we were
limited<00:03:25.950> with<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.370> camera<00:03:26.700> movements<00:03:27.180> this

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
limited with the camera movements this

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.180 
limited with the camera movements this
is<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.050> reason<00:03:28.380> why<00:03:28.470> we<00:03:28.590> couldn't<00:03:28.830> leave<00:03:29.010> her

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
is the reason why we couldn't leave her

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:40.130 
is the reason why we couldn't leave her
the<00:03:29.250> right<00:03:29.490> choice<00:03:29.730> for<00:03:29.760> example<00:03:38.510> actually<00:03:39.510> we

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
the right choice for example actually we

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.560 
the right choice for example actually we
already<00:03:40.380> cook<00:03:40.860> off<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.100> big<00:03:41.400> bowl<00:03:41.700> while<00:03:42.360> at

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
already cook off the big bowl while at

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
5:00 a.m. the Sun rose and we couldn't

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.130 
5:00 a.m. the Sun rose and we couldn't
