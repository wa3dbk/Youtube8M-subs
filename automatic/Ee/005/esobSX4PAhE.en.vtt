00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 if you don't know what to prepare for 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.100
 lunch for dinner I would like to give you today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.390
 a brilliant idea to recover the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.890
 ahead of the day before 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.650
 you must know that yesterday for 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.630
 lunch prepared a nice in the evening of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.000
 red turnips at dinner I ate instead 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.310
 a chickpea soup and guess what already 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 or boasted people with red and chickpea turnips 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.640
 so I thought of a way to 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 combine these two ingredients 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.900
 let's see together how to prepare the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.269
 vegetarian meatballs some 300 ea 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.219
 prepare 6 chickpea and turnip meatballs 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.340
 250 g of boiled chickpeas are required 80 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.370
 g of red turnip 2 tablespoons of sauce 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.129
 fresh spicy chilli soy can in 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.969
 powder1 teaspoon of ginger in 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.910
 powder a teaspoon of sweet paprika 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:51.690
 a clove of garlic 2 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.270
 extra virgin juice of half a lemon 50 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.660
 grams of organic breadcrumbs for 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.510
 stuff 30 grams of soy cheese 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.030
 spreadable or top to decorate 30 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.519
 grams of sesame seeds then aquino 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.369
 prepared already boiled chickpeas vi 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.560
 I remember briefly how I am 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.470
 I left with dried chickpeas 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.500
 soak a day 24 hours after that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.110
 or drained the york water rinsed for 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.580
 benini or boiled in unsalted water for 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.500
 in short, about an hour until 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.330
 you feel that your heart has become soft 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.070
 and this is the result 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.500
 I did n't salt it at the time 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.520
 otherwise salt tends to harden the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.280
 then skin to investment 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.560
 experts that we now know them so 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 let's go into the pan 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:42.420
 turn on and pour a tablespoon of 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.520
 extra virgin olive oil flight just another 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.100
 spoon will serve us later then you 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:54.090
 am I right 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:58.380
 in Rome we give you the oil with garlic and 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:03.050
 we pour cc after a couple of minutes to 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.910
 sustained flame we combine the sweet paprika 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.259
 I don't want to powder you can 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.390
 clearly add all the species 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.750
 that you like a little more 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.750
 chili pepper 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.980
 the cool one is fine too if you like it 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
 mix 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.319
 and then I would add some juice 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.319
 lemon 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.220
 at this point, fade with the sauce 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:43.300
 soy which will be our substitute for 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:45.730
 salt let's lower the flame we cover with 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.010
 the lid and we are born flavored about 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.010
 5 minutes 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.890
 now we join the blender and pour 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.940
 a part of chickpeas or all the cesi in short 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.690
 depends on the size of yours 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.940
 blender inside in the container e 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.710
 we also combine a bit of red turnip 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.390
 cut into pieces previously 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:09.400
 peeled the turnip because together why 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.720
 we will need it to soften ours 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.700
 compound we cover and want 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.360
 we thus obtained a thick cream 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.550
 just see that since we want to do 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.650
 some balls need a part that 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.110
 keep in mind what we can add 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.610
 of breadcrumbs organic as required 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.030
 until you get the right one 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.030
 consistency 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.720
 we have thus obtained this consistency 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.580
 see moldable now let's take one 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.530
 part of the dough and make the ball 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.530
 and so we get them 6 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.550
 so we got six balls too 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.980
 rather irregular now I'll explain 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.590
 because we make the filling as like 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.840
 let's crush our ball 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.080
 let's get some soy cheese 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.790
 ricotta is also spreadable 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.220
 soy or even the velvety touch 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.840
 also where you can find the link in 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.549
 overlay or below the video 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:24.630
 and we close trying to imprison the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:26.040
 cheese inside once stuffed 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.630
 all the balls what we do 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.850
 we must attack 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.250
 sesame seeds to make them stick 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.900
 well what do we do here i have passed a 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.400
 spoon of oil you remember that 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:44.340
 I said before a small bowl 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:47.640
 brush the ball and then see a 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.210
 put the meatball inside the 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:56.220
 bowl with all the sesame seeds 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:58.580
 here's how well we're going to lay it out now 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.229
 on earth 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:07.699
 and we do so with all the others 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:10.699
 meatballs and now we're going to bake at 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.770
 180 degrees for about 15 20 minutes up to 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.020
 when on the surface you will notice some 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.969
 small cracks for a cooking instead more 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.900
 experiment let's say you can also decide 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:23.090
 of fry in hot oil view 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.039
 simple to create new creations 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.199
 have fun creating new ones too 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.569
 you don't like pairings for example 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.490
 the classes replace them with broad beans or with 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.409
 Beans are not lovers of turnips 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.900
 even spinach is fine 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.909
 squeezed or if you are serious c 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.409
 replace the breadcrumbs with 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.719
 potatoes or potato flakes 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:44.319
 in short, now I leave you a space 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.319
 for new ideas
