 Hi everyone, I talk about the book 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.330
 there are so many pony climate is of temponi 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.030
 book I found it leader I don't know 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.400
 normally where you can find why 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.539
 the nests in the bookstore do not think it marks 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:28.320
 came out in front of the cover 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:34.739
 but not not the complete gentleman among 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.489
 your other of determined than less 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.489
 of 10 euros 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.559
 then the sensors can particularly 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.950
 strong then we start from the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.550
 characteristic of the book is precisely there 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.440
 are the buttons that make the effects 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:02.820
 sound and are there and there just as there is 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.500
 written with a cover you never see 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.500
 that the law 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:22.790
 behind instead there are six protagonists 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:22.790
 more heavenly than spike so nothing 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:33.540
 this book 2012 2012 or else then 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.390
 let's start with the house 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.220
 publisher I know what it's called ivan si 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.600
 show in colors but what i do 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.470
 seem to understand, however, that we can 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.850
 find on the line sto league ho 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.820
 written the book read the book ie 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.260
 wrap you in any trouble in karts 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.630
 onerous 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:05.070
 tones of idea me of this and some 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:12.200
 he speaks thus of country we say or exceptions 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:17.420
 of network among for the figure cut here 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:21.140
 here is how the pages are robust 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.300
 twilight in the library books of acs 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.390
 the twilight library if in reality 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:34.290
 have already strained to the type library 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:37.500
 nivis then echoes school there is here 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.620
 can do and I know what it's called the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:46.440
 center of the wall of modest but 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:51.980
 especially our generic ones of 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.980
 will be covered in this chapter 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.910
 of course there is on every page the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:08.640
 circle of the are of the soil to do 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:11.220
 afterwards it made the sounds heard everything was 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:19.050
 done slightly yet on that of 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:27.480
 first the house of sweets then then the 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:35.550
 in short, pastry here then the park i 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:38.880
 good general term data 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.420
 normally claps and flies to 5 centimeters 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.630
 from the ground 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.100
 anyway if with butterflies what 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.930
 they could take it in pictures a little 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:52.769
 different the castle of counter of 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.510
 silence if enough, finished end, understood with 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.950
 inactivity however should not cost 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.489
 the saint is unfortunately the only thing 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.150
 negative is that they did bar or up 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.310
 there is the battery compartment that there is a display case 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.590
 unfortunately, firm pivot 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.420
 you can't turn it off so need every 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.780
 Once you remove the battery, do not leave it 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.190
 so just that it practically pulsates to say to 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.310
 which is very sensitive 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:28.680
 the station is worth and some are lacquered 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:31.290
 you take it in your hand all the time he 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:05:06.690
 made the 10 states felt quickly 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:05:09.030
 sound and then I finished with the lecce then 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.450
 bridge the Liberia's library 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.450
 toilet 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:35.120
 my mom with god 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:35.120
 I come from short truthful 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:06:01.840
 brother of welcomes one and this 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:06:06.280
 found the dust or a little 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:15.130
 as disturbing as the sweets house 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:24.190
 ttp butterflies that are make butterflies 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:37.360
 I don't know giggles and at the end on 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:39.220
 back in the ground feels good and pid e 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:45.220
 I don't know what they want from her 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:49.919
 behind say they want it written 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:54.000
