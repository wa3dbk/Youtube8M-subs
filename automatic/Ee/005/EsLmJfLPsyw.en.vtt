00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.720
 cities correctly chris such salon on 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.200
 the outskirts of the city los-santos 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.329
 here I think some have noticed this 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.520
 little church when we walked around the city 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.400
 or accidentally passed by this 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.340
 town church as you can see 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.440
 adjoin even a graveyard on the left of the church 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.710
 there is a small area for cars and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.800
 booth priests over this area 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.670
 hanging poster with idiotic mug 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.100
 the priest and the poster is written 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.470
 stop and pray but the strangest and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.470
 terrible happens on church grounds 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.240
 at night, well , let's wait a little 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.460

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.920

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.640

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.600

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.050
 apparently the master of the crypt rose and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.409
 went for a walk 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.100
 ok hope we won't meet him in 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.229

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.670
