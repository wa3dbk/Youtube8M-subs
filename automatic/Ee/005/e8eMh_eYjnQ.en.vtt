well<00:00:00.210> done<00:00:00.480> rollers<00:00:01.290> we<00:00:01.589> have<00:00:01.879> the<00:00:02.879> advance

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
well done rollers we have the advance

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.280 
well done rollers we have the advance
routine<00:00:04.220> for<00:00:05.220> your<00:00:05.339> basic<00:00:05.790> run<00:00:06.299> rock<00:00:06.600> all<00:00:07.049> that

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
routine for your basic run rock all that

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.350 
routine for your basic run rock all that
means<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:08.130> we're<00:00:08.490> using<00:00:08.519> triple<00:00:09.000> step

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
means is that we're using triple step

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.740 
means is that we're using triple step
instead<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.620> normal<00:00:11.070> six<00:00:11.280> boot<00:00:11.750> pattern

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
instead of the normal six boot pattern

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.079 
instead of the normal six boot pattern
so<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.799> we're<00:00:13.950> going<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.160> do<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.759> show<00:00:15.030> you

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
so what we're going to do is show you

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.120 
so what we're going to do is show you
how<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.750> done<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.740> quick<00:00:16.920> reminder

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
how this is done just a quick reminder

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.380 
how this is done just a quick reminder
of<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.789> song<00:00:18.980> this<00:00:20.869> triple<00:00:21.869> step<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.439> back

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
of this song this triple step is back

of this song this triple step is back
replace<00:00:26.000> here<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.119> go<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:28.080> two<00:00:28.640> triple<00:00:29.640> step

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
replace here we go one two triple step

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
replace here we go one two triple step
triple<00:00:30.390> step<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.050> some<00:00:31.320> people<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
triple step and some people like the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.190 
triple step and some people like the
triple<00:00:32.460> step<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.969> further<00:00:33.210> part<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:34.020> like

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
triple step with a further part we like

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200 
triple step with a further part we like
to<00:00:34.320> close<00:00:34.559> them<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> little<00:00:35.130> bit<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
to close them a little bit it's up to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.299 
to close them a little bit it's up to
you<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.290> remember<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.890> did<00:00:38.160> that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
you so you remember that we did that

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
you so you remember that we did that
earlier<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.480> we're<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> do<00:00:39.930> our<00:00:39.960> basic

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
earlier so we're going to do our basic

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.639 
earlier so we're going to do our basic
when<00:00:40.710> saying<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.040> before<00:00:41.250> -<00:00:42.410> triple<00:00:43.410> step

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
when saying this before - triple step

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.600 
when saying this before - triple step
triple<00:00:44.100> step<00:00:44.600> again<00:00:45.600> back<00:00:46.320> step<00:00:46.829> triple<00:00:47.250> step

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
triple step again back step triple step

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.420 
triple step again back step triple step
triple<00:00:48.210> step<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:49.379> we're<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> move<00:00:50.129> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
triple step now we're going to move and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
triple step now we're going to move and
serve<00:00:50.670> your<00:00:50.879> motion<00:00:51.680> sounds<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:54.170> physical

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
serve your motion sounds very physical

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.160 
serve your motion sounds very physical
way<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:56.579> physics<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:59.870> we're<00:01:00.870> back<00:01:01.020> where

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
way but in physics and we're back where

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.150 
way but in physics and we're back where
we<00:01:01.199> started<00:01:01.320> from

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
we started from

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
we started from
so<00:01:02.370> there's<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.730> triple<00:01:03.270> step<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:04.049> base<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.350> on

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
so there's a triple step you base it on

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.679 
so there's a triple step you base it on
the<00:01:05.339> spot<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.850> turning<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.330> we're<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the spot and turning now we're going to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.990 
the spot and turning now we're going to
do<00:01:06.810> ladies<00:01:07.140> underarm<00:01:07.500> turn<00:01:07.890> would<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.520> basic

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
do ladies underarm turn would your basic

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.270 
do ladies underarm turn would your basic
to<00:01:09.150> get<00:01:09.330> into<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:11.780> with<00:01:12.780> your<00:01:12.869> back<00:01:13.110> step<00:01:13.470> now

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to get into it with your back step now

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.340 
to get into it with your back step now
the<00:01:14.310> spot<00:01:16.310> allow<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.369> turn<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.119> basically<00:01:18.990> on

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the spot allow you turn and basically on

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.560 
the spot allow you turn and basically on
the<00:01:19.799> spot<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> lady<00:01:20.729> turning<00:01:21.150> will<00:01:21.450> do

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the spot with a lady turning will do

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:34.219 
the spot with a lady turning will do
that<00:01:21.720> from<00:01:21.840> over<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:23.210> basic<00:01:32.720> then<00:01:33.720> gets<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
that from over here basic then gets a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.840 
that from over here basic then gets a
little<00:01:34.409> bit<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.250> much<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.670> lady

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
little bit but not as much as the lady

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
little bit but not as much as the lady
there<00:01:36.150> otherwise<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.810> cut<00:01:37.020> each<00:01:37.140> other<00:01:37.380> off

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
there otherwise we cut each other off

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.660 
there otherwise we cut each other off
now<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:38.790> underarm<00:01:39.180> turn<00:01:39.450> now

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
now really underarm turn now

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.260 
now really underarm turn now
basic<00:01:42.649> there's<00:01:43.649> some<00:01:43.890> anti<00:01:44.340> sides<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.000> side

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
basic there's some anti sides the side

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.880 
basic there's some anti sides the side
that's<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:48.020> there<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> over<00:01:49.740> from

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that's it there we go up and over from

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.100 
that's it there we go up and over from
over<00:01:50.220> here

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
over here

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.810 
over here
that's<00:01:52.110> step

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.560 

and<00:01:56.480> now<00:01:56.720> moves<00:01:58.780> and<00:02:00.550> that<00:02:01.550> again<00:02:01.850> bit<00:02:02.480> of

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
and now moves and that again bit of

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.490 
and now moves and that again bit of
practice<00:02:02.930> you'll<00:02:03.080> get<00:02:03.230> that<00:02:03.970> American<00:02:04.970> spin

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
practice you'll get that American spin

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.859 
practice you'll get that American spin
basic<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.710> prepare<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.940> all<00:02:08.119> same<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.630> vary
