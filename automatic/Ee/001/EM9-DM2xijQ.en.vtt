00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello we all have a new channel of 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.419
 parrot mania in which we are going to try 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.690
 Offer as much information as possible 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:11.730
 about parrots this time we're going to 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.150
 talk briefly and without detailing much 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.429
 about the yaco or not the gray the chaco 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.589
 popularly known is the red tail 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.499
 whose scientific name is without giving us 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.810
 perita cus erithacus but this one has a 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.970
 Chaco subspecies with the vinegar whose 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.029
 scientific name is we need edit 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.070
 Augustine game the differences basically 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.890
 they are physical they are with the vinegar in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.020
 same smaller darker by the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.630
 upper jaw with bronze or bone tone 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.300
 and the resale color queue that does not 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.980
 I confuse every person has a 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.390
 experience determined at the time of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.610
 advise but the differences 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.830
 behavioral characteristics of the specific pet 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.170
 they are going to lie mostly in the management and 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.120
 I try to see this of this kind of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.770
 parrot we can say that it is between 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.380
 the parrots of the most recognized 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 mainly by imitation 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.700
 this ability of parrots in general 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.680
 but so attributed in particular to this 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.200
 species has caused it to become a 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.820
 very demanded species unfortunately not 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.380
 everyone is aware that the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.390
 Lake means much more than repeating 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.340
 some words 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.020
 by this characteristic measure you will be 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.150
 can see it maintained incorrectly 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.530
 for lack of knowledge lack of interest 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.240
 part of some owners who 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.770
 they mainly acquired it as an icon 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.810
 funny night watchman who will spend the month 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.460
 valued if it does not meet expectations 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.380
 but what does not hold in 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.630
 correct conditions to which you are not 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.329
 offer correct care and do not 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.340
 hardly in good health 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.200
 will imitate as well as remember 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.299
 that not everyone has to have the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.640
 same facility and even there are 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.740
 they may never come to avoid 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.350
 we went to inform us a bit about data 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.860
 final this species is native to 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.680
 Africa 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.140
 Its approximate size is about 33 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.630
 centimeters and does not present clear 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.670
 sexual dimorphism although there are people 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.350
 experienced and paying attention to certain 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.150
 traits especially if they are very marked 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.759
 they can know the sex that has been in 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.900
 total security the safest way to 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.790
 Knowing your sex is by DNA 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.890
 although each individual presents his 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.710
 variations in behaviors 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.440
 generalizing we can say that it is no longer 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.020
 a very intelligent parrot and observer of 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.540
 reserved and quiet nature maintained 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.730
 as the pet and receiving a correct 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.620
 management and education is a pretty parrot 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.830
 nice and interesting that is us 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.840
 surprising every day nonetheless 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.520
 they have a certain tendency to 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.100
 develop preferences with some 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.200
 member with family members who 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.080
 confuse us if one is discouraged by 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.750
 this not only happens with the hogs 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.060
 happens with all the parrots just that maybe 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.709
 the iago by the size of its peak is more 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.400
 taken into account when he lets see his 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.400
 preferences 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.810
 can show one more preference 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.060
 drastic if it gives rise to it and if not 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.070
 It is prevented from the beginning a parrot 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.230
 prefer a person does not mean that 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.069
 can not deal with other people and 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.560
 enjoy it 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.540
 They also tend to be more sensitive to 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.280
 new situations and hence perhaps 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.499
 may be more affected by the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.760
 presence of a new front a change 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:15.439
 in the environment a certain object 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.090
 this does not mean that they can not 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.709
 adapt to the changes but maybe 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.660
 may take longer to adapt to 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.610
 they 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.200
 it is therefore advisable to change 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.910
 regularly the entertainments 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.400
 offered in the cage as well as the 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.260
 distribution of the presses 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.849
 in the daily food that of receiving 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.760
 It must consist of two main parts 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.200
 a wet food and dry food like 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.120
 food a medium we take for example 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.750
 people and fruits that every day 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.129
 they should try to vary as dry food 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.689
 we take for example the seeds and the 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.770
 balanced balanced feed for the 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.390
 species 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.670
 Food plays a very important role 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.770
 important in health and not only physical 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.900
 also psychic variable in the 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.630
 presentation and combinable food 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.520
 it stimulates them entertain you have to avoid 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.290
 the food monotony and is extremely 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.810
 important to be informed in advance of the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.970
 prohibited food for parrots there is no 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.400
 to be especially careful 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.360
 Always remember that you have to keep them 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.070
 in a cage as wide as possible of a 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.880
 resistant stainless steel material 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.070
 with galvanized metal 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.020
 the chaco should be able to stretch the wings 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.100
 without the tip of his sights touching with 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.960
 the bars I never want to reach a 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.580
 stress situation
