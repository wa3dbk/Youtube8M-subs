00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.840 

so<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.840> animation<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.650> show<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:01.190> have<00:02:01.610> to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
so the animation of the show I have to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.260 
so the animation of the show I have to
say<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.870> didn't<00:02:03.320> catch<00:02:03.830> me<00:02:04.100> on<00:02:04.280> at<00:02:04.490> first<00:02:04.760> it

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
say it didn't catch me on at first it

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.930 
say it didn't catch me on at first it
took<00:02:05.480> me<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.690> while<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:05.930> get<00:02:06.200> used<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.550> I

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
took me a while to get used to it so I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.060 
took me a while to get used to it so I
can't<00:02:08.330> really<00:02:08.539> call<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.289> best<00:02:09.500> animation

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
can't really call it the best animation

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.120 
can't really call it the best animation
I've<00:02:10.429> seen<00:02:10.759> but<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.690> does<00:02:12.050> work<00:02:12.080> for<00:02:12.410> what<00:02:12.890> it

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
I've seen but it does work for what it

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.010 
I've seen but it does work for what it

lots of the creatures and aliens they

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.830 
lots of the creatures and aliens they
meet<00:02:27.110> are<00:02:27.320> nicely<00:02:27.860> designed<00:02:28.430> well<00:02:29.330> not<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
meet are nicely designed well not the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.690 
meet are nicely designed well not the
ones<00:02:30.020> I'm<00:02:30.230> sure<00:02:30.440> right<00:02:30.770> now<00:02:30.800> they<00:02:31.310> look<00:02:31.459> kinda

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
ones I'm sure right now they look kinda

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.510 
ones I'm sure right now they look kinda
creepy<00:02:31.850> but<00:02:32.300> still<00:02:33.200> they<00:02:33.680> really<00:02:34.070> they<00:02:34.489> really

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
creepy but still they really they really

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.020 
creepy but still they really they really
look<00:02:34.940> great<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.739> can't<00:02:37.550> say<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:37.820> the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
look great so I can't say that the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.540 
look great so I can't say that the
animation<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.380> best<00:02:39.650> because<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.250> took<00:02:40.370> me

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
animation is the best because it took me

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.890 
animation is the best because it took me
a<00:02:40.580> while<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.850> get<00:02:41.060> used<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.780> might

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
a while to get used to it and it might

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.510 
a while to get used to it and it might
take<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.290> while<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.590> get<00:02:42.800> used<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.280> to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
take you a while to get used to it to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.910 
take you a while to get used to it to
like<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.090> eyes<00:02:44.270> for<00:02:44.780> instance<00:02:45.260> they<00:02:45.770> look

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
like the eyes for instance they look

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.290 
like the eyes for instance they look
like<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.100> lot<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.400> dots<00:02:46.550> that<00:02:46.820> have<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:46.970> singular

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
like a lot of dots that have a singular

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.350 
like a lot of dots that have a singular
duck<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.739> animation<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.520> kind<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.970> decent

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
duck so the animation is kind of decent

the aliens and all that other stuff I

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.320 
the aliens and all that other stuff I
really<00:04:58.870> enjoyed<00:04:59.139> looking<00:04:59.349> at<00:04:59.589> those<00:04:59.860> but<00:05:00.669> its

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
really enjoyed looking at those but its

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.179 
really enjoyed looking at those but its
animation<00:05:01.839> is<00:05:02.050> kind<00:05:02.229> of<00:05:02.319> hard<00:05:02.499> to<00:05:02.620> accept<00:05:03.009> that

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:03.189 
animation is kind of hard to accept that

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:04.950 
animation is kind of hard to accept that
first<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:03.610> it<00:05:03.759> might<00:05:03.969> be<00:05:03.999> a<00:05:04.240> stumble<00:05:04.689> for<00:05:04.899> you
