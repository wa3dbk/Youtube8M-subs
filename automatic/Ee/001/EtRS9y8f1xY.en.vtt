00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.240 
see it actually scans the 700 megahertz
band<00:03:16.829> now<00:03:18.739> remember<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.829> have<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.010> scanner

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
band now remember I have the scanner

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.039 
band now remember I have the scanner
after<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.549> 700<00:03:21.060> megahertz<00:03:21.329> barrel<00:03:21.750> it's<00:03:21.900> this

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
after you 700 megahertz barrel it's this

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.759 
after you 700 megahertz barrel it's this
700<00:03:22.590> makers<00:03:22.920> trunk<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.730> also<00:03:24.319> my<00:03:25.319> other<00:03:25.530> guys

300 megahertz scanning military orb and

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.569 
300 megahertz scanning military orb and
it<00:03:33.299> will<00:03:33.420> do<00:03:33.569> it<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.989> m2<00:03:37.370> still<00:03:38.370> trying<00:03:38.549> to

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
it will do it on a m2 still trying to

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.099 
it will do it on a m2 still trying to
get<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.849> hanging<00:03:39.299> using<00:03:39.629> all<00:03:39.720> these<00:03:39.810> buttons

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
get the hanging using all these buttons

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.619 
get the hanging using all these buttons
this<00:03:40.829> is<00:03:41.010> gonna<00:03:41.489> go<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:41.730> my<00:03:41.879> car<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:42.299> I've<00:03:42.420> set

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
this is gonna go in my car but I've set

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.460 
this is gonna go in my car but I've set
up<00:03:42.659> here<00:03:42.959> on<00:03:43.079> my<00:03:43.200> desk<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.829> could<00:03:45.349> get<00:03:46.349> the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
up here on my desk so I could get the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.349 
up here on my desk so I could get the
hang<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.799> how<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.129> thing<00:03:47.190> works<00:03:50.180> well<00:03:51.180> it

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
hang of how this thing works well it

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.659 
hang of how this thing works well it
also<00:03:51.510> does<00:03:51.750> amateur<00:03:52.109> bands<00:03:52.349> candy<00:03:52.769> bands

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
also does amateur bands candy bands

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.830 
also does amateur bands candy bands
scanning<00:03:54.950> you<00:03:55.950> can<00:03:55.980> turn<00:03:56.370> off<00:03:56.840> individual

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
scanning you can turn off individual

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.990 
scanning you can turn off individual
bands<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.440> think<00:03:58.530> it's<00:03:58.799> doing<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.370> 6<00:03:59.790> meter

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
bands so I think it's doing the 6 meter

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.710 
bands so I think it's doing the 6 meter
band<00:04:00.269> now<00:04:03.769> if<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:05.010> press<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.579> numbers<00:04:06.090> it'll<00:04:06.480> go

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
band now if I press the numbers it'll go

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.680 
band now if I press the numbers it'll go
through<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.530> bands<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:08.220> scans<00:04:08.579> all<00:04:08.730> like<00:04:09.239> 13

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
through the bands it scans all like 13

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.400 
through the bands it scans all like 13
or<00:04:09.720> 12<00:04:09.870> hundred<00:04:10.440> megahertz<00:04:10.680> band<00:04:11.690> or<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.750> 1.2

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
or 12 hundred megahertz band or the 1.2

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.479 
or 12 hundred megahertz band or the 1.2
gigahertz<00:04:13.739> bands<00:04:16.070> there<00:04:17.070> isn't<00:04:17.280> really<00:04:17.370> that

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
gigahertz bands there isn't really that

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.969 
gigahertz bands there isn't really that
much<00:04:17.639> activity<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.329> those<00:04:18.539> bands<00:04:18.810> around<00:04:19.650> here

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
much activity on those bands around here

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.370 
much activity on those bands around here
so<00:04:20.959> it<00:04:21.959> gives<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.320> nice<00:04:22.500> display<00:04:24.260> we're<00:04:25.260> in

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
so it gives you a nice display we're in

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.620 
so it gives you a nice display we're in
touch<00:04:25.800> with<00:04:25.979> you

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.450 

mmm<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.810> manuals<00:04:34.200> well-written<00:04:34.530> it's<00:04:35.250> not

mmm the manuals well-written it's not

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.280 
mmm the manuals well-written it's not
too<00:04:35.610> hard<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:35.910> use

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
too hard to use

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.150 
too hard to use
I<00:04:37.730> also<00:04:38.730> has<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:38.970> goal<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.360> railroad<00:04:39.990> scam<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.950> as

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
to go through this to make sure it's set

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.590 
to go through this to make sure it's set
up<00:04:45.570> for<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.960> mayor<00:04:46.440> on<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.830> Canadian<00:04:47.250> side

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
up for the mayor on the Canadian side

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.890 
up for the mayor on the Canadian side
but<00:04:48.600> uh<00:04:48.630> it<00:04:49.230> scans<00:04:49.620> from<00:04:49.860> 159<00:04:50.510> all<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.690> way<00:04:51.780> up

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
but uh it scans from 159 all the way up

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:01.220 
but uh it scans from 159 all the way up
to<00:04:52.170> 161<00:04:53.240> pretty<00:04:54.240> quickly<00:04:54.450> too<00:04:54.780> so<00:05:00.110> there's<00:05:01.110> a

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
to 161 pretty quickly too so there's a

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.400 
to 161 pretty quickly too so there's a
limit<00:05:01.470> search<00:05:01.800> you<00:05:02.130> can<00:05:02.280> do<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:03.410> programming

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
limit search you can do a programming

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:15.680 
limit search you can do a programming
your<00:05:04.560> link<00:05:04.800> search<00:05:05.100> mode<00:05:13.850> there<00:05:14.850> we<00:05:14.970> go

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
your link search mode there we go

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.810 
your link search mode there we go
you<00:05:16.350> can<00:05:16.560> set<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.890> limits<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.280> what<00:05:17.490> you<00:05:17.610> want

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
you can set the limits to what you want

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.760 
you can set the limits to what you want
to<00:05:17.970> do<00:05:18.540> it<00:05:18.690> to<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:18.900> can<00:05:19.050> scan<00:05:19.260> the<00:05:19.380> whole<00:05:19.500> ban

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
to do it to you can scan the whole ban

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.870 
to do it to you can scan the whole ban
let's<00:05:20.070> say<00:05:20.280> we<00:05:21.270> go<00:05:21.450> from<00:05:21.720> my<00:05:22.020> 29<00:05:22.620> megahertz<00:05:23.750> to

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
let's say we go from my 29 megahertz to

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:41.950 
let's say we go from my 29 megahertz to
1200

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.540
