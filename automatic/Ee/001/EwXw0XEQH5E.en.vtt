00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 usually hunt continues for a cable 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.820
 Fred is but the worst case may be this 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.190
 type of situation causing a 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.420
 short circuit and fire 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.190
 result 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.020
 this is such a case where the stone marten 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.940
 caused considerable damage 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 the animals are now on the rise 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.320
 in our province and the garage owners 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.570
 are busy with it 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.289
 it seems that the problem is more common 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.730
 whether it is on the period for maters 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.040
 we blow we get more cases 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.120
 inside with marthe damage 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.800
 think of this through fact cables 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.660
 pipes of windscreen washer fluid 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 first we thought of what it is 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.010
 it have a mouse or something below it 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.440
 because you can hear that the mice 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.739
 just stood under the hood 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.559
 hanging it got bigger and bigger and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.369
 from the aircon did that more to the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.659
 garage 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:57.089
 then they discovered that in one of them 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.719
 that of that pan that leads and bones 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.729
 from 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.920
 I heard it in the treatment 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.710
 a type of fishmeal or of the cable 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.399
 fish oil is processed and probably 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.350
 to get rid of him 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.429
 the problem cannot be solved 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.950
 by finishing them 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:14.300
 the stemat there is protected hold the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.300
 owners can dislodge them 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.360
 I just had to use spray 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.500
 find martens of course 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.610
 awful and remain stuck 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.920
 to stick 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.970
 yes you can be an electronic box 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.259
 apply to the battery 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.240
 that is a very high-frequency signal 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.020
 the base also goes crazy 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.340
 from 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.720
 or just very cheap an old-fashioned 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.979
 toilet block what you normally have under you 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.380
 hangs around 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.759
 well save without your hacks and 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.080
 those with them find that fragrance soft 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.959
 they don't get there either 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.179
 click here than maud when I am on 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.950
 bridge 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.860
 it gives a nice tone 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.450
 we no longer suffer from and yes the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.439
 Martha's like a he do somewhere else 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.969
 Search 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.039
 So we can do enough tasty things 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.899
 in the world for them I drink the 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.429
 garage owner hope the government anyway 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.750
 something about the protected status of the 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.549
 marten does 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.619
 I do think it is a scourge 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.970
 start to be yes then trouble already 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.970
 I think taking action
