00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
such as tales orphanage tale I think I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.880 
such as tales orphanage tale I think I
think<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.700> hasn't<00:00:41.940> been<00:00:42.120> seen<00:00:42.450> enough<00:00:42.890> there

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
think that hasn't been seen enough there

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
think that hasn't been seen enough there
are<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.280> things<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:44.879> genuinely<00:00:45.180> just

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
are some things but I'm genuinely just

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.930

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
I wouldn't be pointless but it would
