00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
you want it to work and it will have the

sense when you click randomized you will

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.770 
sense when you click randomized you will

also<00:02:43.659> just<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.200> keep<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.500> better<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.980> can<00:02:45.159> go

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
also just to keep it better you can go

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.390 
also just to keep it better you can go
