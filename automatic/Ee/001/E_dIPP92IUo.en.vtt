00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.060
 friends world blackberry well found 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.560
 given the particular vocation of the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.420
 blackberry classic seemed to us 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.880
 appropriate to make a small focus for 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.100
 understand how trackball behave e 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.410
 function keys on an operating system 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.770
 blackberry 10 against the old 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.200
 blackberry os7 system I have here with me a 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.100
 porsche design 99 81 which substantially 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.130
 it is a bolt apart from the aesthetics and the theme 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.090
 dedicated software what are we going to 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.800
 see first direction 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.810
 inside the system with the trackpad 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.020
 I can move to the top 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:55.670
 where on the battery indicator is given time 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.900
 and phone signal 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.690
 then I have the part related to notifications 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:06.229
 audio profiles the search and then the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.610
 selection of applications from the part 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.700
 superior we said where we have 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.710
 battery indicator and now I can 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.650
 select with the trackpad and activate 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.170
 the connection menu this 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.630
 we can do it also with the classic bar 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.030
 and we will see immediately how then we have 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.810
 we said the audio profiles and so on 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.180
 etc 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.479
 let's move on to our blackberry 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.050
 classes unlock the keyboard or better 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.690
 we unlock the screen with the keyboard 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.710
 by pressing the button but now the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:43.700
 menu key activates the drop-down menu 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.770
 where or how you saw the first 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.900
 network management then mobile network e 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.470
 wifi and bluetooth can I manage everything from 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.390
 here 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.299
 I also have all the other options 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:58.430
 such as customizing notifications 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:00.940
 alarm notifications and many other options 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.040
 within this menu always 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.070
 let's go back for a second on ours 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.459
 porsche design and let's see how 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.340
 involves the selection of the text ad 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.269
 example we enter the message menu io 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.390
 here I have two messages what can I do with 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.060
 the home button I am now going to access 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.260
 menu 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.530
 with various settings and options 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.800
 button back around in the list 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.069
 messages I can select more than one 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.700
 message at a time with holding 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.920
 the uppercase key and moving with the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.470
 trackpad 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.250
 let's see what happens on 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.900
 blackberry classic blackberry classic a 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.170
 a bit different handling of messages 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.480
 in fact as you well know it is equipped with 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.410
 notification center blackberry app 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.540
 however, even here as you can see I have many 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.989
 menu in sight precisely because it is a 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.190
 system that was conceived 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:09.420
 basically for touch use 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.390
 however, by pressing the blackberry button 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.849
 I can activate the menu with all the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.010
 options here too multiple selection 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.090
 it is very convenient always with the key 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.450
 uppercase and traverse scrolling a 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.970
 back key to deselect is 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.290
 still back to return to the home 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.940
 page within an application one 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.049
 simple application as well as the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.620
 contact management 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:42.390
 I can by pressing the blackberry button 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.060
 activate as we said 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:50.060
 options and search with add contact 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:53.819
 add more group and I have all this 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.250
 series of options with a pressure 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.870
 prolonged instead the menu is activated 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.780
 top where driving 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.389
 update and settings in 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.329
 old blackberry was a little different 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.670
 precisely because there was only one menu 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.930
 always with the blackberry button where I go to 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.140
 see what my chances are 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.630
 thing 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.250
 what differences does your systems have a little e 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.810
 also the management of the 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.260
 multitasking because blackberry 10 is the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.270
 first real blackberry multitasking though 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.720
 from the home page of our porsche 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.990
 design if I hold it down for some 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.340
 according to the blackberry button one is activated 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.340
 sort of multitasking 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.639
 or better the management the selection of 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.500
 applications already open this on 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.600
 classic we don't find it precisely because 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.820
 as we know the management of 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:56.090
 multitasking is entrusted to active 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:59.389
 frames selection of the nice test we have 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.930
 also said very similar here we can 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:07.030
 always go to the app to see 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.030
 how can we do 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.449
 maybe we enter in an email I want 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.080
 select this part of text 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.210
 I click with trackpad uppercase key 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.789
 select what I want to do 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.190
 pair menu key select share 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:29.510
 back back and let's go back 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.729
 in the competition we did not do this 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.229
 little comparison from riccardo to world 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.229
 blackberry is everything to the next
