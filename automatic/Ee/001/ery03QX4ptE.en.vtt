ended up getting this one this one's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.620 
ended up getting this one this one's
called<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.969> Ava<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:35.640> debated<00:00:36.000> long<00:00:36.360> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
called the Ava and I debated long and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.869 
called the Ava and I debated long and
hard<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.559> because<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.010> also<00:00:38.430> came<00:00:38.700> in

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
hard on this one because it also came in

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.180 
hard on this one because it also came in
a<00:00:38.969> cream<00:00:39.239> color<00:00:39.540> which<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.800> beautiful

a cream color which is just so beautiful
but<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.969> figured<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> fall<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.410> winter

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
but I figured with the fall and winter

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.610 
but I figured with the fall and winter
season<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.390> darker<00:00:45.840> color<00:00:46.020> would<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.230> more

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
season the darker color would be more

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.529 
season the darker color would be more
