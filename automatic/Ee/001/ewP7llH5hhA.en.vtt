00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
draw four to get us started one two

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.490

three<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.990> four<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.750> we're<00:00:21.750> supposed<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.289> put

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
three and four and we're supposed to put

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.410 
three and four and we're supposed to put
these<00:00:22.740> around<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.840> entrance<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:27.390> we

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
these around this this entrance so we

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.209 
these around this this entrance so we
have<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> summoning<00:00:28.710> chamber<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:31.040> looks<00:00:32.040> like

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
have a summoning chamber and looks like

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.900 
have a summoning chamber and looks like
it's<00:00:32.399> easy<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:32.940> demons<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.840> into<00:00:34.110> their

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
it's easy for demons to get into their

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.220 
it's easy for demons to get into their
demons<00:00:35.910> cost<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.480> less<00:00:36.690> peril<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.290> play<00:00:37.530> here

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
demons cost one less peril to play here

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
demons cost one less peril to play here
so<00:00:40.230> we'll<00:00:40.350> put<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.559> down<00:00:40.940> maybe<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
so we'll put that down maybe to the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.650 
so we'll put that down maybe to the
north<00:00:43.219> and<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.520> should<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> legal<00:00:45.300> move

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
north and that should be a legal move

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.119 
north and that should be a legal move
door<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.230> door<00:00:46.910> we<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.120> barracks<00:00:49.129> all

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
door to door we have the barracks all

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.720 
door to door we have the barracks all
non<00:00:50.850> quest<00:00:51.360> monsters<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.170> plus<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.860> melee

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
non quest monsters have plus one melee

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.260 
non quest monsters have plus one melee
here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
here

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.810 
here
I<00:00:54.530> guess<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.370> their<00:00:56.579> hands

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
I guess because they can get their hands

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.029 
I guess because they can get their hands
on<00:00:57.710> weapons<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.129> such<00:01:00.050> we<00:01:01.050> can't<00:01:01.410> place<00:01:01.739> this

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
on weapons and such we can't place this

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.889 
on weapons and such we can't place this
one<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> south<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.600> wall

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
one to the south because it's a wall

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.469 
one to the south because it's a wall
that's<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.949> block<00:01:05.400> our<00:01:05.610> ability<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.330> in

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that's gonna block our ability to get in

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.500 
that's gonna block our ability to get in
there<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.900> we've<00:01:07.049> got<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.270> right<00:01:09.450> or

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
there so we've got to go to the right or

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.440 
there so we've got to go to the right or
left<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.590> let's<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.250> put<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.460> over<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
left so let's just put that over to the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.390 
left so let's just put that over to the
east<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> right<00:01:15.259> layer<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> tentacle

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
east to the right layer of the tentacle

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.609 
east to the right layer of the tentacle
beast<00:01:17.810> okay<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.229> are<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.830> space<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
take one wound when you enter this space

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.649 
take one wound when you enter this space
on<00:01:28.170> your<00:01:28.229> turn<00:01:28.799> over<00:01:29.340> come<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> movement<00:01:30.030> threat

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
movement to overcome the movement threat

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.300 
movement to overcome the movement threat
to<00:01:38.670> untypical

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:51.100 

we'll<00:01:44.310> play<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.320> south<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:49.670> grim

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
we'll play that to the south a grim

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.480 
we'll play that to the south a grim
Junction<00:01:53.750> there's<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.840> hazard<00:01:55.200> there<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.100> says

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
Junction there's a hazard there it says

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.149 
Junction there's a hazard there it says
that<00:01:56.790> traps<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.509> plus<00:01:57.930> two<00:01:58.290> threats<00:01:58.860> so

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
that traps have plus two threats so

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.830 
that traps have plus two threats so
traps<00:01:59.520> are<00:01:59.820> difficult<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:01.250> overcome<00:02:02.509> if<00:02:03.509> any

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
traps are difficult to overcome if any

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.990 
traps are difficult to overcome if any
traps<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.439> played<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:05.040> grim<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
traps are played in this grim and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.359 
traps are played in this grim and
Junction<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.079> we'll<00:02:07.799> put<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> west

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
Junction and we'll put that to the west

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.580 
Junction and we'll put that to the west
we're<00:02:09.489> here<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.849> starts<00:02:13.390> our<00:02:13.720> map<00:02:14.200> that's

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590
