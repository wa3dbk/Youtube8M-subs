00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
yeah that's kind of a look had really

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.720 
yeah that's kind of a look had really
nice<00:00:14.759> lines<00:00:15.089> until<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.450> put<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.730> pedal

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
nice lines until I put the the pedal

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.599 
nice lines until I put the the pedal
setup<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.180> there<00:00:18.359> but<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:19.220> wanted<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> make<00:00:20.400> us<00:00:20.520> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
setup in there but I wanted to make us a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.730 
setup in there but I wanted to make us a
little<00:00:20.730> bit<00:00:20.850> pedal<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:22.050> may<00:00:22.230> or<00:00:22.350> may<00:00:22.439> not<00:00:22.470> be

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
little bit pedal that may or may not be

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.349 
little bit pedal that may or may not be
the<00:00:22.859> seed<00:00:23.039> I'd<00:00:23.160> go<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.789> kind<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.090> like<00:00:24.240> how

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the seed I'd go with I kind of like how

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.689 
the seed I'd go with I kind of like how
it<00:00:24.420> tucks<00:00:24.689> into<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.050> frame<00:00:25.260> back<00:00:25.529> there<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it tucks into the frame back there and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.160 
it tucks into the frame back there and
may<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.119> may<00:00:27.210> not<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> handlebars<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.140> I

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
may or may not be the handlebars that I

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.139 
may or may not be the handlebars that I
go<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:29.570> we'll<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:35.579> here's<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.030> got

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
go with we'll see and here's what we got

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.430 
go with we'll see and here's what we got
for<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.329> pedal<00:00:36.630> set<00:00:36.750> up<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.920> long<00:00:38.399> chain<00:00:39.440> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
for the pedal set up one long chain and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770 
for the pedal set up one long chain and
we're<00:00:40.559> probably<00:00:40.800> gonna<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.329> is<00:00:42.329> come<00:00:42.750> down

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
we're probably gonna do is come down

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260 
we're probably gonna do is come down
this<00:00:43.710> one's<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> bell<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.090> other

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
this one's for the bell on the other

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.590 
this one's for the bell on the other
side<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:46.440> same<00:00:47.399> idea<00:00:47.539> it'll<00:00:48.539> come<00:00:48.750> down<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
side but same idea it'll come down and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.639 
side but same idea it'll come down and
support<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> chain<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> probably<00:00:52.260> even<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
support the chain I probably even get a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
support the chain I probably even get a
little<00:00:52.770> fatter<00:00:53.100> roller<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.329> gonna<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
little fatter roller I was gonna do a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630 
little fatter roller I was gonna do a
sprocket<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> figured<00:00:56.070> what's<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> sense

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
sprocket but I figured what's the sense

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.240 
sprocket but I figured what's the sense
I<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:56.879> get<00:00:57.090> an<00:00:57.629> idler<00:00:57.989> pulley<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> lip<00:00:59.129> on

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
I can get an idler pulley with a lip on

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.990 
I can get an idler pulley with a lip on
each<00:00:59.430> side<00:00:59.730> probably<00:01:00.510> better<00:01:00.930> off<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:02.000> that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
each side probably better off and that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.850 
each side probably better off and that
could<00:01:03.120> also<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.359> my<00:01:03.600> adjustment<00:01:04.260> before<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
could also be my adjustment before the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.679 
could also be my adjustment before the
yeah<00:01:05.129> taking<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> slack<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> tree

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
yeah taking the slack out of the tree

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.820 
yeah taking the slack out of the tree
and<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:08.430> follows<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.030> pretty<00:01:09.210> good

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
and as you see it follows it pretty good

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.870 
and as you see it follows it pretty good
it's<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> peony<00:01:11.189> ass<00:01:11.340> trying<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.760> this

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it's a peony ass trying to get this

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.510 
it's a peony ass trying to get this
square<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> back<00:01:12.659> had<00:01:13.310> several<00:01:14.310> times

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
square to the back had several times

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.300 
square to the back had several times
that<00:01:14.760> flat<00:01:15.509> edge<00:01:15.720> attached<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that flat edge attached to this one a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
that flat edge attached to this one a
flat<00:01:17.640> edge<00:01:17.820> tied<00:01:18.090> attached<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> backs

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
flat edge tied attached to the backs

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600 
flat edge tied attached to the backs
Brock<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.470> kept<00:01:19.680> from<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> two<00:01:20.159> rods<00:01:20.400> until

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
Brock and I kept from the two rods until

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.929 
Brock and I kept from the two rods until
they<00:01:20.820> met<00:01:21.000> together<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.259> middle<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
they met together in the middle and so I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.460 
they met together in the middle and so I
had<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.090> break<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.420> free<00:01:24.689> quite<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> few<00:01:25.320> times

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
had to break it free quite a few times

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.920 
had to break it free quite a few times
before<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.890> got<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.220> right<00:01:26.509> set<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.540> up<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
before I got it right set it up on the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.420 
before I got it right set it up on the
little<00:01:28.259> lift<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.890> put<00:01:29.220> shims

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
little lift here and put shims

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.640 
little lift here and put shims
underneath<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:30.439> that<00:01:31.439> should<00:01:31.560> be

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
underneath it and all that should be

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.469 
underneath it and all that should be
good<00:01:32.030> up<00:01:33.030> there

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
good up there

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.780 
good up there
you<00:01:33.720> know<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.710> that'll<00:01:35.250> keep<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.520> straight

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
you know and that'll keep it straight

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.550 
you know and that'll keep it straight
keep<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> way<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.560> everything

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
keep it out of the way of everything

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.960 
keep it out of the way of everything
might<00:01:38.100> feel<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> little<00:01:38.490> something<00:01:38.759> right

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
might feel a little something right

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.350 
might feel a little something right
there<00:01:39.060> too<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.540> close<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> frame

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
there too so close to this to the frame

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.740 
there too so close to this to the frame
but<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.390> gotta<00:01:42.600> remember<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:44.420> 99.9<00:01:45.420> percent

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
but you gotta remember that 99.9 percent

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.510 
but you gotta remember that 99.9 percent

really is gonna be good for is pedaling

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.550 
really is gonna be good for is pedaling
backwards<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.610> turn<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> rear<00:01:53.970> brakes<00:01:54.210> huh

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
speed can be gearbox

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.240 
speed can be gearbox
and<00:02:09.819> something<00:02:10.539> else<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:10.899> say<00:02:11.170> 50<00:02:11.440> cc's<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:11.980> might

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
and something else I say 50 cc's I might

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.059 
and something else I say 50 cc's I might
have<00:02:12.599> we're<00:02:13.599> gonna<00:02:13.750> call<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.319> is<00:02:14.440> we're

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
have we're gonna call that it is we're

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.290 
have we're gonna call that it is we're
gonna<00:02:15.160> put<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> sticker<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.819> there<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.180> it's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
gonna put a sticker on there so it's

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.280 
gonna put a sticker on there so it's
just<00:02:16.420> 49<00:02:16.930> CCS<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.840> which<00:02:20.220> should<00:02:21.220> be

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
just 49 CCS and so that which should be

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.839 
just 49 CCS and so that which should be
my<00:02:23.290> setup<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.739> when<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:23.890> go<00:02:24.069> with<00:02:24.099> that's

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
my setup and when I go with that's

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.000 
my setup and when I go with that's
pretty<00:02:25.000> good<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.270> my<00:02:25.870> reach<00:02:26.080> on<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.530> pedals

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
pretty good for my reach on the pedals

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.050 
pretty good for my reach on the pedals
I<00:02:27.040> had<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.640> shorter<00:02:28.120> set<00:02:28.630> up<00:02:28.750> here<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:30.060> because

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
I had a shorter set up here and because

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.309 
I had a shorter set up here and because
I<00:02:31.120> was<00:02:31.180> just<00:02:31.330> kind<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.540> going<00:02:31.660> by<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:31.870> then<00:02:32.230> I

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
I was just kind of going by I then I

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.870 
I was just kind of going by I then I
decided<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.860> hop<00:02:32.980> up<00:02:33.010> on<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.340> bike<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.670> sat<00:02:33.850> on

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
decided to hop up on the bike and sat on

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.410 
decided to hop up on the bike and sat on
it<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.980> there<00:02:35.980> was<00:02:36.069> no<00:02:36.250> way<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.910> started

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
it and there was no way I started

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.479 
it and there was no way I started
hogging<00:02:37.959> this<00:02:38.080> out<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.440> get<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.709> into<00:02:39.130> there

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
hogging this out to get it into there

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.290 
hogging this out to get it into there
and<00:02:40.110> that's<00:02:41.110> how<00:02:41.230> close<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.470> was<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:43.030> wasn't

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
and that's how close it was just wasn't

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.650 
and that's how close it was just wasn't
happening

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
happening

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.380 
happening
plus<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.650> was<00:02:44.739> just<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.069> very<00:02:45.220> close<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.850> it

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
plus it was just so very close to the it

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.840 
plus it was just so very close to the it
was<00:02:46.480> hitting<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.890> fan<00:02:47.890> trout<00:02:48.160> on<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.430> motor<00:02:48.610> I

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
was hitting the fan trout on the motor I

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.050 
was hitting the fan trout on the motor I
was<00:02:49.060> gonna<00:02:49.239> heat<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.780> pedal<00:02:50.080> up<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.380> bend<00:02:50.620> it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
was gonna heat the pedal up and bend it

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.309 
was gonna heat the pedal up and bend it
further<00:02:52.060> out<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.540> still<00:02:52.780> may<00:02:52.900> do<00:02:53.080> that<00:02:53.260> a

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
further out and I still may do that a

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.030 
further out and I still may do that a
little<00:02:53.500> bit<00:02:53.650> but<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:56.410> leave<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.650> as<00:02:56.769> is<00:02:56.799> for

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
little bit but I can leave it as is for

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.940 
little bit but I can leave it as is for
an<00:02:57.310> animal<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:59.170> everything<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.470> still<00:02:59.799> just

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
an animal so everything is still just

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.090 
an animal so everything is still just
kind<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.250> tacked<00:03:00.549> into<00:03:00.790> place<00:03:00.880> nothing's<00:03:01.510> uh

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
kind of tacked into place nothing's uh

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.140 
kind of tacked into place nothing's uh
you<00:03:03.100> know<00:03:03.220> if<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.370> need<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.610> go<00:03:03.700> move<00:03:03.910> something

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
you know if I need to go move something

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.520 
you know if I need to go move something
I<00:03:04.299> still<00:03:04.480> can<00:03:04.660> move<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.930> just<00:03:05.019> cut<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.319> tags

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
I still can move it just cut the tags

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.670 
I still can move it just cut the tags
off<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:05.980> fudge<00:03:06.970> your<00:03:07.120> Lodge<00:03:07.269> that's<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.350> idea

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
off and fudge your Lodge that's the idea

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.890 
off and fudge your Lodge that's the idea
you<00:03:09.040> know<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.370> figured<00:03:10.150> this<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.480> how<00:03:10.720> much

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
you know I figured this is how much

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.979 
you know I figured this is how much
slack<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.440> need<00:03:11.790> for<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.239> pulley<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.569> come<00:03:13.840> up

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
slack I need for the pulley to come up

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.740 
slack I need for the pulley to come up
you<00:03:14.410> know<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.799> turn<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.130> on<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.430> off<00:03:15.570> so<00:03:16.570> my

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
you know to turn it on and off so my

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.110 
you know to turn it on and off so my
thought<00:03:17.079> is<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:18.010> adjustment<00:03:18.549> for<00:03:18.670> this<00:03:18.850> belt

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
thought is the adjustment for this belt

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.599 
thought is the adjustment for this belt
will<00:03:20.049> be<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.350> rim<00:03:20.560> sliding<00:03:20.920> back<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.100> forward

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
will be the rim sliding back and forward

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.190 
will be the rim sliding back and forward
and<00:03:21.700> then<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.910> adjustment<00:03:22.690> for<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.900> chain

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
and then the adjustment for the chain

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.319 
and then the adjustment for the chain
will<00:03:23.410> be<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.739> idler<00:03:24.070> pulley<00:03:24.730> going<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:25.120> on

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
will be that idler pulley going in on

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.569 
will be that idler pulley going in on
the<00:03:25.480> other<00:03:25.600> side<00:03:25.980> okay<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.040> got<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.250> couple<00:03:27.459> of

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
the other side okay you got a couple of

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.380 
the other side okay you got a couple of
master<00:03:27.970> links<00:03:28.209> for<00:03:28.299> that<00:03:28.359> too<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:31.120> I'm<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.359> I

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
master links for that too so I'm like I

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.270 
master links for that too so I'm like I

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
like the way it lays out it's uh when I

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.039 
like the way it lays out it's uh when I
had<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.670> front<00:03:39.910> end<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.180> little<00:03:40.299> shorter<00:03:40.870> I

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
had the front end a little shorter I

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.580 
had the front end a little shorter I
actually<00:03:41.560> kind<00:03:41.890> of<00:03:41.950> liked<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:43.170> even<00:03:44.170> better

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
that kind of bolts to the bottom of it I

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.070 
that kind of bolts to the bottom of it I
just<00:05:06.760> took<00:05:06.880> this<00:05:07.090> off<00:05:07.300> so<00:05:07.480> I<00:05:07.510> can<00:05:07.660> kind<00:05:07.810> of<00:05:07.870> tuck

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
just took this off so I can kind of tuck

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.320 
just took this off so I can kind of tuck
it<00:05:08.200> in<00:05:08.320> there<00:05:08.470> in<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.520> corner<00:05:09.880> there<00:05:10.030> for<00:05:10.240> now

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
it in there in the corner there for now

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.030 
it in there in the corner there for now
but<00:05:10.930> something<00:05:11.170> like<00:05:11.290> that<00:05:11.350> plus<00:05:11.680> it<00:05:11.830> tucks

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
but something like that plus it tucks

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.870 
but something like that plus it tucks
right<00:05:12.250> in<00:05:12.960> around<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.080> frame<00:05:14.290> like<00:05:14.500> that<00:05:14.820> so<00:05:15.820> I

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
right in around the frame like that so I

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.280 
right in around the frame like that so I
think<00:05:15.940> that<00:05:16.180> would<00:05:16.240> be<00:05:16.330> pretty<00:05:16.510> good<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.990> little

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
think that would be pretty good a little

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.410 
think that would be pretty good a little
bit<00:05:17.380> of<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:17.530> sissy<00:05:17.830> bar<00:05:17.980> may<00:05:18.730> or<00:05:18.880> may<00:05:19.000> not<00:05:19.030> do

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
bit of a sissy bar may or may not do

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.680 
bit of a sissy bar may or may not do
