screens<00:03:15.660> are<00:03:15.780> configured<00:03:16.200> properly<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:16.859> that

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
screens are configured properly so that

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.960 
screens are configured properly so that
your<00:03:17.640> mouse<00:03:17.910> will<00:03:18.480> move<00:03:18.750> from<00:03:19.019> one<00:03:19.230> screen

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
your mouse will move from one screen

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.240 
your mouse will move from one screen
onto<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.060> metal<00:03:21.209> screen<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.870> across<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.950> the

between all the monitors no so freely to

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.190 
between all the monitors no so freely to
prove<00:04:37.130> that<00:04:37.370> I'll<00:04:37.940> just<00:04:38.210> again<00:04:38.780> double<00:04:39.080> click

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
screen move it across the middle and

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.580 
screen move it across the middle and
then<00:04:44.450> I<00:04:44.570> could<00:04:44.720> actually<00:04:44.870> then<00:04:45.200> just<00:04:45.410> move

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
across that I if I wanted to and

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.740 
across that I if I wanted to and
maximize<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.350> it's<00:04:48.950> that<00:04:49.310> simple<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.790> do<00:04:50.030> okay

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750
