can<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.420> guess<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.140> many<00:02:01.259> respects<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
can I guess in many respects the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.679 
can I guess in many respects the
comparisons<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.729> superheroes<00:02:03.270> shouldn't

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
comparisons to superheroes shouldn't

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.719 
comparisons to superheroes shouldn't
shock<00:02:03.930> me<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> mean<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.009> sort<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.340> where<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
shock me I mean it is sort of where the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.190 
shock me I mean it is sort of where the
origin<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.180> superheroes<00:02:06.600> came<00:02:06.810> from

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
origin of superheroes came from

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.529 
origin of superheroes came from
Greek<00:02:07.380> mythology<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.789> said<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
Greek mythology but like I said it's the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.270 
Greek mythology but like I said it's the
choices<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.379> make<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.800> way<00:02:10.890> they<00:02:11.069> tell

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
choices they make in the way they tell

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.059 
choices they make in the way they tell
this<00:02:11.519> story<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.209> really<00:02:12.629> makes<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.200> odd

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
this story that just really makes it odd

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.610 
this story that just really makes it odd

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
for the fact that's in Greek mythology

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.870 
for the fact that's in Greek mythology
but<00:02:48.750> why<00:02:48.989> would<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.380> want<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.650> see<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:50.130> the

but why would we want to see that the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.400 
but why would we want to see that the
only<00:02:51.030> thing<00:02:51.269> that's<00:02:51.420> kind<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.930> entertaining

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
only thing that's kind of entertaining

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.979 
only thing that's kind of entertaining
is<00:02:52.680> James<00:02:53.010> Woods<00:02:53.340> as<00:02:53.579> Hades<00:02:54.090> because<00:02:54.299> well

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
again

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.559 
again
it's<00:02:55.680> one<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.069> weird<00:02:56.340> odd<00:02:56.640> choices<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.420> I

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
it's one of the weird odd choices that I

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.390 
it's one of the weird odd choices that I
guess<00:02:57.900> or<00:02:58.110> works<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.709> its<00:02:58.860> advantage

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
guess or works to its advantage

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.699 
guess or works to its advantage
I<00:02:59.610> mean<00:03:00.030> how<00:03:00.150> strange<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.049> guy<00:03:01.230> doesn't

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
I mean how strange that this guy doesn't

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.350 
I mean how strange that this guy doesn't
talk<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.190> traditional<00:03:02.700> villain<00:03:03.090> he<00:03:03.180> talks

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
talk like a traditional villain he talks

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.020 
talk like a traditional villain he talks
much<00:03:03.569> more<00:03:03.750> like<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> lawyer<00:03:04.319> agent<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.700> would

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
much more like a lawyer agent so I would

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.180 
much more like a lawyer agent so I would
be<00:03:06.209> eternally<00:03:06.840> grateful<00:03:07.079> if<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.829> would<00:03:08.010> just

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
be eternally grateful if you would just

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.920 
be eternally grateful if you would just

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
thing I can contemplate is that maybe

this isn't what I think which is fine if
it<00:04:18.620> was<00:04:18.739> better<00:04:18.920> or<00:04:19.250> an<00:04:19.370> entertaining

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
it was better or an entertaining

it was better or an entertaining
alternative<00:04:20.540> but<00:04:20.870> it's<00:04:21.350> really<00:04:21.620> not<00:04:21.890> it's

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
alternative but it's really not it's

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.850 
alternative but it's really not it's
clumsy<00:04:23.000> it's<00:04:23.390> flawed<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.140> story<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.620> so

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
clumsy it's flawed the story is so

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.100 
clumsy it's flawed the story is so
recycled<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.670> characters<00:04:26.180> are<00:04:26.330> so<00:04:26.480> recycled

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
recycled the characters are so recycled
