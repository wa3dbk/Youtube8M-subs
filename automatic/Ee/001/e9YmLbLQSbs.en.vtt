him just like this then the ball screen

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
him just like this then the ball screen
with<00:01:00.660> Shawn<00:01:00.899> will<00:01:01.140> occur<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.559> he's<00:01:01.770> coming<00:01:02.070> off

the<00:01:02.280> ball<00:01:02.460> screen<00:01:02.789> now<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the ball screen now we have a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660 
the ball screen now we have a
penetrating<00:01:04.619> pitch<00:01:04.860> situation<00:01:05.430> we're<00:01:05.549> going

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
penetrating pitch situation we're going

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.600 
penetrating pitch situation we're going
to<00:01:05.729> simulate<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.479> Hawks<00:01:07.049> man<00:01:07.380> after<00:01:08.130> hawk<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
to simulate that Hawks man after hawk to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.010 
to simulate that Hawks man after hawk to
pass<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.939> ball<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.240> never<00:01:09.330> want<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.630> stand<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
pass the ball you never want to stand so

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
pass the ball you never want to stand so
he<00:01:10.080> gets<00:01:10.320> away<00:01:10.439> we're<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> simulate

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
he gets away we're going to simulate

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
he gets away we're going to simulate
that<00:01:11.700> Hawks<00:01:12.060> man<00:01:12.299> actually<00:01:12.630> makes<00:01:13.590> a

defensive mistake and comes to the
basketball<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.060> help<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.600> then

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
basketball right here to help and then

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
basketball right here to help and then
Russell<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.200> pass<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> ball<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.070> a

to get out of it and getting out of the
ball<00:01:31.140> screen<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.530> something<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.890> practiced

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
ball screen is something we practiced

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.530 
ball screen is something we practiced
with<00:01:32.369> our<00:01:32.579> bigs<00:01:32.790> all<00:01:33.000> time

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
with our bigs all time

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.230
