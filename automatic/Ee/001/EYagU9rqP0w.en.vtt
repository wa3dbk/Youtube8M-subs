00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello to all youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.350
 video I wanted to show you the main ones 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.880
 crochet stitches then we leave 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.389
 saying that as you know this is a 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.150
 crochet 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.490
 there are of various sizes I am 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.560
 used to especially using the 4th e 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.760
 half the 6 because I tend to work 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 caps or scarves so big things 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.640
 anyway for little things I do n't know 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.910
 you want to make placemats or that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.500
 they are also deer incentive crochet hooks 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.660
 a millimeter 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:43.020
 obviously this here and I am composed 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.649
 accustomed as I said this to 4 and a half 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:53.360
 this does not net us 6 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:53.360
 otherwise there are also those two john companies 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.219
 goes to measure at 2 and a half mm four e 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 half 6 there are also smaller ones 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.580
 have been outside I found them in 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:13.970
 I've never used a magazine that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.970
 they are 110 and 175 are minors anyway 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.580
 according to the crochet you will have wool 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.030
 special when you go to buy the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.430
 wool on the packaging is written with 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.970
 how to use them as a bearing 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.380
 usually self r5 the hook will be at 4 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.340
 precisely this does not have to work with a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.570
 crochet 4 and I hold a crochet hook 4 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.530
 and nothing these are the basic notions 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.149
 however let's see how to work 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.460
 how to start a job 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.090
 we always start by making chains 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.610
 to make them I pass twice the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.240
 thread the breath breath the thread that is 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.820
 behind the front that brings the thread that before 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.100
 stood in front gone behind the port 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:08.149
 in front of it I pass the finger 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.500
 I crochet the hook and made my knot 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.200
 this is the starting point 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.390
 now they go very well always have a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.060
 work chains to make you 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.060
 see how it started by making 5 chains 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.340
 2 the chain and here crochet already 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.900
 inside a chain the thread passes 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:40.910
 behind crochet and in front and I do it 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:43.140
 go through none at 3 4 and 5 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.020
 let's see now how to knit a shirt 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:51.500
 high from my 5 chains I go to 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:55.590
 increase by 3 then go 8 1 2 and 3 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.730
 and from here my top shirt starts 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.100
 they are responsible for loading the wire 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.510
 the wire does not net passes in front of the 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.470
 son and then behind he entered the fifth 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.760
 chain is not the third from the crochet hook 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:18.750
 peach the black wire 3 load step the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.610
 thread through the first two load passes 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.820
 through the last two 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.630
 and this is a high jersey always for the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.120
 second load the peach thread while one 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:36.080
 peach loaded chain come out the two 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.080
 load and drain 2 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:45.980
 and so on until I get 5 then 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:51.959
 within peach I come out of two peach trees and drains 2 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:53.570
 load within and leave peach of two with the 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.890
 two 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:01.470
 the last assignment within this disc of 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.190
 two German 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:12.230
 the two this is the high jersey like 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.230
 see now to turn chain work 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:23.240
 3 3 chains work load load enters 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.669
 in the first peach I get out of two mix 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.690
 it's loaded 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:32.300
 within peach I go out of two I go out of two and 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.100
 so on until you get to the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.530
 desired length 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.120
 however the work a job will be 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.010
 so 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.430
 I hope these tutorials have been there 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.039

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.020

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.130
 Later lessons see you at
