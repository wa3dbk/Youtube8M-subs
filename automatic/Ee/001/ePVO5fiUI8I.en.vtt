for your systems to be lighting up quite

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.179 
for your systems to be lighting up quite
a<00:01:50.299> bit<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:50.600> your<00:01:50.810> energy<00:01:51.080> use<00:01:51.200> is<00:01:51.500> very<00:01:51.560> low<00:01:51.890> so

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
a bit so your energy use is very low so

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.669 
a bit so your energy use is very low so
what<00:01:52.909> we<00:01:53.030> did<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.479> we<00:01:53.509> figured<00:01:54.320> out<00:01:54.409> a<00:01:54.439> way<00:01:54.619> to

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
what we did is we figured out a way to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.740 
what we did is we figured out a way to
put<00:01:55.130> insulation<00:01:55.369> on<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.000> outside<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.689> our

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
put insulation on the outside of our

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.980 
put insulation on the outside of our
house<00:01:57.069> we're<00:01:58.069> using<00:01:58.190> denim<00:01:58.580> batt<00:01:58.759> insulation

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
house we're using denim batt insulation

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.440 
house we're using denim batt insulation
we<00:01:59.990> have<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.259> then<00:02:00.470> then<00:02:00.979> wrap<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:02.090> some<00:02:02.330> way

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
we have to then then wrap it in some way

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.389 
we have to then then wrap it in some way
so<00:02:02.600> we<00:02:02.840> use<00:02:03.229> this<00:02:03.440> vinyl<00:02:03.649> coated<00:02:04.069> polyester

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
so we use this vinyl coated polyester

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.699 
so we use this vinyl coated polyester
skin<00:02:04.940> so<00:02:05.479> it's<00:02:05.630> manufactured<00:02:06.289> to<00:02:06.440> fit

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
skin so it's manufactured to fit

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.509 
skin so it's manufactured to fit
perfectly<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.459> a<00:02:07.490> glove<00:02:07.759> would<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.399> they

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
perfectly like a glove would so they

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.830 
perfectly like a glove would so they
have<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> Kinect<00:02:11.180> which<00:02:11.360> allows<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.810> to

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
have a Kinect which allows you to

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.979 
have a Kinect which allows you to
virtually<00:02:12.380> control<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.890> lights<00:02:13.069> in<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> site

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.610 

well<00:02:17.989> we<00:02:18.080> have<00:02:18.170> an<00:02:18.230> eight<00:02:18.380> point<00:02:18.440> two

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
well we have an eight point two

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.429 
kilowatt array so there's actually a 108
thin<00:03:23.450> film<00:03:23.780> panels<00:03:24.379> up<00:03:24.650> on<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.919> roof<00:03:26.319> once<00:03:27.319> you

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439 
thin film panels up on the roof once you

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.929 
thin film panels up on the roof once you
get<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:27.709> there<00:03:27.859> there's<00:03:28.099> a<00:03:28.159> lot<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.519> exciting

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
get in there there's a lot of exciting

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:35.080 
get in there there's a lot of exciting
moments<00:03:32.859> every<00:03:33.859> team<00:03:34.069> here<00:03:34.340> has<00:03:34.549> a<00:03:34.579> different

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
moments every team here has a different

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.210 
moments every team here has a different
solution<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.989> problem<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.680> there's<00:03:37.159> a

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
solution to the problem and there's a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.330 
solution to the problem and there's a
lot<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.609> really<00:03:38.180> good<00:03:38.329> ideas<00:03:38.919> the<00:03:39.919> team<00:03:40.189> to

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
lot of really good ideas the team to

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.649 
lot of really good ideas the team to
beat<00:03:40.549> we<00:03:40.760> are<00:03:40.849> the<00:03:41.000> team<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.209> beat

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
beat we are the team to beat

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.539 
beat we are the team to beat
clearly<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.590> competition<00:03:43.159> is<00:03:43.250> going<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.430> be

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
clearly the competition is going to be

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:44.979 
clearly the competition is going to be
stiff<00:03:43.819> but<00:03:43.849> I<00:03:44.120> think<00:03:44.359> that<00:03:44.510> we<00:03:44.599> have<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> really

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
stiff but I think that we have a really

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.319 
stiff but I think that we have a really
good<00:03:45.079> chance
