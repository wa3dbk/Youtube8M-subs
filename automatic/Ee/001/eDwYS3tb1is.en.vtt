however he still has Garchomp and this

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:57.609 
however he still has Garchomp and this
Garchomp<00:04:55.409> is<00:04:55.589> very<00:04:55.859> hard<00:04:56.129> to<00:04:56.189> figure<00:04:56.399> out<00:04:56.549> and

00:04:57.609 --> 00:04:57.619 
Garchomp is very hard to figure out and

00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:00.169 
Garchomp is very hard to figure out and
he<00:04:58.619> goes<00:04:58.799> for<00:04:58.979> an<00:04:59.069> outrage<00:04:59.429> which<00:04:59.699> is<00:04:59.849> going<00:05:00.089> to

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:00.179 
he goes for an outrage which is going to

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:02.359 
he goes for an outrage which is going to
finish<00:05:00.329> me<00:05:00.569> off<00:05:00.599> and<00:05:00.959> he's<00:05:01.739> going<00:05:01.979> to<00:05:02.039> give<00:05:02.129> for

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:02.369

finish me off and he's going to give for
another<00:05:02.579> outrage<00:05:03.119> and<00:05:03.449> meaning<00:05:03.899> that<00:05:04.019> it's

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
another outrage and meaning that it's

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.749 
another outrage and meaning that it's
carved<00:05:04.529> and<00:05:04.859> that's<00:05:05.099> probably<00:05:05.579> the<00:05:05.729> reason

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
carved and that's probably the reason

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.849 
carved and that's probably the reason
why<00:05:06.149> I<00:05:06.179> didn't<00:05:06.779> out<00:05:06.929> to<00:05:07.079> beat<00:05:07.259> him<00:05:07.439> with<00:05:07.679> my

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:07.859 
why I didn't out to beat him with my

00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:13.189 
why I didn't out to beat him with my
alligator<00:05:09.139> he<00:05:10.139> gets<00:05:10.799> confused<00:05:11.369> now<00:05:12.049> which<00:05:13.049> is

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:29.839 
I'm going to go for a superpower not
sure<00:05:28.139> why<00:05:28.289> but<00:05:28.469> even<00:05:28.829> though<00:05:29.069> the<00:05:29.279> resistance

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
sure why but even though the resistance

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.379 
sure why but even though the resistance
it<00:05:29.999> does<00:05:30.269> a<00:05:30.299> ton<00:05:30.719> of<00:05:30.779> damage<00:05:31.199> to<00:05:31.379> that<00:05:31.559> Pokemon

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389

it does a ton of damage to that Pokemon
so<00:05:33.389> it's<00:05:33.539> really<00:05:33.719> worth<00:05:33.989> trying<00:05:34.349> out<00:05:34.559> to<00:05:34.739> speak

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009
