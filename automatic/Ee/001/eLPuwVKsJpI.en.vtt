there<00:04:00.609> so<00:04:01.359> if<00:04:01.599> you<00:04:01.889> are<00:04:02.889> using<00:04:03.159> DVI<00:04:03.459> monitors

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
there so if you are using DVI monitors

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.409 
there so if you are using DVI monitors
you<00:04:04.030> can<00:04:04.180> use<00:04:04.269> that<00:04:04.419> you<00:04:04.840> get<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.019> DVI<00:04:05.909> to<00:04:06.909> analog

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
you can use that you get a DVI to analog

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.800 
you can use that you get a DVI to analog
d-sub<00:04:08.379> connector<00:04:08.650> right<00:04:09.609> there<00:04:09.669> I<00:04:10.120> don't

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
d-sub connector right there I don't

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.259 
d-sub connector right there I don't
recommend<00:04:11.139> using<00:04:11.379> that<00:04:11.680> because<00:04:12.269> really

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
recommend using that because really

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.659 
recommend using that because really
really<00:04:13.989> you<00:04:14.379> should<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:15.250> should<00:04:15.280> be<00:04:15.519> using

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
really you should you should be using

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.300 
really you should you should be using

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
digital these days get a get a monitor

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.539 
digital these days get a get a monitor

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
with DVI or HDMI or DisplayPort so you

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.010 
with DVI or HDMI or DisplayPort so you
can't<00:04:21.700> display<00:04:21.969> port<00:04:22.240> here<00:04:22.479> is<00:04:22.630> your<00:04:22.810> mini
