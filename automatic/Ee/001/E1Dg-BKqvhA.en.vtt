00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:09.361
Jonathan, you've just finished a half season at Újpest

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:11.156
and you're already the club history

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:12.987
as winner of the Hungarian cup.

00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:15.096
How were your first months?

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:16.706
How do you feel in Hungary?

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:21.556
Would you recommend other players to sign in Újpest?

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.574
Everything was great since I arrived here.

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:28.744
I could quickly find my marks 
and feel at ease.

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:32.365
I arrived during a period of administrative problems,

00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:35.608
but everything was quickly arranged.

00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:45.161
We were not performing very well in the league,
but we could show our qualities with the cup.

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:50.034
I think we finished the season on a good note.

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:55.638
From my experience,
I would say to other players,

00:00:56.011 --> 00:01:02.285
that it is a good club 
to boost your career and reach a higher level.

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:09.360
Was it easy to come and live in Hungary?
How do you feel in this country?

00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:18.090
The city center is very close, 
I feel like at home.

00:01:19.108 --> 00:01:24.895
It was really easy,
only the language is more difficult.

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:31.319
Because my English is not so good either,
But I can adapt myself and everything is going well.

00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:37.649
The summer will be very interesting
with a lot of arriving, departing players.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.085
with also the preparation in Belgium
and the participation in the Philips Stayen Cup.

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.544
what's the program of the team in the coming weeks?

00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:49.426
It will be like the first week.

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:58.108
The coach told us we'd train everyday
with certainly a bit more intensity,
to be ready for the camp in Belgium.

00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:06.666
And for the game against Debrecen 
in the Super Cup.

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:11.894
About Belgium, how do you feel about 
playing in Belgium but in a foreign team?

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:21.859
It will be the first time for me.
It will certainly be strange for me.

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.357
Your friends and family will 
probably be there as well.

00:02:24.626 --> 00:02:29.099
Yes and I know 
the majority of players in Belgium.

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:34.238
So being in one club of another, 
it will be the same for me.

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:37.880
Yesterday Belgium won their first game
in the World Cup against Algeria.

00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:41.577
What do you expect from you national team?

00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:45.616
That they go as far as possible.

00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:50.780
First, pass the first round,

00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:55.468
I hope they'll go to semi-final 
against Brazil.

00:02:55.912 --> 00:02:57.680
Do you follow them closely?

00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:01.627
Yes! I watched the game yesterday.

00:03:02.054 --> 00:03:06.863
I was a bit afraid, because 
the score was not in our favor.

00:03:07.698 --> 00:03:08.849
But now I'm looking forward the next game.

00:03:09.368 --> 00:03:11.344
Who is your favorite player?

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.578
Axel Witsel.

00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:15.976
Why?

00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:25.010
Why? Because he is polyvalent,
He can do everything.

00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.823
He is one of the pillars of the team.
