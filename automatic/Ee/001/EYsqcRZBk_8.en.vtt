00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.040
 in this video tutorial we will see how 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:08.170
 work with adobe camera raw if with 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.300
 lightroom we can do all the management 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.429
 integral of photographic archives 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.730
 We can work in batches to import 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.460
 catalog and reveal the photographs 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.769
 also print them even assign them 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.990
 a position on the map with the camera 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:26.019
 raw would be a more specific process of 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.390
 file file to open the raw camera 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.490
 we have first of all to open the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.080
 photoshop the raw camera is a program 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.730
 which is included in the photoshop 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.930
 for it once the photoshop is open 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.840
 let's open file and look for our 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.650
 file that 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.650
 a tail 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.980
 the highest quality file of our 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.050
 camera and here I have the gross and inside 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.780
 of the gross I will select for example 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.550
 this first picture I give to open 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.949
 and how is a raw file that we have seen 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.039
 that was cr2 which is the native file of 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.690
 canon here we have the photograph that in 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.800
 another occasion already revealed with the light 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.080
 room 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.030
 by default the whole screen is opened 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.160
 of the raw camera may not be 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.190
 there will be with this aspect the same you see it like this 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.720
 in a smaller way you can switch it 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.870
 to full screen by clicking here or 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.730
 by pressing the letter f and so we have 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.030
 a larger space to see the picture 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.470
 if you look at the interface space it's 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.000
 quite like the lightroom just that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.850
 you do not have all the panels of the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.450
 left but here on the right 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.290
 you have the development settings and above 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.290
 we have the tools 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.730
 yes as thais to the most reduced space 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.070
 note that in the upper part it appears 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.370
 the version of the camera raw or in this case 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.580
 is 7.3 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.310
 and the type of camera in the photograph that 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.640
 let's reveal the version type of the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.750
 raw camera is usually associated with the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.030
 photoshop version 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.040
 if we are in with the photoshop cs 6 that 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.620
 it is the latest the camera versions 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.350
 raw are from 7 onwards if you were 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.880
 in photoshop cs5 you would have the camera 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.220
 raw 6 if we had the cs 4 we would have 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.620
 the camera raw 5 and the different 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.330
 updates for it you have to go to 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.980
 the adobe page or I'll open the double 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.130
 application manager that allows us 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.370
 update what is east this 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.740
 software in any case we having 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.170
 this arrangement we can see on the side 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.410
 right the histogram that as always 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.150
 is going to be our our eyes for 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.980
 perform any type of development 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.380
 you can also see that on the side 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.960
 right we have the basic panel with the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.540
 different settings these adjustments are the 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.390
 same as in the lightroom for which 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.670
 I will not explain the step by step since 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.940
 I already explained them in a tutor 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.489
 about the lightroom without reviewing form 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.010
 quick we have the basic tab 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.280
 to make basic adjustments to the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.280
 photography whether they are from the exhibition 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 contrast 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.690
 illuminations the shadows the temperature 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.110
 of color we have the curve to the right 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.360
 of tones to the next tab we have 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.599
 the detail to make the approach the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.209
 noise reduction we also have the 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.720
 hs options the scale eo 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.790
 gray 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.650
 and we also have the options of living 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.250
 tones to perform 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.000
 somehow revealed crossed 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.000
 with shades 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.069
 green as if it were a cross revelation 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.200
 we also have the corrections panel 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.440
 of the same lens as in the light room and 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.370
 the effects for ticket are the 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.970
 photography and create a certain type 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.750
 of 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.750
 adjustment 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.990
 darken that photograph 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.020
 the last three calibration panels 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.880
 of camera equal who lightroom 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.440
 the adjustments lends lessons if we want 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.590
 load preset settings and 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.780
 instantaneous snapshot allows us if 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.730
 click on the last tab, click here 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.280
 down that you have 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.140
 kind of new instant new layer 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.840
 so that this new snapshot 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.840
 I could put cross side 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.800
 in this way if I now come and do 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.330
 another type of development totally 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.460
 different for example I'm going to make a 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.410
 revealed in black and white 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.410
 and I'm going to take away these options 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.620
 doing it a little bit could come here 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.870
 I would call this revealed 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.180
 black and white 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.120
 and keeps two versions of it 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.860
 photographic archive with which it would have 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.220
 the development in black and the developer 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.220
 crossed
