00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
we've just finished the VFL league

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.840 
we've just finished the VFL league
season<00:00:18.090> we've<00:00:18.210> got<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.480> Cup<00:00:18.900> season<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.500> come

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
season we've got this Cup season to come

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.450 
season we've got this Cup season to come
we<00:00:20.850> finished<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.420> disappointing<00:00:22.189> fourth<00:00:23.189> from

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
we finished a disappointing fourth from

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.660 
we finished a disappointing fourth from
bottom<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.910> believe<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.449> was<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.160> but<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.460> had

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
bottom I believe it was and but we had

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.310 
bottom I believe it was and but we had
one<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.029> best<00:00:27.210> defensive<00:00:27.390> records<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
one of the best defensive records in the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.109 
one of the best defensive records in the
league<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.189> know<00:00:29.400> where<00:00:29.670> we<00:00:29.789> need<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
league so we know where we need to

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.600 
league so we know where we need to
improve<00:00:30.470> one<00:00:31.470> place<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.920> don't<00:00:32.219> need<00:00:32.460> to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
improve one place we don't need to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.299 
improve one place we don't need to
improve<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.270> our<00:00:33.809> bill<00:00:34.020> keeper<00:00:34.410> without<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
improve is our bill keeper without a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.430 
improve is our bill keeper without a
doubt<00:00:35.460> he's<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> best<00:00:36.600> goalkeeper<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
doubt he's the best goalkeeper in the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.040 
doubt he's the best goalkeeper in the
league<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:37.920> he'd<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.190> been<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.610> us
