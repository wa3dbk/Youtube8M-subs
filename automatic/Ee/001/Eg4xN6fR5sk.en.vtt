you'll<00:00:42.120> need<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:44.280> basic<00:00:44.610> premise<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.120> this

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you'll need the basic premise of this

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.930 
you'll need the basic premise of this
mod<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.289> build<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.739> tank<00:00:46.980> any<00:00:47.219> shape<00:00:47.789> or

mod is you can build a tank any shape or
size<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> wish<00:00:49.039> the<00:00:50.039> tank<00:00:50.309> block<00:00:50.820> itself

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
size that you wish the tank block itself

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.350

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
has to be connected to a tank controller

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.990 
has to be connected to a tank controller
for<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.719> work<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.760> right

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
for it to work and then you can right

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.849 
for it to work and then you can right
click<00:00:57.030> anywhere<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.840> tank<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> open<00:00:58.770> up

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
click anywhere on the tank and open up

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.700 
click anywhere on the tank and open up
this<00:00:59.039> GUI<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.260> now<00:01:04.470> is

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
this GUI so what I'm going to do now is

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.490 
this GUI so what I'm going to do now is
build<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.519> simple<00:01:05.790> tank<00:01:11.689> now<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> tank<00:01:13.229> block

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
build a simple tank now the tank block

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
build a simple tank now the tank block
doesn't<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> back<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.420> can

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
doesn't have to be on the back you can

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.320 
doesn't have to be on the back you can
actually<00:01:16.080> incorporate<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.610> controller

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
actually incorporate the controller

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:28.330 
actually incorporate the controller
within<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> tank

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.490 

and<00:01:29.340> let's<00:01:30.270> fill<00:01:30.510> this<00:01:30.660> up<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:30.900> lava<00:01:33.500> I'm

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and let's fill this up with lava I'm

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230 
and let's fill this up with lava I'm
going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.220> little<00:01:35.370> cut<00:01:35.640> here<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> I'll

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
going to do a little cut here and I'll

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840 
going to do a little cut here and I'll
get<00:01:36.390> back<00:01:36.450> when<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.870> filled<00:01:37.110> up<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.520> that's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
get back when it's filled up so that's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.360 
get back when it's filled up so that's
enough<00:01:39.150> liquid<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:41.070> want<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
enough liquid I think I just want to

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.270 
enough liquid I think I just want to
demonstrate<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:43.080> mod<00:01:43.800> interact

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
demonstrate here the mod interact

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.940 
demonstrate here the mod interact
ability<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:45.000> other<00:01:45.300> mods<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.650> this<00:01:46.740> case

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
ability with other mods so in this case

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.820 
ability with other mods so in this case
BuildCraft<00:01:47.490> liquid<00:01:48.330> pipes<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.680> i'll<00:01:49.800> just

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
BuildCraft liquid pipes so i'll just

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.250 
BuildCraft liquid pipes so i'll just
show<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.420> when<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.050> pump

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
show you here so you can when you pump

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.620 
show you here so you can when you pump
aight<00:01:55.530> liquids<00:01:56.400> out<00:01:56.550> of<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.910> tank<00:01:57.150> has<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> be

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
aight liquids out of the tank has to be

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.120 
aight liquids out of the tank has to be
connected<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> controller<00:01:58.680> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
connected to the controller and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.910 
connected to the controller and
conversely<00:02:00.060> has<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.720> connected<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.830> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
conversely has to be connected for the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.130 
conversely has to be connected for the
input<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.369> well<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:03.200> tank<00:02:04.200> will<00:02:04.380> fill<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:09.140> it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
input as well and tank will fill up it

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.260 
input as well and tank will fill up it
also<00:02:10.410> interacts<00:02:10.979> with<00:02:11.070> thermal<00:02:11.790> expansion

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
also interacts with thermal expansion

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.080 
also interacts with thermal expansion
pipes<00:02:12.680> but<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:13.860> case<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.400> pipes<00:02:14.640> can

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
pipes but in this case the pipes can

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.690 
pipes but in this case the pipes can
connect<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.750> tank<00:02:15.959> itself<00:02:16.670> for<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
connect to the tank itself for the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.430 
connect to the tank itself for the
output<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.450> for<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.380> input<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:25.320> we're

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
output and for the input so we're

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.479 
output and for the input so we're
draining<00:02:25.650> liquid<00:02:26.100> there<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:28.040> gaining<00:02:29.040> liquid

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
draining liquid there and gaining liquid

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.320 
draining liquid there and gaining liquid
there

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.320 

we<00:02:34.260> also<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:34.890> internet<00:02:35.310> ability<00:02:35.760> from<00:02:36.060> n

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
we also have internet ability from n

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.030 
we also have internet ability from n
dire<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:37.850> it<00:02:38.850> also<00:02:39.030> will<00:02:39.630> draw<00:02:39.870> from<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.620> tank

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
dire and it also will draw from the tank

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.310 
dire and it also will draw from the tank
block<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.290> insert<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.800> tank<00:02:44.010> block<00:02:48.320> like

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
block and insert in the tank block like

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:59.820 
block and insert in the tank block like
so

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.000 

so<00:03:00.670> as<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.210> see<00:03:01.390> here<00:03:01.600> my<00:03:01.810> setups<00:03:02.410> changed

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
so as you can see here my setups changed

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.810 
so as you can see here my setups changed
quite<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.370> bit<00:03:03.930> that's<00:03:04.930> because<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:06.370> feature

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
quite a bit that's because of a feature

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.080 
quite a bit that's because of a feature
that<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.270> mod<00:03:07.510> offers<00:03:08.460> but<00:03:09.460> is<00:03:09.610> currently

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
that this mod offers but is currently

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.430 
that this mod offers but is currently
bugged<00:03:10.590> I'll<00:03:11.590> show<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.130> feature<00:03:12.340> now<00:03:12.670> is

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
bugged I'll show you the feature now is

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.890 
bugged I'll show you the feature now is
if<00:03:14.440> we<00:03:14.980> get<00:03:15.420> grab<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> pic<00:03:17.850> now<00:03:18.850> with<00:03:19.030> these<00:03:19.180> tank

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
if we get grab a pic now with these tank

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.830 
if we get grab a pic now with these tank
controllers<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.670> wiki<00:03:22.120> says<00:03:22.270> you<00:03:22.450> can<00:03:22.600> break

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
controllers the wiki says you can break

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.060 
controllers the wiki says you can break
them<00:03:27.090> which<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.210> can<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:29.070> information

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
them which you can and the information

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.970 
them which you can and the information
of<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:31.240> tank<00:03:31.480> is<00:03:31.630> stored<00:03:32.050> in<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.350> block<00:03:32.620> there

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
of the tank is stored in the block there

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.400 
of the tank is stored in the block there
is<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.540> can<00:03:34.630> see<00:03:34.810> they're<00:03:34.990> stored<00:03:35.560> lava

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
is so you can see they're stored lava

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.699 
is so you can see they're stored lava
139,000<00:03:38.410> millet<00:03:38.800> buckets<00:03:40.140> now<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.200> idea<00:03:41.410> is

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
139,000 millet buckets now the idea is

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.220 
139,000 millet buckets now the idea is
that<00:03:41.860> you<00:03:42.040> can<00:03:42.300> place<00:03:43.300> this<00:03:43.510> down<00:03:43.840> in<00:03:44.140> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
that you can place this down in the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.500 
that you can place this down in the
world<00:03:44.440> onto<00:03:44.890> another<00:03:45.430> tank<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.360> will

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
world onto another tank and it will

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.030 
world onto another tank and it will
retain<00:03:47.500> its<00:03:48.180> ID<00:03:49.470> now<00:03:50.470> when<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.740> done<00:03:50.920> that

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
retain its ID now when I done that

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.420 
retain its ID now when I done that
earlier<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:52.080> crashed<00:03:53.080> my<00:03:53.410> world<00:03:54.190> and

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
earlier it crashed my world and

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.949 
earlier it crashed my world and
corrupted<00:03:55.330> it<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.490> consequently<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.750> world

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
corrupted it so consequently the world

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.180 
corrupted it so consequently the world
got<00:03:59.170> deleted<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.990> is<00:04:02.020> a<00:04:02.170> feature<00:04:02.530> when<00:04:03.040> it's

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
got deleted so it is a feature when it's

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.680 
got deleted so it is a feature when it's
working<00:04:03.340> but<00:04:04.030> for<00:04:04.480> now<00:04:04.600> just<00:04:04.810> be<00:04:04.989> mindful<00:04:05.320> that

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
working but for now just be mindful that

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.000 
working but for now just be mindful that
your<00:04:07.690> worlds<00:04:08.620> will<00:04:08.769> get<00:04:08.980> corrupted<00:04:10.950> okay<00:04:11.950> so

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
your worlds will get corrupted okay so

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.970 
your worlds will get corrupted okay so
let's<00:04:12.280> move<00:04:12.519> on<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.850> some<00:04:13.570> shapes<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:14.500> here<00:04:14.830> we

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
let's move on to some shapes so here we

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.640 
let's move on to some shapes so here we
have<00:04:15.010> I<00:04:15.870> I'll<00:04:16.870> guess<00:04:17.109> and<00:04:18.989> there's<00:04:19.989> no<00:04:20.290> limit

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
have I I'll guess and there's no limit

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.180 
have I I'll guess and there's no limit
to<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.830> shape<00:04:21.160> or<00:04:21.430> size<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:23.740> can<00:04:23.980> build

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
to the shape or size that you can build

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.980 
to the shape or size that you can build
with<00:04:24.340> these<00:04:24.490> tanks<00:04:25.350> here<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:28.150> in<00:04:28.450> fact<00:04:28.810> the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
with these tanks here is in fact the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.260 
with these tanks here is in fact the
tank<00:04:29.260> that<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:29.950> can<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.820> can<00:04:30.970> place<00:04:31.150> your

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
tank that you can you can place your

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.010 
tank that you can you can place your
textures<00:04:31.750> on<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:32.050> in<00:04:32.740> order<00:04:32.890> to<00:04:33.040> do<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:33.970> you

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.450 

get<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.140> texture<00:04:38.410> that<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:38.650> wish<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:38.919> paste

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
get the texture that you wish to paste

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.460 
get the texture that you wish to paste
onto<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.800> tank<00:04:41.800> block<00:04:42.160> itself<00:04:43.229> one<00:04:44.229> of<00:04:44.350> these

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
onto the tank block itself one of these

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:52.469 
onto the tank block itself one of these
and<00:04:46.140> you<00:04:47.140> just<00:04:47.380> shift<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.430> left<00:04:48.460> click<00:04:51.479> now

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
and you just shift and left click now

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.990 
and you just shift and left click now
the<00:04:52.810> bottom<00:04:53.080> layer<00:04:53.200> always<00:04:53.620> appears<00:04:54.400> darker

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
the bottom layer always appears darker

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.520 
the bottom layer always appears darker
for<00:04:55.150> some<00:04:55.240> reason<00:04:55.600> I'm<00:04:55.780> sure<00:04:55.960> that's<00:04:56.110> a<00:04:56.200> bug<00:04:56.380> as

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
for some reason I'm sure that's a bug as

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.950 
for some reason I'm sure that's a bug as
well<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.979> it'll<00:04:57.160> get<00:04:57.340> fixed<00:04:57.580> and<00:05:00.600> to<00:05:01.600> remove

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
well and it'll get fixed and to remove

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.950 
well and it'll get fixed and to remove
the<00:05:02.169> texture<00:05:02.640> have<00:05:03.640> an<00:05:03.880> empty<00:05:04.030> hand<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:04.630> shift

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
the texture have an empty hand and shift

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.310 
the texture have an empty hand and shift
left<00:05:05.590> click<00:05:05.860> again

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.900 

so<00:05:11.320> that's<00:05:11.470> pretty<00:05:11.770> cool<00:05:11.860> that<00:05:12.340> you<00:05:12.430> can<00:05:12.550> hide

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
so that's pretty cool that you can hide

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.860 
so that's pretty cool that you can hide
your<00:05:13.360> tanks<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:19.150> final<00:05:19.480> thing<00:05:19.510> I<00:05:19.690> want<00:05:19.840> to

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
your tanks the final thing I want to

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.750 
your tanks the final thing I want to
show<00:05:19.960> you<00:05:20.080> is<00:05:20.350> that<00:05:20.380> these<00:05:20.800> tanks<00:05:21.160> can<00:05:21.370> store

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
show you is that these tanks can store

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.390 
show you is that these tanks can store
multiple<00:05:22.150> liquids<00:05:22.750> so<00:05:23.680> here<00:05:23.890> we<00:05:23.920> have<00:05:24.040> some

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
multiple liquids so here we have some

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:32.040 
multiple liquids so here we have some
water<00:05:24.780> some<00:05:25.780> lava<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.550> some<00:05:27.550> end<00:05:27.850> up<00:05:29.910> in<00:05:31.050> order

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
water some lava and some end up in order

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.080 
water some lava and some end up in order
to<00:05:32.200> have<00:05:33.160> these<00:05:33.310> tanks<00:05:33.730> store<00:05:33.940> multiple

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
to have these tanks store multiple

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.940 
to have these tanks store multiple
liquids<00:05:34.630> you<00:05:34.720> need<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:34.960> craft<00:05:35.230> yourself<00:05:35.650> an

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
liquids you need to craft yourself an

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.160 
liquids you need to craft yourself an
upgrade<00:05:36.460> module<00:05:36.670> and<00:05:37.030> place<00:05:37.300> it<00:05:37.570> next<00:05:37.720> to<00:05:38.110> the

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
upgrade module and place it next to the

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.140 
upgrade module and place it next to the
time<00:05:38.410> controller<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:39.430> has<00:05:39.610> to<00:05:39.760> be<00:05:39.790> next<00:05:40.060> to

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
time controller it has to be next to

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.940 
time controller it has to be next to
this<00:05:40.300> controller<00:05:40.720> for<00:05:40.990> in<00:05:41.080> it<00:05:41.200> for<00:05:41.440> it<00:05:41.530> to<00:05:41.620> work

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:51.810 

so<00:05:44.950> once<00:05:45.190> that's<00:05:45.400> been<00:05:45.610> constructed<00:05:50.700> you<00:05:51.700> need

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
so once that's been constructed you need

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.740 
so once that's been constructed you need
to<00:05:51.910> get<00:05:52.000> yourself<00:05:52.090> a<00:05:52.450> storage<00:05:52.870> upgrade<00:05:53.050> and

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
to get yourself a storage upgrade and

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:01.040 
to get yourself a storage upgrade and
simply<00:05:55.750> right<00:05:56.500> click<00:05:56.770> on<00:05:57.540> the<00:05:59.460> rectangle<00:06:00.460> here

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
simply right click on the rectangle here

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.590 
simply right click on the rectangle here
and<00:06:02.610> if<00:06:03.610> you<00:06:03.700> right<00:06:03.880> click<00:06:03.910> again<00:06:04.120> on<00:06:04.360> that

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
and if you right click again on that

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.370 
and if you right click again on that
rectangle<00:06:05.170> it<00:06:05.380> will<00:06:05.770> pull<00:06:05.980> out<00:06:06.070> the<00:06:06.220> upgrade

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.610 

now<00:06:11.700> with<00:06:12.700> this<00:06:12.850> GUI<00:06:13.360> here<00:06:13.750> you<00:06:14.140> can<00:06:14.320> type<00:06:15.240> set

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
now with this GUI here you can type set

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.420 
now with this GUI here you can type set
index<00:06:17.620> with<00:06:18.340> a<00:06:18.370> capital<00:06:18.640> I<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:20.040> if<00:06:21.040> we<00:06:21.070> set<00:06:21.400> it

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
index with a capital I and if we set it

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.740 
index with a capital I and if we set it
to<00:06:21.700> 0<00:06:23.550> which<00:06:24.550> corresponds<00:06:25.120> to<00:06:25.330> this<00:06:25.480> first

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
to 0 which corresponds to this first

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.170 
to 0 which corresponds to this first
tank<00:06:26.110> so<00:06:26.530> this<00:06:26.680> tank<00:06:26.890> will<00:06:27.010> be<00:06:27.130> 0<00:06:27.430> this<00:06:27.970> one

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
tank so this tank will be 0 this one

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.290 
tank so this tank will be 0 this one
would<00:06:28.360> be<00:06:28.419> one<00:06:28.930> this<00:06:29.860> one<00:06:30.070> will<00:06:30.160> be<00:06:30.310> two<00:06:30.520> three

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
would be one this one will be two three

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.950 
would be one this one will be two three
four<00:06:31.960> and<00:06:32.169> five<00:06:32.680> and<00:06:33.419> then<00:06:34.419> we<00:06:34.540> execute<00:06:34.630> that

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
four and five and then we execute that

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.950 
four and five and then we execute that
command<00:06:35.140> and<00:06:36.750> the<00:06:37.750> tank<00:06:37.960> change<00:06:38.200> to<00:06:38.410> water<00:06:39.960> you

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
command and the tank change to water you

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.290 
command and the tank change to water you
can<00:06:41.110> also<00:06:41.260> do<00:06:41.590> this<00:06:41.740> with<00:06:41.800> a<00:06:42.690> redstone<00:06:43.690> signal

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
can also do this with a redstone signal

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.970 
can also do this with a redstone signal
so<00:06:46.300> when<00:06:46.419> the<00:06:46.540> signal<00:06:46.720> is<00:06:46.960> on<00:06:47.140> it<00:06:47.470> will<00:06:47.650> cycle

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
so when the signal is on it will cycle

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:56.479 
so when the signal is on it will cycle
the<00:06:48.370> index

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:56.489 

00:06:56.489 --> 00:07:09.079 

and<00:06:57.489> when<00:06:57.639> we<00:06:57.729> switch<00:06:57.939> it<00:06:58.089> again<00:07:06.839> and<00:07:07.839> again

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:09.089 
and when we switch it again and again

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:11.939 
and when we switch it again and again
now<00:07:10.089> it's<00:07:10.239> gone<00:07:10.330> to<00:07:10.509> empty<00:07:10.839> because<00:07:11.139> that's

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:11.949 
now it's gone to empty because that's

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:20.059 
now it's gone to empty because that's
the<00:07:12.249> next<00:07:12.489> slot<00:07:16.379> and<00:07:17.379> will<00:07:17.709> go<00:07:17.830> empty<00:07:18.009> again

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:20.069 
the next slot and will go empty again

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:30.389 
the next slot and will go empty again
and<00:07:21.449> then<00:07:22.449> back<00:07:22.659> to<00:07:22.839> water<00:07:28.739> so<00:07:29.739> one<00:07:30.009> last<00:07:30.219> thing

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:30.399 
and then back to water so one last thing

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:33.269 
and then back to water so one last thing
I<00:07:30.610> should<00:07:30.819> probably<00:07:31.449> mention<00:07:31.899> is<00:07:32.800> that<00:07:32.949> when

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:33.279 
I should probably mention is that when

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:36.149 
I should probably mention is that when
you<00:07:33.369> upgrade<00:07:33.489> this<00:07:33.849> mod<00:07:34.110> make<00:07:35.110> sure<00:07:35.319> to<00:07:35.619> remove

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:36.159 
you upgrade this mod make sure to remove

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:39.479 
you upgrade this mod make sure to remove
any<00:07:36.550> basic<00:07:37.119> upgrades<00:07:37.479> from<00:07:38.019> your<00:07:38.349> old<00:07:38.889> tanks

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:39.489 
any basic upgrades from your old tanks

00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:43.529 
any basic upgrades from your old tanks
and<00:07:40.889> also<00:07:41.889> to<00:07:41.949> delete<00:07:42.399> the<00:07:42.610> config<00:07:43.089> file<00:07:43.269> and

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:43.539 
and also to delete the config file and

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:45.540 
and also to delete the config file and
let<00:07:43.989> them<00:07:44.169> mod<00:07:44.349> generate<00:07:44.769> a<00:07:44.800> new<00:07:44.979> config<00:07:45.339> file

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550 
let them mod generate a new config file

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.279 
let them mod generate a new config file
which<00:07:46.479> means<00:07:46.719> you'll<00:07:46.959> have<00:07:47.079> to<00:07:48.959> remember<00:07:49.959> the

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:50.289 
which means you'll have to remember the

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:52.919 
which means you'll have to remember the
old<00:07:50.589> block<00:07:51.039> IDs<00:07:51.399> and<00:07:51.669> enter<00:07:52.329> them<00:07:52.479> into<00:07:52.719> the

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:52.929 
old block IDs and enter them into the

00:07:52.929 --> 00:07:56.489 
old block IDs and enter them into the
new<00:07:53.050> config<00:07:53.709> and<00:07:54.809> also<00:07:55.809> those<00:07:55.929> options<00:07:56.319> there

00:07:56.489 --> 00:07:56.499 
new config and also those options there

00:07:56.499 --> 00:07:59.399 
new config and also those options there
to<00:07:56.679> enable<00:07:57.099> or<00:07:57.550> disable<00:07:57.819> the<00:07:58.809> upgrades

00:07:59.399 --> 00:07:59.409 
to enable or disable the upgrades

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:06.239 
to enable or disable the upgrades
themselves<00:08:04.439> so<00:08:05.439> that's<00:08:05.740> most<00:08:05.979> of<00:08:06.189> the
