00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
pray he goes for the energy ball and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.029 
pray he goes for the energy ball and
it's<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.869> mutual<00:00:28.080> because<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.949> know

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
in the fluid in the field floating

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.299 
in the fluid in the field floating
around<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.050> ship<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.530> he<00:00:37.920> goes<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.219> another

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
around the ship and he goes for another

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.250 
around the ship and he goes for another
energy<00:00:38.579> ball<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.300> that's<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.660> he<00:00:39.690> has<00:00:39.960> I'm

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
energy ball and that's all he has I'm

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.720 
energy ball and that's all he has I'm
surprised<00:00:40.559> he<00:00:40.649> doesn't<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.040> psychic<00:00:41.520> and

then I go for the good ol Smackdown and
because<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.430> Esper<00:00:44.850> has<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> levitate

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
because I'm Esper has the levitate

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.180 
because I'm Esper has the levitate
ability<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.590> knocked<00:00:46.829> down<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
ability it's just knocked down to the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340 
ability it's just knocked down to the
ground<00:00:47.430> thus<00:00:48.149> making<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.629> suspect<00:00:49.020> able<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
ground thus making a suspect able to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.250 
ground thus making a suspect able to
earthquake<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.309> right<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.260> it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
earthquake as you see right now and it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.520 
earthquake as you see right now and it
doesn't<00:00:52.649> take<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.829> much<00:00:53.070> damage<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> he<00:00:55.410> goes

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
doesn't take that much damage so he goes

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
doesn't take that much damage so he goes
for<00:00:55.739> another<00:00:55.829> energy<00:00:56.100> ball<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.770> I<00:00:58.770> go<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
for another energy ball and I go for the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.389 
for another energy ball and I go for the
X<00:00:59.730> is<00:01:00.000> ur<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.390> cuz<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.350> stab<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.800> weakness<00:01:02.219> I'm

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
X is ur and cuz of stab and weakness I'm

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.619 
X is ur and cuz of stab and weakness I'm
able<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> knock<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.879> down<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.480> pretty

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
able to knock it down which is pretty

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
able to knock it down which is pretty
nice<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> quick<00:01:05.100> two<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.519> don't

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670

nice and I get a quick two but I don't
think<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.880> mattered<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> next<00:01:07.619> he<00:01:08.369> brings<00:01:08.670> in

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
think that mattered so next he brings in

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.070 
think that mattered so next he brings in
his<00:01:08.970> gyarados<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.810> he<00:01:09.990> gets<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> intimidate

you see right here after he gets the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730 
you see right here after he gets the
stuff<00:01:15.119> off<00:01:15.270> lounge<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.630> course<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> go

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
for the good old Smackdown after he

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.230 
for the good old Smackdown after he
misses<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.229> his<00:01:19.320> ice<00:01:19.500> bank<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.040> because<00:01:20.850> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
misses with his ice bank and because of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.450 
misses with his ice bank and because of
its<00:01:21.869> half<00:01:22.080> line<00:01:22.320> type<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.830> knocked<00:01:23.159> down<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
its half line type it's knocked down to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.550 
its half line type it's knocked down to
the<00:01:23.549> ground<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.570> don't<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.170> kind<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the ground and I don't get this kind of

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
the ground and I don't get this kind of
logic<00:01:25.890> how<00:01:26.250> does<00:01:26.430> girls<00:01:26.850> fly<00:01:27.210> um<00:01:27.540> I've<00:01:28.080> seen

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
logic how does girls fly um I've seen

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.480 
logic how does girls fly um I've seen
him<00:01:28.409> flowing<00:01:28.799> around<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.159> does<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.340> really

fly<00:01:29.880> around<00:01:30.000> leaving<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.840> comment<00:01:31.079> below<00:01:31.290> how

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
fly around leaving a comment below how

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.940 
fly around leaving a comment below how
you<00:01:31.979> think<00:01:32.100> girl<00:01:32.549> roses<00:01:32.820> fly<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> he<00:01:34.590> goes<00:01:34.740> for

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you think girl roses fly so he goes for

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.230 
you think girl roses fly so he goes for
the<00:01:35.009> hydro<00:01:35.340> pump<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.909> knocks<00:01:36.119> down

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the hydro pump and it knocks down

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.710 
the hydro pump and it knocks down
crustal<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.200> um<00:01:38.329> it's<00:01:39.329> super<00:01:39.659> effective

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
crustal because um it's super effective

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.590

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.130 
luckily for me he goes for the leaf
storm<00:02:50.460> because<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:51.390> double<00:02:51.690> resistant

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
storm because that's double resistant

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.760 
storm because that's double resistant
and<00:02:52.320> that's<00:02:53.280> nice<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.720> go<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.500> home

and that's nice so I go for the home

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.590 
and that's nice so I go for the home
cloth<00:02:56.070> because<00:02:56.280> Durant<00:02:56.760> has<00:02:56.940> hustle<00:02:57.420> an

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
cloth because Durant has hustle an

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.240 
cloth because Durant has hustle an
ability<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.080> raises<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.590> tech<00:02:58.800> but<00:02:59.010> lowers

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
ability that raises the tech but lowers

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.280 
ability that raises the tech but lowers
accuracy<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.880> home<00:03:00.390> clothes<00:03:00.630> bring<00:03:00.960> back<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
accuracy and home clothes bring back the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.990 
accuracy and home clothes bring back the
accuracy<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:02.070> he<00:03:02.280> goes<00:03:02.400> for<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.610> earthquake

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
accuracy and he goes for the earthquake

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.690 
accuracy and he goes for the earthquake
but<00:03:03.270> um<00:03:03.450> Durant<00:03:04.350> has<00:03:04.530> some<00:03:04.800> defense<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.490> it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
but um Durant has some defense and it

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.000 
but um Durant has some defense and it
lives<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.540> go<00:03:06.840> for<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.110> x-scissor<00:03:07.620> and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
lives and I go for the x-scissor and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.490 
lives and I go for the x-scissor and
it's<00:03:08.400> super<00:03:08.610> effective<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:09.270> thought<00:03:09.840> um<00:03:10.080> but

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
it's super effective I thought um but

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.620 
it's super effective I thought um but
type<00:03:10.770> moves<00:03:11.040> are<00:03:11.370> not<00:03:11.760> very<00:03:11.940> fertile<00:03:12.450> ground

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
type moves are not very fertile ground

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.020 
type moves are not very fertile ground
types<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.960> know<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.500> other<00:03:13.650> way<00:03:13.800> around<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.880> it

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
types I know the other way around but it

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.000 
types I know the other way around but it
hurts<00:03:15.480> grass<00:03:15.750> types<00:03:16.020> so<00:03:16.350> that's<00:03:16.620> pretty<00:03:16.770> cool

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
hurts grass types so that's pretty cool

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.890 
hurts grass types so that's pretty cool
I<00:03:17.250> don't<00:03:17.460> know<00:03:17.520> what<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.670> just<00:03:17.730> said<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.720> now<00:03:18.840> he

I don't know what I just said so now he

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.630 
I don't know what I just said so now he
brings<00:03:19.170> in<00:03:19.380> his<00:03:19.470> rapidash<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.310> go<00:03:20.430> for

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
brings in his rapidash and I go for

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.040
