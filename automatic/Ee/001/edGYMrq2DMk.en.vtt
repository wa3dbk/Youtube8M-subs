00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.570
 so or boys sitting we have a review on 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.779
 macbook retina 13 inches this base 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.020
 equipment cost about 1500 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:27.180
 dollars or so but proper 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.490
 bought him to work in music 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.520
 programs music editor audio and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.090
 which is why I thought that it is not 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.670
 quite possesses of course there 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.680
 filtration 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.640
 comedians modest 4 gigabyte operational 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.450
 memory hard drive or with it hard 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.539
 ssd disk 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.600
 when body and auto 20 8 gigabytes at very 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.649
 expose they will conduct tests 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.960
 do many guys 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.090
 download magic speedtest block do you watch 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.219
 how many megabytes is it very fast and 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.460
 me at the end of this photo and you can believe 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.560
 we have enough of it all happen 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.750
 instantly 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:15.479
 about the display retina display of course 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.799
 2012 is not only evidence that 1 cm 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.500
 certainly produced indelible 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.299
 impression 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.170
 now actually this post is about yours 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.470
 quality is not history really do not know 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.259
 what are people there so fall away from him 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.930
 just spend my all honest 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:38.119
 after windows there is nothing to compare with 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.979
 so no matter how I go to no 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.369
 it turned out good and color rendition 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.759
 you can work in the field photos 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:51.560
 conditions of external work with video 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.770
 calm though in principle for training 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.690
 k for these moments in general that is not 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.070
 quite comfortable and but again 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.680
 subjectively execute here he is a laptop 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.800
 and macbook is very easy one and a half 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.709
 a kilogram inside costs 6 batteries 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.440
 which provide about 12 and about 12 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.760
 ten o'clock reading mode from if there 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.520
 looks like turn off this backlight 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.790
 the keyboard is there clearly I don't even know 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.280
 how much does it affect 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.530
 reality could sit out all day 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.020
 This MacBooks listening to music I watch videos 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.930
 in the toilet with the included wi-fay he 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.420
 works a lot that is principle i 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.540
 I do n't even know why I need a macbook and if 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.910
 leave out could could kind of life there might 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.910
 be 12 hours offline but on 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:48.020
 I show the screen right now that you can 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.500
 also play say such a moment that 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.019
 macbook basically works great with 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.530
 programs this comment which i 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.860
 Took for sure there logic pro file cad 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.080
 many other permissibility run that one 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.450
 same here maynkravt any easier 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.280
 another game or even google chrome and i 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.209
 very much fussed that he is heated 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.549
 the fluff beat mercilessly spends electrons 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.720
 it 's actually he blows up just from 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.450
 all the toys she's on 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.310
 and overheat after hear from i'm on 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.430
 I really can beech 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:27.470
 it is the most economical highest quality 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:30.850
 and most probably the quiet readiness who in 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:35.140
 It is of course one of the easiest and 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.610
 at least we were killed did not have the most but 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.829
 let's say such 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.079
 time and meeting new windows 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.250
 letters on windows 8 but honestly not 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.910
 work less 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.030
 Perhaps more resolution is heated 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.030
 final 10 watts already 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.640

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.980
 I do not remember how we guys than 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.990
 a good thing if used for what 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.090
 many of course uses it for 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.670
 something like that for music proper 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.100
