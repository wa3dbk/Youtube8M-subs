for<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.740> video<00:00:02.070> we're<00:00:02.340> gonna<00:00:02.429> do<00:00:02.700> a

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
for this video we're gonna do a

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.269 
for this video we're gonna do a
glissando<00:00:03.389> scale<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.259> this<00:00:04.440> Lassonde<00:00:05.009> scale

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
glissando scale and this Lassonde scale

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.629 
glissando scale and this Lassonde scale
is<00:00:05.430> very<00:00:05.520> very<00:00:06.210> good<00:00:06.569> for<00:00:07.160> working<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
is very very good for working on the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.410 
is very very good for working on the
middle<00:00:08.849> ground<00:00:09.090> between<00:00:09.330> doing<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.620> normal<00:00:11.420> one

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
middle ground between doing a normal one

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.799 
middle ground between doing a normal one
octave<00:00:12.809> scale<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:14.190> string<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.820> doing<00:00:15.719> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
octave scale on one string and doing a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.349 
octave scale on one string and doing a
one-finger<00:00:16.410> scale<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:17.310> string<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.119> only

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
one-finger scale on one string the only

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.720 
one-finger scale on one string the only
difference<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.109> from<00:00:20.010> note<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.520> note

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
difference is is that from note to note

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.670 
difference is is that from note to note
we're<00:00:21.090> actually<00:00:21.240> going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.720> slide<00:00:22.230> our<00:00:22.650> finger

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
we're actually going to slide our finger

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.009 
we're actually going to slide our finger
so<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.970> hear<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.300> pitch<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.750> played

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
so that we can hear the pitch we played

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.679 
so that we can hear the pitch we played
and<00:00:25.320> hear<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> next<00:00:26.340> pitch<00:00:26.580> okay

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
and hear the next pitch okay

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.390 
and hear the next pitch okay
so<00:00:28.109> we're<00:00:28.230> going<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.380> start<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.710> open<00:00:29.039> G<00:00:29.220> I'm

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
so we're going to start with open G I'm

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.220 
so we're going to start with open G I'm
going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> do<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> G<00:00:30.060> major<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.630> because<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> lot

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
going to do a G major one because a lot

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.770 
going to do a G major one because a lot
of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.650> videos<00:00:32.250> are<00:00:32.430> G<00:00:32.669> major<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.630> going

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
of the videos are G major so I'm going

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
of the videos are G major so I'm going
to<00:00:33.809> show<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.079> G<00:00:34.440> major<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.980> we're<00:00:35.070> gonna<00:00:35.190> start

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to show you G major so we're gonna start

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.920 
to show you G major so we're gonna start
with<00:00:35.670> G<00:00:35.820> major<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.239> we're<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:36.510> started

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
with G major but we're actually started

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.260 
with G major but we're actually started
with<00:00:37.079> our<00:00:37.110> finger<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> nut<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.120> can

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
with our finger up at the nut so we can

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
with our finger up at the nut so we can
slide<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.870> G<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.500> get<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:42.530> we're<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.649> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
slide on G to get to a we're going to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.490 
slide on G to get to a we're going to
play<00:00:44.010> G<00:00:44.250> again<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.910> slide

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.900 

play<00:00:48.100> a<00:00:48.280> again<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:48.850> slide

play B again and slide okay we're going

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.380 
play B again and slide okay we're going
to<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.289> all<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.500> way<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.219> harmonic<00:00:56.789> it's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
to go all the way up to harmonic it's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.729 
to go all the way up to harmonic it's
all<00:00:57.660> going<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.839> be<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.320> finger<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
all going to be with one finger and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
all going to be with one finger and
you're<00:00:58.920> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> move<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.940> now

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you're going to move all the way up now

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.410 
you're going to move all the way up now
the<00:01:00.570> issue<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.969> transitioning<00:01:02.969> from<00:01:03.089> one

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the issue is is transitioning from one

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.630 
the issue is is transitioning from one
note<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:03.839> next<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:05.190> I<00:01:05.220> want<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
note to the next and what I want you to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.130 
note to the next and what I want you to
do<00:01:05.729> isn't<00:01:05.909> what<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> think<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.509> your<00:01:06.630> hand<00:01:06.960> as

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
do isn't what you think of your hand as

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.370 
do isn't what you think of your hand as
a<00:01:07.170> circle<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.630> every<00:01:09.630> time<00:01:09.899> you<00:01:10.049> create<00:01:10.289> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
a circle and every time you create a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.730 
a circle and every time you create a
circle<00:01:10.979> you're<00:01:11.850> moving<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.899> watch<00:01:13.289> my<00:01:13.500> hand

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
circle you're moving so watch my hand

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.289 
circle you're moving so watch my hand
again<00:01:13.979> we're<00:01:14.159> gonna<00:01:14.220> make<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> circle<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> when

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
again we're gonna make a circle and when

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.649 
again we're gonna make a circle and when
it<00:01:15.390> comes<00:01:15.479> down<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:16.590> hand<00:01:17.009> slides<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.420> we're

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it comes down my hand slides and we're

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.149 
it comes down my hand slides and we're
gonna<00:01:18.750> make<00:01:18.899> a<00:01:18.930> loop<00:01:19.170> again<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.740> our<00:01:19.830> hand

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
gonna make a loop again and our hand

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.430 
gonna make a loop again and our hand
slides<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.570> we're<00:01:21.659> gonna<00:01:21.750> make<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> loop<00:01:22.170> again

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
slides and we're gonna make a loop again

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.520 
slides and we're gonna make a loop again
and<00:01:22.500> our<00:01:22.710> hand<00:01:22.979> slides<00:01:23.429> work<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.899> until

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and our hand slides work with that until

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.950 
and our hand slides work with that until
you<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.069> the<00:01:26.190> point<00:01:26.460> where<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
you get to the point where you can do it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.450 
you get to the point where you can do it
with<00:01:28.770> little<00:01:29.009> tiny<00:01:29.310> motions<00:01:29.789> so<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:35.130> only

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
with little tiny motions so and only

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.580 
with little tiny motions so and only
moving<00:01:35.819> it<00:01:35.940> when<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.210> need<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:37.050> start<00:01:37.409> off

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
moving it when you need to but start off

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.760 
moving it when you need to but start off
making<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.580> big<00:01:38.759> loop<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.240> sliding<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.409> making

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
making a big loop and sliding and making

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.399 
making a big loop and sliding and making
a<00:01:40.860> big<00:01:41.009> loop<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> sliding<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.450> that'll<00:01:43.200> help

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
a big loop and sliding and that'll help

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.680 
a big loop and sliding and that'll help
and<00:01:44.039> now<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> need<00:01:44.429> to<00:01:44.580> know<00:01:44.789> whether<00:01:45.479> you're

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
and now you need to know whether you're

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.499 
and now you need to know whether you're
gonna<00:01:45.810> move<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.200> whole<00:01:46.380> step<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.190> from<00:01:47.640> open<00:01:48.000> 2<00:01:48.240> 1

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
gonna move a whole step so from open 2 1

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.740 
gonna move a whole step so from open 2 1
1<00:01:49.170> 2<00:01:49.619> 2<00:01:50.179> so<00:01:51.179> you're<00:01:51.360> looking<00:01:51.479> at<00:01:51.979> G<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.220> A<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
1 2 2 so you're looking at G to A and a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.679 
1 2 2 so you're looking at G to A and a
to<00:01:54.810> B<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.490> you're<00:01:56.640> moving<00:01:56.759> from<00:01:56.939> B<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.329> C

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
to B or if you're moving from B to C

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.569 
to B or if you're moving from B to C
where<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.439> only<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.770> half<00:01:58.979> step<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.310> you

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
where you only have a half step so you

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.730 
where you only have a half step so you
need<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.000> know<00:02:00.210> those<00:02:00.450> concepts<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.590> able

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
need to know those concepts and be able

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.920 
need to know those concepts and be able
to<00:02:01.799> know<00:02:02.070> how<00:02:02.280> far<00:02:02.460> you're<00:02:02.640> moving<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.659> I'm

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
to know how far you're moving so I'm

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.600 
to know how far you're moving so I'm
gonna<00:02:04.020> do<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> whole<00:02:04.530> scale<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.070> entirety

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
gonna do the whole scale and entirety

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:37.850 
gonna do the whole scale and entirety
now<00:02:05.789> so<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.390> hear<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.190 

now<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.069> way<00:02:39.190> back<00:02:39.490> you're<00:02:40.420> gonna<00:02:40.540> do<00:02:40.990> the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
now on the way back you're gonna do the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.410 
now on the way back you're gonna do the
same<00:02:41.620> thing<00:02:41.950> but<00:02:42.190> as<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.850> make<00:02:43.030> your<00:02:43.060> loop

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
same thing but as you make your loop

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.160 
same thing but as you make your loop
your<00:02:43.660> loop<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:43.959> gonna<00:02:44.170> go<00:02:44.340> backwards<00:02:45.340> and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
your loop is gonna go backwards and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.870 
your loop is gonna go backwards and
backwards<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.350> your<00:02:47.500> forwards<00:02:48.160> on<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.490> way<00:02:48.610> up

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
backwards so your forwards on the way up

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.630 
backwards so your forwards on the way up
and<00:02:49.650> backwards<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.980> way<00:02:51.130> down

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
and backwards on the way down

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.460 
and backwards on the way down
okay<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.540> then<00:02:52.660> when<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.870> get<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.200> upper

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
okay and then when you get to the upper

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.800 
okay and then when you get to the upper
positions<00:02:53.920> if<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.190> notice<00:02:54.550> once<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.510> get<00:02:55.660> to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
positions if you notice once you get to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.220 
positions if you notice once you get to
be<00:02:56.459> alright<00:02:57.459> once<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.760> get<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.239> e<00:02:58.270> sorry<00:02:59.080> on

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
be alright once you get to e sorry on

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.170 
be alright once you get to e sorry on
the<00:02:59.319> g-string<00:02:59.530> then<00:03:00.520> when<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.819> get<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.150> e

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
the g-string then when you get to e

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.479 
the g-string then when you get to e
you're<00:03:01.600> going<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.810> slide<00:03:02.230> up<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.739> slide<00:03:03.250> your

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
instrument for the f-sharp and for the G

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.690 
instrument for the f-sharp and for the G
and<00:03:09.400> then<00:03:09.730> back<00:03:09.940> on<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.180> f-sharp<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.930> back<00:03:11.830> on

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
and then back on the f-sharp and back on

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.259 
and then back on the f-sharp and back on
the<00:03:13.570> E<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.959> back<00:03:14.830> on<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:15.970> that<00:03:16.120> your

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
hands always do in that circular motion

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.310 
hands always do in that circular motion
so<00:03:18.790> if<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:18.940> have<00:03:19.060> questions<00:03:19.480> feel<00:03:20.110> free<00:03:20.170> to
