and<00:00:00.630> axial<00:00:01.140> came<00:00:01.500> on<00:00:01.879> when<00:00:02.879> every<00:00:03.120> burger<00:00:03.270> is

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
and axial came on when every burger is

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.329 
and axial came on when every burger is
lying<00:00:03.750> on<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.020> ground<00:00:04.140> on<00:00:04.650> one<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:04.920> his<00:00:05.130> face

if you wanna a similarly we draw the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.440 
if you wanna a similarly we draw the
line<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.869> opposite<00:00:31.230> side<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
line on the opposite side we see this

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.090 
line on the opposite side we see this
anywhere<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:34.050> take<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> same<00:00:34.590> don't<00:00:34.860> even

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
anywhere we take the same don't even

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.880 
anywhere we take the same don't even
come<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.090> Kalpana<00:00:36.630> will<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.680> very

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
come here and we Kalpana will be very

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.490 
come here and we Kalpana will be very
from<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:39.000> other<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.230> there

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
from here we can other are we get there

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.529 
from here we can other are we get there
why<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> when<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.450> buy<00:00:42.600> said<00:00:42.840> these<00:00:43.079> lines<00:00:44.539> we

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
why a so when we buy said these lines we

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.569 
why a so when we buy said these lines we
get<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.410> center<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.460> petal<00:00:47.850> shape<00:00:48.360> so

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
get the center of the petal shape so

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.029 
get the center of the petal shape so
when<00:00:50.579> every<00:00:50.850> premiere<00:00:51.270> looks<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.440> in

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
when every premiere looks like this in

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.069 
when every premiere looks like this in
the<00:00:53.190> Tokyo<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.660> five<00:00:55.969> equal<00:00:57.079> triangles

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the Tokyo you have five equal triangles

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.950 
the Tokyo you have five equal triangles
at<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> top<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.270> now<00:01:00.390> when<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.629> believe

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
at the top you so now when you believe

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.210 
at the top you so now when you believe
this<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.129> bottom<00:01:02.879> line<00:01:03.090> base<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.220> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
this you get the bottom line base and to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.789 
this you get the bottom line base and to
the<00:01:05.400> axis<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.180> take<00:01:06.390> system<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.380> height

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the axis you can take system on height

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.270 
the axis you can take system on height
and<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.760> oxygen<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.200> join<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.680> even

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and then oxygen you can join this even

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.090 
and then oxygen you can join this even
getting<00:01:11.520> there<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:12.659> take<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.650> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
getting there we take it in this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.270 
getting there we take it in this
question<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.080> put<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> sign<00:01:17.100> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
question now you have to put the sign of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.070 
question now you have to put the sign of
the<00:01:17.369> pentagram<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> dog<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.630> therefore

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the pentagram of the dog so therefore

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.660 
the pentagram of the dog so therefore
make<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.890> side<00:01:20.159> DC<00:01:20.939> DC<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> ground<00:01:22.740> here

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
make this side DC DC on the ground here

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.289 
make this side DC DC on the ground here
we<00:01:23.850> draw<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> axis<00:01:24.960> DVD<00:01:25.860> HD<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.150> for

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
we draw the axis DVD HD so that for

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.890 
we draw the axis DVD HD so that for
obviously<00:01:27.720> over<00:01:27.930> draw<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> base<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.939> cd-rom

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
obviously over draw the base so cd-rom

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:40.609 
obviously over draw the base so cd-rom
is<00:01:31.079> speedy<00:01:31.530> line<00:01:32.750> draw<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.229> skinny<00:01:34.680> line

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.499 

place<00:01:41.619> this<00:01:42.490> baseline<00:01:43.390> on<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:44.049> 60<00:01:44.439> degree<00:01:45.509> so

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
place this baseline on the 60 degree so

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.990 
place this baseline on the 60 degree so
the<00:01:47.140> story<00:01:47.409> equation<00:01:47.950> is<00:01:48.100> C<00:01:49.030> 1<00:01:49.270> -<00:01:49.450> even<00:01:50.290> -<00:01:50.470> and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
then in this j1 - this is this distance

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.029 
then in this j1 - this is this distance
locate<00:01:59.909> b1<00:02:00.909> -<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.500> even<00:02:02.500> -<00:02:04.470> again<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.890> can

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
locate b1 - and even - again you can

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.479 
locate b1 - and even - again you can
draw<00:02:06.250> there<00:02:06.549> an<00:02:06.610> axis<00:02:07.590> remember<00:02:08.590> for<00:02:09.459> a
