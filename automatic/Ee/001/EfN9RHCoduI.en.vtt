00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello viewers of my channel after 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.529
 long absence on the channel I am again 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.540
 back with a new review all want 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.790
 wish happy new year and merry christmas 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.940
 and today we will talk with you about 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.800
 low-frequency speakers 25 Gdn 4 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.859
 this cinema is a theater speaker 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.859
 impressive size and weight 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.330
 produced in Samarkand at the factory on 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.859
 mass production of this speaker 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.560
 started back in 1961 and 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.890
 it was produced before the early 90's range 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.630
 reproducible frequencies from 60 hertz to 5 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.070
 kHz 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.649
 16 dcd uneven sneeze 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.309
 sensitivity from 93 to ninety five 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.260
 decibel 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.129
 depending on the year of manufacture and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.980
 modifications resistance is 15 meters but it 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.620
 the passport details of the fact here are the 13th and 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.770
 By the way such an indicator in many movies 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.359
 papal speakers for some reason nominal 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.629
 power 15 watts maximum 25 watts 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:06.960
 the resonant frequency also fluctuated here 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:10.619
 55 hertz diameter of the speaker is 38 centimeters 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.189
 weight 8 kilogram 700 grams diffuser out 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.110

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.119
 suspension corrugated one-piece with 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.909

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.930
 other movie papal speakers diffuser 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.549
 not only glued in the basket but also 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.869
 pressed against metal plates which 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.329
 put bolted on 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.329
 basket now see basket 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 here is our basket 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.619
 steel steel 2 millimeters thick and 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.540
 cobalt magnet others no any 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.000
 applied but later 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.420
 basket modifications made cast 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.509
 with additional stiffeners 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.000
 terminals are screw but by the way not very 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.869
 comfortable as the wire needs to be wound on 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.710
 bolt inside 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.110
 and then just tighten the terminals now 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.929
 screw is much more convenient with a hole 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.959
 these speakers were installed for the wire 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.270
 cinema theater acoustics in 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:21.000
 pair with hands 118 120 and 122 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.310
 the acoustics were impressive in size so 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.950
 that adapting it for the house was very 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.680
 hard and at least the factory buildings had 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.530
 internal volume within 250 liters 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.050
 then the measurement of the speakers indicates that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.260
 for all their potential can be 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.540
 not less than 400 liters but not translated 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.700
 the heroes in Russia are brave 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.980
 housekeepers who feed on them 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.820
 do something I do not know what kind of design 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.940
 design for them is most successful on 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.440
 my opinion it will be a closed box he 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.340
 meets phase inverter shields and 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.530
 Horn systems reviews you sound them 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.900
 the most different so there is definitely 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.180
 can not say 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.100
 personally he listened to such a speaker shield not 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.739
 although it was quite large 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.799
 if I'm not mistaken then meter twenty on 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.220
 meter eighty full sound i 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.920
 there did not feel he did not give no pressure no 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.250
 the depths of the speaker itself are good 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.160
 the base is not nearly all the average range it 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.440
 pretty good draws images and 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.950
 working on small details but looking at 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.370
 this size you want more meaty and 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.829
 soft low bass but here it is not to 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.530
 Unfortunately, its full potential is possible. 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.340
 bottoms can open to us 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.840
 acoustic design or trumpet 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.000
 but it's hard to imagine the size 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.860
 such a system who knows whether to risk 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.079
 some homemade people do 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.450
 building such huge buildings 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.090
 although I think your project will be 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.390
 meaningless because the room is 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.040
 bushes should be a decent size 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.940
 who ever tried to do acoustics on 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.269
 432 will say that in rooms for 20-25 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.000
 square meters it doesn't sound either 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.959
 what acoustic design and this 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.750
 only at 12 inches here 15 well, in principle 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.739
 I will not think much about whether or 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.330
 no adapt them to don 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.410
 it is clear that this speaker was designed 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.010
 for a specific purpose 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.530
 sound theaters and halls and clubs 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.420
 I think better and Mutomi stay well, and we 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.190
 in turn met one more 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.530
 interesting dynamics of the Soviet 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.720
 production so thank you all for 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.610
