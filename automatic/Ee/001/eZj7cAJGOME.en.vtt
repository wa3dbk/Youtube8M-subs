00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.480
 whine people you know yes determined karl 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.730
 softpack they often have a lot 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.240
 Cool deals here and I had back then 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.490
 also already bought so when I the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 mac then new touchscreen fled with 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.890
 was there and parallels and so on 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.010
 and now again a deal for $ 49 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.670
 that's 37 euros and 14 cents at the time 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.390
 with actually a price of 310 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.690
 dollar 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.149
 So what do we have in there so we 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.100
 First, yes, the tactics that's well 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.079
 a program what error in the system 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.160
 to recognize and to eliminate 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.309
 before they are somehow tragic 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.350
 then we will have pathfinder sixx 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.260
 you definitely know the program as mac 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.879
 user already exists in the mac app store 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.530
 for example, allow you tabs in the enemy 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.940
 to make and so easily the enemies 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.480
 improve as it supposed to be 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.510
 should then we have textexpander 4 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.460
 this is a program I totally 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 just for example shortcuts for 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.100
 can add certain words or 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.619
 also correct the autocorrection manually 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.180
 can add new words as me can 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.860
 however, for example, is the winner of 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.960
 2010 then have mad world cheese award 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.320
 we with haider that with what a program 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.939
 I data and so yes photos photos 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.630
 protect anything with password 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.250
 can 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.900
 if you have a mac for example now 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.939
 not only used alone but with 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.229
 the family or so you want specific 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.210
 Just avoid things that me 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.110
 see any people then that goes 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.350
 with this program 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.399
 then we have drops and that's one 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.750
 program with which I well shortcuts 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.670
 So I can create so to speak 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.590
 then just go to the side of 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.659
 screen and then come there like that 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.070
 little pop up window out there I can 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.509
 for example, very simple files in 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.619
 to grab some particular folder there 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.270
 I have to open up not only 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.009
 but I just go to the side of you 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.509
 this prefabricated folder in it and 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.659
 can just put that in there 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.180
 or I can do something with it very quickly 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.009
 facebook flickr twitter do not load any 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.420
 problem simply the data there 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.670
 so you can easily this 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.370
 open programs then we rather have 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.260
 server 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.459
 knows her determined many of you 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.720
 already existed 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.950
 different test versions and you can 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.200
 yes already a whole while buy 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.090
 this is a program that allows you 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.890
 or mac as yes, so to speak 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.019
 to use something so you can 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.000
 then music and videos at your extreme 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.739
 and that is a small window is on 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.150
 of course very useful for screencast 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.760
 but even if you are for example now 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.530
 from anyone wants to play music and 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.879
 the plant is coupled to the mac can 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.890
 i just do that i stopped 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.090
 the thing and can ipod on my iphone 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.370
 then simply select touch and ipad 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.620
 is that here as it were for my sake 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.940
 apple tv or so in the sense of one 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.459
 apple tv is detected and can do that 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.030
 easy on the makeup play then 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.230
