just share because it's getting busier
and<00:01:28.270> it's<00:01:28.479> only<00:01:28.630> gonna<00:01:28.840> get<00:01:28.960> more<00:01:29.050> busy<00:01:29.560> the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
and it's only gonna get more busy the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.029 
and it's only gonna get more busy the
the<00:01:30.460> two<00:01:30.640> forms<00:01:30.940> of<00:01:31.030> writing<00:01:31.270> need<00:01:31.660> to<00:01:31.810> be

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
the two forms of writing need to be

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.600 
the two forms of writing need to be
allocated<00:01:33.039> to<00:01:33.729> different<00:01:34.240> spots<00:01:34.539> which<00:01:34.990> is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
allocated to different spots which is

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.999 
allocated to different spots which is
unfortunate<00:01:36.610> but<00:01:37.539> I<00:01:37.780> think<00:01:38.110> that's<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.680> fact

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
unfortunate but I think that's the fact

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.650 
unfortunate but I think that's the fact
in<00:01:39.250> because<00:01:40.200> formal<00:01:41.200> division<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.789> activities

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
in because formal division of activities

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.690 
in because formal division of activities
is<00:01:44.080> sort<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.649> rare<00:01:44.890> thing<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.280> surfing

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
is sort of a rare thing and surfing

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.210 
is sort of a rare thing and surfing
because<00:01:45.880> it's<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.179> sort<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.479> unstructured

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
because it's the sort of unstructured

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.990 
because it's the sort of unstructured
activity<00:01:48.220> there's<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.090> lot<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.600> angst<00:01:50.200> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
activity there's a lot of angst and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.930 
activity there's a lot of angst and
debate<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.470> stuff<00:01:53.470> going<00:01:53.860> on<00:01:53.979> around<00:01:54.039> that<00:01:54.520> I

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
area where you know you can't pass the

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.790 
area where you know you can't pass the
line<00:02:15.630> trestles<00:02:16.630> there<00:02:17.050> they're<00:02:17.260> regulating

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
line trestles there they're regulating

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800 
line trestles there they're regulating
too<00:02:17.980> initially<00:02:18.940> they<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.239> thought<00:02:19.420> maybe<00:02:19.660> it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
too initially they just thought maybe it

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.780 
too initially they just thought maybe it
was<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.930> fad<00:02:20.260> wasn't<00:02:20.980> gonna<00:02:21.069> stick<00:02:21.400> around<00:02:21.520> very

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
was a fad wasn't gonna stick around very

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.850 
was a fad wasn't gonna stick around very
long<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.510> they<00:02:22.569> just<00:02:22.630> look<00:02:22.930> for<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.470> quick

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
long and they just look for a quick

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.350 
long and they just look for a quick
answer<00:02:24.099> so<00:02:24.430> they<00:02:24.550> threw<00:02:24.880> us<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.150> designated

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
answer so they threw us in a designated

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.110 
answer so they threw us in a designated
area<00:02:25.810> but<00:02:26.140> with<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.099> sport<00:02:27.370> growing<00:02:27.849> and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
area but with the sport growing and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.540 
area but with the sport growing and
people<00:02:28.959> pushing<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.560> limits<00:02:29.890> as<00:02:30.010> far<00:02:30.040> as<00:02:30.250> what

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
people pushing the limits as far as what

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.970 
people pushing the limits as far as what
you<00:02:30.640> can<00:02:30.790> surf<00:02:31.030> in<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:32.170> boards<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.650> get<00:02:32.770> much

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
you can surf in the boards you get much

you can surf in the boards you get much
smaller<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:34.390> think<00:02:34.959> you'll<00:02:35.080> see<00:02:35.230> more<00:02:35.260> spots

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
smaller I think you'll see more spots

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.400 
smaller I think you'll see more spots
opening<00:02:36.069> up<00:02:36.190> definitely<00:02:37.000> but<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:37.959> do<00:02:38.080> have<00:02:38.379> a
