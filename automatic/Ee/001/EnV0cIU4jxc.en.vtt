actually brought to you by Sonic Team
and<00:00:19.520> imps<00:00:19.849> but<00:00:20.509> that's<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:21.320> idea<00:00:21.770> of<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.070> hack

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
and imps but that's the idea of the hack

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.710 
and imps but that's the idea of the hack
it's<00:00:23.060> Sonic<00:00:24.050> 2<00:00:24.289> Dimps<00:00:25.250> edition<00:00:25.760> now<00:00:26.300> some

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
it's Sonic 2 Dimps edition now some

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.540 
it's Sonic 2 Dimps edition now some
people<00:00:27.050> would<00:00:27.199> argue<00:00:27.230> that<00:00:27.590> dimps<00:00:28.189> hasn't

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
people would argue that dimps hasn't

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.640 
people would argue that dimps hasn't
exactly<00:00:28.789> been<00:00:29.029> the<00:00:29.390> best<00:00:29.420> influence<00:00:30.350> in<00:00:30.529> the

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
exactly been the best influence in the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.589 
exactly been the best influence in the
sonic<00:00:30.949> franchise<00:00:31.390> although<00:00:32.390> if<00:00:32.480> you're

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
sonic franchise although if you're

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.049 
sonic franchise although if you're
anything<00:00:32.840> like<00:00:33.140> me<00:00:33.199> I<00:00:33.769> don't<00:00:34.129> mind<00:00:34.370> so<00:00:34.580> much<00:00:34.610> I

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
anything like me I don't mind so much I

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.090 
anything like me I don't mind so much I
did<00:00:35.300> like<00:00:35.480> Rush<00:00:35.780> and<00:00:36.110> I<00:00:36.320> did<00:00:36.530> like<00:00:36.680> advance

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
did like Rush and I did like advance

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.889 
did like Rush and I did like advance
although<00:00:37.580> I<00:00:37.610> didn't<00:00:37.940> like<00:00:38.090> advance<00:00:38.420> 2<00:00:38.690> &amp;<00:00:38.840> 3

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
although I didn't like advance 2 &amp; 3

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.770 
although I didn't like advance 2 &amp; 3
I'll<00:00:39.469> say<00:00:39.800> that<00:00:39.980> much<00:00:40.160> but<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.180> idea<00:00:41.540> of<00:00:41.630> this

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
I'll say that much but the idea of this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.990 
I'll say that much but the idea of this
hack<00:00:42.050> is<00:00:42.230> to<00:00:42.530> make<00:00:42.680> fun<00:00:42.950> of<00:00:42.980> Dempsey's<00:00:43.579> current

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
hack is to make fun of Dempsey's current

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.299 
hack is to make fun of Dempsey's current
work<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.379> features<00:00:45.770> you'll<00:00:45.920> see<00:00:46.129> in<00:00:46.280> here

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
work so the features you'll see in here

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.810 
work so the features you'll see in here
range<00:00:46.790> from<00:00:47.260> misuse<00:00:48.260> sound<00:00:48.710> effects<00:00:49.280> much

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
range from misuse sound effects much

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.910 
range from misuse sound effects much
like<00:00:50.090> in<00:00:50.239> Sonic<00:00:50.539> for<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.050> Spin<00:00:51.410> Dash<00:00:51.440> sound

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
like in Sonic for the Spin Dash sound

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.470 
like in Sonic for the Spin Dash sound
effects<00:00:52.309> are<00:00:52.399> kind<00:00:52.610> of<00:00:52.670> muddled<00:00:53.090> up<00:00:53.180> a<00:00:53.300> little

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
effects are kind of muddled up a little

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.410 
effects are kind of muddled up a little
bit<00:00:53.690> music<00:00:54.469> sounding<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.190> bit<00:00:55.219> weird<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:56.000> have

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
bit music sounding a bit weird I have

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.080 
bit music sounding a bit weird I have
noticed<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.199> also<00:00:58.070> speed<00:00:58.550> boosters

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
noticed and also speed boosters

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.299 
noticed and also speed boosters
everywhere<00:00:59.870> this<00:01:00.199> is<00:01:00.440> one<00:01:00.770> thing<00:01:01.039> I'll<00:01:01.280> agree

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
everywhere this is one thing I'll agree

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.479 
everywhere this is one thing I'll agree
on<00:01:01.969> with<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.930> hold<00:01:03.140> imps<00:01:03.559> thing<00:01:03.800> is<00:01:04.009> that<00:01:04.339> they

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
on with the hold imps thing is that they

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.330 
on with the hold imps thing is that they
do<00:01:04.550> love<00:01:04.970> their<00:01:05.210> speed<00:01:05.600> boosters<00:01:06.140> but<00:01:07.130> not

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
do love their speed boosters but not

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.000 
do love their speed boosters but not

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
as a homing attack that you have to be

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.380 
as a homing attack that you have to be

quotation<00:01:25.549> marks<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:27.350> hack<00:01:27.619> isn't<00:01:28.100> much

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
quotation marks this hack isn't much

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.160 
quotation marks this hack isn't much
different<00:01:28.820> from<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.150> original<00:01:29.360> Sonic<00:01:29.960> 2

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
have ever come out of anything ever a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.010 
have ever come out of anything ever a
long<00:01:58.290> time<00:01:58.880> playing<00:01:59.880> through<00:02:00.000> Sonic<00:02:00.600> 2<00:02:00.810> with

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
long time playing through Sonic 2 with

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.690 
long time playing through Sonic 2 with
all<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.260> speed<00:02:01.590> boosters<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.310> physics

all the speed boosters and the physics

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.330 
all the speed boosters and the physics
changed<00:02:03.150> ever<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.780> slightly<00:02:04.200> even<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.220> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
changed ever so slightly even with the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.700 
changed ever so slightly even with the
music<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.030> sound<00:02:06.480> effects<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.200> really

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
music and the sound effects is really

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.490 
music and the sound effects is really
really<00:02:07.980> off-putting<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.270> weird<00:02:09.600> it's<00:02:10.229> kind

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
really off-putting and weird it's kind

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.650 
really off-putting and weird it's kind
of<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.710> a<00:02:10.740> whole<00:02:11.040> new<00:02:11.340> experience<00:02:12.240> so<00:02:12.420> it's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
of like a whole new experience so it's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.720 
of like a whole new experience so it's
worth<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.080> try<00:02:13.410> at<00:02:13.620> least<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.130> laugh<00:02:14.400> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
worth a try at least for a laugh and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.940 
worth a try at least for a laugh and
especially<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.990> get<00:02:16.140> later<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
especially as you get later on in the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.040 
especially as you get later on in the
levels<00:02:17.310> seeing<00:02:18.210> that<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> physics<00:02:18.930> have

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
levels seeing that the physics have

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.390 
levels seeing that the physics have
changed<00:02:19.410> slightly<00:02:19.560> becomes<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.190> lot<00:02:20.370> more

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
changed slightly becomes a lot more

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.950 
changed slightly becomes a lot more
apparent<00:02:21.060> when<00:02:21.240> there<00:02:21.390> are<00:02:21.480> certain<00:02:21.810> things

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
apparent when there are certain things

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.870 
apparent when there are certain things
you<00:02:22.140> could<00:02:22.320> originally<00:02:22.740> do<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.190> Sonic<00:02:23.490> 2<00:02:23.670> that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
you could originally do in Sonic 2 that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.480 
you could originally do in Sonic 2 that
you<00:02:23.910> can't<00:02:24.270> do<00:02:24.510> here<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.140> good<00:02:25.680> example<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.340> in

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
you can't do here a good example is in

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.370 
you can't do here a good example is in
the<00:02:26.580> aquatic<00:02:26.850> ruin<00:02:27.360> zone<00:02:27.630> when<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.020> try<00:02:28.260> and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
the aquatic ruin zone when you try and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.170 
the aquatic ruin zone when you try and
destroy<00:02:28.800> those<00:02:29.040> pillars<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.640> rise<00:02:29.820> up<00:02:30.000> from

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
destroy those pillars that rise up from

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.840 
destroy those pillars that rise up from
the<00:02:30.270> floor<00:02:30.570> ah<00:02:31.880> can't<00:02:32.880> reach<00:02:33.660> too<00:02:34.470> tall<00:02:35.130> can't

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
the floor ah can't reach too tall can't

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.660 
the floor ah can't reach too tall can't
jump<00:02:36.270> high<00:02:36.510> enough<00:02:37.070> it's<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.280> same<00:02:38.490> with

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
jump high enough it's the same with

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.820 
jump high enough it's the same with
every<00:02:39.060> single<00:02:39.270> one<00:02:39.570> it's<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:40.080> just<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.560> one

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
every single one it's not just that one

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.500 
every single one it's not just that one
so<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.250> only<00:02:41.400> way<00:02:41.610> you're<00:02:41.760> going<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.060> get<00:02:42.210> past

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
so the only way you're going to get past

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.240 
so the only way you're going to get past
them<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.960> to<00:02:43.110> jump<00:02:43.350> over<00:02:43.650> them<00:02:43.800> somehow<00:02:44.100> but

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
them is to jump over them somehow but

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.760 
them is to jump over them somehow but
thankfully<00:02:45.000> most<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.960> areas<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.590> do

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
thankfully most of the areas that do

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.040 
thankfully most of the areas that do
have<00:02:47.010> them<00:02:47.250> you're<00:02:48.030> able<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.420> jump<00:02:48.630> over<00:02:48.750> them

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
have them you're able to jump over them

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.130 
have them you're able to jump over them
also<00:02:50.010> you'll<00:02:50.490> find<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:51.120> when<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.390> say<00:02:51.810> he's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
also you'll find that when I say he's

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.190 
also you'll find that when I say he's
put<00:02:52.440> speed<00:02:52.890> boosters<00:02:53.400> everywhere<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.360> really

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
put speed boosters everywhere I really

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.479 
put speed boosters everywhere I really
mean<00:02:55.350> everywhere<00:02:55.770> they're<00:02:56.100> they're

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
mean everywhere they're they're

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.090 
mean everywhere they're they're
everywhere<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.830> wherever<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.040> think

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
everywhere just wherever you think

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.590 
everywhere just wherever you think

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
everywhere is they're just everywhere

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.400 
everywhere is they're just everywhere
believe<00:03:01.050> me<00:03:01.290> they're<00:03:02.150> everywhere<00:03:03.150> now<00:03:03.480> we're

believe me they're everywhere now we're

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.720 
believe me they're everywhere now we're
just<00:03:04.500> gonna<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.130> ball<00:03:05.280> my<00:03:05.640> god<00:03:06.770> huh<00:03:07.770> huh

oK<00:03:10.620> we've<00:03:10.830> bitten<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.310> boss<00:03:11.489> now<00:03:11.880> it's<00:03:12.060> time

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
oK we've bitten the boss now it's time

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.310 
oK we've bitten the boss now it's time
to<00:03:12.270> go<00:03:12.510> up<00:03:12.540> here<00:03:12.750> another<00:03:13.140> speed<00:03:13.980> booster<00:03:14.459> Wow

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
to go up here another speed booster Wow

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.070 
to go up here another speed booster Wow
yeah<00:03:16.320> I'm<00:03:16.530> not<00:03:16.770> over<00:03:17.070> exaggerating

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
yeah I'm not over exaggerating

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.410 
yeah I'm not over exaggerating
everywhere<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.470> do<00:03:20.010> think<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.880> hat<00:03:21.150> goes

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
everywhere I do think that this hat goes

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.300 
everywhere I do think that this hat goes
a<00:03:21.450> little<00:03:21.690> bit<00:03:21.959> overboard<00:03:22.440> with<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.040> speed

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
a little bit overboard with the speed

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.800 
a little bit overboard with the speed
boosters<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:23.940> some<00:03:24.150> cases<00:03:24.570> but<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.780> think

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
boosters in some cases but I think

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.830 
boosters in some cases but I think
that's<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.410> idea<00:03:25.800> it's<00:03:26.160> meant<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.580> be

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
that's the idea it's meant to be

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.360 
that's the idea it's meant to be
ridiculously<00:03:27.840> making<00:03:28.350> fun<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.620> Dimps<00:03:29.220> like

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
ridiculously making fun of Dimps like

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.130 
ridiculously making fun of Dimps like
completely<00:03:30.800> overreacting<00:03:32.180> but<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.510> do<00:03:33.750> agree

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
completely overreacting but I do agree

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.410 
completely overreacting but I do agree
that<00:03:34.530> Dimps<00:03:35.070> does<00:03:35.310> use<00:03:35.550> speed<00:03:35.940> boosters

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
that Dimps does use speed boosters

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.320 
that Dimps does use speed boosters
probably<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.019> little<00:03:37.350> bit<00:03:37.500> too<00:03:37.739> much<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.370> think

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
probably a little bit too much I think

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.630 
probably a little bit too much I think
another<00:03:39.600> cool<00:03:39.900> addition<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:40.650> game<00:03:40.950> would

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
another cool addition to this game would

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.060 
another cool addition to this game would
be<00:03:41.670> when<00:03:42.150> we<00:03:42.269> all<00:03:42.420> saw<00:03:42.690> Sonic<00:03:43.170> falls<00:03:43.470> footage

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
be when we all saw Sonic falls footage

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.160 
be when we all saw Sonic falls footage
at<00:03:44.250> first<00:03:44.550> we<00:03:44.880> all<00:03:45.000> thought<00:03:45.300> it<00:03:45.540> took<00:03:45.750> Sonic

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
at first we all thought it took Sonic

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.650 
at first we all thought it took Sonic
too<00:03:46.350> long<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.860> get<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.190> its<00:03:47.310> full

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
too long to get to its full

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.720 
too long to get to its full
running<00:03:47.930> animation<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.740> think<00:03:49.400> this<00:03:49.580> should

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
running animation I think this should

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.970 
running animation I think this should
somehow<00:03:50.000> be<00:03:50.180> worked<00:03:50.570> into<00:03:50.870> this<00:03:51.080> game<00:03:51.320> just

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
somehow be worked into this game just

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.930 
somehow be worked into this game just
because<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.670> think<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.630> would<00:03:53.750> fit<00:03:54.580> but<00:03:55.580> since<00:03:55.790> I

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
because I think it would fit but since I

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.880 
because I think it would fit but since I
have<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.180> very<00:03:56.450> limited<00:03:56.720> knowledge<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.470> hacking

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
have a very limited knowledge of hacking

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.470 
have a very limited knowledge of hacking
at<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.040> moment<00:03:58.430> anyway<00:03:58.520> I'm<00:03:58.850> not<00:03:59.060> sure<00:03:59.300> how

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
at the moment anyway I'm not sure how

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.020 
at the moment anyway I'm not sure how
easy<00:03:59.720> or<00:03:59.930> hard<00:04:00.110> this<00:04:00.380> would<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.860> do<00:04:01.070> oh<00:04:01.370> by

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
easy or hard this would be to do oh by
