00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
first time you use it you use it to go

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.119

up<00:02:56.120> an<00:02:56.209> elevator<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:57.620> then<00:02:57.769> when<00:02:57.859> you<00:02:57.920> up<00:02:58.010> the

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
up an elevator and then when you up the

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.309 
up an elevator and then when you up the
elevator<00:02:58.250> don't<00:02:58.760> go<00:02:58.910> left<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.390> then<00:03:00.109> go

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
elevator don't go left and then go

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.309 
elevator don't go left and then go
through<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.859> and<00:03:01.250> swing<00:03:02.000> that's<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.900> bad<00:03:03.079> idea

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
through that and swing that's a bad idea

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.160 
through that and swing that's a bad idea
because<00:03:03.920> you're<00:03:04.310> gonna<00:03:04.459> miss<00:03:04.879> the

because you're gonna miss the
stonemasons<00:03:06.170> chisel<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.459> make<00:03:07.790> sure<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:08.030> pick

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
stonemasons chisel so make sure you pick
