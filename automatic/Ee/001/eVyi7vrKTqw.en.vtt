00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:43.250 

I<00:00:31.570> think

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.530 

so<00:00:44.260> basically<00:00:45.010> we<00:00:45.280> will<00:00:45.490> have<00:00:46.240> here<00:00:46.870> five

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
so basically we will have here five

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.640 
so basically we will have here five
modules<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:50.350> will<00:00:50.860> talk<00:00:51.070> about<00:00:51.250> so<00:00:51.730> one<00:00:52.000> is<00:00:52.150> a

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
modules I will talk about so one is a

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.800 
modules I will talk about so one is a
