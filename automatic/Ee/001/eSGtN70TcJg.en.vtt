00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.030
 welcome, welcome to the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.099
 neurology I am attila biologist 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.940
 researcher and my dragons have been 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.310
 extinct 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.439
 today we are going to unravel how the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.520
 idea of dragons and how they would be in 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.170
 real world 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.390
 the myth the dragons has already appeared 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.189
 independently in various cultures and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.619
 that they all have in common is the presence 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 of fossils is not very difficult to imagine 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.769
 someone finds the skull easy and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.680
 wondering if those huge animals 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.420
 it was not a monster that were extinct 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.770
 like the dragon declare strong the first 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.230
 statue made from a skull 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.360
 if there is any news in this case 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.010
 it will not be a distinct several 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.020
 characteristics of the fossils are 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.629
 incorporated into the dragon's 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.120
 long necks the horns and 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.770
 the bone plates exposed as 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.750
 adriane describes better in the book the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.699
 force one reuters in china all 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.430
 our fossils were called bones 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.410
 dragon the mongolia and desert region 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.439
 of special gobi is famous for 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.640
 skeletons very well preserved as 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.640
 protocitotope velociraptor that were 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.979
 fossilized in full battle legends 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.210
 described the dragons being 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 found by Chinese farmers 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.979
 long before a thousand before Christ in 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.799
 a short time these knots start to be 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.509
 used in traditional Chinese medicine 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.759
 other regions such as Greece and India and 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.430
 even Egypt had their myths dragons 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.960
 based skeleton found part 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.450
 of these skulls found in excavations 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.220
 like the first gold mines, which 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.350
 can explain the myth of griffins with 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.990
 nozzles and dragon with keepers 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.909
 treasures than the mineral gems that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.950
 sometimes formed in the bones in the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.079
 fossilization process as crystals 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.790
 of selenite calcite enhances the association 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.740
 of dragons with jewels 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.119
 these bones motivated legends such as 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.790
 dragon of bill uhf that was one of the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.350
 tdlc's most influential sources then 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.270
 origin of the myth based on 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.860
 mainly dinosaur bones and 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.570
 constant presence of a long tail 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.560
 pointed teeth and mainly 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.299
 Scales 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.729
 let's assume that dragons 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.829
 animals are associated with rags 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.570
 the internal skull and jaw skeleton and 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.580
 four paws as well as reptiles 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.959
 mammals and birds 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.670
 this coincides with the reconstruction of 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.330
 evolution of dragons made by 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.760
 researcher at brighton university 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.200
 colombia the bicola out that positioned the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.480
 oriental dragons closer to 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.220
 European mammals and dragons 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.750
 known as a new group of 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.090
 terrestrial vertebrates 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.370
 This proximity allows we see the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.410
 pterosaurs the largest group of rags 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.690
 already flies to extrapolate to our 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.720
 next step as dragons have succeeded 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.120
 flying to start now would depend on 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.010
 considerable anatomical changes to 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.350
 have the front legs and a pair of 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.360
 wings beyond the hind legs 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.850
 they would be the first vertebrates until 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.290
 more than four members their joy 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.600
 it is relatively simple to 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.120
 occur in fruit flies to drosophila 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.490
 victory that has precisely this 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.410
 more thorax segment with four wings 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.300
 almost a fly limo 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.459
 but even if it were possible to 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.230
 dragons the arms over bring the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.240
 extra problem for the flight 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.950
 just take a look at the body format 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.320
 of an area of 1 that has the balance that is 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.510
 perceives the problem the center of mass 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.490
 must be at the height of the wings and 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.990
 legs and the lower part of the body almost 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.610
 they are never fulfilled 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.430
 all to be able to get off the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.110
 ground with the beat of wings wings that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.989
 would have to be charged for a good 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.450
 muscles and speaking in strength the greater 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.269
 pterosaur of all was quartz 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.459
 four years in the tropics with ten meters 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.800
 wingspan and the size of the wingspan 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.190
 close to a giraffe its weight was 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.739
 called between 70 and more recently 230 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.900
 And he said he could because he still 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.360
 much debated if he being so heavy 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.920
 in fact it flew or it was terrestrial and 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.140
 walked on all four legs like the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.570
 short-tailed bat of new zealand 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.459
 the larger and heavier the animal the more 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.510
 space boost it needs to get started 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.580
 your flight 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.019
 and he needs to flap his wings soon 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.989
 after takeoff to pick up speed 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.910
 cruise dragons besides being 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.470
 well above the weight limit 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.540
 wings support and than metabolism 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.120
 can withstand producing energy 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.459
 still need a good run of 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.410
 take off spitfire accounting 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.720
 we can provide a biological basis for this 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.310
 display capability 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.470
 Beetle group defends itself using 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.390
 abdomen to splash boiling mixture 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.360
 of substances such as acids and aldehydes 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.250
 to light this pump. 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.390
 beetles use two organs that produce 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.889
 substances 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.199
 one of them produces among others 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.319
 things hydrogen peroxide and other produces 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:35.020
 small amounts of enzymes called 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:37.719
 catalase cp oxidase 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.490
 oxygenation very quickly when the two 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.080
 compounds are thrown into a 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.610
 reaction at the end of the abdomen 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.889
 enzymes attack hydrogen peroxide 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.349
 releasing oxygen and now a reaction 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.969
 very fast which makes the water boil 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.749
 oxygen to expand a true 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.639
 explosion 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:53.590
 our work already has an end 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.289
 where flammable gases emerge as well 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.300
 common is the same explosive end 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.550
 but the beetles and respect for the dignity 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.289
 them and to give them a better ability to 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.139
 let's assume that this gas would have 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.639
 that a burp of methane and 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.310
 other gases released by fermentation 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.379
 of food the salivary gland could 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.659
 oxygenated desk along with saliva 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.849
 and a venom gland like the snakes 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.740
 with hostesses could dictate catalase 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.969
 that would produce a reaction that sets fire to 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.490
 gaseous face 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.650
 suddenly a brazilian peasant 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.419
 the consistency of a ball of fire penalty 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.379
 we do not have dramatic low over 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.120
 the village 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:30.490
 so when they went to see the hobbit 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.139
 remember the gastritis of the short enamel and 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.610
 share our video and sign the 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.710

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.310
 children destroyed and until the next 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.589
 fifth 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.900
 another thanks to the fabled ax and

 pill for help with script take advantage 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.080
 and take a look down here at the 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:46.779
 lollipop goes there to pay him a visit 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.180
 Please critical suggestions comments 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.669
 of themes down here and our 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.289
 twitter and facebook profiles 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:59.740
 this nerd praises is an offer of 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:03.279
 killer and 4 flex from ubisoft alias 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.069
 arrived already arrived with the world scenario 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:08.529
 open space and more than 50 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:10.960
 navigation the game already comes with less 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.060
 subtitles and dubbing in Portuguese but 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.210
 you do not want you can still play in 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.000
 original language in English also 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.099
 available for an xbox and playstation 3 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.830
 indeed, whoever buys the version of 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:26.589
 playstation 3 can download psn one of them 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.389
 and with an extra 60 minutes of gameplay and 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:31.240
 you will also be able to buy the 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:34.300
 playstation 4 then for only 10
