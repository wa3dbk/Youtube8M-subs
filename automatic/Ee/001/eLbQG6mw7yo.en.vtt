00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
and then here is my DIY co2 system you

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.470 
and then here is my DIY co2 system you
can<00:03:36.860> see<00:03:37.010> here<00:03:37.280> bubbles<00:03:37.940> are<00:03:38.060> coming<00:03:38.090> out

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
can see here bubbles are coming out

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.340 
can see here bubbles are coming out
every<00:03:39.320> once<00:03:39.380> in<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.680> while<00:03:40.030> yep<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.209> so<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:42.110> is

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
every once in a while yep and so that is

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.530 
every once in a while yep and so that is
shooting<00:03:42.829> up<00:03:42.890> through<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.820> side<00:03:44.060> here<00:03:44.390> I

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
shooting up through the side here I

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.110 
shooting up through the side here I
don't<00:03:45.290> know<00:03:45.350> if<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.470> can<00:03:45.590> see<00:03:45.739> ya<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.100> then<00:03:46.790> up

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
don't know if you can see ya and then up

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.300 
don't know if you can see ya and then up
to<00:03:47.390> here<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.780> then<00:03:47.840> micro<00:03:48.829> bubbles<00:03:48.980> are

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
to here and then micro bubbles are
