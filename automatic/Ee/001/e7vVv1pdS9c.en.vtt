00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.849
 my name is Marina who does not know yet 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.150
 Today I would like to do a review on 2 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:18.160
 manhattan concealer 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.039
 budget options this concealer 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.279
 more liquid and this concealer more 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.470
 tight who will be interested in this video 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.519
 then stay with me and all the nice 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.470
 view 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.810
 having come to the shop we choose ourselves 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.300
 concealer picking up one concealer come 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.309
 home and it turns out this concealer does 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.070
 the colors do not suit us either 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.829
 suitable or not suitable for us 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.870
 the textures of this concealer and myself 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.079
 faced once and 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.230
 this reason is of course the storeâ€™s light 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.289
 what's there they have a very bright light and 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.180
 and of course it's not daylight and what 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.789
 It can give us if we put on 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.449
 makeup or for example this concealer even 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.879
 we do not test and of course today i 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.140
 I would like to offer you to consider two 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:11.620
 concealer and concealer from man 2 in one 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.640
 Here in such here jars here goes powder 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.040
 fixing 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.680
 and another concealer also from manhattan 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.930
 weaker not as dense texture as 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.960
 here and so well let's start here with 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.450
 this concealer yes and he is already with me 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.150

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.720

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.210
 unscrewed and sponge goes along with 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.300
 powder here it is fixative powder 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.490
 so that this concealer does not roll but it 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.100
 powder especially so not 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.260

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.690

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.990

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.170

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.890
 light texture 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.490

 easily distributed and all sorts of small 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.260
 wrinkles that may even be even 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.480
 with juicy not seen in it 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.930
 some 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.300
 moisture or some oiliness so 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.760
 how my skin is oily and this concealer 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.190
 very well approached the area around the eyes 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.660
 does not dry well refreshes it or does 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.970
 extra shine and if with this 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.280
 concealer see those wrinkles which 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.760
 I don't see who this concealer either 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.190
 hides all our shortcomings and minor 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.810
 fine wrinkles which are not seen but 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.160
 it is also refreshing 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.160
 eye area 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.170
 and since I said this concealer well 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.980
 suitable for disco parties 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.980
 for exits for photos but this one 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.219
 concealer is more suitable for 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.090
 everyday life 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:01.670
 since its texture is very light 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.650
 good and very nice skin 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.170
