hi Chuck Holly with a west brain minute

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.940 
hi Chuck Holly with a west brain minute
on<00:00:05.680> West<00:00:06.069> brains<00:00:06.430> CPP<00:00:07.360> a<00:00:07.390> blade<00:00:07.690> of<00:00:07.720> paint<00:00:08.110> this

on West brains CPP a blade of paint this

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.310 
on West brains CPP a blade of paint this
is<00:00:09.130> a<00:00:09.160> very<00:00:09.700> good<00:00:09.940> compatibility<00:00:10.299> paint<00:00:10.959> goes

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
is a very good compatibility paint goes

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.230 
is a very good compatibility paint goes
over<00:00:11.650> almost<00:00:11.920> any<00:00:12.340> previously<00:00:12.940> painted

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
over almost any previously painted

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.330 
over almost any previously painted
surface<00:00:13.809> they'll<00:00:14.350> go<00:00:14.500> over<00:00:14.799> a<00:00:14.830> properly

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
surface they'll go over a properly

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.050 
surface they'll go over a properly
primed<00:00:15.610> metal<00:00:16.360> or<00:00:16.570> wood<00:00:17.080> or<00:00:17.320> fiberglass

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
primed metal or wood or fiberglass

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
primed metal or wood or fiberglass
doesn't<00:00:19.060> go<00:00:19.150> over<00:00:19.390> aluminum<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.050> you

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
doesn't go over aluminum and you

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.140 
doesn't go over aluminum and you
shouldn't<00:00:20.890> be<00:00:20.949> using<00:00:21.310> on<00:00:21.400> an<00:00:21.550> out<00:00:21.670> drive<00:00:21.939> but

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
shouldn't be using on an out drive but

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.390 
shouldn't be using on an out drive but
it'll<00:00:22.330> go<00:00:22.480> on<00:00:22.630> most<00:00:22.869> other<00:00:23.050> surfaces<00:00:23.679> however

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
it'll go on most other surfaces however

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.730 
it'll go on most other surfaces however
nothing<00:00:25.210> really<00:00:25.570> goes<00:00:25.750> well<00:00:25.960> over<00:00:26.230> a<00:00:26.259> Teflon

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
nothing really goes well over a Teflon

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.109 
nothing really goes well over a Teflon
based<00:00:26.919> bottom<00:00:27.339> paint<00:00:27.519> so<00:00:27.699> if<00:00:27.789> you<00:00:27.910> have<00:00:28.089> a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
based bottom paint so if you have a

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.599 
based bottom paint so if you have a
previously<00:00:28.660> coated<00:00:29.349> surface<00:00:30.039> with<00:00:30.220> Teflon

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
previously coated surface with Teflon

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.249 
previously coated surface with Teflon
based<00:00:30.789> paint<00:00:31.089> you<00:00:31.570> probably<00:00:31.869> ought<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.110> take

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
based paint you probably ought to take

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.980 
based paint you probably ought to take
that<00:00:32.290> off<00:00:32.619> before<00:00:32.770> you<00:00:33.040> recode<00:00:33.430> it<00:00:33.810> this<00:00:34.810> is<00:00:34.960> a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
that off before you recode it this is a

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.990 
that off before you recode it this is a
single-season<00:00:35.830> paint<00:00:36.310> meaning<00:00:36.760> that<00:00:36.850> it

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
single-season paint meaning that it

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.850 
single-season paint meaning that it
loses<00:00:37.420> effectiveness<00:00:37.600> when<00:00:38.260> it's<00:00:38.380> left<00:00:38.620> out

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
loses effectiveness when it's left out

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.200 
loses effectiveness when it's left out
of<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.040> water<00:00:39.220> for<00:00:39.490> long<00:00:39.640> periods<00:00:40.030> of<00:00:40.150> time

of the water for long periods of time

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.060 
of the water for long periods of time
you<00:00:40.900> know<00:00:40.960> that's<00:00:41.110> not<00:00:41.290> such<00:00:41.740> a<00:00:41.770> terrible

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
you know that's not such a terrible

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.560 
you know that's not such a terrible
thing<00:00:42.310> a<00:00:42.550> lot<00:00:42.670> of<00:00:42.730> people<00:00:42.820> leave<00:00:43.180> their<00:00:43.360> boats

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
thing a lot of people leave their boats

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.300 
thing a lot of people leave their boats
in<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.810> water<00:00:43.840> over<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.710> in<00:00:44.800> winter<00:00:45.130> and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
in the water over the in winter and

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.790 
in the water over the in winter and
that's<00:00:45.460> fine<00:00:45.760> but<00:00:46.360> this<00:00:46.750> is<00:00:46.930> not<00:00:47.110> an<00:00:47.350> ablative

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
that's fine but this is not an ablative

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.410 
that's fine but this is not an ablative
paint<00:00:48.100> that<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.400> can<00:00:48.550> leave<00:00:48.820> out<00:00:49.030> and<00:00:49.300> then

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
paint that you can leave out and then

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.420 
paint that you can leave out and then
relaunch<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:50.140> next<00:00:50.380> season<00:00:50.710> if<00:00:50.860> you<00:00:51.100> do

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
relaunch the next season if you do

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.220 
relaunch the next season if you do
launch<00:00:51.700> air<00:00:52.030> if<00:00:52.150> you<00:00:52.270> do<00:00:52.390> haul<00:00:52.720> out<00:00:52.840> during<00:00:53.110> the

launch air if you do haul out during the
winter<00:00:53.320> make<00:00:53.890> sure<00:00:54.070> that<00:00:54.220> you<00:00:54.370> recode<00:00:54.820> it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
winter make sure that you recode it

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.580 
winter make sure that you recode it
before<00:00:55.390> you<00:00:55.450> put<00:00:55.660> it<00:00:55.750> in<00:00:55.870> for<00:00:56.050> maximum

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
before you put it in for maximum

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.430 
before you put it in for maximum
effectiveness<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:58.360> is<00:00:58.600> an<00:00:58.780> ablative<00:00:59.080> paint

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
effectiveness it is an ablative paint

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.760 
effectiveness it is an ablative paint
however<00:00:59.770> so<00:01:00.370> as<00:01:00.610> you<00:01:01.090> use<00:01:01.300> your<00:01:01.330> boat

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
however so as you use your boat

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.870 
however so as you use your boat
microscopic<00:01:02.770> layers<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.310> this<00:01:03.460> paint<00:01:03.700> will

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
microscopic layers of this paint will

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.730 
microscopic layers of this paint will
wear<00:01:04.089> off<00:01:04.269> and<00:01:04.509> that's<00:01:04.839> how<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.320> does<00:01:05.590> its

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
wear off and that's how it does its

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.340 
wear off and that's how it does its
antifouling<00:01:06.690> this<00:01:07.690> means<00:01:07.960> that<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:08.200> don't

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
antifouling this means that you don't

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.200 
antifouling this means that you don't
get<00:01:08.470> paint<00:01:08.740> build<00:01:09.040> up<00:01:09.220> over<00:01:09.400> time<00:01:09.730> which<00:01:10.030> is<00:01:10.180> a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
get paint build up over time which is a

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.660 
get paint build up over time which is a
nice<00:01:10.450> feature<00:01:10.720> so<00:01:11.080> after<00:01:11.620> a<00:01:11.890> year<00:01:12.040> or<00:01:12.280> two<00:01:12.370> when

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
nice feature so after a year or two when

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.460 
nice feature so after a year or two when
it's<00:01:12.790> time<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.000> recoat<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.480> you<00:01:13.960> haul<00:01:14.350> your

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
it's time to recoat it you haul your

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.530 
it's time to recoat it you haul your
boat<00:01:14.650> out<00:01:14.680> any<00:01:15.100> paint<00:01:15.760> that's<00:01:15.970> still<00:01:16.150> there<00:01:16.360> is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
boat out any paint that's still there is

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.080 
boat out any paint that's still there is
still<00:01:16.810> active<00:01:17.380> valuable<00:01:18.250> paint<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:18.880> you<00:01:18.940> just

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
still active valuable paint so you just

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.560 
still active valuable paint so you just
go<00:01:19.210> right<00:01:19.390> over<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.720> top<00:01:19.900> of<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:21.340> uses<00:01:21.670> this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
go right over the top of it it uses this

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.260 
go right over the top of it it uses this
C<00:01:23.110> C's<00:01:23.350> T<00:01:23.710> copper<00:01:24.460> technology<00:01:24.640> that's

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
C C's T copper technology that's

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.899 
C C's T copper technology that's
composite<00:01:26.200> copper<00:01:26.590> technology<00:01:26.909> which

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
composite copper technology which

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.410 
composite copper technology which
essentially<00:01:28.750> takes<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.430> amount<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.060> copper

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
essentially takes the amount of copper

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.180 
essentially takes the amount of copper
it<00:01:31.510> has<00:01:31.690> in<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.140> increases<00:01:32.650> its<00:01:32.770> surface

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
it has in it and increases its surface

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.520 
it has in it and increases its surface
area<00:01:33.370> with<00:01:34.300> this<00:01:34.450> does<00:01:34.659> is<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:34.960> allows<00:01:35.229> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
area with this does is that allows the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.920 
area with this does is that allows the
paint<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:35.979> use<00:01:36.100> less<00:01:36.610> metallic<00:01:37.300> copper<00:01:37.510> but

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
paint to use less metallic copper but

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.270 
paint to use less metallic copper but
still<00:01:38.229> be<00:01:38.350> very<00:01:38.680> effective

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
still be very effective

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.490 
still be very effective
so<00:01:40.000> since<00:01:40.540> copper<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.050> one<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.350> most

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
so since copper is one of the most

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.440 
so since copper is one of the most
expensive<00:01:41.920> components<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:42.760> a<00:01:42.880> bottom<00:01:43.210> paint

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
expensive components in a bottom paint

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.910
