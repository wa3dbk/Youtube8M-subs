engraving<00:01:15.030> when<00:01:15.299> people<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.689> crazy

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
engraving when people do that crazy

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.649 
engraving when people do that crazy
engraving<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.490> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> looks<00:01:18.600> like

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
engraving just that kind of looks like

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.570 
engraving just that kind of looks like
an<00:01:18.869> art<00:01:19.080> piece<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.950> doesn't<00:01:20.250> even<00:01:20.280> look<00:01:20.520> like

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
an art piece it doesn't even look like

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.030 
an art piece it doesn't even look like
some<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.420> random<00:01:21.869> mix<00:01:22.049> colors<00:01:22.470> actually

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
some just random mix colors actually

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.210 
some just random mix colors actually
looks<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.580> some<00:01:23.759> kind<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:24.000> art<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.650> think<00:01:25.650> but

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
looks like some kind of art I think but

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.120 
looks like some kind of art I think but
I<00:01:26.250> don't<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.640> much<00:01:26.820> about<00:01:26.939> art<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.829> but<00:01:28.829> we

like it what I did was I did ground of
the<00:01:31.200> blue<00:01:31.500> liner<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.369> will<00:01:32.490> make<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the blue liner because it will make it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.480 
the blue liner because it will make it
really<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:35.040> soon<00:01:35.340> as

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
I reach the unidirectional I left it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.260 
I reach the unidirectional I left it
there<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.930> no<00:01:39.930> did<00:01:40.380> everything<00:01:41.000> shaped<00:01:42.000> it

flows<00:02:01.200> better<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> knife<00:02:02.070> when<00:02:02.310> it's

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
flows better with the knife when it's

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.749 
flows better with the knife when it's
closed<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.409> three<00:02:04.770> scoops<00:02:05.159> not<00:02:05.430> one

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
closed so you have three scoops not one

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.410 
closed so you have three scoops not one
two<00:02:06.299> three<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.530> fingers<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.979> look<00:02:08.310> for

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
two three and the fingers all look for

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.320 
two three and the fingers all look for
and<00:02:09.630> then<00:02:10.140> two<00:02:10.349> up<00:02:10.500> front<00:02:11.090> everything<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and then two up front everything is the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.720 
and then two up front everything is the
same<00:02:12.530> except<00:02:13.530> then<00:02:13.800> when<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.010> was<00:02:14.250> done<00:02:14.310> this

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
same except then when I was done this

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.839 
same except then when I was done this
was<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.150> taker<00:02:15.510> still<00:02:16.010> what<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.040> did<00:02:17.310> was<00:02:17.550> and

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
was the taker still what I did was and

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.280 
was the taker still what I did was and
this<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.060> smooth<00:02:18.420> because<00:02:18.599> it's<00:02:18.840> polish

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
this is smooth because it's polish

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.839 
this is smooth because it's polish
that's<00:02:19.440> how<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.590> finish<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.069> what<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> did<00:02:20.819> was

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
that's how you finish it what I did was

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.390 
that's how you finish it what I did was
actually<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.660> did<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.560> get<00:02:22.739> your<00:02:22.920> country<00:02:23.280> we

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
actually I did you get your country we

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.940 
actually I did you get your country we
said<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.849> can<00:02:24.000> only<00:02:24.120> feel<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.870> which<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.770> nice

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
said you can only feel it which is nice

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.280 
said you can only feel it which is nice
that<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.340> don't<00:02:26.550> see<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.000> did<00:02:27.600> put<00:02:27.900> kind<00:02:28.200> of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
that you don't see I did put kind of

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.620 
that you don't see I did put kind of
like<00:02:28.410> kind<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.400> rock<00:02:29.730> pattern<00:02:29.970> on<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
like kind of like a rock pattern on the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.630 
like kind of like a rock pattern on the
flag<00:02:30.989> just<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.739> give<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.069> little<00:02:32.250> bit<00:02:32.520> of

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
flag just to give it a little bit of

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.479 
flag just to give it a little bit of
some<00:02:33.060> kind<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.300> texture<00:02:33.750> some<00:02:34.050> kind<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.489> yeah

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
some kind of texture some kind of yeah

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.370 
some kind of texture some kind of yeah
but<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.030> said<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.360> cannot<00:02:36.900> really<00:02:37.140> even

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
but like I said you cannot really even

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.559 
but like I said you cannot really even
see<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.459> can<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.790> can<00:02:38.940> feel<00:02:39.180> when<00:02:39.450> you

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
see it but you can you can feel when you

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.270 
see it but you can you can feel when you
run<00:02:39.750> your<00:02:39.780> finger<00:02:40.319> on<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> give<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.220> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
run your finger on it just to give you a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.870 
run your finger on it just to give you a
little<00:02:41.310> more<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.420> grip<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:43.250> really<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.400> and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
little more and a grip I really like and

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.080 
little more and a grip I really like and
purposely<00:02:45.630> did<00:02:46.130> contouring<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.549> such<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> way

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
purposely did contouring in such a way

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.500 
purposely did contouring in such a way
that<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:49.470> expose<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.280> orange<00:02:50.640> liner<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.420> you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
that I expose the orange liner so you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.130 
that I expose the orange liner so you
have<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:52.019> outline<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.860> around<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:53.730> like

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
have that outline all around just like

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.840 
have that outline all around just like
pretty<00:02:55.140> nice<00:02:55.410> what's<00:02:56.069> kind<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.340> tricky<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.700> do

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
pretty nice what's kind of tricky to do

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.090 
pretty nice what's kind of tricky to do
because<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.540> lion<00:02:57.750> door<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.170> run<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.769> thin

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
because the lion door and run is so thin

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.870 
because the lion door and run is so thin
so<00:02:59.340> it<00:03:00.000> was<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.810> know<00:03:00.930> close<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.920> some<00:03:02.670> some

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
so it was you know close to some some

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.330 
so it was you know close to some some
places<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.630> would<00:03:03.900> grind<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.350> know<00:03:04.470> tiny

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
places if I would grind you know tiny

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.370 
places if I would grind you know tiny
bit<00:03:05.640> more<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:06.120> would<00:03:06.360> actually<00:03:06.690> go<00:03:06.900> all<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.350> way

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
bit more I would actually go all the way

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.690 
bit more I would actually go all the way
to<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.680> black<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:09.290> induction<00:03:10.290> will<00:03:11.280> work<00:03:11.489> out

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
to the black the induction will work out

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.240 
to the black the induction will work out
nice<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.330> person<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.049> you're<00:03:13.859> super

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
nice and I person like that you're super

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.130 
nice and I person like that you're super
thin<00:03:14.430> outline<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.299> orange<00:03:15.690> around<00:03:15.989> it

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
thin outline of the orange around it

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.910 
thin outline of the orange around it
blue<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.590> like<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:18.260> what<00:03:19.260> else<00:03:19.470> another

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
blue I like it and what else another

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.520 
blue I like it and what else another
thing<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.549> try<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.420> do<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.350> work

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
thing is I try to do this and it work

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.979 
thing is I try to do this and it work
out<00:03:22.709> nice<00:03:22.920> as<00:03:23.190> well<00:03:23.370> pocket<00:03:24.329> clip<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.780> from

out nice as well pocket clip is from

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.349 
out nice as well pocket clip is from

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.410

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.800 
we have to really press it and then it
flies<00:04:08.870> off<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:10.220> little<00:04:10.580> detail<00:04:11.030> just<00:04:11.420> like<00:04:11.630> the

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
flies off so little detail just like the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.500 
flies off so little detail just like the
one<00:04:11.959> yesterday<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:12.740> really<00:04:13.400> like<00:04:13.580> that<00:04:13.790> on<00:04:14.300> the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
one yesterday I really like that on the

one yesterday I really like that on the
flipper<00:04:15.430> really<00:04:16.430> like<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.880> only<00:04:17.030> thing

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
flipper really like it only thing

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.390 
flipper really like it only thing
different<00:04:17.660> what<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.049> did<00:04:18.320> was<00:04:18.590> when<00:04:19.100> it<00:04:19.220> was

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
different what I did was when it was

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.780 
different what I did was when it was
done<00:04:19.639> I<00:04:19.910> brushed<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:21.109> with<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.790> bullshit

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
done I brushed it with the bullshit

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.810 
done I brushed it with the bullshit
brass<00:04:23.090> wire<00:04:23.780> wheel<00:04:24.139> so<00:04:24.950> we<00:04:25.070> darken<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.639> up<00:04:25.760> a

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
brass wire wheel so we darken it up a

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.710 
brass wire wheel so we darken it up a
little<00:04:26.000> bit<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:27.230> like<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:28.419> grind<00:04:29.419> was

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
little bit and I like that and grind was

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.700 
little bit and I like that and grind was
nailed<00:04:30.639> nicely<00:04:31.639> so<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.389> left<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.080> sadden

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
nailed nicely so I left it sadden

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.070 
nailed nicely so I left it sadden
because<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:35.030> just<00:04:35.180> came<00:04:35.389> out<00:04:35.540> perfect

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
because it just came out perfect

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.600 
because it just came out perfect
everything<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.620> perfect<00:04:37.130> about<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:37.490> the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
everything is perfect about it the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.260 
everything is perfect about it the
switch<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.240> dry<00:04:38.540> in<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.840> flats<00:04:40.270> everything

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
switch to dry in the flats everything

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.400 
switch to dry in the flats everything
worked<00:04:41.540> out<00:04:41.750> good<00:04:43.330> nice<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.630> lean<00:04:44.840> although

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
worked out good nice and lean although

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.500 
worked out good nice and lean although
if<00:04:45.500> you<00:04:45.800> know<00:04:45.890> even<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.250> tip<00:04:46.490> tip<00:04:46.700> is<00:04:46.850> slightly

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
if you know even the tip tip is slightly

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.570 
if you know even the tip tip is slightly
microscopically<00:04:48.440> thicker<00:04:48.770> but<00:04:49.010> not<00:04:49.220> by<00:04:49.400> much

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
microscopically thicker but not by much

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.090 
microscopically thicker but not by much
and<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.570> grind<00:04:50.810> is<00:04:50.990> something<00:04:51.530> thousands

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
and the grind is something thousands

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.090 
and the grind is something thousands
behind<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.580> edge<00:04:53.080> so<00:04:54.130> nice<00:04:55.570> even<00:04:56.570> jinping

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
behind the edge so nice even jinping

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.940 
behind the edge so nice even jinping
what<00:04:58.100> I<00:04:58.160> do<00:04:58.220> now<00:04:58.880> is<00:04:58.910> I<00:04:59.479> describe<00:05:00.140> it<00:05:00.320> nice<00:05:00.680> with

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
what I do now is I describe it nice with

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.510 
what I do now is I describe it nice with
the<00:05:01.100> actual<00:05:01.700> exact<00:05:02.510> measuring<00:05:03.350> tape<00:05:03.560> or<00:05:04.160> I<00:05:04.190> put

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
the actual exact measuring tape or I put

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.250 
the actual exact measuring tape or I put
in<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:04.669> meal<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.150> just<00:05:05.330> do<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.690> grooves<00:05:06.020> the

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
in the meal and just do the grooves the

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.320 
in the meal and just do the grooves the
basic<00:05:06.620> initial<00:05:06.979> groups<00:05:07.250> with<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.760> meal<00:05:08.000> you

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
basic initial groups with the meal you

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.510 
basic initial groups with the meal you
know<00:05:08.450> with<00:05:08.690> exact<00:05:09.139> terms<00:05:09.410> of<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.680> wheel<00:05:09.860> it

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
know with exact terms of the wheel it

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.430 
know with exact terms of the wheel it
also<00:05:10.700> gives<00:05:10.880> me<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.390> perfect<00:05:11.540> uniformity<00:05:12.380> and

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
also gives me the perfect uniformity and

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.680 
also gives me the perfect uniformity and
then<00:05:12.590> I<00:05:12.710> go<00:05:12.890> there<00:05:13.100> by<00:05:13.280> hand<00:05:14.650> so<00:05:16.120> nice<00:05:17.120> lock<00:05:17.419> up

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
then I go there by hand so nice lock up

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.500 
then I go there by hand so nice lock up
not<00:05:18.110> too<00:05:18.320> early<00:05:18.380> not<00:05:18.830> too<00:05:19.070> late<00:05:19.310> there<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.360> it

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
not too early not too late there is it

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.630 
not too early not too late there is it
to<00:05:20.600> disengage<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.740> package<00:05:22.130> is<00:05:22.310> actually

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
to disengage the package is actually

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.000 
to disengage the package is actually
very<00:05:22.669> functional<00:05:23.270> I<00:05:23.479> like<00:05:23.690> it<00:05:23.900> it's<00:05:24.590> just

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
very functional I like it it's just

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.529 
very functional I like it it's just
perfect<00:05:25.250> spring<00:05:25.760> and<00:05:25.910> I<00:05:25.940> soy<00:05:26.120> una<00:05:26.360> cosa

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
perfect spring and I soy una cosa

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:27.700 
perfect spring and I soy una cosa
different<00:05:26.810> direction<00:05:27.050> it's<00:05:27.350> actually<00:05:27.680> very

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
different direction it's actually very

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.070 
different direction it's actually very
strong<00:05:28.280> as<00:05:28.700> you<00:05:28.940> do<00:05:29.090> have<00:05:29.300> couple<00:05:29.660> layers<00:05:29.780> that

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
strong as you do have couple layers that

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.320 
strong as you do have couple layers that
go<00:05:30.289> all<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.650> way<00:05:30.680> through<00:05:31.070> so<00:05:31.280> it<00:05:31.850> should<00:05:32.090> it

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
go all the way through so it should it

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.270 
go all the way through so it should it
should<00:05:32.360> last<00:05:32.750> you<00:05:33.050> know<00:05:33.080> it<00:05:33.350> should<00:05:33.560> help<00:05:34.100> the

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
should last you know it should help the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.980 
should last you know it should help the
room<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.580> I<00:05:34.700> sleep<00:05:35.500> nicely<00:05:36.500> centered<00:05:37.990> and

like<00:05:39.260> how<00:05:39.440> it<00:05:39.590> flies<00:05:39.830> out<00:05:40.100> it<00:05:40.340> really<00:05:40.510> Rockets

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510
