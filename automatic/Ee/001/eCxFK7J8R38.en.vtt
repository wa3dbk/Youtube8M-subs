00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.030
 two points of difference only between 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.760
 greenhouses 13th and istres 15th auxerrois 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.619
 who want to win this match finally 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.369
 because they are on five matches without 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.599
 success on two consecutive defeats 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.880
 the Burgundians must play without marc 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.720
 esther hanging serene and dry but fia 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.189
 are still injured Istrian side it's going 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.080
 better there was only one defeat 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.019
 over the last six games and alone 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.519
 malfleury and wounded of the Istreans who 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.629
 starts well they get the 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.430
 first opportunity 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.110
 donovan leon managed to deflect this ball 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.150
 and the Provencal insists with this 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.250
 huge new opportunity the release of 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.129
 the east then supplemented by his defense 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.979
 it's a good start to the match for 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.040
 Juan de Pasqualetti's men from your shots 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.750
 by far very surprising auxerre puts 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.949
 time to get his first opportunity 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.180
 on this free kick but it does not pass 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.070
 still a possibility for Istréens 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.790
 that offers the best face and that's 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.920
 on the pole 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.820
 this is the best opportunity of the 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.590
 first period auxerre has a lot of 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.729
 wrong to put in the right tempo and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.490
 finally find goal situations but 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.499
 attention to this error at the end of 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.450
 first period and the referee of the match 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.939
 hakim belhadj pulls out the red card he 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.359
 is for mamadou all good 42nd minute 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:36.799
 istres is reduced to ten the coup 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:39.829
 franc is then saved that of istres 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.539
 go over at half-time 0 to 0 but 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.799
 istres in difficulty who will have to play 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.880
 the whole second period to 10 against 11 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.950
 auxerre only lost once to 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.789
 home and was largely threatened by 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.439
 First period 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.700
 in second the numerical superiority 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.350
 must help the Burgundians istres did 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.749
 won only once outside 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.979
 the situation has become more complicated 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:04.069
 that auxerre is back from the locker room 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.149
 a first situation put second 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.149
 do not want it still not 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.519
 new corner for auxerrois is 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.670
 this time the balloon is at the bottom of 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.150
 nets the goal of i can not we can to twenty 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.250
 minutes from the end a little bit of success 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.250
 but he is the most prompt to deviate 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.549
 this ball and score his first goal of 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.549
 the season 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.620
 auxerre who insist and who argues 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.239
 its numerical superiority with this new 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.830
 shot framed istres still a small 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.280
 chance at ten against eleven that would be a 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.709
 feat 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.829
 the dribble on the goalkeeper and the penalty 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.489
 in favor of istres indices they can 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.989
 return to equality at the end of the game 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.880
 it's a huge opportunity for jérôme 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.760
 leroy who comes in front of thoune 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.019
 oval but we try on the post what 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.069
 failure when Jerome Leroy who is 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.049
 yet one of the best players 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.090
 this season it was a 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.640
 Golden opportunity to come back from Auxerre with 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.810
 a point this will not be the case 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.810
 Burgundy 1 0
