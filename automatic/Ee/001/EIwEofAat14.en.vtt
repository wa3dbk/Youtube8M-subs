00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 or the jons and compass and welcome to another 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.179
 new video as they saw it in the title 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.530
 big car 5 ferris wheel with no snow ok and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.090
 this was something I wanted them to 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.969
 bring today because recently 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.859
 a creator of mods has created this 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.840
 northampton texture without snow and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.520
 it seems like a norbit anton type like 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.500
 that just spent the winter and already 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.420
 the sun came out and the snow is being removed 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.670
 not as you see it there are a few limits 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.320
 inside the map from north to anthony if 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.210
 Some of you want to download it 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.219
 I will leave this mode in the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.219
 description just remember that this mode 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.780
 only ok for the computer ok is for 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.850
 the computer will not believe that it 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.079
 can put on playstation3 and how 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.090
 can appreciate the truth that is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.440
 quite father since we can see the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.539
 north antón from a perspective 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.550
 totally different from what normally 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.170
 we know because because in which 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.969
 we usually know is when we 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 we passed the prologue of the story mode of 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.680
 great effect 5 and in the prologue the only 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.050
 that there is snow and we can only 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.609
 access some areas but you can not 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.550
 appear almost nothing because there are so many 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.350
 fog and there is also a lot of fog not 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.900
 besides that there is snow and the truth 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.300
 you can not see absolutely anything and for 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.160
 this mode is super well because as 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.350
 come we appreciate an order with totally 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.670
 different from what we know because as 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 can appreciate here there is like a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.840
 sort of spring in which you see 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.130
 quite nice but as you see it is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.350
 a pretty father way to me has 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.940
 much liked more than anything is the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.560
 change of textures because there are some 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.810
 moments that if you do not give that the if 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.090
 the character walks on the pavement what 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.210
 what's going to happen is that it's going to stop like the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.350
 footprint of the snow not that also to the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 same time appears as is the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.220
 character will bring such with the feet but 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.050
 it's not snow and the truth that you see 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.460
 super father not also here we give ourselves 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.869
 account of some things he did 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.210
 rockstargames of creating great 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.130
 cars and it's like these details of the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.930
 textures we see from afar not 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 suppose that texture of the tree that the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.460
 I crossed from far away you do not notice how they see it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.380
 there are some buildings that have 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.540
 these limits like we can not jump 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.430
 and like they have a super high beard or 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.440
 not the fence is not so exaggeratedly 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.420
 high indeed if we get on a 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.759
 helicopter and we can get there 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.979
 you may notice that the truth is that 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.810
 I do not know it 's a texture but the texture does not 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.940
 is one hundred percent completed but 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.740
 all forms is still very beautiful in 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.510
 the whole city not since what 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.060
 that part of big is pretty good 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.850
 cars to me I would like this part of 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.650
 this map is already in the big game 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.170
 I believe that the creators of the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.540
 great cars could be developed in 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.820
 a dlc and add that area not that 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.680
 add a little bit of textures and that 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.330
 add and that we can arrive in 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.730
 plane let's not assume that it has damaged in a 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.770
 flight track one thing that got me something 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.180
 here wave is that here you can notice 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.800
 that there is a cabin but the truth is that 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.740
 cottage I do not know what it is and I think that 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.180
 they can hide many mysteries not already 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.120
 that in addition to everything we saw in the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.460
 prolog there are some locations that 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.680
 they have many textures there as they see it 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.690
 we see this type of cabin that you see 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.880
 pretty good, something that's bad 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.100
 this mold in parts of when we go 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.710
 to our canton what is going to happen is 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.690
 well, practically when we arrive 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.860
 to this part if we do not leave the map what 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.630
 what's going to happen is that we're going to fall 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.550
 water and in fact the height if you do not carry 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.320
 god mode is quite possible that 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.420
 you die also something that impressed me 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.070
 enough of the creator in this way are 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.990
 the textures that I add because how 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.510
 come the more we go away we can 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.280
 notice that there is no anton is every time 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.470
 plus 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.940
 so you do not see snow so much and I think 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.950
 that 's something that looks pretty good 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.690
 and I loved it there are how they see it 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.640
 the distance looks like a kind of mountain 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.500
 a city and I really do not know what I am 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.810
 I think it will be the city of saints 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.209
 but if we get closer we will notice that it will be 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.670
 a simple texture but from a distance because yes 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.230
 it seems to be some city or I do not know the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.360
 Chilean mountain any of these things 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.980
 I doubt it's because I know what 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.260
 I feel they do not take place in what goes 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.239
 doing the city of saints or anything 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.880
 like that so who knows 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.680
 that is also another thing that I saw it 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.690
 it seems to me something funny are the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.580
 buildings that are just as 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.190
 away from norge antón because as they see it 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.200
 they only have the textures on the front and 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.360
 on the back they do not have textures, nothing else 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.069
 is so that it goes away and to say it 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.989
 in some way they are a kind of ornament 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.489
 that has the city but how they see it there 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.170
 I like it a lot I think it looks 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.630
 pretty good and it's really worth it 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.970
 play it that way because I do not know is a 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.590
 essence totally different from the one 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.049
 we had when we played the prologue 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.479
 also one thing that surprised me is 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.340
 that I came here to the East River and I 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.260
 I set out to look for the alien and not 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.970
 appeared I do not know why he will have disappeared 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.380
 the terrestrial with this mode but the 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.790
 truth is something that takes off because 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.040
 I do not know I was looking to see 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.690
 how it looked if it was dry but the most 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.420
 possible is that the creator of the mod which 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.190
 did not add the new textures what 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.740
 what happened is that the alien was 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.600
 with the ice and separate it maybe I could 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.430
 do something difficult and better what he did 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.590
 was to remove all the ice because if you 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.600
 you take a motorcycle in that area you can 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.580
 handle perfectly in fact to 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.470
 then you can see that I in this 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.330
 part I'm right next to the squirrel 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.700
 and I do not know looks pretty father sardiya 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.290
 since I do not know this is the one of the 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.230
 only snowy things 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.610
 obviously they did not remove the snow at 100% 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.980
 since there are some places that 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.170
 they have snow like they could be 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.120
 places here as they see it we come to a 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.280
 of the cabins that are just 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.990
 around here and if I'm not wrong in this 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.000
 hut happened a shootout when 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.710
 we are doing the prologue here I do not know 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.630
 what's wrong with me but when there's a shock and 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.550
 I fly high I do not know by cesc and 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.080
 that mesh with I have a spring what 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.110
 contain but what happens is that when 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.700
 I will shock you with what happens is that it is 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.650
 something flying high and is something that does not 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.870
 it makes no sense but how do they see it 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.180
 he is quite father noria antón if snow 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.380
 the truth that is something 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.480
 different I think it's worth it 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.310
 play it this way because as they see it 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.370
 It's pretty pretty I've also seen 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.860
 that in gta forum many people ask to be 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.600
 add a dlc de noria antón that is another 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.460
 extension of the city ​​I do not think that the 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.440
 better way to do it is that 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.300
 we arrive by means of an airplane and that 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.850
 let's talk about 5 minutes to get there 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.980
 although it has a lot of realism and that is 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.170
 quite funny all that not to see what 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.820
 it would really worth it and then it 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.590
 let's go as they see it is something pretty 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.990
 nice this way I liked a 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.670
 heap and more than anything as you see everything 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.950
 green no I never imagined that it 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.080
 out to make a motorcycle of this 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.340
 kind because as they see it is extremely 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.530
 different from what we normally see 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.780
 because here as they see it is totally 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.520
 everything has changed the textures and the 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.110
 true that it is much more worth of 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.060
 done I think that if the prologue 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.830
 would have done this way and not what 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.690
 would have done without snow would have been 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.130
 also pretty good since we would have 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.110
 I was able to appreciate the city a little 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.120
 although also if you think about the 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.000
 developer's side it's better to put 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.770
 much fog since visibility is not 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.870
 so good and they should not work so much 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.969
 in textures that's also something that 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.759
 you have to take into account that if you increase 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:43.589
 fog there's going to be so much distance from 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:46.259
 Drawing draw distance as you want 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:47.789
 say and that makes the textures 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.889
 you can do a little poorer and that the 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:51.779
 people do not realize and besides that no 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:53.819
