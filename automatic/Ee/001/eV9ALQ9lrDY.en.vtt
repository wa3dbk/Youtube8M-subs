here so what I'm going to do is just

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.670 
here so what I'm going to do is just
drop<00:00:38.340> two<00:00:38.579> loons<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.270> hog<00:00:39.480> they'll<00:00:40.469> take

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
drop two loons and a hog they'll take

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.139 
drop two loons and a hog they'll take
that<00:00:40.920> out<00:00:41.129> don't<00:00:41.430> move<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.670> once<00:00:41.850> they<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that out don't move in once they get to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.080 
that out don't move in once they get to
hear<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.960> will<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.460> getting<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> CC<00:00:44.850> pulled

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.940 
hear they will be getting the CC pulled
out<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.539> believe<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> two<00:00:46.140> loons<00:00:46.379> will

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
out and I believe the two loons will

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
out and I believe the two loons will
also<00:00:47.430> take<00:00:47.700> out<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.270> defense<00:00:48.750> there<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
also take out that defense there the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.750 
also take out that defense there the
only<00:00:49.590> reason<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.860> threw<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> hog<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.489> there<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
only reason I threw a hog in there is

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
only reason I threw a hog in there is
there<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.030> loon<00:00:51.300> there<00:00:51.570> he<00:00:52.199> doesn't<00:00:52.379> affect

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
there is a loon there he doesn't affect

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.979 
there is a loon there he doesn't affect
my<00:00:52.890> my<00:00:53.399> attack<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.360> i<00:00:54.390> thought<00:00:54.570> when<00:00:54.750> i'll<00:00:54.870> go

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
my my attack but i thought when i'll go

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.779 
my my attack but i thought when i'll go
ahead<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.770> far<00:00:55.980> they<00:00:56.129> heroes

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
were hoping to clean up it won't be

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.010 
were hoping to clean up it won't be
dropping<00:00:58.710> bombs<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.129> them<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> once<00:01:00.899> that's

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
dropping bombs on them so once that's

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750

when<00:01:33.570> i<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.020> i'll<00:01:34.170> drop<00:01:34.439> three<00:01:34.890> loons<00:01:35.130> here

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
i want to those to come in and get these

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.810 
i want to those to come in and get these
to<00:01:37.740> take<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.070> that's<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.400> important

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
to take it out that's very important

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.069 
to take it out that's very important
because<00:01:38.850> otherwise<00:01:39.180> islands<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:39.900> start

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
because otherwise islands will start

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.990 
because otherwise islands will start
straying<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.560> outside<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.159> base<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.970> i

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
straying out outside the base so i

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.100 
straying out outside the base so i
really<00:01:42.240> want<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.390> make<00:01:42.479> sure<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> get<00:01:42.930> those

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
really want to make sure and get those

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
them out to a pretty hefty start there

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.229

that<00:05:41.880> I<00:05:42.090> wonder<00:05:42.630> what<00:05:42.750> those<00:05:42.900> two<00:05:42.960> different

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
that I wonder what those two different

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.580 
that I wonder what those two different
is<00:05:43.530> taken<00:05:43.800> out<00:05:43.970> and<00:05:44.970> then<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.570> sea<00:05:46.290> sealer

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
is taken out and then the sea sealer

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.680 
is taken out and then the sea sealer
pulled<00:05:46.920> out<00:05:47.070> so<00:05:47.310> right<00:05:47.490> there<00:05:47.730> that<00:05:48.270> goes<00:05:48.450> down

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
pulled out so right there that goes down

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.620 
pulled out so right there that goes down
boom<00:05:49.290> it<00:05:49.680> goes<00:05:49.890> down<00:05:50.100> everything's<00:05:50.340> out<00:05:50.790> so

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
boom it goes down everything's out so

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.300 
boom it goes down everything's out so
we'll<00:05:51.750> fast<00:05:51.990> forward<00:05:52.110> about<00:05:52.290> that<00:05:52.710> first<00:05:52.890> min

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
we'll fast forward about that first min

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.530 
we'll fast forward about that first min
which<00:05:53.460> is<00:05:53.550> a<00:05:53.610> little<00:05:53.880> bit<00:05:54.000> I<00:05:54.030> guess<00:05:54.180> I<00:05:54.420> was

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
which is a little bit I guess I was

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.600 
which is a little bit I guess I was
cutting<00:05:54.750> it<00:05:54.870> pretty<00:05:54.900> close<00:05:55.110> there<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:56.280> second

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
cutting it pretty close there the second

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.430 
cutting it pretty close there the second
one<00:05:56.730> was<00:05:56.760> out<00:05:57.180> of<00:05:57.210> range<00:05:57.510> so<00:05:57.840> it<00:05:58.080> really<00:05:58.260> helped

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
one was out of range so it really helped

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.930 
one was out of range so it really helped
me<00:05:58.530> get<00:05:58.620> that<00:05:58.830> those<00:05:59.160> troops<00:05:59.640> pulled<00:05:59.760> out<00:05:59.910> a

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
me get that those troops pulled out a

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.300 
me get that those troops pulled out a
little<00:06:00.090> bit<00:06:00.300> and<00:06:00.510> then<00:06:00.960> again<00:06:01.230> the<00:06:01.770> witch<00:06:01.950> on<00:06:02.250> a

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
little bit and then again the witch on a

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.730 
little bit and then again the witch on a
on<00:06:02.640> a<00:06:02.700> attack<00:06:03.540> like<00:06:03.750> that<00:06:03.780> means<00:06:04.500> almost

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
on a attack like that means almost

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.820 
on a attack like that means almost
nothing<00:06:04.950> no<00:06:05.610> big<00:06:05.820> deal<00:06:05.850> at<00:06:06.150> all<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:07.140> wizard

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
nothing no big deal at all the wizard

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.020 
nothing no big deal at all the wizard
was<00:06:08.010> really<00:06:08.250> the<00:06:08.340> only<00:06:08.370> thing<00:06:08.610> I<00:06:08.700> was<00:06:08.790> worried

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
was really the only thing I was worried

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.640 
was really the only thing I was worried
about<00:06:09.060> taking<00:06:09.510> out<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:10.140> archers<00:06:10.530> and

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
about taking out and the archers and

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.410 
about taking out and the archers and
they<00:06:11.070> went<00:06:11.250> down<00:06:11.340> very<00:06:11.400> quickly<00:06:11.820> so<00:06:12.180> once<00:06:12.360> that

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
they went down very quickly so once that

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.210 
they went down very quickly so once that
was<00:06:12.660> down<00:06:12.900> I<00:06:13.170> knew<00:06:13.620> all<00:06:13.770> that<00:06:13.890> was<00:06:14.010> going<00:06:14.070> to<00:06:14.160> be
