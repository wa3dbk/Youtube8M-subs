00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.210
 so this is the second day of our experiment 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:15.719
 in the anthill now you see the past 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:24.660
 our bunkers and this is us and I am 0 tons 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:29.550
 he has a lot of ants running around 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.309
 back and forth and they extended this single 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.020
 see how big it became 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.520
 his work is in full swing here now 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.690
 work and clean away 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.660
 stamens like that for the night they 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.620
 increased the anthill even in the morning and not yet 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.739
 it was her holes not so much 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.649
 increased fun bunker staff responded 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.600
 the bunker did not become a banker they are shorter 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.140
 overwhelmed him here look staying foot 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.140
 going on 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.979
 this is a crowd of ants who 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:20.560
 constantly digging forward even before our eyes 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.560
 seen as extended for the gathering 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.679
 surprisingly generally difficult c not getting tired 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.119
 yes this speed I thought that they 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.119
 only slightly extended this entrance 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:54.319
 but here mimics got all the ants 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:02:00.200
 what is in our anthill is also here 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:00.200
 underground connection course t with 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:11.849
 continuation of the fun bunker here 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.299
 cheerful bunker there you are at all until the 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:24.810
 Well, its remnants in one entrance filled up 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:32.010
 shorter than the given a care 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:35.959
 the main entrance and the main burrow can 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.959
 watch these ants 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:49.639
 in general there are few who go and few 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.639
 It turns out except that only render and puppies 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:12.670
 You see, the group that takes away 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:21.980
 grains of sand and then goes back down unis 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:27.940
 all down and carry the extra main place in 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.860
 which workers continue their work 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:36.170
 but now there are fewer of them why don't you 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:40.010
 I know why there seems to be somewhere else 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.920
 one move but it is not along the glass and sometimes 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.210
 he disappeared of the ants you have it 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.210
 again a lot came running 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:04:01.250
 here is the active expansion of the anthill 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:04.760
 the appearance of rooms 1 crossroads ants 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:13.240
 wants can go where she wants can 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:16.400
 go to right can go left here and 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:22.090
 same says the ant enters he can go 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:26.630
 go to the right and this level decided to go 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:34.880
 to street 1 and such a crossroad this turn 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:37.790
 leads up to the connection of two tunnels here 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.600
 we can see ducks such an appendix 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.240
 which the ants meets the dough go 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:54.560
 extend the entrance to the intersection 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:57.100
 and those that enter the bottom of the fun 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.100
 bunker 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.900
 here 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.620
 Well, actually this is all what you have achieved 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.599
 our ants 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.599
 during this time
