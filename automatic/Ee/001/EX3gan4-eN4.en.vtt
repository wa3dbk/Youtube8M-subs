front hub and steering knuckle these
things<00:00:41.270> tend<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.600> break<00:00:41.780> pretty<00:00:42.440> easy<00:00:43.150> here's

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150

the HR hot racing one on the right and
here's<00:00:54.500> pretty<00:00:55.190> much<00:00:55.339> what<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:55.550> looks<00:00:55.670> like

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
here's pretty much what it looks like

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.380 
here's pretty much what it looks like
when<00:00:56.000> they<00:00:56.390> are<00:00:56.420> together<00:00:56.900> and<00:00:57.610> then<00:00:58.610> we're

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
when they are together and then we're

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.910 
when they are together and then we're
gonna<00:00:59.480> tackle<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.409> arms<00:01:00.980> next<00:01:02.589> with<00:01:03.589> the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
gonna tackle the a arms next with the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.180 
gonna tackle the a arms next with the
arms<00:01:04.610> we<00:01:05.030> ran<00:01:05.420> into<00:01:05.600> some<00:01:05.840> issues<00:01:06.130> here's<00:01:07.130> a

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
arms we ran into some issues here's a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.040 
arms we ran into some issues here's a
stock<00:01:07.430> Arum<00:01:07.790> what's<00:01:08.000> never<00:01:08.210> been<00:01:08.300> never<00:01:08.960> been

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
stock Arum what's never been never been

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.380 
stock Arum what's never been never been
broken<00:01:09.350> anything<00:01:09.620> but<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.770> decided<00:01:10.010> to<00:01:10.130> try<00:01:10.310> the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
broken anything but I decided to try the

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.930 
broken anything but I decided to try the
RPM<00:01:11.390> ones<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.840> just<00:01:11.960> upgrade<00:01:12.290> everything

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
RPM ones and just upgrade everything

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.580 
RPM ones and just upgrade everything
well<00:01:13.940> I<00:01:13.970> had<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.180> chance<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:14.900> here's<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.260> RPM

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
well I had the chance so here's the RPM

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.350 
well I had the chance so here's the RPM
ones<00:01:15.800> as<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:16.100> can<00:01:16.310> tell<00:01:16.580> there's<00:01:16.909> actually

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
ones as you can tell there's actually

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.580 
ones as you can tell there's actually
quite<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.690> bit<00:01:17.900> of<00:01:17.990> difference<00:01:18.229> in<00:01:18.320> thickness

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
quite a bit of difference in thickness

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.730 
quite a bit of difference in thickness
and<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:20.090> shape<00:01:20.300> of<00:01:20.330> them<00:01:20.570> but<00:01:20.930> there<00:01:21.530> are<00:01:21.560> some

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
and the shape of them but there are some

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.690 
and the shape of them but there are some
problems<00:01:21.890> with<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.159> arms<00:01:22.399> and<00:01:22.460> we'll<00:01:22.610> get

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
problems with the arms and we'll get

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.109 
problems with the arms and we'll get
into<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:22.969> right<00:01:23.180> here<00:01:24.670> so<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.759> problem<00:01:26.030> with

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
into that right here so the problem with

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.440 
into that right here so the problem with
the<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.240> arms<00:01:26.630> was<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.320> holes<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.610> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
the a arms was the holes that the the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.800 
the a arms was the holes that the the
pin<00:01:29.600> goes<00:01:29.810> into<00:01:30.790> where<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:31.850> mounts<00:01:31.939> on<00:01:32.329> your

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
pin goes into where it mounts on your

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.950 
pin goes into where it mounts on your
chassis<00:01:33.200> were<00:01:33.560> way<00:01:34.100> too<00:01:34.130> tight<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.840> air

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
chassis were way too tight the the air

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.080 
chassis were way too tight the the air
would<00:01:36.229> not<00:01:36.380> move<00:01:36.649> up<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:36.920> down<00:01:37.039> freely<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:37.850> we

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
would not move up and down freely so we

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.539 
would not move up and down freely so we
had<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.299> drill<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.570> hole<00:01:38.750> out<00:01:39.039> so<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.340> pin

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
had to drill the hole out so the pin

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.639 
had to drill the hole out so the pin
would<00:01:40.850> go<00:01:41.119> in<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.479> out<00:01:41.539> freely<00:01:41.780> like<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:42.289> see

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
would go in and out freely like you see

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:43.899 
would go in and out freely like you see
it<00:01:42.740> here<00:01:42.920> pretty<00:01:43.310> much<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.549> had<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.700> pull<00:01:43.820> it

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
it here pretty much you had to pull it

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.830 
it here pretty much you had to pull it
out<00:01:43.939> with<00:01:44.090> pliers<00:01:44.360> before<00:01:44.869> I<00:01:44.899> did<00:01:45.110> this<00:01:46.840> right

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
out with pliers before I did this right

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.959 
out with pliers before I did this right
here<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.109> picture<00:01:48.409> of<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:48.920> arm<00:01:49.280> on<00:01:49.579> and

the<00:02:07.310> stock<00:02:07.490> parts<00:02:07.760> on<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.970> left<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.330> blow

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
the stock parts on the left of the blow

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.980 
the stock parts on the left of the blow
see<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:11.090> here's<00:02:11.270> another<00:02:11.420> shot<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:11.810> as

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
see so here's another shot of that as

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.500 
see so here's another shot of that as
well<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.640> actually<00:02:13.640> with<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.790> RPM<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.270> arms

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
well and actually with the RPM a arms

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.990 
well and actually with the RPM a arms
there's<00:02:15.200> some<00:02:15.530> rubbing<00:02:15.920> on<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.400> right<00:02:16.670> wheel

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
there's some rubbing on the right wheel

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.870 
there's some rubbing on the right wheel
which<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:17.750> kind<00:02:17.959> of<00:02:18.020> weird<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.580> I'm<00:02:19.670> just

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
which is kind of weird so I'm just

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.190 
which is kind of weird so I'm just
trying<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.270> some<00:02:20.450> bigger<00:02:20.600> wheels<00:02:20.810> Rita<00:02:21.050> that

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
trying it some bigger wheels Rita that

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.460 
trying it some bigger wheels Rita that
are<00:02:21.320> thrown<00:02:21.800> back<00:02:21.950> on<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.730> stock<00:02:23.540> arms<00:02:24.110> for

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
are thrown back on the stock arms for

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.930 
are thrown back on the stock arms for
some<00:02:24.590> reason<00:02:24.860> there<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.130> some<00:02:25.310> some<00:02:25.670> rubbing

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
some reason there is some some rubbing

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.699 
some reason there is some some rubbing
you<00:02:26.060> can<00:02:26.180> see<00:02:26.390> there's<00:02:27.320> quite<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.500> bit<00:02:27.650> of

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
you can see there's quite a bit of

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.800 
you can see there's quite a bit of
difference<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.300> thickness<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
difference in the thickness and the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.600 
difference in the thickness and the
width<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.680> air<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.130> here's<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.430> front

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
width of the air so here's a front

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.550 
width of the air so here's a front
bumper<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.090> sangs<00:02:32.750> definitely<00:02:33.140> got<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.350> go

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
bumper the sangs definitely got to go

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.840 
bumper the sangs definitely got to go
that's<00:02:34.160> total<00:02:35.560> no<00:02:36.560> protection<00:02:36.920> at<00:02:37.010> all<00:02:37.130> as<00:02:37.459> you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
that's total no protection at all as you

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.280 
that's total no protection at all as you
can<00:02:38.180> tell<00:02:38.360> right<00:02:38.540> here<00:02:38.600> with<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:38.930> picture

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
can tell right here with this picture

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.190 
can tell right here with this picture
you<00:02:39.470> can<00:02:39.620> see<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:40.180> smaller<00:02:41.180> one<00:02:41.450> on<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:42.020> right

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
you can see the smaller one on the right

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.780 
you can see the smaller one on the right
is<00:02:42.350> actually<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.890> stock<00:02:43.130> bumper<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.670> then

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
is actually the stock bumper and then

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.070 
is actually the stock bumper and then
there's<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.000> t-bone<00:02:44.330> one<00:02:44.570> on<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.810> left-hand

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
there's a t-bone one on the left-hand

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.130 
there's a t-bone one on the left-hand
side<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.860> huge<00:02:46.040> improvement<00:02:46.520> there<00:02:46.670> and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
side so a huge improvement there and

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.050 
side so a huge improvement there and
that's<00:02:48.140> what<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.350> t-bone<00:02:48.620> Racing<00:02:49.060> bumper

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
that's what the t-bone Racing bumper

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.990 
that's what the t-bone Racing bumper
looks<00:02:50.150> like<00:02:50.390> when<00:02:50.570> it's<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:51.070> there's<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.190> quite

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
looks like when it's on there's a quite

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.699 
looks like when it's on there's a quite
a<00:02:53.030> bit<00:02:53.180> more<00:02:53.330> protection<00:02:53.480> there<00:02:53.900> definitely

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
a bit more protection there definitely

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.229 
a bit more protection there definitely
something<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.130> need<00:02:55.220> on<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.550> car<00:02:55.760> and

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.460

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
in tackle taking out the stock shock

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.720 
in tackle taking out the stock shock
towers<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.650> shock<00:03:18.920> towers<00:03:19.130> are<00:03:19.250> aluminum<00:03:19.610> but

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
towers the shock towers are aluminum but

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.920 
towers the shock towers are aluminum but
I<00:03:19.910> just<00:03:20.060> wanted<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.360> put<00:03:20.510> some<00:03:20.660> different<00:03:20.750> ones

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
I just wanted to put some different ones

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.170 
I just wanted to put some different ones
on<00:03:21.140> there<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:22.489> reason<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:22.790> decided<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.120> go

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
on there and the reason I decided to go

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.970 
on there and the reason I decided to go
with<00:03:23.269> this<00:03:23.570> this<00:03:23.930> one<00:03:24.110> this<00:03:24.140> is<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.500> driven

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
with this this one this is a driven

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.240 
with this this one this is a driven
productions<00:03:25.959> Delrin<00:03:26.959> shock<00:03:27.320> tower<00:03:27.530> as<00:03:28.070> you

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
productions Delrin shock tower as you

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.890 
productions Delrin shock tower as you
can<00:03:28.370> see<00:03:28.459> there's<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.209> place<00:03:29.390> for<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.630> shocks

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
can see there's a place for the shocks

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.110 
can see there's a place for the shocks
to<00:03:30.320> actually<00:03:30.860> get<00:03:31.519> some<00:03:31.640> protection<00:03:31.790> the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
to actually get some protection the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.000 
to actually get some protection the
shocks<00:03:32.330> go<00:03:32.480> under<00:03:32.660> there<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:32.810> little<00:03:32.959> bit<00:03:33.140> so

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
shocks go under there a little bit so

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.560 
shocks go under there a little bit so
you<00:03:34.100> don't<00:03:34.130> break<00:03:34.370> shot<00:03:34.580> caps<00:03:34.850> as<00:03:35.030> much<00:03:35.209> and

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
you don't break shot caps as much and

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.440 
you don't break shot caps as much and
with<00:03:35.750> low<00:03:35.930> C<00:03:35.989> Mini<00:03:36.290> 8<00:03:36.440> there's<00:03:37.269> definitely<00:03:38.269> an

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
with low C Mini 8 there's definitely an

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.840 
with low C Mini 8 there's definitely an
issue<00:03:38.600> with<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.530> shocks<00:03:39.799> as<00:03:40.130> everybody<00:03:40.700> knows

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
issue with the shocks as everybody knows

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.030 
issue with the shocks as everybody knows
that<00:03:41.030> has<00:03:41.180> one<00:03:41.420> shot<00:03:42.260> caps<00:03:42.470> break<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:42.920> that

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
that has one shot caps break and that

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.420 
that has one shot caps break and that
ball<00:03:43.400> ends<00:03:43.610> break<00:03:43.910> on<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.150> end<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:46.250> here's

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
ball ends break on the end so here's

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.160 
ball ends break on the end so here's
what<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.549> looks<00:03:46.700> like<00:03:46.790> installed<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:49.840> here<00:03:50.840> is

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
what it looks like installed and here is

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.789 
what it looks like installed and here is
another<00:03:51.590> picture<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:53.090> installed<00:03:53.709> it's<00:03:54.709> a

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
another picture of it installed it's a

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.140 
another picture of it installed it's a
nice<00:03:54.920> close-up<00:03:55.160> as<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.459> can<00:03:55.549> see<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.910> shocks

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
nice close-up as you can see the shocks

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.870 
nice close-up as you can see the shocks
actually<00:03:56.690> have<00:03:57.160> some<00:03:58.160> more<00:03:58.400> protection<00:03:58.760> on

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
actually have some more protection on

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.060 
actually have some more protection on
the<00:03:58.970> top<00:03:59.150> right<00:03:59.390> there<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:00.799> that's<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:00.980> main

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
the top right there so that's the main

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.860 
the top right there so that's the main
reason<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:01.340> went<00:04:01.430> with<00:04:01.519> that<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:01.970> now<00:04:02.750> it's

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
reason I went with that and now it's

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.680 
reason I went with that and now it's
time<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.019> start<00:04:03.260> on<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.560> back<00:04:03.799> end<00:04:04.070> of<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.430> car

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
time to start on the back end of the car

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.039 
time to start on the back end of the car
alright<00:04:05.690> so<00:04:06.230> here's<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.859> difference<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.250> the

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
alright so here's a difference of the

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.950 
alright so here's a difference of the
stock<00:04:09.049> air<00:04:09.320> immerses<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:10.180> rpma<00:04:11.180> arm<00:04:11.389> for<00:04:11.750> the

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
stock air immerses the rpma arm for the

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.330 
stock air immerses the rpma arm for the
your<00:04:12.130> big<00:04:13.130> difference<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:15.170> that's<00:04:16.160> what<00:04:16.250> it

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
your big difference and that's what it

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.470 
your big difference and that's what it
looks<00:04:16.370> like<00:04:16.610> with<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:19.340> rear<00:04:20.000> knuckle<00:04:20.420> on

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
looks like with the the rear knuckle on

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.930 
looks like with the the rear knuckle on
the<00:04:20.660> low<00:04:21.020> C<00:04:21.170> beneath<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.770> the<00:04:22.180> rpma<00:04:23.180> arm<00:04:23.500> and

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
the low C beneath and the rpma arm and

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.370 
the low C beneath and the rpma arm and
there's<00:04:25.940> another<00:04:26.060> close-up<00:04:26.330> shot<00:04:26.720> now<00:04:27.260> with

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
there's another close-up shot now with

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.040 
there's another close-up shot now with

just thought the HR one looks cool with
that<00:04:59.450> logo<00:04:59.690> right<00:04:59.900> in<00:04:59.990> the<00:05:00.080> center<00:05:00.290> there<00:05:00.320> and

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
that logo right in the center there and

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.780 
that logo right in the center there and
next<00:05:03.410> we're<00:05:03.500> gonna<00:05:03.560> as<00:05:04.040> you<00:05:04.130> can<00:05:04.250> see<00:05:04.370> there's

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
next we're gonna as you can see there's

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.690 
next we're gonna as you can see there's
no<00:05:05.000> protection<00:05:05.780> in<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.080> back<00:05:06.430> most<00:05:07.430> buggies

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
no protection in the back most buggies

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.740 
no protection in the back most buggies
don't<00:05:07.850> have<00:05:07.940> protection<00:05:08.090> in<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.420> back<00:05:08.540> but<00:05:08.720> I

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
don't have protection in the back but I

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.360 
don't have protection in the back but I
decided<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.110> put<00:05:09.170> on<00:05:09.320> a<00:05:09.380> rear<00:05:09.770> bumper<00:05:10.130> for<00:05:10.310> the

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
decided to put on a rear bumper for the

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.740 
decided to put on a rear bumper for the
low<00:05:10.460> C<00:05:10.610> mediate<00:05:10.880> so<00:05:11.060> saves<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.510> wing<00:05:11.630> a<00:05:11.720> little

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
low C mediate so saves the wing a little

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.000 
low C mediate so saves the wing a little
bit<00:05:12.080> because<00:05:12.440> I've<00:05:12.530> already<00:05:12.620> cracked<00:05:12.920> the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
bit because I've already cracked the

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.730 
bit because I've already cracked the
wing<00:05:13.130> home<00:05:13.310> just<00:05:13.580> a<00:05:13.640> few<00:05:13.790> runs<00:05:13.940> I've<00:05:14.090> had<00:05:14.240> on<00:05:14.390> it

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
wing home just a few runs I've had on it
