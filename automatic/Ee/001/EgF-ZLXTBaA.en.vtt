00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.750
 hello I am I explained it was like the republic about that the first goal 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.740
 From Ricardo 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.740
 because remove cheaper than others and all the factors that affect 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:14.249
 the first thing that nothing takes away in favor of art for a hundred some will sign exotic 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.509
 wood orchid that are more common 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.469
 obviously he the decision factor of the wood that is used is going to affect 

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:21.650
 the price of this one 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.300
 if in some way it only grows at a decisive moment of the year in a 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.550
 remote region of the world is obviously going to affect the price kill it 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.729
 additional to this 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:36.039
 we must also consider that the train confrontation and assembly 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.660
 by many companies they have several Easter divisions in their garden 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.880
 pursue more view in its place in the world 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.240
 to cut costs percent 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.810
 of local labor hour 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.000
 that or is obviously to follow instrument that has a percent lower value 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.230
 it is not that it is of lesser quality it simply has another efe process in the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.380
 manufacturing 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.410
 n the pieces 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.180
 some federer 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.000
 they are of regularity the smaller filming would give me majors only goes also 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.110
 would affect to undermine the final value of the instrument 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.040
 percent 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.130
 the fis and is for a hundred 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.899
 all kinds other guy missed them being 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.910
 will determine the book value 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.750
 of the instrument 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.750
 mainly the number one factor in wood 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.710
 we have to understand what it is 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.070
 the hero something natural not all places have a one at all for the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.640
 evidence of correct health 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.650
 sometimes to get the best tone in which seas in places the alleged aggressor 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.670
 that will cost you and it will be the role of the determinant behind the anger 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.890
 additional to this read 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.110
 usually guitar manufacturing in the united states has a value 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.720
 and a higher cost 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.010
 poblet percent the labor law see 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.680
 the alert about it 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.890
 of salary which all this affects 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.370
 there we have to see the mbe the manifestation of magic against 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.020
 manufactures in your hand a human work will always come out more expensive believes 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.139
 that the machine 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.139
 because they can produce more in a short time 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:17.869
 for at the end of the day when it is going to be very hard commits to rajoy to say 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:19.569
 examining other factors 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.709
 percent and follows a collection piece obviously 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.649
 you will have to read 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:29.459
 analyze what way that is left thing they want that they will send ibaka 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.829
 part of its value 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:32.969
 ee 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:38.119
 if there is no league and look accompanying almost electric branches plus they are 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.549
 just as good as it said 72 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.479
 they make you retain the value the increase you want when you entered high quality 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:50.959
 after all a little bit of luisa chappe competent dead you go very 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.199
 good results 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.739
 fc2 on the day of the return of the approximate hector Solomon
