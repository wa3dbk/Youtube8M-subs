for a digital copy of Nintendo land now
this<00:00:57.570> probably<00:00:57.809> isn't<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.230> be

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
this probably isn't going to be

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.260 
this probably isn't going to be
satisfying<00:00:58.859> everybody<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.820> some<00:01:00.030> people

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
satisfying everybody because some people

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.119 
satisfying everybody because some people
might<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.050> physical<00:01:01.590> copy<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
might really want that physical copy and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.369 
might really want that physical copy and
well<00:01:02.789> having<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> digital<00:01:03.899> copy<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.229> just

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
well having the digital copy is just

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.810 
well having the digital copy is just
gonna<00:01:04.470> take<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.830> space<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> Wii<00:01:05.489> U<00:01:05.640> but

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
gonna take up space on the Wii U but

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.640 
gonna take up space on the Wii U but
nevertheless<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.689> least<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> copy<00:01:07.439> of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
nevertheless at least you get a copy of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.289 
nevertheless at least you get a copy of
Nintendo<00:01:08.040> land<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.280> guess<00:01:08.310> next<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.150> every

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
Nintendo land I guess next up is every

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
Nintendo land I guess next up is every
year<00:01:09.390> some<00:01:09.570> details<00:01:09.960> about<00:01:10.049> nycos<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.040> boost

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
year some details about nycos you boost

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.980 
year some details about nycos you boost
for<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> Wii<00:01:11.909> U<00:01:12.210> gamepad<00:01:12.720> which<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
for the Wii U gamepad which is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
for the Wii U gamepad which is
essentially<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.619> battery<00:01:13.979> extension<00:01:14.820> so

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
essentially a battery extension so

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.060 
essentially a battery extension so
basically<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.930> boost<00:01:16.170> attaches<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
basically the you boost attaches to the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.830 
basically the you boost attaches to the
back<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> Wii<00:01:17.820> U<00:01:18.030> gamepad<00:01:18.479> there's<00:01:18.689> no

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
back of the Wii U gamepad there's no

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
back of the Wii U gamepad there's no
modification<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:19.799> tools<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.670> required

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
modification or tools that are required

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.640 
modification or tools that are required
I<00:01:21.210> guess<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.509> attaches<00:01:21.840> somehow<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
I guess it just attaches somehow and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.740 
I guess it just attaches somehow and
then<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.430> works<00:01:23.610> together<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> internal

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
then it works together with the internal

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.450 
then it works together with the internal
battery<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.229> gives<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> about<00:01:25.680> two<00:01:26.130> times

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
battery and it gives you about two times

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.090 
battery and it gives you about two times
