00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.819
 choices that you want to enjoy for a long time 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.819
 therefore choose high for smart maintenance of skoda 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.129
 skoda maintenance 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.300
 there is a simple way to keep a skoda in top condition 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.329
 professional and regular maintenance 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.319
 when you have your car serviced by a skoda dealer 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.179
 I am not only assured of a car that drives like new but also of 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.179
 a longer service life and a higher residual value 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.800
 at skoda you can choose from two variants 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.480
 fixed or long live maintenance 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.400
 both consist of a basic turn 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 always depends on age and mileage 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.810
 possible packages for spark plugs aex over additional inspections 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.560
 what is the difference between fixed and long live maintenance 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.460
 with fast maintenance you get every year whether there is also a 15,000 kilometer alternately 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.950
 of large or small maintenance servers 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.590
 the best choice if you want to have your car checked every year or if you have one 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.350
 want to pay a lower price for maintenance 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.220
 with long live maintenance also called variable maintenance 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.650
 geertje skoda himself when a service is needed 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.950
 after two years of contraction, mizzi has previously driven a maximum of 30,000 kilometers 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 that depends on your driving style and driving behavior 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.690
 an unwise turn is more expensive because more inspections are needed and one 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.160
 high-quality and therefore more expensive oil is used 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.600
 but you can then also advance a land mine again 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.610
 long live is the best choice when as little as possible for maintenance but you 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.470
 that the world 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.470
