00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.900
 so we have on the review the car deu 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.139
 nexia and i its owner already 3 4 went 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.519
 Goths in September 11 , he was bought 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.289
 here and let us go with you i 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.050
 I'll tell you a little about him 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.490
 there were shoals what inconvenience what 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.730
 actually why did i get in and what is it worth 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.310
 immediately know the car enthusiast before 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.900
 buy it well first is the engine 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.329
 we have 1 and 5 liters 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.840
 that is, there are 80 something horses no longer 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.820
 I remember in principle its enough if you 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.730
 do not turn on the air conditioner 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.100
 These are the cases but if you include 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.260
 summer concerto pancake traction at all 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.670
 enough even if one person in the cabin 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.420
 is it 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.629
 and it is very, very freezing 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.079
 then the next such minus is wild 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.690
 just gasoline consumption unreal wild well 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.210
 imagine the daewoo nexia 1 and 5 liters and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.129
 take some nissan teana 2 with 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.369
 half liter which eats less 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.950
 about 30 percent gasoline than daeus 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.200
 nexia 1 and 5 is just like space 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.650
 some kind of unreal i'm still people 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.250
 which I safely sew this 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.979
 car and will and as they claim 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.619
 there is 30-40 percent less if that 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.810
 I'm sure in the comments 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:31.979
 I will send a reference for Volgograd residents for 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.600
 those who watch this video now and live 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.270
 in the city of Volgograd or adjacent 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.220
 territory may have already appeared bottom 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.909
 reference phone address and so on 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.810
 these people and the actual story of 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.700
 Mommy created a video where I already posted 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.470
 the story of how and where to flash and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.299
 cheap car okay not about that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.850
 it means everything 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.570
 Here I praise this car 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.210
 principle treat them the same thing 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.799
 that there are downsides to this car 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.600
 now let's say I'm sitting now like 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.910
 it would seem exactly 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.190
 the steering wheel is actually a little bit 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.360
 to the right 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.319
 driver's seat and it immediately 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.849
 do you notice when you take new cars 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.670
 when you buy a new car is 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.520
 immediately catches the eye when you 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.830
 you sit down and just have your knuckle 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.660
 is in the passenger seat and this 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.209
 enrages really infuriates but then you get used 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.970
 in principle, but I have loins here 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.519
 starts to hurt I don't know well when 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.200
 We drive an hour and a half there say on 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.470
 standing in traffic or driving 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.290
 somewhere far away like in so on 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.849
 small long-range start spitting because 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.599
 that begin to hurt the loins though 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:53.430
 lateral support itself is quite good 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:56.239
 it means further it well as I said already 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.420
 Conter yes the fact that he is very affected 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.519
 consumes a lot of energy and does not give 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.190
 enough to develop the amount of power 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.360
 but he is also weak ie in the summer he blows 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.520
 just how to say just 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.490
 blows you like a fan 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.130
 works in principle ac otherwise 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.380
 very cool wrinkle 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.140
 so she swallows a kidney can not 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.250
 Jelly And here I already traveled fifty dollars I not 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.710
 changed nothing on the chassis yet 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.150
 quietly have a wife dependent on 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.120
 Except only there consumable 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.160
 materials that are already on their own 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.170
 come on run before replacing them here 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.390
 so well, who can ride such 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.670
 cars that's what people think 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.239
 average average income just below yes 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.270
 Well, here I am with you a little bit disagree 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:54.740
 now if you look at me now yes 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.930
 it is not clear what wealth I am 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.150
 in principle, it is not clear 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.209
 I drive a car in the mix it's mine 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:10.030
 officially belongs to me i ride on 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:12.469
 it already well, as it were now, such as 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.889
 the features are what I am on it 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:18.440
 there are days he me I have the opportunity 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.989
 change but what's the point of changing it 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.270
 if he is very reliable here is the only 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.850
 just that he really eats a lot 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.449
 eats a lot of fuel here and the rest is 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.419
 cool car for people who 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.970
 know a lot about saving money if you do it 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.639
 miscalculate then it will just be underwater 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.300
 work like a Tajik who brought 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.610
 for free illegally in Russia and so 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.520
 Further, but no offense of course there Tajiks 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:52.120
 there are very smart people mostly like this 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:55.460
 a stereotype formed them which means further 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.710
 what I wanted to tell you is that 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.520
 no armrest here guys 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.729
 no armrests which is annoying here 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.060
 This is for those who have already traveled to the class. 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.490
 higher car class car higher 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.680
 but of course there are no pillows 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:19.639
 safety what it is all about 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:22.070
 hardcore turns out means there is no 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.940
 no about this or any 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.690
 additional components that 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.909
 contribute to passenger safety and 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.460
 there is no such driver here either 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:37.699
 I really want to mention something very 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.490
 wacky right here mirrors 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.490
 but simply unreal stupid 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:47.210
 this mirror here is just 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:51.370
 flat but here's a little bit more Bo less 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:57.470
 some kind of how she say convex 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:06:05.380
 where some diaphragm has this one 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:10.000
 no here on the barrier like hind legs 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:12.949
 will break themselves shorter if cho 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.580
 here if especially the front passenger 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:21.050
 the forward type of chair is sure to 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:25.909
 back something necessarily from from like 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:28.550
 say so aches mean what else glove box 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:31.280
 generally stupid just wildly stupid 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.020
 there is no a4 glove compartment 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.520
 here's an accordion folding so he goes there 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:40.370
 climbed and closed damn it here I cloak 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.979
 annoying damn well I don't know for whom 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.690
 cars but for office workers 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.550
 It definitely does not fit because 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.389
 glove box nothing to put absolutely 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.639
 nothing to put 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:56.960
 Only there is a watch I do not know socks and 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:59.570
 the phone is just no 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.180
 there is no mirror here for disks 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:06.050
 By the way lies the radio tape recorder here already reads 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.810
 CDs from 11 years here please mp3 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:12.020
 sit and music you by the way real 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.969
 good music is worth it that tried 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.259
 make uzbek duck this good music 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:20.750
 really mean the trunk I'll show you 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:23.330
 now a little later maybe in another form 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:27.830
 because I'm a little busy at the 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.300
 me after the wedding photo session all all 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.259
 until 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.259
 in short everything
