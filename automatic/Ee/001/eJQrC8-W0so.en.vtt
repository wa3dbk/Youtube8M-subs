00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
matter of fact know that she drive long

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.640 
matter of fact know that she drive long
hauls<00:01:17.400> she<00:01:17.790> drives<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:18.930> her<00:01:19.080> patients<00:01:19.590> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
hauls she drives to see her patients and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.740 
hauls she drives to see her patients and
some<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.490> them<00:01:20.580> are<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.820> reservations<00:01:21.479> that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
some of them are on reservations that

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.590 
some of them are on reservations that
are<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.080> hundreds<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.500> miles<00:01:22.650> away<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> so

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
are just hundreds of miles away and so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.060 
are just hundreds of miles away and so
what<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.080> difference<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.650> all

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
what what is the difference there all

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.940 
what what is the difference there all
along<00:01:26.759> whole

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
along whole

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.779 
along whole
does<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.729> run<00:01:29.149> longer<00:01:29.509> and<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:30.140> would<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:31.280> would

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
does it run longer and I would I would

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.060 
does it run longer and I would I would
say<00:01:31.969> 6,000<00:01:32.570> miles<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:33.110> can't<00:01:33.289> be<00:01:33.649> done<00:01:33.829> to

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
say 6,000 miles I can't be done to

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.039 
say 6,000 miles I can't be done to
change<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:34.789> she<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:35.119> basically<00:01:35.659> being<00:01:35.810> ripped

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
change so she is basically being ripped

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.600 
change so she is basically being ripped
off<00:01:36.229> if<00:01:36.469> they're<00:01:36.649> making<00:01:36.799> her<00:01:37.039> comeback<00:01:37.250> every

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
off if they're making her comeback every

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.529 
off if they're making her comeback every
3,000<00:01:38.149> miles

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
3,000 miles

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.450 
3,000 miles
