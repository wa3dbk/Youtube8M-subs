00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.910 
originally a mechanical engineer and
actually<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.299> started<00:01:54.720> out<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> service

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
actually I started out as a service

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.310 
actually I started out as a service
station<00:01:56.240> mechanic<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> mechanic<00:01:58.200> on

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
station mechanic I was the mechanic on

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.120 
station mechanic I was the mechanic on
duty

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
duty

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.069 
duty
way<00:01:59.549> back<00:01:59.790> when<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
way back when and

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.959 
way back when and
and<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> went<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> Navy<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.789> went

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
and then I went in the Navy you went

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.139 
and then I went in the Navy you went
into<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:04.289> newest<00:02:04.649> US<00:02:05.070> nuclear<00:02:05.549> submarine

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
into the newest US nuclear submarine

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.080 
into the newest US nuclear submarine
program<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.160> pretty<00:02:08.640> heavy

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
program and that's a pretty heavy

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.630 
program and that's a pretty heavy
education<00:02:10.080> especially<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.039> enlisted<00:02:11.459> man

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
education especially for an enlisted man

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.640 
education especially for an enlisted man
that<00:02:11.910> was<00:02:12.030> quite<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.660> big<00:02:12.900> deal<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.410> then<00:02:13.530> I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that was quite a big deal and then I

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.860 
that was quite a big deal and then I
spent<00:02:13.980> about<00:02:14.550> six<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:15.180> eight<00:02:15.209> years<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
spent about six to eight years in the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.080 
spent about six to eight years in the
Navy<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.160> got<00:02:17.340> out<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.760> went<00:02:17.819> back<00:02:18.060> to

Navy and we got out and went back to
school<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.019> got<00:02:19.230> my<00:02:19.260> mechanical<00:02:19.950> engineering

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
school and got my mechanical engineering

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.509 
school and got my mechanical engineering
degree<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:22.500> University<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.220> Hawaii

party<00:02:30.269> school<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:32.840> after<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:34.040> got<00:02:35.040> through

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
party school and after I got through

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.199 
party school and after I got through
with<00:02:35.840> about<00:02:36.840> 83<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.769> went<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.340> work<00:02:38.459> for<00:02:38.489> General

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.120 
with about 83 I went to work for General
Electric<00:02:39.299> as<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> field<00:02:40.110> engineer<00:02:40.319> now<00:02:40.920> that's

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
Electric as a field engineer now that's

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.589 
Electric as a field engineer now that's
the<00:02:41.250> kind<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.519> an<00:02:41.640> int<00:02:41.790> thats<00:02:42.000> literally<00:02:42.450> of

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
the kind of an int thats literally of

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.210 
the kind of an int thats literally of
engineer<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.260> goes<00:02:43.440> out<00:02:43.680> works<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
engineer that goes out works in the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.449 
engineer that goes out works in the
field<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:45.780> really<00:02:46.440> enjoyed<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.099> lot

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
field and I really enjoyed that a lot

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.780 
field and I really enjoyed that a lot
and<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:48.630> I'm<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.530> hands-on<00:02:50.040> engineer<00:02:50.579> and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
and that's I'm a hands-on engineer and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.589 
and that's I'm a hands-on engineer and
then<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.599> went<00:02:51.810> back<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.140> school<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:53.069> 1990<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.239> I

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
then I went back to school in 1990 and I

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.960 
then I went back to school in 1990 and I
was<00:02:54.810> interested<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.380> materials<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.190> studied

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
was interested in materials and studied

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.330 
was interested in materials and studied
metal<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.599> metallurgy<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.410> now<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.069> called

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
metal and metallurgy and now it's called

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.449 
metal and metallurgy and now it's called
materials<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.120> engineering<00:03:01.019> but<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.560> kind<00:03:02.370> of

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
materials in engineering but I kind of

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.850 
materials in engineering but I kind of
mostly<00:03:03.329> looked<00:03:03.540> at<00:03:03.690> metallurgy<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.470> that's

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
mostly looked at metallurgy and that's

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.550 
mostly looked at metallurgy and that's
kind<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.310> my<00:03:05.370> background<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.480> now<00:03:06.690> give<00:03:07.440> it

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
kind of my background and now give it

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.190 
kind of my background and now give it
back<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:07.920> Mike<00:03:08.239> all<00:03:09.239> right<00:03:09.480> well<00:03:09.720> again

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
different types of metal so from here

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.509 
different types of metal so from here
we're<00:03:19.380> going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> talk<00:03:19.709> about<00:03:19.920> stainless

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
we're going to talk about stainless

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.449 
we're going to talk about stainless
