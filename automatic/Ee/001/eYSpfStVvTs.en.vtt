change<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> didn't<00:00:32.489> find<00:00:32.700> one<00:00:33.770> explicitly

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
change but I didn't find one explicitly

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.380 
change but I didn't find one explicitly
for<00:00:36.899> I'm<00:00:37.430> sorry<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> camera<00:00:39.059> movement

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
for I'm sorry for the camera movement

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.389 
for I'm sorry for the camera movement
here<00:00:40.070> explicitly<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> e<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.840> 50<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.410> even

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
here explicitly for the e to 50 or even

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.970 
here explicitly for the e to 50 or even
actually<00:00:45.110> 150<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> thought<00:00:46.620> I'd<00:00:46.800> do<00:00:46.950> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
actually 150 so what I thought I'd do is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.319 
actually 150 so what I thought I'd do is
I'd<00:00:47.219> show<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.850> little<00:00:48.000> bit<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
I'd show you a little bit of the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.819 
I'd show you a little bit of the
breakdown<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.200> while<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:49.559> getting

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
breakdown of this one while I'm getting

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
breakdown of this one while I'm getting
to<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:51.059> way<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.420> an<00:00:51.539> idea<00:00:51.629> so

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
to it and that way you have an idea so

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
to it and that way you have an idea so
basically<00:00:52.920> we're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
basically we're going to do have to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:05.289 
basically we're going to do have to
remove<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.960> air<00:00:55.350> assembly<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:57.410> probably

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.730 

want<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.780> zoom<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.409> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
want to see if we can zoom in here I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.539 
want to see if we can zoom in here I
think<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:11.340> we're<00:01:11.460> looking

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
think that's it there that we're looking

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.320 
think that's it there that we're looking
at<00:01:11.850> no<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.750> there's<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> fins<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.920> it

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
at no there it is there's the fins of it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.370 
at no there it is there's the fins of it
always<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.390> got<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:15.689> down<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> get

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
always I got to get down there and get

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380 
always I got to get down there and get
to<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.210> pull

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
to that so what I have to do is pull

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.380 
to that so what I have to do is pull
this<00:01:18.540> air<00:01:19.259> filter<00:01:19.740> assembly<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.310> my<00:01:21.150> big

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
this air filter assembly out my big

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.620 
this air filter assembly out my big
deals<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.900> held<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.380> four<00:01:22.590> bolts<00:01:22.860> now

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
deals just held on with four bolts now

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.480 
deals just held on with four bolts now
it's<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:25.220> ring<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.890> we'll<00:01:29.040> pull<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.280> out

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it's a ring there so we'll pull that out

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.060 
it's a ring there so we'll pull that out
and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.720> there's<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.470> two<00:01:31.740> bolts

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
and then there's like I think two bolts

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.399 
and then there's like I think two bolts
that<00:01:32.280> we'll<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.360> undo<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
that we'll have to undo and the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.800 
that we'll have to undo and the
tensioner<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.100> we're<00:01:35.430> done<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:36.479> right<00:01:36.509> let

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
tensioner and we're done all right let

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.240 
tensioner and we're done all right let
me<00:01:36.840> take<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.200> off<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.860> let<00:01:37.950> me<00:01:38.040> take<00:01:38.220> that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
me take this off so let me take that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.649 
me take this off so let me take that
I'll<00:01:38.640> take<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> camera<00:01:39.180> off<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.540> I'll

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
I'll take the camera off and then I'll

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.800 
I'll take the camera off and then I'll
take<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.869> shot<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.290> off<00:01:41.390> all<00:01:42.390> right<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
take a shot of it off all right so to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.929 
take a shot of it off all right so to
remove<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.829> start<00:01:44.159> by<00:01:44.250> removing<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.759> air

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
remove we start by removing the air

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.690 
remove we start by removing the air
filter<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:45.509> their<00:01:45.780> filter<00:01:46.380> housing<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
filter here their filter housing to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.800 
filter here their filter housing to
start<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> remove<00:01:48.770> these<00:01:49.770> four<00:01:50.810> bolts

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
start we have to remove these four bolts

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.840 
start we have to remove these four bolts
here<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.990 

loosen<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:56.780> take<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.530> off<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.250> then<00:01:58.909> the

whole piece of come out that way you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.820 
whole piece of come out that way you
don't<00:02:00.140> have<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:00.470> take<00:02:00.650> off<00:02:00.830> here<00:02:02.650> do<00:02:03.650> your
