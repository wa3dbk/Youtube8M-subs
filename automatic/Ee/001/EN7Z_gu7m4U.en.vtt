00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:07.069
 the global world cup of mexico-86 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.860
 full of great surprises idols and 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.780
 great goals and manuel negrete scored one 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.150
 of the most beautiful goals in history 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.750
 of the worlds that today to almost 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.200
 28 years we all remember it 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:25.520
 the goal of negredo extraordinary as 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:29.150
 They raise me was timely was beautiful 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.250
 or important balls one of the best 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.190
 that I have seen, it is simply taken out of 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.860
 the sleeve and hits a formidable goal he 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.410
 normally it's going to be his 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.550
 the pumas team actually practiced it 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.290
 Much along with new Sanchez 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.100
 this again 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100
 value 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.540
 in an unusual celebration the Basque Javier 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.809
 aguirre after the great goal gives him a zape 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.590
 to manuel negrete 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.899
 I hope it was very very significant 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.790
 because he pulls her hair javier aguirre 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.700
 and age as we say here a pan 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.590
 mode xy scored a goal despite the fact that 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.899
 diego armando maradona does the one that stops 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.640
 many was the goal of the century the magazine 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.070
 'france football' cataloged him as the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.340
 best goal of the world cup 86 I remember 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.770
 perfectly the double page of the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.240
 central pages of 'france football' 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.100
 saying this is the best goal of the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.649
 world 86 the goal of vote negrete 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.569
 captured the right moment from the auction 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.929
 of the most beautiful goal not of the cup of 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:43.000
 world of 86 was marked by a Mexican in the 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.939
 stadium this a play of like that is 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.030
 the variation is back and a defense 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.099
 he cuts it and arrives at Rafael loving him 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.560
 rafael amador and I always go on 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:56.510
 pumas then look for me by the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.300
 right side I control it 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.940
 it looks a bit too early in the control and 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.260
 javier aguirre that is on the right and 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.110
 I touched it on the wall 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.630
 the garment and the moment in contact and 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.890
 I knew that the narrative for goal is 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.000
 manuel negrete a legend today in 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.000
