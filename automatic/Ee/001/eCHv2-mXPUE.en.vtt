00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.370 
attack org yeah I'm thinking about
honesty<00:01:51.479> probably<00:01:51.810> out<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.049> fight<00:01:52.229> i'll

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
honesty probably out of this fight i'll

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.399 
honesty probably out of this fight i'll
probably<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.860> uh<00:01:53.509> well<00:01:54.509> captain<00:01:54.960> ginyu<00:01:55.229> has

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
probably think uh well captain ginyu has

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.130 
probably think uh well captain ginyu has
ability<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> change<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.520> body's<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.810> i<00:01:57.840> guess

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
ability to change your body's so i guess

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.899 
ability to change your body's so i guess
if<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.619> were<00:01:58.799> losing<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.369> body<00:01:59.640> could

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
if you were losing this body could

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.459 
if you were losing this body could
probably<00:02:00.149> find<00:02:00.570> some<00:02:00.869> way<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.079> changing

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
probably find some way of changing

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.649 
probably find some way of changing
bodies<00:02:02.009> with<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:04.070> okay<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.670> upon<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
bodies with the really okay I upon you

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.180 
bodies with the really okay I upon you
upon<00:02:06.719> some<00:02:07.020> weight<00:02:07.110> rating<00:02:07.439> bodies<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:07.920> year

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
upon some weight rating bodies if year

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.490 
upon some weight rating bodies if year
so<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.580> sick<00:02:08.789> jury

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
so that's a sick jury

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.340 
so that's a sick jury
I<00:02:09.590> was<00:02:09.830> just<00:02:10.009> use<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.570> what<00:02:11.570> is<00:02:11.660> up<00:02:11.840> with<00:02:11.990> the
