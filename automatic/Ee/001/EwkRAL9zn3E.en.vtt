00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.360 
you know seem to be alright with me got
a<00:02:54.510> pitch<00:02:54.810> by<00:02:55.080> pitch<00:02:55.819> up<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.090> down<00:02:57.239> here<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:59.310> I

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
a pitch by pitch up and down here so I

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.300 
a pitch by pitch up and down here so I
use<00:02:59.550> those<00:02:59.790> sometimes<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:01.010> got<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.130> little

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
use those sometimes I got the little

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.180 
use those sometimes I got the little
function<00:03:02.760> right<00:03:02.849> here<00:03:02.910> just<00:03:03.180> pretty<00:03:03.480> cool<00:03:04.190> you

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
function right here just pretty cool you

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.910 
function right here just pretty cool you
know<00:03:05.280> start<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.700> loop<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.610> loop<00:03:09.920> the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
know start the loop and the loop the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:24.710 
know start the loop and the loop the
repot<00:03:17.180> loop<00:03:18.180> out<00:03:22.880> yeah<00:03:23.880> right<00:03:24.120> here<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.450> track

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
repot loop out yeah right here the track

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.030 
repot loop out yeah right here the track
noms<00:03:26.480> switch<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:27.720> track<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.170> push<00:03:28.890> you

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
noms switch to the track to push you

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.270 
noms switch to the track to push you
there<00:03:30.650> there<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.799> go<00:03:31.980> back<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.980> go<00:03:35.099> with

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
there there you go back to you go with

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.559 
there there you go back to you go with
the<00:03:35.340> reverse<00:03:35.489> which<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.060> couldn't<00:03:36.360> figure<00:03:36.480> out

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
the reverse which I couldn't figure out

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.920 
the reverse which I couldn't figure out
for<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.870> little<00:03:37.079> while<00:03:37.230> but<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:38.660> mean<00:03:39.660> not<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
for a little while but I mean not the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.589 
for a little while but I mean not the
reverse<00:03:40.079> with<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.650> brake<00:03:40.890> first<00:03:41.599> obviously

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
reverse with the brake first obviously

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.020 
reverse with the brake first obviously
reverse<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.230> track<00:03:45.079> brake<00:03:46.079> though<00:03:46.940> put<00:03:47.940> it

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
reverse to the track brake though put it

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.599 
reverse to the track brake though put it
on<00:03:48.120> break<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:49.290> press<00:03:49.560> pause<00:03:52.280> slowly<00:03:53.280> so

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
on break and you press pause slowly so

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.920 
on break and you press pause slowly so
slowly<00:03:53.880> slows<00:03:54.660> down<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.340> on<00:03:56.480> slowly<00:03:57.480> starts

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
slowly slows down to on slowly starts

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:06.610 
slowly slows down to on slowly starts
back<00:03:58.139> up<00:03:58.380> on<00:03:58.590> some<00:03:58.829> brake<00:03:59.510> take<00:04:00.510> off<00:04:00.750> rake<00:04:03.799> um

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
back up on some brake take off rake um

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:15.670 
back up on some brake take off rake um
so<00:04:09.530> yeah<00:04:13.519> it's<00:04:14.519> about<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.120> know<00:04:15.239> they're

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
so yeah it's about that you know they're

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.199 
so yeah it's about that you know they're
pretty<00:04:16.680> decent<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.400> know<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.789> haven't<00:04:18.000> used

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
pretty decent you know I haven't used

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.050 
pretty decent you know I haven't used
too<00:04:18.389> many<00:04:18.479> CDJs<00:04:19.049> myself<00:04:19.560> but<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:22.610> don't<00:04:23.610> know<00:04:23.820> I

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
too many CDJs myself but I don't know I

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.950 
too many CDJs myself but I don't know I
like<00:04:24.389> them<00:04:24.860> for<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.010> price<00:04:26.220> they<00:04:26.490> are<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:27.810> get

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
like them for the price they are you get

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.260 
like them for the price they are you get
pitch<00:04:28.260> percentage<00:04:29.070> four<00:04:30.030> percent<00:04:32.060> up<00:04:33.060> and

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
pitch percentage four percent up and

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:41.800 
pitch percentage four percent up and
down<00:04:35.840> but<00:04:37.400> there's<00:04:38.400> enough<00:04:38.669> bad<00:04:38.910> press<00:04:39.740> pause

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
down but there's enough bad press pause

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:49.760 
down but there's enough bad press pause
open<00:04:42.810> them<00:04:42.960> up

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.379 

usually<00:04:50.770> then<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:51.550> gotta<00:04:51.759> wait<00:04:51.820> for<00:04:52.180> it<00:04:52.240> to

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
usually then you gotta wait for it to

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.270 
usually then you gotta wait for it to
load<00:04:53.100> doesn't<00:04:54.100> take<00:04:54.280> all<00:04:54.490> that<00:04:54.520> long<00:04:54.759> really

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
load doesn't take all that long really

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.810 
load doesn't take all that long really
there<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:57.400> go<00:04:57.580> there<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.780> don't<00:04:59.740> have<00:04:59.889> mp3s<00:05:00.550> now

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
there you go there I don't have mp3s now

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.760 
there you go there I don't have mp3s now
