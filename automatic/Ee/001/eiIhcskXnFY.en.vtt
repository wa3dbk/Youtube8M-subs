00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
have three options you can draw two

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.350 
have three options you can draw two
cards<00:01:11.810> from<00:01:12.050> one<00:01:12.320> of<00:01:12.410> these<00:01:12.530> decks<00:01:12.890> or<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:14.090> can

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
cards from one of these decks or you can

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.570 
cards from one of these decks or you can
play<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:14.750> card<00:01:15.110> that<00:01:15.410> card<00:01:15.680> can<00:01:15.890> be<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:16.009> body<00:01:16.280> part

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
play a card that card can be a body part

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.400 
play a card that card can be a body part
or<00:01:16.820> it<00:01:17.420> could<00:01:17.690> be<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:19.869> special<00:01:20.869> card<00:01:21.050> if<00:01:21.200> there

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
or it could be a special card if there

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.990 
or it could be a special card if there
there's<00:01:21.680> many<00:01:22.009> different<00:01:22.070> special<00:01:22.700> cards

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
there's many different special cards

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.490 
there's many different special cards
that<00:01:23.240> are<00:01:23.360> scattered<00:01:23.630> throughout<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.140> deck

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
that are scattered throughout the deck

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.800 
that are scattered throughout the deck
and<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.460> if<00:01:25.729> you<00:01:26.060> get<00:01:26.180> one<00:01:26.300> of<00:01:26.390> those<00:01:26.479> you<00:01:26.660> can

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
and so if you get one of those you can

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.840 
and so if you get one of those you can
play<00:01:27.020> one<00:01:27.259> now<00:01:27.619> when<00:01:27.770> you<00:01:27.890> play<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.130> body<00:01:28.550> part

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
play one now when you play a body part

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.999 
play one now when you play a body part
you're<00:01:29.450> going<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.630> play<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.259> obvious

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
you're going to play in the obvious

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.249 
you're going to play in the obvious
position<00:01:31.490> there's<00:01:31.670> an<00:01:31.759> arrow<00:01:32.030> okay<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.050> the

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
position there's an arrow okay so the

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.160 
position there's an arrow okay so the
head<00:01:33.470> obviously<00:01:33.860> would<00:01:34.700> go<00:01:34.880> here<00:01:35.270> now<00:01:36.020> when

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
head obviously would go here now when

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.020 
head obviously would go here now when
you<00:01:36.289> play<00:01:36.470> a<00:01:36.500> body<00:01:36.830> part<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.399> let's<00:01:37.550> say<00:01:37.700> here

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
you play a body part so let's say here

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.130 
you play a body part so let's say here
on<00:01:38.149> this<00:01:38.810> baby<00:01:39.259> robot<00:01:39.890> torso<00:01:40.550> I<00:01:40.820> put<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:41.810> elf

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
on this baby robot torso I put this elf

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.650 
on this baby robot torso I put this elf
head<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:42.860> think<00:01:43.100> that's<00:01:43.220> enough<00:01:43.310> anyway<00:01:43.789> if<00:01:44.030> I'm

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
head I think that's enough anyway if I'm

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.540 
head I think that's enough anyway if I'm
the<00:01:44.869> yellow<00:01:45.170> player<00:01:45.410> I<00:01:45.440> would<00:01:45.740> put<00:01:45.950> one<00:01:45.979> token

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
the yellow player I would put one token

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.900 
the yellow player I would put one token
on<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.030> because<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.830> fits<00:01:49.399> there<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:49.820> a

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
on it because it it fits there it's a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.230 
on it because it it fits there it's a
head<00:01:50.149> but<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.720> does<00:01:50.959> not<00:01:51.140> match<00:01:51.470> color<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.670> also

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
head but it does not match color it also

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.520 
head but it does not match color it also
does<00:01:53.420> not<00:01:53.630> match<00:01:54.640> anything<00:01:55.640> about<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.270> now

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
does not match anything about it now

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.410 
does not match anything about it now
let's<00:01:57.530> say<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:57.770> stick<00:01:58.130> this<00:01:58.310> arm<00:01:58.640> here<00:01:59.179> on<00:01:59.300> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
let's say I stick this arm here on the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.889 
let's say I stick this arm here on the
robot<00:01:59.750> now<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:01.190> is<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.369> red<00:02:01.700> card<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:02.720> it's<00:02:02.869> a

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
robot now this is a red card so it's a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.410 
robot now this is a red card so it's a
robotic<00:02:03.380> type<00:02:03.709> card<00:02:04.039> but<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.789> symbol<00:02:05.149> doesn't

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
robotic type card but the symbol doesn't

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.630 
robotic type card but the symbol doesn't
match<00:02:05.539> isn't<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.020> baby<00:02:06.229> one<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.160> if<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.369> was<00:02:07.550> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
match isn't the baby one so if I was the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.980 
match isn't the baby one so if I was the
purple<00:02:07.910> player<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.300> put<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.569> out<00:02:08.750> i<00:02:08.780> would

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
purple player and I put this out i would

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.370 
purple player and I put this out i would
get<00:02:09.170> two<00:02:09.560> tokens<00:02:09.950> on<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.700> one<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.380> then

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
get two tokens on this one and then

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.070 
get two tokens on this one and then
let's<00:02:12.650> say<00:02:12.860> later<00:02:13.220> on<00:02:13.459> someone<00:02:14.120> else<00:02:14.330> decided

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
let's say later on someone else decided

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.800 
let's say later on someone else decided
that<00:02:15.230> they<00:02:15.380> were<00:02:15.440> going<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.800> add<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.880> different

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
that they were going to add a different

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.570 
that they were going to add a different
body<00:02:18.230> part<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.739> it<00:02:18.830> let's<00:02:19.040> say<00:02:19.190> they<00:02:19.340> want<00:02:19.520> to

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
body part to it let's say they want to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.690 
body part to it let's say they want to
add<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:19.940> leg<00:02:20.300> here<00:02:21.069> now<00:02:22.069> this<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:22.459> matches

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
add this leg here now this one matches

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.000 
add this leg here now this one matches
the<00:02:23.000> color<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.630> matches<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.050> symbol<00:02:24.530> so

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
the color and it matches the symbol so

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.800 
the color and it matches the symbol so
this<00:02:25.250> person<00:02:25.520> who<00:02:25.880> would<00:02:26.030> be<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.300> blue<00:02:26.510> player

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
this person who would be the blue player

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.910 
this person who would be the blue player
would<00:02:27.650> put<00:02:27.920> three<00:02:28.489> tokens<00:02:29.150> on<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:30.080> because

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
would put three tokens on that because

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.830 
would put three tokens on that because
not<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.310> what<00:02:31.430> they<00:02:31.550> matched<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:32.090> perfectly

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
not on what they matched it perfectly

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.290 
not on what they matched it perfectly
and<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.980> will<00:02:34.190> continue<00:02:34.550> let's<00:02:34.940> say<00:02:35.120> then

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
and this will continue let's say then

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.780 
and this will continue let's say then
the<00:02:35.450> yellow<00:02:35.660> player<00:02:36.020> put<00:02:36.770> this<00:02:36.950> over<00:02:37.190> here<00:02:37.340> and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
the yellow player put this over here and

the yellow player put this over here and
the<00:02:38.270> yellow<00:02:38.480> player<00:02:38.810> got<00:02:39.080> two<00:02:39.410> tokens<00:02:39.770> on<00:02:40.160> it

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
the yellow player got two tokens on it

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.490 
the yellow player got two tokens on it
and<00:02:40.520> then<00:02:41.209> later<00:02:41.540> on<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:42.020> blue<00:02:42.200> player

and then later on the blue player
managed<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.580> find<00:02:44.410> stick<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.590> leg<00:02:46.069> on<00:02:46.250> it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
managed to find stick this leg on it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.160 
managed to find stick this leg on it
here<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.849> got<00:02:47.300> one<00:02:47.450> more<00:02:47.629> token<00:02:48.050> that

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
here and got one more token that

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.890 
here and got one more token that

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
the special action cards do a variety of

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.479 
the special action cards do a variety of
things<00:03:33.450> for<00:03:33.720> example<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.950> prosthetic

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
things for example this is a prosthetic

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.750 
things for example this is a prosthetic
arm<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.150> could<00:03:36.570> put<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:36.840> any<00:03:37.140> arm<00:03:37.590> location<00:03:38.519> and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
arm I could put in any arm location and

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.820 
arm I could put in any arm location and
then<00:03:39.060> place<00:03:39.390> three<00:03:39.930> marks<00:03:40.320> on<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:40.739> it's

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
then place three marks on it so it's

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.699 
then place three marks on it so it's
kind<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.190> wild<00:03:41.760> arm<00:03:42.200> other<00:03:43.200> special

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
kind of like a wild arm other special

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.040 
kind of like a wild arm other special
cards<00:03:44.100> remove<00:03:44.819> all<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.239> marks<00:03:45.540> from<00:03:45.690> ahead

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
cards remove all the marks from ahead

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.990 
cards remove all the marks from ahead
then<00:03:46.650> put<00:03:46.920> two<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.160> yours<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:47.940> a

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
then put two of yours on it it's a

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.229 
then put two of yours on it it's a
Mindwipe<00:03:48.510> you're<00:03:49.200> taking<00:03:50.000> points<00:03:51.000> away<00:03:51.060> from

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
Mindwipe you're taking points away from

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.340 
Mindwipe you're taking points away from
somebody<00:03:51.840> else<00:03:52.080> or<00:03:52.680> here<00:03:53.310> we<00:03:53.489> have<00:03:54.170> searched<00:03:55.170> a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
somebody else or here we have searched a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.650 
somebody else or here we have searched a
discard<00:03:55.769> pile<00:03:56.010> for<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> body<00:03:56.580> part<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.209> play<00:03:57.480> it

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
discard pile for a body part and play it

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.960 
discard pile for a body part and play it
so<00:03:58.230> you're<00:03:58.890> not<00:03:59.040> going<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.280> always<00:03:59.550> use<00:03:59.760> these

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
so you're not going to always use these

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.370 
so you're not going to always use these
cards<00:04:00.209> but<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.870> do<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.110> instead

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
cards but that you can do that instead

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.289 
cards but that you can do that instead
of<00:04:01.440> playing<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.800> body<00:04:02.010> part<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.550> have<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.090> hand

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
of playing a body part you have a hand

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.520 
of playing a body part you have a hand
limit<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.600> seven<00:04:03.900> cards<00:04:04.260> but<00:04:04.380> that's

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
limit of seven cards but that's

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.380 
limit of seven cards but that's
essentially<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.040> game<00:04:05.280> now<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:05.970> don't<00:04:06.180> know

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
essentially the game now I don't know

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.819

think<00:05:03.479> you<00:05:03.810> need<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:03.960> think<00:05:04.229> you<00:05:04.289> have<00:05:04.380> eight

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
think you need I think you have eight

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.240 
think you need I think you have eight
total<00:05:05.370> yeah<00:05:06.030> eight<00:05:06.270> so<00:05:07.169> once<00:05:07.860> you're<00:05:07.979> down<00:05:08.070> to

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
total yeah eight so once you're down to

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.010 
total yeah eight so once you're down to
four<00:05:08.460> victory<00:05:08.970> points<00:05:09.360> alright<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:09.780> guess

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
four victory points alright I guess

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.270 
four victory points alright I guess
you'll<00:05:10.140> never<00:05:10.229> for<00:05:10.620> once<00:05:10.860> you<00:05:10.950> have<00:05:11.039> three

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
you'll never for once you have three

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.650 
you'll never for once you have three
victory<00:05:11.580> points<00:05:11.909> you<00:05:12.419> only

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
victory points you only

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.570

have<00:05:12.810> five<00:05:13.320> of<00:05:13.590> those<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.980> work<00:05:14.160> with<00:05:14.370> so<00:05:14.520> you

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
have five of those to work with so you

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.010
