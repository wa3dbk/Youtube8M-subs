watching<00:03:25.829> this<00:03:26.010> with<00:03:26.280> today<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:28.349> now<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.829> know

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
watching this with today so now you know

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.039 
watching this with today so now you know
everything<00:03:29.489> you're<00:03:29.819> seeing<00:03:30.060> right<00:03:30.420> now<00:03:30.480> is

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
everything you're seeing right now is

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.369 
everything you're seeing right now is
actually<00:03:31.549> right-side<00:03:32.549> up<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:33.329> know<00:03:33.389> seeing

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
actually right-side up you know seeing

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:41.839 
actually right-side up you know seeing
things<00:03:34.799> upside<00:03:35.639> down<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.450> my<00:03:36.810> science<00:03:40.549> it's<00:03:41.549> so

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
things upside down is my science it's so

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.150 
things upside down is my science it's so
cool
