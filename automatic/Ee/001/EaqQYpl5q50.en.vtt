00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.090
 Cut the pork loin into pieces, about 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:28.350

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.130
 Every piece of meat well beat off from two sides, 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:59.880
 salt and pepper taste, also from two sides. 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.969
 Raw potatoes rubbed on a coarse grater. 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:16.499
 Onions grate on a coarse grater.

 Add eggs, mayonnaise (or sour cream), I add 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:37.770
 mayonnaise. 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:49.779
 Finely chop the garlic, dill and parsley

 Combine potatoes, garlic and greens, mix. 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.170
 Pour some salt, but not very much so that the potato 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.239
 the fur coat did not turn out salty. 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.799
 Leave for 5-7 minutes, during which time the potatoes will let 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.170
 the juice. 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.040

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.110
 Roll each piece of pork in a potato coat, but 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.200
 not very much. 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.180

 without covering with two sides, until golden brown. 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.359
 Turn the chops gently to avoid damage.

 potato coat. 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:22.790

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.090

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.310
