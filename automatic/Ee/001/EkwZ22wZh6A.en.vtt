00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
that clinician doesn't walk on damp hair

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.140 
that clinician doesn't walk on damp hair
but<00:02:40.620> for<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.310> last<00:02:41.459> few<00:02:41.670> months<00:02:41.849> I've<00:02:42.120> been

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
but for the last few months I've been

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.180 
but for the last few months I've been
using<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.660> on<00:02:42.780> damp<00:02:42.959> hair<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.920> actually

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
using it on damp hair and it actually

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.720 
using it on damp hair and it actually
gives<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.970> nice<00:02:45.349> semi<00:02:46.349> matte<00:02:46.700> slicked<00:02:47.700> back

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
gives a nice semi matte slicked back

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.110 
gives a nice semi matte slicked back
looks<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.470> doesn't<00:02:49.799> give<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.040> much<00:02:50.280> volume

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
looks so it doesn't give you much volume

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.930 

now<00:04:06.530> I'm<00:04:06.620> using<00:04:06.830> a<00:04:06.980> bit<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.130> claymation<00:04:07.610> to

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
now I'm using a bit of claymation to

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.210 
now I'm using a bit of claymation to
lock<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.270> up<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:08.510> give<00:04:08.720> some<00:04:08.930> texture

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.610 

don't<00:04:13.120> use<00:04:13.330> too<00:04:13.360> much<00:04:13.570> product<00:04:14.110> in<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.320> front

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
don't use too much product in the front

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:24.570 
don't use too much product in the front
because<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.160> will<00:04:15.280> lose<00:04:15.460> the<00:04:15.610> Walden

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
so you can kind of see what it does in

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.820 
so you can kind of see what it does in
the<00:04:27.140> hair<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:29.060> give<00:04:29.270> some<00:04:29.510> nice<00:04:29.690> texture<00:04:30.350> nice
