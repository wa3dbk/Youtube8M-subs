00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
down to turn off the signal up in the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.080 
down to turn off the signal up in the
ass<00:03:24.650> cuz<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:24.920> forget<00:03:25.250> sometimes<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.880> I'm

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
ass cuz I forget sometimes and I'm

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.260

turning<00:03:26.390> left<00:03:26.420> left<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.050> right<00:03:27.080> for<00:03:27.410> miles

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
turning left left to right for miles

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:38.410 
turning left left to right for miles
works<00:03:32.350> works<00:03:34.989> it's<00:03:35.989> not<00:03:36.050> safety<00:03:36.440> but<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.420> don't

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
works works it's not safety but I don't

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.940 
works works it's not safety but I don't
think<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.600> would<00:03:38.690> take<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:38.900> whole<00:03:39.050> lot<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.830> get
