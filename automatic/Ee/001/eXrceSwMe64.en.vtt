00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.340
 him to all of us we lose 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.080
 today for the second knew scama 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.350
 today ben is hat offered 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.670
 until tomorrow number two you have 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.330
 you seemed to be waiting for forgiveness 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.800
 sunday but what I'm eating 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.119
 really no time to do a lot 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.310
 of time games videos rather galley 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.529
 this year missed I do as I can 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.210
 but good so I hope it's still a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.980
 pleasure so we started with the trick 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.089
 pasta rice 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.149
 so of course this trick she and she 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:46.079
 is made for the teams but we can 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:48.690
 would give a site from there in the sequel 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.940
 videos of the hints falling so 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.679
 the trick is to wrap the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.679
 skips do not laugh you have you 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.610
 universo and you can take that in 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.730
 take four wrestler and daf masters 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.150
 trucks with you have betrayed your salary 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.920
 Dad is here made 8 years and therefore 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.420
 you can loop the skips not ris 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.740
 you can not do that for Toulon 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.210
 frigost you need to pay 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.350
 keys you do that once protects a 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.770
 once for rice pasta once for 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.600
 your system 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.580
 once coriander you can even 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.430
 go up to 16 players prius iii this 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.990
 which allows you better for you and 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.610
 so just loop like that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.300
 big dungeon a plus to three is that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:35.160
 the hours passages that yields 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.990
 so these are really worth 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.530
 expensive in hdv they leave like 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.869
 rolls you do for example 3 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.450
 also diane kruger and she watched 750 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.360
 me kam at the goal capture invites them 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.660
 young as I was saying just now 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.390
 you can easily go down there with 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.280
 only four characters and then 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.710
 against capture stuff look at that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.259
 very good 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.550
 4-4 multiman no matter what is so 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.200
 the v6 doubts the dungeons the resale is 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.119
 what I do very often it works 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.920
 so now we come for the trick 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.000
 case mamono account that I use here 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.289
 you go in 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.620
 you go to the cemeteries of what 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.620
 there are plenty of areas so that 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.379
 this is the trick archi monster must know 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.980
 that you will have there you see there is a 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.330
 dude there I was afraid he put everything stolen 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.950
 so I'm going to finish my sentence before 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.430
 serious we will go on suck 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.180
 archimonde this area but it's a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.620
 little treasure for the archives there you 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.080
 just go to finally you know 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.150
 that there are connected on this area 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.290
 connected at 9 am so I 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.200
 can tell you that the archive year 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.510
 after the year but there are plenty 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.860
 full of bah bah you have you 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.470
 connect you will see a salesman 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.960
 if my feeling 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.660
 it costs between 700 thousand and one million 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.610
 five each is incredible so you 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.620
 see I went to 18 hours no 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.030
 possibility in the archi monster I do not 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.110
 cross to a guy who was there so I 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.000
 I'm told it's fucked but I'm going when 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.320
 even do it for the video and I'm going 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.800
 not lie to you I only do them in one 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.890
 one time 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.950
 and bim here is a good old monster arch 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.930
 the fights are good the horse is 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.130
 required are simple but I arrive 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.050
 easily all alone well I take a 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.460
 small chalet destructor completed but 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.840
 you'll see that the ponytail 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.060
 low street will lose a little bit tell me 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.340
 I have almost nothing to lose as we say 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.820
 you can totally disengage yourself 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.990
 alone then is when I talk about when 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.130
 you speak darchy mons go you can 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.780
 very well capture them monsters 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.950
 named or giant monsters by 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.000
 example of helping nest in 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.380
 tablets so dice mons in 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.600
 labyrinths that shakes that upward 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.250
 like that finally you compare before with 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.709
 the sales statements for example the 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.930
 Swiss named monsters in chorus of 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.080
 sanctuary dragoes that same by 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.459
 labyrinth there are some that are worth up to 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.600
 200 thousand units vimont find everywhere 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.590
 gp jean laflamme to go there that the 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.620
 fights are sometimes two groups of 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.040
 eight months are too lazy to go and capture 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.500
 forgiveness for their others for europe 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.820
 no named monsters it's for the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.550
 successes go from elsewhere i'll maybe 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.600
 even been removed but all right that 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.030
 everyone knows that archives on that 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.680
