00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.690 
day but yeah do enough of it to be
proficient<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.439> doing<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> research<00:01:41.070> this

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
proficient and doing the research this

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.300 
proficient and doing the research this
tool<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.180> good<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> do-it-yourselfer<00:01:43.590> on

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
tool is good for a do-it-yourselfer on

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.980 
tool is good for a do-it-yourselfer on
up<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> person<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.329> runs<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.600> shop<00:01:45.750> right

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
up to a person that runs a shop right

yes yep okay so what's use it for I use

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.359 
yes yep okay so what's use it for I use
it<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> little<00:01:48.990> bit<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.290> everything<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.950> did

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
it for a little bit of everything I did

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.149 
it for a little bit of everything I did
go<00:01:50.549> down<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.000> 16th<00:01:51.509> 16th<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.680> an<00:01:52.770> inch<00:01:52.890> metal

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
go down the 16th 16th of an inch metal

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.870 
go down the 16th 16th of an inch metal
um<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.270> made<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.320> seam<00:01:55.590> weld<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.250> actually<00:01:56.700> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
um in made a seam weld and actually you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.789 
um in made a seam weld and actually you
know<00:01:56.909> made<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> angles<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.200> whatnot<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.619> some

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
know made the angles and whatnot on some

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.789 
know made the angles and whatnot on some
sheet<00:01:59.009> metal<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.490> say<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> Fender<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.619> was

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
sheet metal for say a Fender it was

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.130 
sheet metal for say a Fender it was
really<00:02:02.280> smooth<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.270> thin<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.780> then<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.899> went

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
really smooth that thin and then I went

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.010 
really smooth that thin and then I went
up<00:02:04.229> as<00:02:04.380> far<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:04.829> making<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> step<00:02:06.180> for<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.869> back

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
up as far as making a step for the back

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.260 
up as far as making a step for the back
of<00:02:07.170> my<00:02:07.290> pet<00:02:07.469> couple<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.979> 3/16<00:02:08.759> angle<00:02:09.090> iron

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
of my pet couple out of 3/16 angle iron

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.510 
of my pet couple out of 3/16 angle iron
to<00:02:09.959> step<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> bed<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.220> had

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
to step up in the bed and it had

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.210 
to step up in the bed and it had
problems<00:02:11.940> with<00:02:12.120> either<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.660> okay<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.710> who

it<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:33.930> said<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> was<00:02:34.500> very<00:02:34.830> capable<00:02:35.070> in

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
it and said that it was very capable in

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.360 
it and said that it was very capable in
either<00:02:36.120> hands<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.230> can<00:02:37.500> get<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.710> little<00:02:38.160> bow

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
either hands so you can get a little bow

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.270 
either hands so you can get a little bow
of<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.580> DI<00:02:38.790> wire<00:02:39.090> okay<00:02:39.720> then<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.920> grate<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
of the DI wire okay then you grate the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.120 
of the DI wire okay then you grate the
performance<00:02:41.790> as<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.720> think<00:02:43.440> very<00:02:43.530> good<00:02:43.650> beer

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
performance as I think very good beer

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.010 
performance as I think very good beer
I'm<00:02:44.280> for<00:02:44.790> what<00:02:44.910> it's<00:02:45.060> billed<00:02:45.300> as<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.750> think<00:02:45.810> it

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
I'm for what it's billed as I think it

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.690 
I'm for what it's billed as I think it
does<00:02:46.200> very<00:02:46.230> well<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.250> its<00:02:47.400> element

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
does very well and it's in its element

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.850 
does very well and it's in its element
okay<00:02:48.150> let's<00:02:48.570> talk<00:02:48.690> about<00:02:48.750> design<00:02:49.230> pretty

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
okay let's talk about design pretty

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.380 
okay let's talk about design pretty
simplistic<00:02:50.280> right<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.940> comes<00:02:51.180> with

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
simplistic right it comes with

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.390 
simplistic right it comes with
everything<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.810> see<00:02:52.020> right<00:02:52.050> here<00:02:52.400> including

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
everything you see right here including

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.580 
everything you see right here including
uh<00:02:53.430> one<00:02:54.030> spool<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.420> wire<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.050> let's<00:02:55.320> talk<00:02:55.530> about

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
uh one spool of wire so let's talk about

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.780 
uh one spool of wire so let's talk about
it<00:02:55.860> what<00:02:56.130> do<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.280> think<00:02:56.400> about<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.670> design

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
it what do you think about the design

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.550 
it what do you think about the design
it's<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.810> know<00:02:57.900> it's<00:02:58.020> one<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.170> those<00:02:58.260> tools

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it's you know it's one of those tools

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.650 
it's you know it's one of those tools
that<00:02:58.710> it's<00:02:59.280> not<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.460> lot<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.790> bang<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.420> know<00:03:00.450> it

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
that it's not a lot of bang you know it

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.900 
that it's not a lot of bang you know it
does<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.020> job<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:02.010> think<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.490> design<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.790> it's

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
does this job I think the design of it's

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.760 
does this job I think the design of it's
great<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:03.240> simple<00:03:03.570> its<00:03:03.720> straightforward<00:03:03.780> it

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
great it's simple its straightforward it

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.130 
great it's simple its straightforward it
does<00:03:04.950> come<00:03:05.160> up<00:03:05.190> come<00:03:05.520> with<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> gas<00:03:05.910> hookup<00:03:06.140> so

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
does come up come with a gas hookup so

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.530 
does come up come with a gas hookup so
if<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.290> do<00:03:07.410> want<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.620> run<00:03:07.770> argon<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.640> they

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
if you do want to run argon to it they

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.880 
if you do want to run argon to it they
give<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.840> all<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.140> fittings<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.590> everything

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
give you all the fittings and everything

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.160 
give you all the fittings and everything
everything<00:03:11.160> but<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.370> gas<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.760> do<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.080> but<00:03:13.080> as

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
everything but the gas to do it but as

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.050 
everything but the gas to do it but as
far<00:03:13.200> as<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.620> design<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.220> function<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.850> think

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
far as the design and function I think

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.520 
far as the design and function I think
everything<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.570> whips<00:03:15.780> are<00:03:15.990> nice<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.380> long

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
everything the whips are nice and long

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.400 
everything the whips are nice and long
and<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.670> just<00:03:18.000> it's<00:03:18.270> simple<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.050> does<00:03:19.200> its<00:03:19.350> job

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
and it just it's simple and does its job

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.199 
and it just it's simple and does its job
okay<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.310> that's<00:03:20.430> probably<00:03:20.700> great<00:03:20.880> for<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
okay and that's probably great for the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.570 
okay and that's probably great for the
DIY<00:03:21.660> or<00:03:22.020> keep<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.350> simple<00:03:22.709> yep<00:03:23.040> not<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.370> lot<00:03:23.550> of

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
DIY or keep it simple yep not a lot of

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.130 
DIY or keep it simple yep not a lot of
added<00:03:23.970> stuff<00:03:24.180> because<00:03:24.450> with<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> cost

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
added stuff because with that the cost

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.330 
added stuff because with that the cost
goes<00:03:25.380> up<00:03:25.500> right<00:03:25.680> exactly

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
goes up right exactly

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.040 
goes up right exactly
okay<00:03:26.760> let's<00:03:27.180> talk<00:03:27.270> about<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.540> quality<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.930> mean

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
okay let's talk about the quality I mean

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.410 
okay let's talk about the quality I mean
it<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.320> just<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.860> box<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.550> supplies<00:03:30.000> some

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
it is just a box that supplies some

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.810 
it is just a box that supplies some
power<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.810> some<00:03:31.050> wire<00:03:31.290> right<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.040> what<00:03:32.700> about

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
power and some wire right so what about

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.699 
power and some wire right so what about
it<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.600> far<00:03:33.690> as<00:03:33.930> quality<00:03:34.230> what<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.440> look<00:03:34.620> at

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
it as far as quality what I look at

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:35.780 
it as far as quality what I look at
something<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.070> this<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:35.520> said<00:03:35.580> it's

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
something like this like you said it's

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.130 
something like this like you said it's
just<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.060> box<00:03:36.240> of<00:03:36.450> metal<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.750> supplies<00:03:37.020> the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
just the box of metal the supplies the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.660 
just the box of metal the supplies the
wire<00:03:37.320> but<00:03:37.590> if<00:03:37.830> you<00:03:37.980> look<00:03:38.130> at<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.310> quality<00:03:38.640> of

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
wire but if you look at the quality of

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.060 
wire but if you look at the quality of
the<00:03:38.820> rubber<00:03:39.030> on<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.300> whip<00:03:39.480> its<00:03:40.320> flexible<00:03:40.860> the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
the rubber on the whip its flexible the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.440 
the rubber on the whip its flexible the
lot<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.459> welding<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.790> did<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.120> my<00:03:42.270> garage

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
lot of the welding I did in my garage

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.510 
lot of the welding I did in my garage
that's<00:03:42.810> unheated<00:03:43.230> here<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.100> Michigan<00:03:44.490> you

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380
