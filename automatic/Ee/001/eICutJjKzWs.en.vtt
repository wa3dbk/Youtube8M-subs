okay we're going to look at our front
arm<00:00:07.870> and<00:00:08.109> our<00:00:08.260> castor<00:00:08.800> block<00:00:09.040> assembly<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:10.840> you

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
arm and our castor block assembly we you

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.600 
arm and our castor block assembly we you
can<00:00:11.260> see<00:00:11.469> we<00:00:11.620> have<00:00:11.650> our

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
can see we have our

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.160 
can see we have our
assembled<00:00:13.179> with<00:00:13.420> the<00:00:13.570> knuckle<00:00:13.929> and<00:00:14.080> the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
assembled with the knuckle and the

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.900 
assembled with the knuckle and the
spindle<00:00:14.650> one<00:00:15.280> thing<00:00:15.429> you<00:00:15.549> want<00:00:15.700> to<00:00:15.730> make<00:00:15.879> sure

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
spindle one thing you want to make sure

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.480 
spindle one thing you want to make sure
is<00:00:16.390> that<00:00:16.570> it<00:00:16.869> moves<00:00:17.140> freely<00:00:17.590> you<00:00:18.099> can<00:00:18.250> see<00:00:18.460> that

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
is that it moves freely you can see that

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.999 
is that it moves freely you can see that
this<00:00:18.789> has<00:00:19.029> no<00:00:19.240> binding<00:00:19.750> in<00:00:19.840> it<00:00:19.960> now<00:00:20.529> let's<00:00:20.770> say

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
this has no binding in it now let's say

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.279 
this has no binding in it now let's say
that<00:00:21.189> you<00:00:21.310> assemble<00:00:21.669> this<00:00:22.000> and<00:00:22.300> it's<00:00:22.990> tight

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
that you assemble this and it's tight

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.810 
that you assemble this and it's tight
and<00:00:23.500> it<00:00:23.619> doesn't<00:00:23.980> move<00:00:24.130> you<00:00:24.189> might<00:00:24.550> want<00:00:24.730> to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
and it doesn't move you might want to

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.420 
and it doesn't move you might want to
take<00:00:25.000> your<00:00:25.150> emery<00:00:25.480> board<00:00:25.750> and<00:00:26.079> go<00:00:26.740> in<00:00:26.950> and<00:00:27.130> file

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
take your emery board and go in and file

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.490 
take your emery board and go in and file
the<00:00:27.699> top<00:00:27.939> down<00:00:28.180> you're<00:00:28.779> going<00:00:28.899> to<00:00:28.960> know<00:00:29.169> if<00:00:29.349> it

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
the top down you're going to know if it

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.769 
the top down you're going to know if it
pinches<00:00:29.980> too<00:00:30.219> tight<00:00:30.550> or<00:00:30.579> something's<00:00:31.540> in<00:00:31.689> the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
pinches too tight or something's in the

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.260 
pinches too tight or something's in the
way<00:00:31.930> use<00:00:32.290> your<00:00:32.469> exacto<00:00:33.070> clean<00:00:33.730> that<00:00:33.910> up<00:00:33.940> but

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
way use your exacto clean that up but

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.720 
way use your exacto clean that up but
this<00:00:34.450> is<00:00:34.630> the<00:00:34.780> proper<00:00:35.230> installation<00:00:35.950> you<00:00:36.550> want

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
this is the proper installation you want

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.520 
this is the proper installation you want
it<00:00:36.820> to<00:00:36.969> move<00:00:37.090> free<00:00:37.510> your<00:00:37.840> steering<00:00:38.170> will<00:00:38.379> be

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
it to move free your steering will be

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.130 
it to move free your steering will be
messed<00:00:38.770> up<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:40.059> next<00:00:40.329> would<00:00:40.450> be<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.660> arm<00:00:40.870> you

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
messed up the next would be the arm you

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.779 
messed up the next would be the arm you
can<00:00:41.290> see<00:00:41.440> we've<00:00:41.559> gone<00:00:41.739> and<00:00:41.920> use<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.219> exacto

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
can see we've gone and use the exacto

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.730 
can see we've gone and use the exacto
trimmed<00:00:43.180> off<00:00:43.329> some<00:00:43.600> of<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.750> extra<00:00:44.140> material

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
trimmed off some of the extra material

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.430 
trimmed off some of the extra material
we're<00:00:45.490> going<00:00:45.579> to<00:00:45.700> take<00:00:45.880> the<00:00:46.060> hinge<00:00:46.300> pin<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:46.900> go

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
we're going to take the hinge pin and go

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.700 
we're going to take the hinge pin and go
through<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:48.070> arm<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:49.420> rule<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.230> thumb<00:00:50.410> is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
through the arm now rule of thumb is

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.520 
through the arm now rule of thumb is
should<00:00:51.670> just<00:00:51.880> fall<00:00:52.030> through<00:00:52.060> like<00:00:52.540> that<00:00:52.810> if<00:00:53.410> it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
should just fall through like that if it

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.170 
should just fall through like that if it
doesn't<00:00:53.800> fall<00:00:53.950> through<00:00:54.220> like<00:00:54.400> that<00:00:54.640> you<00:00:55.000> need

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
doesn't fall through like that you need

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.330 
doesn't fall through like that you need
to<00:00:55.270> go<00:00:55.390> in<00:00:55.570> with<00:00:55.840> a<00:00:55.870> drill<00:00:56.290> bit<00:00:56.500> take<00:00:57.190> your

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
to go in with a drill bit take your

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.940 
to go in with a drill bit take your
calipers<00:00:57.850> measure<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.780> thickness<00:00:59.020> of<00:00:59.649> the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
calipers measure the thickness of the

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.750 
calipers measure the thickness of the
hinge<00:01:00.880> pin<00:01:01.149> get<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:01.960> drill<00:01:02.290> bit<00:01:02.470> or<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.680> reamer<00:01:03.010> go

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
hinge pin get a drill bit or a reamer go

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.850 
hinge pin get a drill bit or a reamer go
through<00:01:04.059> and<00:01:04.239> remit<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.869> if<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.649> falls

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
through and remit and if it falls

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.399 
through and remit and if it falls
through<00:01:06.220> that's<00:01:06.939> what<00:01:07.119> you<00:01:07.240> want<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:08.140> next

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
through that's what you want the next

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.270 
through that's what you want the next
thing<00:01:08.500> we're<00:01:08.680> going<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.829> do<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.100> we're<00:01:09.189> going

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.100 
thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:09.369> go<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:09.700> check<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.090> installation<00:01:10.570> of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
to go in and check the installation of

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.069 
to go in and check the installation of
the<00:01:11.469> width<00:01:11.740> between<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.060> plate<00:01:13.540> and<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.869> B

the width between the a plate and the B

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.490 
the width between the a plate and the B
plate<00:01:14.409> on<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:14.920> sub-assembly<00:01:15.490> plate<00:01:16.180> so<00:01:16.870> we'll

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
plate on the sub-assembly plate so we'll

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.700 
plate on the sub-assembly plate so we'll
take<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.740> look<00:01:17.950> at<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:19.170> now<00:01:20.170> we<00:01:20.229> have<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.560> arm

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
take a look at that now we have the arm

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.460 
take a look at that now we have the arm
between<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.909> B<00:01:22.360> plate<00:01:22.870> we're

between the a and the B plate we're
going<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.680> do<00:01:23.799> a<00:01:23.830> thing<00:01:23.920> that's<00:01:24.310> called<00:01:24.520> a

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
going to do a thing that's called a

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.460 
going to do a thing that's called a
