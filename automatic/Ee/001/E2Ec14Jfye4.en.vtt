improved the AI hope with for the second
one<00:03:32.609> if<00:03:32.760> they<00:03:32.849> do<00:03:32.910> make<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.299> second<00:03:33.660> one

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
one if they do make a second one

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.500 
one if they do make a second one
all<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:35.190> how<00:03:35.280> does<00:03:35.430> rue<00:03:35.580> is<00:03:35.790> but<00:03:36.240> they<00:03:36.360> do<00:03:36.480> make

all of how does rue is but they do make

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.450 
all of how does rue is but they do make
a<00:03:36.660> sec<00:03:36.870> when<00:03:36.990> they<00:03:37.110> got<00:03:37.470> improve<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.070> vastly
