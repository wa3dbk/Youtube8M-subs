 hello everyone today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.940
 make a device to cut 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.950
 wine bottles 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.849
 the pieces you need are the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.930
 next two pieces of wood is not 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.400
 necessary to make them soft because they 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.900
 they need friction between them 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.259
 I need four supports of five 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.480
 centimeters on each side three screws 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.500
 eight millimeters three marks three 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.200
 washers 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.860
 three skate bearings eight screws 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.090
 short glass wheels 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.420
 [Music] 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.600
 a flat-head screwdriver a 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.050
 phillips screwdriver a drill to 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.790
 laxe with an 8 millimeter drill 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.300
 and a grinder 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.790
 the first thing we have to enlarge one 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:15.050
 of the holes in the support for 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:19.640
 place the 8 mm bolts and the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:23.780
 use of the double grinder the tips of 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.890
 the supports and that's how to do the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:33.409
 mounts put the suit the washer the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:38.770
 Bearing and the door in third order 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:41.649
 and I 'm going to look like this 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.380
 and we are going to make two more of it 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:52.190
 way we're going to assemble those on the board in 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56.330
 a rectangular formation 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.140
 8 centimeters wide and 26 centimeters 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.340
 long 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.210
 [Music] 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.619
 now the bases please 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.160
 a good quality wood and a little 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.100
 pressure on it when cutting the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.780
 bottles and you do not want the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.780
 sounds to take 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.130
 and 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.980
 [Music] 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 the cut of the whole territory is assembled 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:36.769
 in the last support we have to grind 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:41.379
 the tip of the last stand more for 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.379
 expose the cutting wheels 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:54.650
 [Music] 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.650
 and 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.629
 and 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:09.450
 as you can see all the wheels are 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.450
 exposed 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:18.330
 how can you melt 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.570
 the support on the left joins with 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.770
 the bearing and the right with the 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.770
 cutting wheels 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.840
 [Music] 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.059
 [Music] 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.569
 and you're ready to cut bottles of 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.569
 now 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.390
 using the second hose that can 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.650
 secure the co-star in a place of 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.980
 this way you can cut in any 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.900
 Where you want this is very easy to 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:08.070
 adjust

 [Music] 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:46.720
 to remember the homelands in half 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:50.210
 use boiling water and cold tap water 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.979
 eventually 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:59.630
 as fast as you were to warm up and 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:01.369
 cool fear uniformly by 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.969
 favor 

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:09.930
 keep extra bottles with 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:13.830
 you because you need practice to 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.879
 do this perfectly as well that's
