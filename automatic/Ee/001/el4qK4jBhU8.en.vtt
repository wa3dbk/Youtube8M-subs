on<00:01:39.090> my<00:01:39.360> brush<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.759> blend<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.970> right

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
on my brush and then just blend it right

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.740 
on my brush and then just blend it right
into<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.100> color<00:01:44.180> you<00:01:45.180> don't<00:01:45.299> want<00:01:45.420> too<00:01:45.600> much

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
into the color you don't want too much

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.170 
into the color you don't want too much
liquid<00:01:46.020> because<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.250> leaves<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.640> streaky

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
liquid because then it leaves a streaky

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.789 
liquid because then it leaves a streaky
but<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.780> won't<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.049> enough<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
but you won't have enough so that it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.149 
but you won't have enough so that it
doesn't<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.180> looks<00:01:51.210> patchy<00:01:51.979> if<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
doesn't but like it looks patchy if that

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.469 
doesn't but like it looks patchy if that
makes<00:01:53.340> sense<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.790> just<00:01:56.790> load<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.450> my

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
makes sense so just load that up on my

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.460 
makes sense so just load that up on my
brush<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.640> then

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
like frost overload it kind of gives it

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.920 
like frost overload it kind of gives it
a<00:04:39.120> little<00:04:39.330> bit<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.550> texture<00:04:41.970> difference<00:04:44.930> it

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
a little bit of a texture difference it

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.690 
a little bit of a texture difference it
makes<00:04:46.110> it<00:04:46.290> so<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:46.500> it's<00:04:46.770> not<00:04:46.980> so

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
makes it so that it's not so

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.670 
makes it so that it's not so
overwhelming<00:04:48.090> cuz<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:49.080> bright<00:04:49.380> those

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
overwhelming cuz that bright those

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.390 
overwhelming cuz that bright those
bright<00:04:49.920> colors<00:04:49.950> can<00:04:50.550> be<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.730> little<00:04:51.030> bit<00:04:51.240> crazy

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
bright colors can be a little bit crazy

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.020 
bright colors can be a little bit crazy
so<00:04:53.400> this<00:04:53.580> just<00:04:53.730> gives<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.120> a<00:04:54.210> little<00:04:54.240> bit<00:04:54.660> a

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
so this just gives it a little bit a

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:03.290 
so this just gives it a little bit a
different<00:04:57.030> feel

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.839 

so<00:05:03.810> really<00:05:04.110> just<00:05:04.319> blend<00:05:05.009> that<00:05:05.190> into<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.699> other

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
so really just blend that into the other

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:11.180 
so really just blend that into the other
colors<00:05:08.449> and<00:05:09.449> then<00:05:09.539> my<00:05:09.840> 227<00:05:10.500> brush<00:05:10.530> which<00:05:10.949> I'd
