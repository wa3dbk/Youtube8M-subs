00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
this I personally for me this is a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.819 
this I personally for me this is a
better<00:00:55.019> version<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.620> too<00:00:56.399> many<00:00:56.519> items<00:00:56.789> because

better version of too many items because

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.149 
better version of too many items because
first<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.780> you<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> spawn<00:01:01.350> spawn<00:01:01.890> errs

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
first of all you get to spawn spawn errs

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.240 
first of all you get to spawn spawn errs
and<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:03.449> bunch<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.049> other<00:01:04.199> stuff<00:01:04.290> well<00:01:05.040> that's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and a bunch of other stuff well that's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.800 
and a bunch of other stuff well that's
basically<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> spawn<00:01:06.450> spawn

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
basically and you get to spawn spawn

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.350 
basically and you get to spawn spawn
errs<00:01:07.049> let<00:01:07.680> your<00:01:07.799> boss<00:01:07.950> bad<00:01:08.280> which<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.030> hate

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
errs let your boss bad which I hate

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
errs let your boss bad which I hate
which<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:12.110> gone<00:01:13.110> also<00:01:13.229> search<00:01:13.649> like

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
which is and then gone also search like

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.810 
which is and then gone also search like
let's<00:01:14.220> say<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.240> I'm<00:01:16.250> dying<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.640> I

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
don't know what that does or that does I

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.670 
don't know what that does or that does I
don't<00:04:32.340> know<00:04:32.780> they're<00:04:33.780> just<00:04:33.810> latest<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.560> those

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
don't know they're just latest and those

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.710 
don't know they're just latest and those
are<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.889> recommended<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:36.090> this<00:04:36.300> works<00:04:36.510> to

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
are the recommended but this works to

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.180 
are the recommended but this works to
find<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.620> latest<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:39.330> so<00:04:40.320> then<00:04:40.530> once<00:04:40.949> you

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
find the latest and so then once you

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.189 
find the latest and so then once you
install<00:04:41.430> those<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:42.360> want<00:04:42.539> to<00:04:42.660> install<00:04:42.870> the

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
install those you want to install the

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.950 
install those you want to install the
latest<00:04:43.380> version<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:44.070> Forge<00:04:44.539> which<00:04:45.539> will

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
latest version of Forge which will

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.210 
latest version of Forge which will
probably<00:04:46.380> be<00:04:47.900> 1.74<00:04:48.900> 10<00:04:49.169> I<00:04:49.410> would<00:04:50.039> recommend

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
probably be 1.74 10 I would recommend

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.469 
probably be 1.74 10 I would recommend
not<00:04:51.560> manually<00:04:52.560> installing<00:04:53.100> it<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.580> wouldn't

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
not manually installing it I wouldn't

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.500 
not manually installing it I wouldn't
recommend<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:55.110> installer<00:04:55.590> for<00:04:55.950> it<00:04:56.130> because

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
recommend the installer for it because

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.370 
recommend the installer for it because
it's<00:04:57.510> easy<00:04:57.930> its<00:04:58.260> quick<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:59.450> it's<00:05:00.450> just<00:05:00.720> so

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
it's easy its quick and it's just so

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.129 
it's easy its quick and it's just so
much<00:05:01.530> better<00:05:01.849> and<00:05:02.849> so<00:05:03.510> once<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:03.840> install<00:05:03.990> that

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
much better and so once you install that

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:12.070 
much better and so once you install that
you<00:05:04.410> just<00:05:05.389> spelled<00:05:06.389> installer

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.890 

so<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.979> then<00:05:14.220> goes<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:14.460> add<00:05:14.699> fly<00:05:15.090> for<00:05:15.389> both<00:05:15.660> of

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
so it then goes to add fly for both of

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.560 
so it then goes to add fly for both of
those<00:05:16.050> yep<00:05:16.770> both<00:05:17.520> of<00:05:17.669> those<00:05:17.790> of<00:05:17.940> us<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.180> add<00:05:18.300> fly

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
those yep both of those of us to add fly

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.040 
those yep both of those of us to add fly
you<00:05:18.630> just<00:05:18.960> install<00:05:19.470> those<00:05:19.710> all<00:05:20.460> of<00:05:20.759> those<00:05:21.050> and

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
you just install those all of those and

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.350 
you just install those all of those and
so<00:05:22.199> then<00:05:22.380> you'll<00:05:22.620> probably<00:05:22.949> have<00:05:23.430> code

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
so then you'll probably have code

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.290 
so then you'll probably have code
