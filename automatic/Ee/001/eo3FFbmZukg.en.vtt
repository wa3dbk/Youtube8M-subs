00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the lightning cable if only because it's

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.850 
the lightning cable if only because it's
reversible<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> other<00:00:46.440> end<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
lightning cable not so much because it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.529 
lightning cable not so much because it
makes<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.250> 27<00:00:50.820> times<00:00:50.850> before
