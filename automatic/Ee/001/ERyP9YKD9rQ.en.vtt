00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
disappointed this year because there's

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.070 
disappointed this year because there's
like<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.649> strings<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.369> these<00:02:08.780> kept<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.899> coming

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
like the strings on these kept on coming

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.270 
like the strings on these kept on coming
out<00:02:10.289> around<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.500> lot<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.800> people's<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
out around a lot of people's and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.740 
out around a lot of people's and
especially<00:02:11.520> my<00:02:11.790> saw<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> keep<00:02:12.270> clipping<00:02:12.629> them

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
especially my saw to keep clipping them

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.430 
especially my saw to keep clipping them
so

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.950 
so
some<00:02:13.680> people<00:02:13.950> they<00:02:14.100> look<00:02:14.280> busted<00:02:14.850> mine<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.720> try

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
some people they look busted mine I try

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.360 
some people they look busted mine I try
to<00:02:16.020> keep<00:02:16.170> them<00:02:16.320> clean<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.950> hard<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.190> keep

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
to keep them clean but it's hard to keep

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.000 
to keep them clean but it's hard to keep
from<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.850> then<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.960> grip<00:02:19.260> started<00:02:19.830> fading

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
from and then the grip started fading

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.520 
from and then the grip started fading
from<00:02:20.400> red<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.120> white<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.380> look

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
from red to white so it kind of look

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.560 
from red to white so it kind of look
stupid<00:02:22.890> at<00:02:23.040> points<00:02:23.400> when<00:02:23.550> people<00:02:23.880> would<00:02:24.420> have

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
stupid at points when people would have

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.360 
stupid at points when people would have
white<00:02:24.960> fingertips<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> rest<00:02:26.220> all

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
white fingertips and then the rest all

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.950 
white fingertips and then the rest all
red<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.210> didn't<00:02:27.450> really<00:02:27.600> like<00:02:27.720> how<00:02:27.930> that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
red so I didn't really like how that

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.280 
red so I didn't really like how that
faded<00:02:28.560> out<00:02:28.710> but<00:02:29.180> otherwise<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.510> use<00:02:30.930> these<00:02:31.080> well

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
faded out but otherwise I use these well

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.680
