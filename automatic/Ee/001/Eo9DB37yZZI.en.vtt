00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.550
 super cool when to take pictures that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.210
 You try to help and it looks like it 's a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:55.309
 Really cool camera here. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.309

 Good if you want to know how to do this. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.760
 campaign is just keep watching

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.650
 good so lets go there for the materials 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:19.400
 You're going to need a pair of scissors. 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:24.950
 toothpick is the image you want 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:28.100
 your truck and transparent capes 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.710
 okay it also gives to do because it is 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.110
 but she's half transparent 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.790
 also gives up to see if I will 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.160
 continue on here I think 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.380
 cute 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.300
 If you want to see the step by step is just 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.820
 keep watching it come 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.479

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.800
 drawing and compared you guys will force it 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.800
 to make a mold 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.210
 but if you want to cause a 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.130
 pen also goes from the taste of each one 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.890
 I'll be using the device 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.500

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.950

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.440

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.540
 put there put the image in there you 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.580

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.250
 time also after that 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.599
