00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.900
 We go to a delicious pasta salad 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.700
 and we are going to use it first 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.780
 I play very much for this 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.710
 yummy 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.710
 4 we put in the pan 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.290
 we will wake up chicken fillet strips for a moment 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.820
 some olive oil 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.820
 I put in the pan in the wok 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.360
 it is also a very tasty one 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.190
 healthy salad with lots of fruit and 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.430
 lots of vegetables 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.770
 so this is really a vitamin bomb 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.770
 add the salt and some pepper 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.760
 I already have the pineapple in pieces 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.040
 sliced and the mozzarella 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.680
 note morel is thickening but 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.870
 I use the limes online especially 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.910
 so and mozzarella light from the deep 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.640
 half fewer calories and in taste I do 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.350
 you just really tasty 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.410
 Well in the meantime I am going to change the dressing 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.630
 make low-fat yogurt and pesto 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.040
 I have now opted for the red version 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.170
 but you can of course also the green 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.890
 use variant so that is just a moment 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.450
 yes taste what you like best I think 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.690
 do that three 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.649
 spoons by being a good sized spoon 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.590
 teaspoons but the pesto gives right 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.640
 tasty so you make together with the skinny 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.640
 Stir yogurt well 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.210
 also gets a very nice color itself 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.210
 I always taste a little bit 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.300
 he is very nice little salt 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:56.990
 so so this is she already 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.880
 the salad dressing for later that state 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.280
 even if done well, I have everything 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.640
 delicious finely sliced â€‹â€‹so the pineapple 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.130
 the apple the leek the mozerella it 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.610
 outing in the celery it's just 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.930
 will soon be a matter of mixing and well 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.430
 even your children can help with this 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.400
 salad 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.590
 well the chicken is ready as you see 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.450
 I'll let you rest for a while, you can do this 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.930
 salad by the way 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.540
 yes serve warm lukewarm or cold 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.319
 I'm going to mean the cold ingredients 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.300
 so this is my mozerella in cubes 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.920
 I do it through it is by the way too 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.300
 very easy if you are a four year old 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.650
 or have a party that you just have one 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.160
 tasty dishes 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.020
 I make pasta really filling the huge salad 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.400
 always get nice insula responses 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.890
 always have the recipe 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.220
 so that is also a nice tip 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.220
 the celery 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:57.840
 the leek from the apples 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.690
 and that is why children think so 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.310
 nice because there is so much animation 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.460
 see and apple I already beat that 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.460
 by each other 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.720
 I'm probably also referring to the chicken fillet strips 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.720
 there 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.670
 it starts to smell really nice 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.770
 I bought the walnuts ready-made 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.450
 at lidl 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.450
 and finally the paste dressing 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.640
 the pasta is al dente which I am going now 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.640
 drain 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.719
 well then he goes like that 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.439
 they fit over this time I go first 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.439
 just stir together 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:53.069
 then I put the dressing through it and myself 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.889
 late can always be just half an hour in 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.579
 pull the fridge tap a little 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:02.329
 the flavors really taste so good in it 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.329
 this salad 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.969
 she goes through the dressing 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.040
 I am also very nice under it 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:10.829
 baguette to eat but actually is 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.489
 that not necessary because of the pasta that already 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.680
 use this pasta salad is ideal as 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.120
 your many friends and you 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.750
 just want something is for them 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.549
 to make 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.160
 but don't be too frugal with those bullying 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.820
 what does it eat him in this salad 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.820
 tasty
