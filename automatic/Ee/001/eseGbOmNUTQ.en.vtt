00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
starts off with the song the revolution

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.170 
starts off with the song the revolution
so<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> very<00:00:25.859> heavy<00:00:26.220> song<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.150> a

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
so this is a very heavy song and it is a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.080 
so this is a very heavy song and it is a
perfect<00:00:27.779> opening<00:00:27.960> song<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.890> album<00:00:29.090> when

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
perfect opening song for the album when

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.730 
perfect opening song for the album when
I<00:00:30.119> first<00:00:30.449> listened<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:30.990> song<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.380> said<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
I first listened to this song I said to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.770 
I first listened to this song I said to
myself<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.579> seems<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> be

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
myself this seems like it's going to be

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.799 
myself this seems like it's going to be
a<00:00:34.020> heavier<00:00:34.950> attack<00:00:35.370> attack<00:00:35.760> album<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
a heavier attack attack album and it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.709 
a heavier attack attack album and it
luckily<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.730> breakdown<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.450> song

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
luckily was the breakdown in this song

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.590 
luckily was the breakdown in this song
is<00:00:40.050> absolutely<00:00:40.620> insane<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.399> reminds<00:00:42.239> me<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
is absolutely insane and reminds me a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.069 
is absolutely insane and reminds me a
lot<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.899> asking<00:00:43.770> Alexandria's<00:00:44.670> song<00:00:45.079> closure

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
lot of asking Alexandria's song closure

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.979 
lot of asking Alexandria's song closure
and<00:00:46.670> I<00:00:47.670> think<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.059> song<00:00:48.270> will<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.690> played

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and I think this song will be played

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.430 
and I think this song will be played
live<00:00:49.350> regularly<00:00:50.309> by<00:00:50.579> attack<00:00:51.570> attack<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.110> 2012

and the next song that I'm reviewing is
the<00:00:57.120> betrayal<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.620> song<00:00:58.890> opens<00:00:59.370> up<00:00:59.609> with

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the betrayal so this song opens up with

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.680
