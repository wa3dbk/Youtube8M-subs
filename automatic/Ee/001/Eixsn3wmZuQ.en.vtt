00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.690
 but 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.740
 mum 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.360
 return to the past at home honda yes 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.900
 because with this crf 250 l honda 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.670
 recalls a little what was his xl2 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.800
 50s appreciated for her 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.380
 inexpensiveness but above all for his 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.360
 good versatility a little for all 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.760
 seasons and for all uses yes because 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.890
 you can go shopping there you can 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.420
 go do some soft enduro you can 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.790
 even go out on the street and have fun 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.220
 above all the economy in a carefree way 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.080
 of the costs yes because with only 4 thousand e 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.080
 500 euros you can take home 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.969
 this crf is really good in the saddle 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.159
 two and a half l 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.170
 yes because a bit like now all 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.570
 honda is easy right away and 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.729
 above all it seems almost sewn on 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.879
 to those who ride it, climb into the saddle and 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.649
 car immediately a limit maybe a little 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.100
 big of this real motor bike 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:12.470
 single cylinder but does not have much torque 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.330
 low and medium speed and to make it blend 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.119
 it must always be kept high 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.460
 in the upper part of the rev counter also ad 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.200
 example for overtaking situations 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.030
 or in off-road situations 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.190
 when we have to face 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.270
 maybe a little more challenging climb 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.490
 than normal 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.630
 the engine does a little effort here is at 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.380
 take gil 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.020
 however you are rewarded with i 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.539
 its consumption yes because even not minding 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.549
 at the expense of the accelerator 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.190
 you can keep average kilometers 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.310
 well above 20 km per liter that 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.170
 today with 18 gasoline 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.170
 the chassis is never a bad thing 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.869
 then it's as easy as that 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.360
 intuitive can exist very light 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.179
 there are only 144 whoever carries it 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.090
 and very quick, I especially liked it 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.340
 a lot of the front fork very absorbs 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.840
 well the imperfections of the asphalt and 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.440
 always allows a smooth ride and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.019
 linear 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.019
 what about target centered for honda
