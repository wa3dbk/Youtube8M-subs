00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.130
 irreconcilable opposition to stress . he

 reports that the communists spent 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.330
 Saratov City Council picket with 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.610
 posters against the mayor of Krishchenko in 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.890
 Grishchenko resign and take the shovel do 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.380
 the road Grishchenko take a shovel to dig 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.510
 Grischenko potatoes take a shovel and dynaco 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.609
 understand the ditch and grischenko take a shovel and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.650
 feed us with pancakes general typical logic 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.420
 modern communists mayor 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.519
 road repair worker 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.650

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.480

 with a poster against the new order of things 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.530
 In general, the Communist Party now has two goals for 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 uncompromising criticism of Medvedev and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 heads of cities because as you know 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.850
 it is these people who accept all the most important 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.550
 political decisions in the country while the united states 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.820

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.840
 Medvedev radish bears decide 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.910

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.949
 The area this week stated that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.410
 past budget inefficiency

 year was 360 million rubles I 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.100
 I think that the accounting chamber is somewhat 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.750
 hurried up my grades because 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.520
 that's what's considered ineffective 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.560
 use will lose our money on 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.720
 the road is a lot of money spent but 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.060
 the road is still bad but the dacha 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.380
 officials just great and for just 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.720

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.500

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.009

 increasing their benefit in taking out 50 percent 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.840

 and deputies still find veterans 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.750
 without an apartment with insufficient benefits 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.820
 every fight is everything and anything from 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.830

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.990
