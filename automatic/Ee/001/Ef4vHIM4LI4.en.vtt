today<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.460> wanted<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.210> figure<00:00:09.480> out<00:00:09.950> how<00:00:10.950> tall

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
today I wanted to figure out how tall

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.629 
today I wanted to figure out how tall
this<00:00:11.639> Mario<00:00:12.090> from<00:00:12.300> Super<00:00:12.360> Mario<00:00:12.690> Brothers<00:00:13.639> so

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
this Mario from Super Mario Brothers so

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.510 
this Mario from Super Mario Brothers so
I<00:00:14.969> did<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> little<00:00:15.420> research<00:00:15.920> on<00:00:16.920> my<00:00:17.160> own<00:00:17.190> and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
I did a little research on my own and

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.990 
I did a little research on my own and
this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.359> why<00:00:18.539> figured<00:00:18.930> out<00:00:19.109> Mario<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.070> 16

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
this is why figured out Mario is 16

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.120 
this is why figured out Mario is 16
pixels<00:00:21.449> tall<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> original<00:00:22.410> Super<00:00:23.100> Mario

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130

pixels tall in the original Super Mario
Brothers<00:00:23.640> again<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.619> apparently<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.609> in

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
Brothers again and apparently so it's in

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.089 
Brothers again and apparently so it's in
the<00:00:26.910> size<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.420> mushroom<00:00:27.630> when<00:00:28.439> Mario<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the size of a mushroom when Mario is a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.849 
the size of a mushroom when Mario is a
single<00:00:29.789> original<00:00:30.359> height<00:00:30.929> died<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> little

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
single original height died a little

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.970 
single original height died a little
research<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.640> mushrooms<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.469> turns<00:00:34.710> out

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
research on mushrooms and it turns out

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.810 
research on mushrooms and it turns out
that<00:00:35.040> apparently<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.110> Goomba<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.950> alive<00:00:38.399> in

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that apparently if a Goomba was alive in

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.270 
that apparently if a Goomba was alive in
real<00:00:39.059> life<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.600> looks<00:00:40.530> most<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:43.280> cremini

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
real life it looks most like a cremini

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.760 
real life it looks most like a cremini
mushroom<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.450> many<00:00:45.840> mushrooms<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.590> like

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
mushroom the many mushrooms are like

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.490 
mushroom the many mushrooms are like
lady<00:00:47.360> in<00:00:48.360> short<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.739> tall<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.660> usual

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
lady in short to tall so it's like usual

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.990 
lady in short to tall so it's like usual
mushroom<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.190> find<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.850> your

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
mushroom that you find on like your

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.479 
mushroom that you find on like your
pizza<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:54.930> soup<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:56.160> type<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
pizza and your soup or that type of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.260 
pizza and your soup or that type of
stuff<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.840> wait<00:00:58.440> does<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.829> mean<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.270> Mario

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
stuff but wait does that mean that Mario

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.539 
stuff but wait does that mean that Mario
is<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:01.289> which<00:01:01.559> images<00:01:02.399> 0<00:01:02.940> 0<00:01:03.830> when<00:01:04.830> Mario

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
is one which images 0 0 when Mario

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.539 
is one which images 0 0 when Mario
Goetze<00:01:05.970> asides<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.860> means<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.310> he's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
Goetze asides up that means that he's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
Goetze asides up that means that he's
actually<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:10.970> foreign<00:01:11.970> crystal<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.049> doesn't

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
actually to foreign crystal this doesn't

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.170 
actually to foreign crystal this doesn't
make<00:01:13.619> sense<00:01:13.830> he's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> human<00:01:14.520> being<00:01:14.700> right<00:01:14.939> I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
make sense he's a human being right I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.240 
make sense he's a human being right I
mean<00:01:15.689> I'm<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.369> 24<00:01:17.820> inches<00:01:17.970> tall<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.799> just

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
mean I'm not to 24 inches tall it's just

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.520 
mean I'm not to 24 inches tall it's just
not<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.939> possible<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.380> you

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
not really that possible but if you

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.800 
not really that possible but if you
think<00:01:22.560> about<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.070> maybe<00:01:23.670> they<00:01:24.030> are<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
think about it maybe they are just a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.560 
think about it maybe they are just a
bunch<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.170> tiny<00:01:25.590> people<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.520> mean<00:01:26.939> look<00:01:27.240> at<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
bunch of tiny people I mean look at the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.300 
bunch of tiny people I mean look at the
size<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.930> their<00:01:28.110> turtles<00:01:28.740> they're<00:01:29.100> like

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
size of their turtles they're like

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.910 
size of their turtles they're like
almost<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.970> big<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.360> them<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.170> they<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.710> have

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
almost as big as them but they do have

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.440 
almost as big as them but they do have
turtles<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.420> have

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
turtles like that but do they have

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.830 
turtles like that but do they have
Turtles<00:01:34.170> bigger<00:01:34.590> than<00:01:34.860> humans<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.520> bowser

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
Turtles bigger than humans like bowser

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.480 
Turtles bigger than humans like bowser
how<00:01:36.840> about<00:01:37.049> turtles<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.100> walk<00:01:38.280> on

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
how about turtles if that can walk on

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.030 
how about turtles if that can walk on
their<00:01:38.670> actual<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.780> wigs<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.439> guys<00:01:40.770> are
