the interception of the fumble doomed um

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.280 
the interception of the fumble doomed um
I<00:01:36.299> thought<00:01:36.540> other<00:01:36.689> than<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.930> he<00:01:37.020> played<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.749 
I thought other than that he played it
pretty<00:01:37.350> much<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> perfect<00:01:37.890> game<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:38.460> thought<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
pretty much a perfect game i thought the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.280 
pretty much a perfect game i thought the
interception<00:01:39.299> was<00:01:39.329> more<00:01:39.600> result<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> roddy

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
hard to believe that a guy who's

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.510 
hard to believe that a guy who's
bringing<00:04:46.660> in<00:04:46.780> 90<00:04:47.140> plus<00:04:47.380> catches<00:04:47.830> isn't<00:04:48.400> gonna

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
find a way to come back especially when

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.750 
find a way to come back especially when
they<00:04:50.140> were<00:04:50.200> so<00:04:50.530> close<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.070> Super<00:04:51.370> Bowl<00:04:51.400> but

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
they were so close to the Super Bowl but

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.980 
they were so close to the Super Bowl but
I<00:04:51.970> just<00:04:52.300> think<00:04:52.420> there's<00:04:52.510> so<00:04:52.720> many<00:04:52.840> other

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
I just think there's so many other

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.540 
I just think there's so many other
things<00:04:53.110> going<00:04:53.560> in<00:04:53.740> their<00:04:53.860> favor<00:04:54.130> you<00:04:54.400> don't

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
things going in their favor you don't

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.710 
things going in their favor you don't
have<00:04:54.670> to<00:04:54.760> worry<00:04:54.970> as<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.240> mentioned<00:04:55.570> about

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
have to worry as you mentioned about

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.210 
have to worry as you mentioned about
some<00:04:55.930> of<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.080> mental<00:04:56.260> makeup<00:04:56.560> issues<00:04:57.070> with

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
some of the mental makeup issues with

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.280

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
bringing his team back on multiple

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.000 
bringing his team back on multiple
occasions<00:05:00.790> and<00:05:01.420> just<00:05:02.410> a<00:05:02.500> lot<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.830> things

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010

working<00:05:03.370> in<00:05:03.490> his<00:05:03.550> favor<00:05:03.760> I<00:05:03.940> don't<00:05:04.270> quite<00:05:04.510> think

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
working in his favor I don't quite think

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.600 
working in his favor I don't quite think
he's<00:05:04.870> hit<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.050> ceiling<00:05:05.320> yet<00:05:05.650> because<00:05:06.010> we<00:05:06.430> saw

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
he's hit the ceiling yet because we saw

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
so much progress made this year and I

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.420 
so much progress made this year and I
just<00:05:08.350> I<00:05:08.500> find<00:05:08.740> there'd<00:05:08.890> still<00:05:09.040> be<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.250> lot<00:05:09.400> of

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
just I find there'd still be a lot of

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.100 
just I find there'd still be a lot of
room<00:05:09.640> to<00:05:09.670> improve<00:05:09.850> all<00:05:10.390> right<00:05:10.540> guys<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:10.930> sounds
