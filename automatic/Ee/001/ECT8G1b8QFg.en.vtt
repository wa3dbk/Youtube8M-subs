00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that but again very appreciative to find

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.110 
that but again very appreciative to find
a<00:00:36.930> way<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> win<00:00:37.610> mates<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.730> free<00:00:38.879> throws<00:00:39.090> down

a way to win mates in free throws down
the<00:00:39.329> end<00:00:39.710> certainly<00:00:40.710> didn't<00:00:40.860> rebound<00:00:41.180> tonight

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
the end certainly didn't rebound tonight

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.400 
the end certainly didn't rebound tonight
but<00:00:42.420> find<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> way<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> win<00:00:48.079> it<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.200> difficult

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
but find a way to win it was difficult

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.810 
but find a way to win it was difficult
because<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:50.070> were<00:00:50.129> doing<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.399> tremendous<00:00:50.579> job

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
because they were doing a tremendous job

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.630 
because they were doing a tremendous job
of<00:00:51.600> attacking<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.590> our<00:00:53.160> guys<00:00:53.370> were<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
of attacking it and our guys were a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.229 
of attacking it and our guys were a
little<00:00:54.379> once<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.649> past<00:00:55.920> our<00:00:56.100> first<00:00:56.430> line

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
little once it got past our first line

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
little once it got past our first line
in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> two-two-one<00:00:58.399> they<00:00:59.399> weren't

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
in the two-two-one they weren't

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.010 
in the two-two-one they weren't
springing<00:00:59.850> back<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:00.780> probably

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
springing back as well as they probably

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.810 
springing back as well as they probably
should<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:02.250> were<00:01:02.309> doing<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.640> good<00:01:02.760> job

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
should have they were doing a good job

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.550 
should have they were doing a good job
so<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:04.110> had<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.430> out<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> timeout<00:01:05.850> David<00:01:06.600> 9<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
so we had a out of a timeout David 9 and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
so we had a out of a timeout David 9 and
Jimmy<00:01:07.860> talked<00:01:08.100> about<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.640> went<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.450> 21<00:01:09.750> got

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
Jimmy talked about it we went to 21 got

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.980 
Jimmy talked about it we went to 21 got
a<00:01:09.990> steal<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.560> got<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> turnover<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.810> we<00:01:12.810> ran

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
a steal and got a turnover so we ran

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.840 
a steal and got a turnover so we ran
with<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.439> bit<00:01:13.530> more<00:01:13.680> tonight<00:01:14.100> again

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
with a little bit more tonight again

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.120 
with a little bit more tonight again
this<00:01:15.119> team<00:01:15.330> has<00:01:15.509> trouble<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.560> pressure<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
this team has trouble with pressure and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.890 
this team has trouble with pressure and
taking<00:01:17.369> care<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> ball<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.810> know

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
taking care of the ball so you know

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.289 
taking care of the ball so you know
forcing<00:01:19.439> 23<00:01:19.920> turnovers<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.939> difference

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
forcing 23 turnovers was the difference

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.880 
forcing 23 turnovers was the difference
in<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.570> game<00:01:21.659> because<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.350> certainly<00:01:22.680> didn't

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
in this game because we certainly didn't

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.149 
in this game because we certainly didn't
rebound<00:01:23.189> something<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.150> yet<00:01:25.159> go

consistency<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.240> urgency<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:57.869> our<00:01:58.020> defense

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
consistency and urgency with our defense

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.310 
consistency and urgency with our defense
right<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:58.850> but<00:01:59.850> again<00:01:59.939> i'd<00:02:00.149> rather<00:02:00.390> work<00:02:01.140> on

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
right now but again i'd rather work on

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
right now but again i'd rather work on
defense<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> win<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:02.759> rather<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.180> loss

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
defense or the win then rather the loss

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.030 
defense or the win then rather the loss
so<00:02:04.070> maybe<00:02:05.070> that's<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:06.450> good<00:02:06.570> thing

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
so maybe that's the good thing

higher<00:05:56.240> but<00:05:57.190> possibly<00:05:58.190> a<00:05:58.280> lot<00:05:58.460> of<00:05:58.580> throwing<00:05:59.210> it

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
higher but possibly a lot of throwing it

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.480 
higher but possibly a lot of throwing it
out<00:05:59.360> of<00:05:59.480> bounds<00:05:59.600> whatever<00:06:00.290> it<00:06:00.410> may<00:06:00.530> be<00:06:00.560> i'm<00:06:01.310> not

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
out of bounds whatever it may be i'm not

out of bounds whatever it may be i'm not
sure<00:06:01.550> why<00:06:01.940> I<00:06:02.000> thought<00:06:02.420> I<00:06:02.600> think<00:06:03.230> we<00:06:03.350> finished

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890

we were okay in transition so the dorm

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.220 
we were okay in transition so the dorm

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
you guys did a good job defending what

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.080 
you guys did a good job defending what
was<00:06:45.680> our<00:06:45.770> game<00:06:45.920> plan<00:06:45.950> we<00:06:46.670> knew<00:06:46.820> we<00:06:46.940> were<00:06:47.000> going

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
was our game plan we knew we were going

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.670 
was our game plan we knew we were going
to<00:06:47.180> play<00:06:47.210> more<00:06:47.480> zone<00:06:47.750> I<00:06:47.900> probably<00:06:48.200> was<00:06:48.530> going

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
to play more zone I probably was going

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.700 
to play more zone I probably was going
to<00:06:48.740> go<00:06:48.830> 5050<00:06:49.550> I'm<00:06:49.640> not<00:06:49.760> sure<00:06:49.940> it<00:06:50.120> was<00:06:50.210> closed

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
to go 5050 I'm not sure it was closed

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.050 
to go 5050 I'm not sure it was closed
because<00:06:51.710> of<00:06:51.950> the<00:06:52.100> fact<00:06:52.310> that<00:06:52.430> they're<00:06:52.820> one<00:06:53.030> of

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
because of the fact that they're one of

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.930 
because of the fact that they're one of
the<00:06:53.150> they<00:06:53.960> don't<00:06:54.140> make<00:06:54.830> many<00:06:55.190> threes<00:06:55.610> or<00:06:55.760> take

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
the they don't make many threes or take

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.570 
the they don't make many threes or take
many<00:06:56.660> threes<00:06:56.960> and<00:06:57.110> so<00:06:57.290> we<00:06:57.590> were<00:06:58.250> going<00:06:58.400> to<00:06:58.460> go<00:06:58.550> a

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
many threes and so we were going to go a

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.140 
many threes and so we were going to go a
little<00:06:58.730> bit<00:06:58.880> more<00:06:59.000> zone<00:06:59.530> and<00:07:00.850> I<00:07:01.850> thought<00:07:02.030> our

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
little bit more zone and I thought our

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.090 
little bit more zone and I thought our
guys<00:07:02.240> did<00:07:02.420> a<00:07:02.510> good<00:07:02.630> job<00:07:02.690> of<00:07:02.870> closing<00:07:03.710> out<00:07:03.950> on

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
guys did a good job of closing out on

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.050 
guys did a good job of closing out on
some<00:07:04.340> shooters<00:07:04.670> but<00:07:05.120> again<00:07:05.390> in<00:07:05.660> zone<00:07:07.030> you<00:07:08.030> have

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
some shooters but again in zone you have

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.550 
some shooters but again in zone you have
to<00:07:08.150> have<00:07:08.300> five<00:07:08.540> guys<00:07:08.750> go<00:07:08.990> to<00:07:09.080> the<00:07:09.140> glass<00:07:09.350> and

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 
to have five guys go to the glass and

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.620 
to have five guys go to the glass and
rebound<00:07:09.860> I<00:07:09.950> didn't<00:07:10.190> think<00:07:10.340> we<00:07:10.570> finished<00:07:11.570> the

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
rebound I didn't think we finished the

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.120 
rebound I didn't think we finished the
possessions<00:07:12.050> off<00:07:12.200> very<00:07:12.440> well<00:07:12.500> against<00:07:12.980> in

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
possessions off very well against in

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.770 
possessions off very well against in
when<00:07:13.340> we<00:07:13.460> weren't<00:07:13.580> zone<00:07:13.820> how<00:07:14.420> much<00:07:14.570> more

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
when we weren't zone how much more

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.270 
when we weren't zone how much more
difficult<00:07:14.990> was<00:07:15.350> it<00:07:15.380> defending<00:07:15.920> against<00:07:16.100> our

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
difficult was it defending against our

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000 
one we had one good defense

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.540 
one we had one good defense
listen<00:07:41.570> it<00:07:42.290> certainly<00:07:42.680> was<00:07:42.920> and<00:07:43.220> Wally

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.550

ball handling but that's again last year
we<00:07:52.970> would<00:07:53.180> have<00:07:53.300> completely<00:07:53.750> let<00:07:54.530> it<00:07:54.650> affect

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:54.980 
we would have completely let it affect

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.480 
we would have completely let it affect
our<00:07:55.970> the<00:07:56.480> way<00:07:56.570> we<00:07:56.720> played<00:07:56.930> that<00:07:57.080> defended<00:07:57.980> the

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.490 
our the way we played that defended the

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.760 
our the way we played that defended the
last<00:07:58.730> three<00:07:58.970> or<00:07:59.060> four<00:07:59.090> possessions<00:07:59.680> we<00:08:00.680> would

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:00.770 
last three or four possessions we would

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.740 
last three or four possessions we would
have<00:08:00.800> put<00:08:01.520> our<00:08:01.610> heads<00:08:01.790> down<00:08:01.880> our<00:08:02.360> energy<00:08:02.720> and

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.750 
have put our heads down our energy and

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.780 
have put our heads down our energy and
our<00:08:03.020> focus<00:08:03.380> would<00:08:03.530> have<00:08:03.650> lapsed<00:08:04.250> and<00:08:04.370> we'd

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:04.790 
our focus would have lapsed and we'd

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.340 
our focus would have lapsed and we'd
have<00:08:04.880> lost<00:08:05.030> the<00:08:05.210> game<00:08:05.360> so<00:08:05.660> there<00:08:06.290> are

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:06.350 
have lost the game so there are

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.500 
have lost the game so there are
positives<00:08:07.040> it's<00:08:07.880> just<00:08:08.090> there's<00:08:08.270> a<00:08:08.330> lot<00:08:08.450> of

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:08.510 
positives it's just there's a lot of

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.930 
positives it's just there's a lot of
room<00:08:08.720> for<00:08:08.750> improvement
