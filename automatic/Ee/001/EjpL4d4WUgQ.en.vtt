00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:09.440
 good friends from youtube the video 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.799
 we will decide how to give a samsung 7 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.019
 of 10 or 15 of this only for models 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.780
 samsung that are resisted with keys 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.680
 if they robbed me that you have to be good 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.780
 is 30 with keys anything 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.740
 we put this thriller key we released 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.170
 the phone of anything 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.060
 well what I wanted to do first 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.870
 you have to take out the battery and success 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.870
 as you can see 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.440
 everything there is to do 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 it has to be meaningful it's over 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.780
 chip everything we just put the battery the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.780
 drums 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.250
 and I proceed to learn 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.659
 there are seven globish is this we are going 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.659
 for any operator 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.870
 Well they are samsung good says 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:31.660
 configuration of interest at this time 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.660
 when what you have to say with this without 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:42.060
 phone we have accessed the system 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.159
 well this is not from this code 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.030
 Because of that I want 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.940
 must be done 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:56.500
 with the asterisk 27 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.500
 in the 7 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.049
 you think 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.049
 again asterisk 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.960
 38 55 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.510
 as you see in small scripts or children 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.780
 small we have any other number 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.730
 not us 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.270
 the key is the key for this phone 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:25.950
 any by any state and what 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.660
 you have to be the last to expose the numeral and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.160
 it is prescribed to cerrito it is not necessary to make 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.160
 nothing is paid alone 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.190

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.190

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.770

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.360
