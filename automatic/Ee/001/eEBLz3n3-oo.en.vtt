00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
either Ford's at Benin but they're all

either Ford's at Benin but they're all
them<00:02:50.420> are<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> little<00:02:50.810> bit<00:02:51.049> different<00:02:51.790> that's

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
them are a little bit different that's

them are a little bit different that's

the code for the last time tested I

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.050 
the code for the last time tested I
don't<00:02:54.860> know<00:02:54.980> if<00:02:55.040> there's<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.250> chime<00:02:55.549> test<00:02:55.880> in

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
don't know if there's a chime test in

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.809 
don't know if there's a chime test in
this<00:02:56.209> vehicle<00:02:56.480> or<00:02:56.840> not<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:58.220> focus<00:02:58.640> had<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
this vehicle or not the focus had a

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.860 
this vehicle or not the focus had a
chime<00:02:59.150> test<00:03:00.850> but<00:03:01.850> like<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.060> said<00:03:02.120> all<00:03:02.420> Ford's

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
chime test but like I said all Ford's

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.449 
chime test but like I said all Ford's
there<00:03:03.019> they<00:03:03.350> differ<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.709> little<00:03:03.890> bit<00:03:04.130> but<00:03:04.280> most

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
there they differ a little bit but most

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.069 
there they differ a little bit but most
of<00:03:04.519> them<00:03:04.670> work<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:04.940> same<00:03:05.120> way<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.570> we're<00:03:05.989> back

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
of them work the same way and we're back

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:12.980 
of them work the same way and we're back
to<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.350> beginning

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.930 

so<00:03:13.560> yeah<00:03:13.830> there<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.250> go<00:03:14.310> it's<00:03:14.520> kind<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.700> fun<00:03:14.850> to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
so yeah there you go it's kind of fun to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.070 
so yeah there you go it's kind of fun to
play<00:03:15.120> with<00:03:15.300> like<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.540> said<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:15.780> can<00:03:15.900> drive

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
play with like I said you can drive

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.360 
play with like I said you can drive
around<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.530> mode<00:03:16.770> doesn't<00:03:17.040> hurt<00:03:17.220> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
around in that mode doesn't hurt the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.860 
around in that mode doesn't hurt the
truck<00:03:17.580> or<00:03:17.730> anything<00:03:17.910> you're<00:03:18.600> not<00:03:18.690> going<00:03:18.810> to

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
truck or anything you're not going to

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.630 
truck or anything you're not going to
mess<00:03:18.990> anything<00:03:19.260> up<00:03:19.590> they<00:03:19.830> don't<00:03:19.920> they<00:03:20.280> make<00:03:20.490> it

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
mess anything up they don't they make it

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.190 
mess anything up they don't they make it
so<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.820> can't<00:03:21.030> do<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.300> obviously<00:03:21.450> can't

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
so you can't do that obviously can't

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.630 
so you can't do that obviously can't
screw<00:03:22.470> up<00:03:22.530> your<00:03:22.710> odometer<00:03:22.920> or<00:03:23.250> anything<00:03:23.400> like

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
screw up your odometer or anything like

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.820 
screw up your odometer or anything like
that<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:25.080> don't<00:03:25.230> worry<00:03:25.290> about<00:03:25.380> messing<00:03:25.650> your

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
that so don't worry about messing your

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.020 
that so don't worry about messing your
truck<00:03:26.010> up<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.370> still<00:03:26.550> play<00:03:26.730> with<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:26.940> you

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
truck up you can still play with it you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.460 
truck up you can still play with it you
can<00:03:27.120> do<00:03:27.210> gauge<00:03:27.450> sweeps<00:03:27.930> while<00:03:28.200> you're<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
can do gauge sweeps while you're on the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.770 
can do gauge sweeps while you're on the
road<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.830> stuff<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.220> kind<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.430> fun<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.790> don't

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
road and stuff it's kind of fun I don't

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.210 
road and stuff it's kind of fun I don't
recommend<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.410> though<00:03:31.650> because<00:03:31.890> you're<00:03:32.130> not

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
recommend that though because you're not

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.670 
recommend that though because you're not
going<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.430> how<00:03:32.520> fast<00:03:32.760> you're<00:03:33.000> going<00:03:33.120> for<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> sec

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
going to how fast you're going for a sec

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.840 
going to how fast you're going for a sec
but<00:03:34.680> now<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:34.950> should<00:03:35.130> be<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.310> problem<00:03:35.580> unless

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
but now it should be a problem unless

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.450 
but now it should be a problem unless
you're<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.300> know<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.630> wild<00:03:37.080> maniac<00:03:37.980> speeding

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
you're you know a wild maniac speeding

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.010 
you're you know a wild maniac speeding
anyway<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:38.940> get<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.090> idea

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
anyway you get the idea

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.190 
anyway you get the idea
that's<00:03:40.830> it<00:03:40.980> bye
