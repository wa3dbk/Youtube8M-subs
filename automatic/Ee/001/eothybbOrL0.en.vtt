we're<00:00:19.000> evolving<00:00:19.270> the<00:00:19.689> sort<00:00:19.930> of<00:00:20.020> stars

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
we're evolving the sort of stars

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.769 
we're evolving the sort of stars
universe<00:00:20.650> it<00:00:21.460> will<00:00:21.640> be<00:00:21.789> the<00:00:22.029> universe<00:00:22.630> that

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
universe it will be the universe that

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.060 
universe it will be the universe that
people<00:00:23.080> play<00:00:23.170> through<00:00:23.500> in<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:23.680> original<00:00:23.800> game

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
people play through in the original game

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.759 
people play through in the original game
and<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.519> two<00:00:24.640> expansions<00:00:25.240> and<00:00:25.650> it'll<00:00:26.650> be

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
and the two expansions and it'll be

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.099 
and the two expansions and it'll be
expanded<00:00:27.340> out<00:00:27.460> into<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.269> future<00:00:28.449> by<00:00:28.840> about<00:00:29.050> a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
expanded out into the future by about a

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.339 
expanded out into the future by about a
hundred<00:00:29.260> years<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:31.150> so<00:00:31.599> all<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:32.019> races

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
hundred years and so all the races

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.869 
hundred years and so all the races
you're<00:00:32.470> familiar<00:00:32.650> with<00:00:32.920> will<00:00:33.309> have<00:00:33.460> evolved

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
you're familiar with will have evolved

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.030 
you're familiar with will have evolved
somewhat<00:00:34.239> taking<00:00:34.690> on<00:00:34.780> new<00:00:34.960> aspects<00:00:35.470> gameplay

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
somewhat taking on new aspects gameplay

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.190 
somewhat taking on new aspects gameplay
will<00:00:36.220> take<00:00:36.400> on<00:00:36.550> new<00:00:36.730> aspects<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:37.450> it<00:00:38.110> will

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
will take on new aspects and it will

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.290 
will take on new aspects and it will
generally<00:00:38.530> be<00:00:38.559> a<00:00:38.770> familiar<00:00:39.309> elements<00:00:39.730> but<00:00:40.180> it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
generally be a familiar elements but it

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.750
