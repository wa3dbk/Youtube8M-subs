this is the infinity case by second

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.499 
this is the infinity case by second
shells<00:00:03.959> this<00:00:04.710> one<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> milltek<00:00:05.790> material<00:00:06.359> if

we take a look at it this has these

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.020 
we take a look at it this has these
little<00:00:09.559> bumps<00:00:10.559> which<00:00:11.400> give<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.790> nice

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
little bumps which give it a nice

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.629 
little bumps which give it a nice
non-slip<00:00:12.690> grip<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.679> one<00:00:13.860> happens<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.309> in

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
non-slip grip this one happens to be in

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.630 
non-slip grip this one happens to be in
bronze<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.470> bronzes<00:00:16.980> has<00:00:17.279> these<00:00:17.490> little

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
bronze the bronzes has these little

bronze the bronzes has these little
black<00:00:18.300> lines<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.960> between<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.830> kind<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
black lines in between it so it kind of

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.750 
black lines in between it so it kind of
gives<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> nice<00:00:20.640> looking<00:00:21.570> case<00:00:22.490> if<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.550> look

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
gives it a nice looking case if we look

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.519 
gives it a nice looking case if we look
in<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> back<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.480> got<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> camera<00:00:25.230> hole<00:00:25.410> in

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
in the back it's got the camera hole in

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.450 
in the back it's got the camera hole in
the<00:00:25.619> back<00:00:26.119> I'll<00:00:27.119> go<00:00:27.269> ahead<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.480> open<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.960> up

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
the back I'll go ahead and open it up

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.429 
the back I'll go ahead and open it up
when<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.490> opened<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.119> see<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:31.380> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
when we opened it up we see that this a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.340 
when we opened it up we see that this a
nice<00:00:31.830> felt<00:00:32.279> material<00:00:32.489> over<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.719> well<00:00:34.110> as

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
nice felt material over here as well as

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.190 
nice felt material over here as well as
the<00:00:34.800> felt<00:00:35.010> material<00:00:35.160> over<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.329> this

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the felt material over here this

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.660 
the felt material over here this
prevents<00:00:37.649> any<00:00:37.770> kind<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> scratches<00:00:38.489> or

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
prevents any kind of scratches or

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.369 
prevents any kind of scratches or
scrapes<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.180> actually<00:00:39.510> will<00:00:39.600> tablet<00:00:40.050> itself

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
scrapes that actually will tablet itself

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.830 
scrapes that actually will tablet itself
which<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.890> pretty<00:00:41.340> neat<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:42.300> addition<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
which is pretty neat in addition the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.990 
which is pretty neat in addition the
felt<00:00:43.050> material<00:00:43.170> goes<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.010> way<00:00:44.309> around<00:00:44.460> so

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
felt material goes all the way around so

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.619 
felt material goes all the way around so
it's<00:00:45.660> actually<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.120> top<00:00:48.390> over

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it's actually in here and in on top over

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.560 
it's actually in here and in on top over
here<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.129> actually<00:00:50.399> prevents<00:00:51.210> any<00:00:51.360> kind

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
here so it's actually prevents any kind

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.869 
here so it's actually prevents any kind
of<00:00:51.629> damage<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> screen<00:00:52.289> itself<00:00:52.789> what<00:00:53.789> I'm

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
of damage to the screen itself what I'm

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.950 
of damage to the screen itself what I'm
going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.030> go<00:00:54.149> ahead<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.719> want<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
going to go ahead and do is I want to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.920 
going to go ahead and do is I want to
put<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.500> tablet<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.660> there's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.809> little

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
put my tablet in there there's a little

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:07.429 
put my tablet in there there's a little
velcro<00:00:58.739> enclosure<00:01:00.649> slides<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:06.290> then<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
velcro enclosure slides in then it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.420 
velcro enclosure slides in then it
straps<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:09.840> it's

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
straps in just like that so now it's

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.600 
straps in just like that so now it's
nice<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.610> steady<00:01:12.229> if<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.920> look<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.310> it's

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
nice and steady if you look at it it's

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.330 
nice and steady if you look at it it's
got<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> nice<00:01:15.439> magnetic<00:01:16.439> closure<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.189> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
got a nice magnetic closure so it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.399 
got a nice magnetic closure so it
doesn't<00:01:17.670> actually<00:01:17.820> ever<00:01:18.240> open<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.780> in

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
doesn't actually ever open up in

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.480 
doesn't actually ever open up in
addition<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.890> reason<00:01:20.130> why<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.340> called

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
addition the reason why it's called

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.960 
addition the reason why it's called
infinity<00:01:21.000> case<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.840> has<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.880> if

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
infinity case is that it has this and if

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.899 
infinity case is that it has this and if
you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.180> tell<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.780> these<00:01:24.930> little

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
you can tell they have these little

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.780 
you can tell they have these little
velcro<00:01:26.909> feet<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> these<00:01:28.140> feet<00:01:28.439> are<00:01:29.310> designed

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
velcro feet and these feet are designed

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.990 
velcro feet and these feet are designed
to<00:01:30.119> position<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> tablet<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.770> any<00:01:32.400> angle<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
to position the tablet on any angle that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.450 
to position the tablet on any angle that
you<00:01:33.150> choose<00:01:33.439> okay<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.979> I'd<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> do

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
something this fashion and actually I do

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.429 
something this fashion and actually I do
a<00:01:38.340> little<00:01:38.579> lower<00:01:38.820> than<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.200> that

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
a little lower than this just like that

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.649 
a little lower than this just like that
you<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.280> has<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.670> military<00:01:42.060> material

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you see it has the military material

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.440 
you see it has the military material
over<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:43.049> also<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.700> nice<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.090> typing

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
over here also and it's nice for typing

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.539 
over here also and it's nice for typing
them<00:01:45.540> type<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.439> are<00:01:46.590> pretty<00:01:46.740> darn<00:01:46.979> hard<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
them type and I are pretty darn hard and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.880 
them type and I are pretty darn hard and
it<00:01:48.119> still<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:48.600> what's<00:01:49.200> moving<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.740> it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
it still is not what's moving but it's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.819 
it still is not what's moving but it's
not<00:01:50.360> folding<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.600> or<00:01:51.960> breaking<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.470> any<00:01:52.649> way

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
not folding or or breaking in any way

not folding or or breaking in any way
shape<00:01:53.070> or<00:01:53.220> form<00:01:53.420> take<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> look<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.899> like

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
shape or form take a look at it like

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.760 
shape or form take a look at it like
this<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:56.390> it's<00:01:57.390> very<00:01:57.750> very<00:01:58.110> thin<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.439> gives

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
this and it's very very thin and gives

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.859 
this and it's very very thin and gives
you<00:01:58.920> almost<00:01:59.100> no<00:01:59.670> both<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.210> case<00:02:00.509> maybe

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
you almost no both to the case maybe

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.459
