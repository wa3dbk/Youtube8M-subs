00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
 and 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.610
 and how about codemates facilitated 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.730
 today we are going to continue with the 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.660
 course of css and we are going to talk about the 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.660
 colors 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.830
 we'll see 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.500
 what properties can we 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.480
 use with colors as we go to 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.760
 assign colors to our things 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:40.360
 same and when there is something that spread 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.579
 with css3 is a property that 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.070
 adopted new or new attributes 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.620
 properties with css3 first we see the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.300
 basic part the part that existed the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.730
 part that several of you have to know 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.820
 and then we see what's coming 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.300
 with with the new standard not then 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.609
 well here I have my paragraph proof that 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.469
 is this one here and we have two properties 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.960
 one that we already saw in the tutorial the 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.270
 background color and another one that 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.570
 it is simply and simply color the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.560
 first you know it serves to change the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.700
 background color and the second one serves to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.700
 change 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.130
 the color of the font is to say you 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.159
 you want to change the color of a font 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.380
 before I do not remember well but I think 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.560
 what is it that was font 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.789
 forget about that definitely what 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.159
 let's use now it's color and good 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:42.140
 is what we have there are several ways 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:45.140
 to place css we are going to write them a 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.000
 little here as annotations adding 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.930
 comments in css 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.930
 of months 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.289
 A) Yes 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.430
 but it's the way to see comments in 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.660
 our style sheet 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.980
 There are three basic ways to add 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:08.830
 colors then the first one is 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.560
 with the name that has 16 colors 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.650
 basic 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.670
 the second is with something that is known 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.670
 as hexadecimal 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:24.740
 ex to decimal and another that is known as 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.740
 hexadecimal short 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:34.110
 well these are the ones we have without css3 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:37.260
 the first one not like I just placed it 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.180
 there does not apply for all colors is 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.540
 say there is not a name for each color 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.700
 that there is only 16 colors that are 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.520
 the basics and right now to see them 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.760
 then I'm going to show you a page 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.160
 well this is a page where 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.310
 I show the 16 basic colors 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.880
 we have red that red the black that is 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.660
 black navy that is navy the blue that is 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.240
 blue the til the water that is as well as as 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.810
 it is in the silver that silver the gray 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.460
 what is serious yellow green or live like that 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:20.640
 like this brown lime white fuchsia and for 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.740
 Paul then all these colors the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.970
 you can add using a name is 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.030
 say for example that we are going to change 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.040
 this for a network background color if we 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.140
 let's go here obviously change network and the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.500
 We will change the color of the font 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.750
 by white here white perfect 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.270
 that is the first way to change 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.570
 colors it is very rare for someone to use 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.620
 this way but good if you can if it is 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.920
 valid and the second is two are 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.860
 place starting with a cat or if you're 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.630
 using as 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.840
 the dreamweaver work tool 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.970
 You have a color palette you 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.730
 has even left the option to have 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.230
 a little circle here with which you can 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.270
 manipulate the color to give you the 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.270
 value that you want 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.939
 it's a good tool but good for 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.290
 there are usually others like colors and the and 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:18.109
 that we're going to see when we talk about 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.449
 degraded especially because there is not one 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.500
 person who obviously knows all the 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.030
 colors of him that exists not for that 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.650
 as well 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.770
 I'm going to show you a tool 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.360
 quite interesting from the same adobe that 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.460
 lets good that we combine 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.470
 colors because usually if you 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.750
 you devote to good web design the theory of 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.450
 colors of the chalk and know if yes you 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.630
 you devote to rather to develop there 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.669
 ascribed to buckingham languages and 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.169
 all that good maybe they are not so 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.440
 familiar with the colors but good 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.139
 this is an interesting tool but 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.120
 I mention that it 's mostly because I do not 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.180
 any there is no person who knows 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.710
 all the colors or the value of what 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.630
 color in hexadecimal but for example 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.380
 here we are going to change the background color 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.720
 by state led is automatically jim 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.410
 Weber tells us that this is the 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.420
 the value in hexadecimal if all how many 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.300
 hexadecimal because it has six values 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.879
 and think 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.509
 then there is also another some 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:27.000
 colors accept a value written in 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:31.229
 equal short hexadecimal does not apply to 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.889
 all the colors but good if for 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:37.379
 for example the basic ones like black 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:41.129
 that instead of putting 36 zeros we put 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:43.650
 only 3 and there is no or the target that 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.960
 instead of using the blank that instead 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.340
 to put the target of its value 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.340
 hexadecimal is 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:57.319
 6 2 4 6 6 but we can also 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.879
 write with the short hexadecimal that 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:06.139
 they are only 3 is to say half and also 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:09.409
 I do not know how many are those who 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.120
 they accept the short hexadecimal but so 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:14.030
 general when I want to place a 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.819
 black background color there is no way anymore 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.009
 short of doing it this or when 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:21.740
 I want to put something blank because this 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:24.080
 is the ideal way not then so far 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.849
 the basic part of the colors in the 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.340
 next let's see from that 3 well 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.340
 I wait for you and well I send you a greeting
