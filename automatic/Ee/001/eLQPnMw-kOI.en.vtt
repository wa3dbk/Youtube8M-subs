00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.169
 4 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:09.130
 and is safe 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.449
 Welcome to choose a new viewer 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:15.249
 This time with Sport Forint why you need us of course 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.219
 at the moment 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.410
 Normally only safe today at 10 clock SGN in the main market is quite simple 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.619
 a real one of the country can 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.779
 also with other programs 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.239
 and show her very briefly what you can do here 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.679
 we do not have hers 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.920
 an account is allowed 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.720
 a first step with this program 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.910
 you can see them a blue logo that is right Treaty 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.730
 was designed for the lineup and so on but I would like to now on the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.730
 to come to the Russian cathedral 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.560
 in Moscow and that is 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.320
 Do not Hamm her 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.820
 beautiful ones with also 1 in purchase and were designed 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.890
 our data should still make before the latter 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 if there is a short notice notice 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.630
 Sion 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.630
 Food the revolving door really designed 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.540
 and the c4 in the keirin 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.510
 i may not need to make any sensations but the ones i mentioned earlier 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.030
 Stand firm and it can be tough 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.670
 what would like to prove with this 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.090
 and although you have different forms here can see the slot samples 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.730
 for example, that convinces her screen 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.360
 comparable middle of the second sentence 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.110
 just 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.150
 this time off 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.630
 and announced their own 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.030
 the children complete training games 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.119
 hereby the ex-ob of the c-class with the blog shadow provide training and play 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.440
 include shading 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.830
 and so on, and it must now be so 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.830
 the Direct here "The Cathedral has 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 of course with this special tool 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.039
 I think that's easy to copy 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:17.089
 that you clean it now 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.359
 Philip has been to ours to demonstrate that 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:24.979
 dress 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:25.830
 It's tough 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.830
 Schwerdt b 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.079
 thus gaining support 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.590
 and so are the individual elements jacked overlook Kosinski 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.229
 make decision 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:39.949
 thinking of you 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.949
 You notice that we briefly pulls again 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.779
 I can change that too 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:50.679
 a double-click on it 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.869
 then the whole window opens with the effects 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.959
 here for example 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.959
 the artists can exhibit and another can go 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.469
 why are all other elements built Bad Kissingen 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.529
 Out of the numbers one has come and has time 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:12.019
 and nothing else to do has the Eifel on Hold 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.719
 and that a little bit nicer and added without loot 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.589
 I really know what I say 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.609
 also be as before 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.539
 and 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.719
 also takes one with one 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.249
 I with a light barrier 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.159
 which leads to the castle 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.239
 such as 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.079
 something is quite abstract 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.969
 with the pictures already preinstalled in advance 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.309
 that's what I do 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:43.969
 and I hope you have the little tutorial 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.069
 you have to look at it as well 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.699
 try it out and use the chance to try something out of what nobody else does 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.649
 makes 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.909
 and
