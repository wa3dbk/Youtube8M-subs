00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
start off with foregrip basically what

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.009 
start off with foregrip basically what
four<00:01:02.820> groups<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.300> allow<00:01:03.449> us<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
four groups going to allow us to do is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.289 
four groups going to allow us to do is
have<00:01:04.530> less<00:01:04.860> kick<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:05.790> we're<00:01:06.000> shooting

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
have less kick when we're shooting

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.820 
have less kick when we're shooting
because<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.570> find<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.110> assault<00:01:07.470> rifle

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because I find with this assault rifle

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
because I find with this assault rifle
that<00:01:07.860> there<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> quite<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> bit<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.909> kick<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that there is quite a bit of kick and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
that there is quite a bit of kick and
having<00:01:09.570> foregrip<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.439> reduces<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.280> little

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
having foregrip just reduces it a little

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.090 
having foregrip just reduces it a little
bit<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.020> focus<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
bit and if you don't have focus and you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.649 
bit and if you don't have focus and you
don't<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.580> full<00:01:14.880> grip<00:01:15.000> either<00:01:15.240> you're<00:01:15.479> just

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
don't have full grip either you're just

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.149 
don't have full grip either you're just
going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> notice<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.259> lot<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.560> flinching<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
going to notice a lot of flinching and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.340 
going to notice a lot of flinching and
you<00:01:17.280> won't<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.729> target<00:01:17.970> easier<00:01:18.659> so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
obviously for our last pack which is

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.360 
obviously for our last pack which is
what<00:03:15.150> we<00:03:15.270> always<00:03:15.450> put<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:15.990> is<00:03:16.370> definitely

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
what we always put on is definitely

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.979 
what we always put on is definitely
going<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.640> be<00:03:17.730> focused<00:03:18.300> which<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.480> when<00:03:18.840> we're

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
going to be focused which is when we're

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.690 
going to be focused which is when we're
getting<00:03:19.080> shot<00:03:19.500> at<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:20.040> won't<00:03:20.220> flinch<00:03:20.550> or

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
getting shot at we won't flinch or

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.490 
getting shot at we won't flinch or
anything<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.300> we'll<00:03:21.450> be<00:03:21.570> more<00:03:21.750> accurate<00:03:22.019> and

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
anything so we'll be more accurate and

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.100 
anything so we'll be more accurate and
we'll<00:03:22.620> win<00:03:22.769> most<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.220> our<00:03:23.340> gunfights<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.989> the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
we'll win most of our gunfights so the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.840 
we'll win most of our gunfights so the
place<00:03:25.320> that<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.590> should<00:03:25.769> actually<00:03:25.950> play<00:03:26.370> with

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
place that we should actually play with

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.729 
place that we should actually play with
