00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.010
 Hi, how are you doing, um ...? 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.700
 living roof over a small 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:19.369
 dog 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:21.200
 thought of that we designed a 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.000
 and asked the carpenter to 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.100
 build with this structure 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.640
 differentiated here from the roof and 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.170
 resembles a tray we need 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.880
 waterproof this space because 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.590
 after the plants are here in 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.540
 they will be watered then this 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.890
 water can not enter into the house 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.960
 so the first step is 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.510
 waterproof and system then people 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.770
 begins with a plastic canvas 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.899
 It needs to be a little thick. 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.649
 We use folded and we go. 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.340
 staple it around this structure 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.770
 of wood after lining this space 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.059
 with the canvas we will cut the limits 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.649
 so that this plastic is not left over 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.840
 on the back 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.820
 so now we start with the part 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.009
 of drainage before the living roof 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.840
 people use expanded clay because 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.979
 is a lightweight material for this roof 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.100
 stand firm 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.229
 after the placement of the expanded clay 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.439
 We put the virgin blanket on top 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.229
 to isolate the system from below are 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.990
 here we have a mixture of 20% of 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.600
 organic compound 40% rice 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.580
 carbonized material and lightness to 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.280
 do not get heavy on the roof and 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.600
 another 40% is of another material that is 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.640
 composed of chicken manure 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.680
 vermiculite and also a little bit of 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.630
 rice husk and organic manure then the 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.880
 people make this mix because only the land 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.270
 would become very heavy on the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.270
 roof 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.850
 now we started planting 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.450
 the option was solar plants to systems 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.400
 daisies the boldo the tostÃ£ozinho and 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.990
 some outstanding succulents and others 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.060
 here further behind are electrons 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.780
 Good you can give the finish that you 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.240
 want to 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.650
 in the house this is another little house that 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.470
 We already have the house of the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.900
 little girl and I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.900
 as much as I do in your new little house 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.990
 O
