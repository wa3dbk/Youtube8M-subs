00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
the best way to get down actually I

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.980 
the best way to get down actually I
think<00:01:51.640> that's<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.060> only<00:01:52.090> way<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.509> mean<00:01:52.840> there

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
think that's the only way I mean there

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.620 
think that's the only way I mean there
might<00:01:53.140> be<00:01:53.200> more<00:01:53.590> ways<00:01:53.830> that<00:01:54.270> y'all<00:01:55.270> could<00:01:55.420> try

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
might be more ways that y'all could try

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.350 
might be more ways that y'all could try
to<00:01:55.690> figure<00:01:55.960> out<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:57.280> that's<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.970> best<00:01:58.119> way<00:01:58.330> I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
to figure out but that's the best way I

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.749 
to figure out but that's the best way I
can<00:01:58.539> think<00:01:58.690> of<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.289> it's<00:01:59.470> super<00:01:59.709> easy<00:01:59.759> it

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
can think of and it's super easy it

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.580 
can think of and it's super easy it
might<00:02:01.000> be<00:02:01.149> slow<00:02:01.390> but<00:02:01.629> it's<00:02:01.830> easy

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
might be slow but it's easy

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.720 
might be slow but it's easy
