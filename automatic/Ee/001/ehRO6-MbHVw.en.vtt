00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.790 
or it's uncool down as if he just threw
one<00:02:13.120> down<00:02:13.269> there's<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.540> big<00:02:13.780> time<00:02:14.019> penalty<00:02:14.500> you

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
one down there's a big time penalty you

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.619

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
second cooldown so you really don't want

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.080 
second cooldown so you really don't want
to<00:02:20.620> waste<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.980> because<00:02:21.250> shot<00:02:21.489> or<00:02:21.640> blown<00:02:21.819> up

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090

to waste it because shot or blown up
that's<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:23.410> patience<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.069> kind<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.400> key<00:02:24.519> and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
that's it so patience is kind of key and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.970 
that's it so patience is kind of key and
if<00:02:24.730> you've<00:02:24.819> got<00:02:24.940> 80<00:02:25.209> 85<00:02:25.599> health<00:02:26.019> might<00:02:26.739> not

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
you you go to turn around and you get

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.719

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
away from the teammates another

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.930 
away from the teammates another
philosophy<00:04:51.680> of<00:04:51.800> that<00:04:51.949> is<00:04:52.159> if<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.490> guy's<00:04:52.669> got<00:04:52.909> to

philosophy of that is if a guy's got to

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.790 
philosophy of that is if a guy's got to
you<00:04:53.270> guys<00:04:53.449> pegged<00:04:53.780> you're<00:04:54.470> standing<00:04:54.620> right
