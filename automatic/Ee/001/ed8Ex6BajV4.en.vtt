a sec and how fantastic it is before I

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.049 
a sec and how fantastic it is before I
started<00:00:38.040> reading<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.820> worried

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
started reading I was really worried

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.250

that<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.239> would<00:00:39.420> struggle<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> language

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
that I would struggle with the language

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.069 
that I would struggle with the language
but<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> book<00:00:41.879> that's<00:00:42.059> written<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.329> 1850

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
but for a book that's written in 1850

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.560 
but for a book that's written in 1850
the<00:00:43.379> writing<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.860> incredibly<00:00:44.579> accessible<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the writing is incredibly accessible and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.000 
the writing is incredibly accessible and
compelling<00:00:46.050> which<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.410> not<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> say<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.770> it's

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
compelling which is not to say that it's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.010 
compelling which is not to say that it's
an<00:00:47.070> easy<00:00:47.309> read<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.120> definitely<00:00:48.750> don't

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
an easy read but I definitely don't

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.760 
an easy read but I definitely don't
think<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.350> should<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.500> intimidated

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
think you should be intimidated

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.740

where harry's in the ministry of magic

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.440 
where harry's in the ministry of magic
and<00:01:38.340> they're<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.610> these<00:01:38.759> cameras<00:01:39.180> flashing

and they're all these cameras flashing

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.480 
and they're all these cameras flashing
and<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.020> mean<00:01:40.470> within<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.829> context<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
