00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.649
 so here we have been commissioning 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:15.389
 work yes tell me why I chose 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:19.529
 equipment boltay stroymash cutting 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.220
 initially it is first completely analysis 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.230
 ambassador aerated all on aerated all 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.529
 it's risky to pay some 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.720
 I did not know it I show it 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.320
 houses 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:39.290
 I read almost everyone on it 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:42.059
 so he began to search the Internet found 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.090
 here again the manufacturers we were all 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.840
 Russian but chose construction because 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.520
 as if geographically porn he himself 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.059
 is closer and I immediately thought 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.850
 reach it to make it easier for me 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.620
 delivery from barnaul 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.719
 so I chose altai as oddity 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.719
 maybe that having studied 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.650
 all the characteristic of the machine say and 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:16.880
 show a reputable company which 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:18.700
 clear answers 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.440
 they made themselves 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.960
 the whole line i'm here are the pallets 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.450
 rail tracks bringing yourself up 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.180
 made 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 I got weakened animation again 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:40.909
 bear scheme itself 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:44.340
 based on this from this scheme with tools 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.700
 without departing from all the standards that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.430
 have shown 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.469
 and how much for how long is it really 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.810
 that is, the installation of the line itself is not 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:02:03.009
 preparation before the room namely installation 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:28.209
 whether a few took time it is very 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:31.079
 good because well here we are now 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.030
 tried already done 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.519
 worked out the technology received first 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.920
 blocks run in so to speak equipment 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.450
 Well, as a first impression or even 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:50.470
 now we are not the first just 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:52.359
 impression as impatience stumbled 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.940
 honor this block to touch 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.300
 look here and how we see today 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.450
 we are already visual 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.640
 this block to look at him 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.620
 visually that is how we already 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.530
 approaching 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.180
 Further further such a pattern on 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.609
 the implementation of these units on the market and he 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.890
 mostly still not reach the most 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.519
 the main result of two servants yes there is 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.120
 block availability oh well thank you thanks 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.120
 great
