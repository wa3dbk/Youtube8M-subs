00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
reviewed earlier on in the year so let's

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.939 
reviewed earlier on in the year so let's
ponder<00:00:15.690> on<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.990> possibility<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.680> this

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
ponder on the possibility that this

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.179 
ponder on the possibility that this
camera<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.340> worth<00:00:17.550> your<00:00:17.699> pennies<00:00:18.320> I'm<00:00:19.320> aware

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
that in Australia we don't actually use

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.390 
that in Australia we don't actually use
pennies<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> alliteration<00:00:22.740> works

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
pennies but the alliteration works

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.689 
pennies but the alliteration works
better<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.939> way<00:00:24.260> here's<00:00:25.260> my<00:00:25.410> review<00:00:25.699> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
better that way here's my review the

itself and to be brutally honest at

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.820 
itself and to be brutally honest at
first<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.020> thought<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> bit<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
first I thought it was a bit of a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.530 
first I thought it was a bit of a
gimmick<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.340> honestly<00:01:14.820> didn't<00:01:15.180> think<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.479> was

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
gimmick I honestly didn't think it was

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.940 
gimmick I honestly didn't think it was
going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:15.990> any<00:01:16.229> better<00:01:16.500> than<00:01:16.590> just

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
going to be any better than just

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.859 
going to be any better than just
selecting<00:01:17.400> those<00:01:17.520> options<00:01:17.880> via<00:01:18.119> menu<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
selecting those options via menu as you

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.780 
selecting those options via menu as you
normally<00:01:18.990> would<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.650> clearly<00:01:19.920> I'm<00:01:20.310> an<00:01:20.520> idiot

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
normally would but clearly I'm an idiot

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.520 
normally would but clearly I'm an idiot
because<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.360> reality<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.500> eye

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
because the reality is that the eye

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.070 
because the reality is that the eye
function<00:01:23.070> system<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.700> much<00:01:24.090> much<00:01:24.360> faster<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
function system was much much faster and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
function system was much much faster and
more<00:01:25.259> intuitive<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.979> being<00:01:26.430> able<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.759> change

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
more intuitive and being able to change

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.940 
more intuitive and being able to change
the<00:01:27.360> manual<00:01:27.659> settings<00:01:27.960> faster<00:01:28.380> means<00:01:28.650> less

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the manual settings faster means less

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.649 
the manual settings faster means less
chance<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.400> missing<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.850> shot<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.299> you're

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
chance of missing a shot because you're

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.899 
chance of missing a shot because you're

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
buried in a menu fiddling I'm sure if it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.429 
buried in a menu fiddling I'm sure if it
is<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.210> does<00:01:33.450> exactly<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.140> supposed<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
is it does exactly what it's supposed to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.719 
is it does exactly what it's supposed to

video my only real complaint about the

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.590 
video my only real complaint about the
basic<00:03:29.340> function<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.880> camera<00:03:30.000> aside<00:03:30.420> from

basic function of the camera aside from
the<00:03:30.720> video<00:03:30.960> stuff<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.320> just<00:03:31.350> mentioned<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:31.920> that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
the video stuff I just mentioned is that

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.670 
the video stuff I just mentioned is that
the<00:03:32.250> autofocus<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.420> be<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.600> bit<00:03:33.810> sluggish<00:03:34.200> and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
the autofocus can be a bit sluggish and
