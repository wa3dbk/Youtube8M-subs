 contrasts of climate in our country and in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.149
 the satellite image we have the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.010
 presence of the ninth winter storm 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.690
 of the season that is what will be 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.760
 generating the important decline for 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.829
 temperatures throughout the north of the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.170
 Mexican Republic possibility of fall 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.360
 of snow also in this entire region as well 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.730
 as also possibility as I say of 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.260
 snow in zacatecas in chihuahua and in 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.239
 durango and on the other hand this cold front 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.369
 the number 41 that is moving away from 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.600
 our country remains its air mass 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.460
 cold generating from 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.200
 are the temperatures mainly because 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.729
 morning and evening as well as 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.070
 also the possibility of falling snow 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.979
 or sleet stops the scale for 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.750
 populate and for veracruz again the chest 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.020
 from perote and again the peak of orizaba 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.909

 east in the south southeast and the peninsula 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.350
 of Yucatan is due to the presence of
