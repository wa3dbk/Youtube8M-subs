to<00:01:02.679> warm<00:01:03.429> up<00:01:03.609> already<00:01:04.210> recorded<00:01:04.690> tracks<00:01:04.930> or

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
to warm up already recorded tracks or

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.890 
to warm up already recorded tracks or
you<00:01:05.950> can<00:01:06.340> use<00:01:06.520> it<00:01:06.550> as<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:06.820> processor<00:01:07.480> to<00:01:07.660> feed

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
you can use it as a processor to feed

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.230 
you can use it as a processor to feed
any<00:01:08.560> sort<00:01:08.830> of<00:01:08.920> line<00:01:09.100> level<00:01:09.310> signal<00:01:09.430> into<00:01:10.120> it

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
any sort of line level signal into it

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.950 
any sort of line level signal into it
give<00:01:11.080> it<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.200> Neve<00:01:11.590> adness<00:01:12.220> in<00:01:12.369> that<00:01:12.520> warmth

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
give it that Neve adness in that warmth

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.170 
give it that Neve adness in that warmth
