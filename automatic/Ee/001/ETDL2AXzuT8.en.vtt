00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.129
 paul decherf presents solo 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.770
 we will also talk a little about stuff 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.150
 since in a father's show when 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.910
 even we spoke a little bit 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.820
 technical is what you could we 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.650
 present your material a little 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.390
 so in fact I am a little more 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.180
 so there totally unfaithful game 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.670
 I try to be always on the lookout for 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.839
 everything that comes out to see what 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.879
 besides for the show I come 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.920
 to buy a new pedal that has that a 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.690
 english compressor which is fabulous by 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.430
 our guitars such first guitar ta 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.290
 first guitar and after aulas my 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.170
 first guitar it was a future to hand 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:56.379
 a future to my future hamas and the species 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.070
 copies of 2.2 telecaster years ago 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.250
 walked a lot 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.500
 after I had an archtop honor and yann 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.110
 everything against which I am 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.640
 very picky 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.080
 when I use deadlines if we 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.660
 the used deadlines in the same and more 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.700
 often the sound that comes in delectable eu 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.500
 quite the original meaning 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.119
 so I always put and is in 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.410
 another speaker but when we go to see 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.030
 a sound a little more and more you did 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.490
 so you knew two guitars 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.849
 signature no then I had made one 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.009
 first stop at the request of sir 

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:29.319
 who was called john gold who was at 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.729
 fender and then there is 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.770
 michel chavarria from ags who told me 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.789
 asked if I wanted to make a guitar and 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.009
 so I did the same to exactly 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.599
 like with electronics because we 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.110
 could no longer use fender pickups 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:46.149
 where the air stephen quebec so I put 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.709
 the ends of the microphones the sponsors but 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.289
 are very very good also excellent 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.090
 yeah that's the microphone and at the level of 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.709
 amps how are you at home 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.630
 it's a good spar I went through 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.849
 all the amps like everyone but 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.789
 I'm back to my first amp that 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.140
 it was a vox ac30 but I was a fan 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.090
 marvin and beatles 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.429
 so that yes it's a controller had 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.489
 no volume button 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.200
 yes it's his death and in terms of pedal 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.150
 so you only play with a compressor 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.340
 no it was just to try 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.640
 today it was just why this 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.500
 morning because I 'm very very little of 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.870
 I have very very little pedal 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:31.220
 always a screamer tube like you are at 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.970
 608 the bones and crowds tornos and a 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.530
 compressor 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.120
 after I have the loft pedals or intimate this 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.610
 that these kinds of pedal but in its 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.640
 pocket and we can go play with the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.319
 buddies it's great for that not actually 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.989
 I use very beautiful very little pedal 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.019
 a lot of delay by cons and 2 and of 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:57.230
 corus and all like that but for that I 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:58.970
 an old an old stereo effect that 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.980
 is called the nhtsa bind verb he 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.629
 no longer exists but whenever I 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.760
 see a sorbet I buy it because 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.349
 I love this sentence there are all 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.549
 effects of evil there was everything in y'a 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.920
 no distortion and all that there are only 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.780
 chorus the time you had inserted m 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.780
 in your amp's where her fans
