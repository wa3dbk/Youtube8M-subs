00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.879
 ah 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.730
 do not 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.439
 hi hello oompa loompas of sugar today os 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.779
 I bring a recipe very easy to make in 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.350
 house is a traditional recipe that comes out 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.930
 great muffins 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.030
 It is very important that you use a good 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.910
 oil for this recipe 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.050
 for this recipe we will need 3 eggs 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.050
 at room temperature 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.640
 165 gr of sugar 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.820
 50g of milk at room temperature 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.430
 125 gr of good olive oil me in 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:53.460
 house use bailén gold 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.870
 250 gr of flour 12 grams of yeast 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.120
 and the zest of a lemon 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.699
 we put the eggs in a tall bowl 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.199
 and we add a part of the sugar 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.910
 lemon zest is added to the 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.810
 because that's how muffins are 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.579
 get more flavor 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.829
 we started to ride with the rods 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.079
 electrical and when it starts to foam 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:14.280
 we take another part of the sugar and 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.320
 we keep riding 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.909
 where they are already almost mounted him 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.909
 we will add the last part of sugar 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:31.090
 mounted eggs triple their volume 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.609
 and today is with us smile 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.740
 I know you know less we overturn the 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.179
 previous dough in a new bowl and 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.240
 we started adding the ingredients 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.960
 first the oil and we mix little to 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 little with the rods 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.930
 and gradually add the flour I 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.400
 always added flour in three parts 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.680
 because it 's much easier when it comes to 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.480
 Mix 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.750
 when we have half the flour 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.560
 we add the 50 grams of milk and 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.560
 we keep mixing 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.660
 finally we add the yeast in 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.030
 dust and we mix well then what 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.770
 we will cover the mass and leave it 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.770
 rest for 20 minutes before 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.690
 to bake 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.910
 with this we ensure that the yeast 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.310
 make effect and inside the oven in 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.040
 our muffins come out with pompadour 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.900
 at the time of baking you can use a 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.540
 cupcake mold with some capsules 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.360
 paper when we increase the mass inside 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.430
 the paper will sink down if 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.170
 we only put the paper the dough when 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.240
 is in the oven will open and there will be a 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.250
 cupcake a little ugly 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.040
 then you have the option to use the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.049
 silicone molds 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.909
 but if you want to give the cupcake 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.659
 you can put the paper inside the 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.659
 silicone molds 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.010
 those who do not have a pastry bag in 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.300
 house you know you can fill it with 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.400
 a couple of spoons 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.440
 we always fill our capsules and 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.510
 three quarters 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.740
 if it happens to you like me that your cases 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.540
 they are a tad bigger than 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.980
 your molds do not worry 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.840
 I tried to crush him a bit for the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.180
 walls but then when you bake how 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.380
 the little bun comes up almost does not 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.630
 come then you will see 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.700
 we put a little sugar just before 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.310
 to put in the oven the oven has to 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.800
 be preheated and we bake at 230 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.270
 degrees for 15 minutes and here you have 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.300
 the result of the cupcakes 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.330
 I always wait between 20 and 30 minutes 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.820
 before consuming them 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.560
 As you can see here, you have the fold of 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.060
 little paper that as I already say, almost 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.190
 you can not tell 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.170
 and good oompa loompas here you have how 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.150
 it is inside yours is to consume 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.620
 It is cupcake on the same day if not 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.850
 you keep well in a tupper and for the day 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.130

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.200
