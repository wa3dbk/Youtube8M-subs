could<00:00:40.050> definitely<00:00:40.290> make<00:00:40.559> things<00:00:40.829> happen<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
could definitely make things happen I

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.779 
could definitely make things happen I
feel<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:43.910> feel<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:44.969> he's<00:00:46.070> he's<00:00:47.070> too<00:00:47.399> fast

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
feel like I feel like he's he's too fast

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.970 
feel like I feel like he's he's too fast
for<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.329> he's<00:00:48.420> supposed<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.079> or<00:00:49.379> he<00:00:49.800> could

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
for what he's supposed to do or he could

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.979 
for what he's supposed to do or he could
be<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:50.760> fancier<00:00:51.210> he's<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.600> speed

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
be a little fancier he's at that speed

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.069 
be a little fancier he's at that speed
where<00:00:52.520> he's<00:00:53.520> goes<00:00:53.879> past<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.480> blockers<00:00:55.050> which

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
where he's goes past the blockers which

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.630 
where he's goes past the blockers which
he<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.860> needs<00:00:56.300> but<00:00:57.829> he<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.280> he<00:00:59.399> makes

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
he kind of needs but he when he makes

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.400 
he kind of needs but he when he makes
those<00:00:59.850> truck<00:01:00.420> moves<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.930> feel<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.379> have

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
those truck moves to feel like you have

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.380 
those truck moves to feel like you have
to<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.949> because<00:01:02.190> he's<00:01:02.430> got<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.640> tide<00:01:02.910> trucking

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to do because he's got the tide trucking

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.580 
to do because he's got the tide trucking
um<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:05.479> he<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.630> gotta<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:07.020> slowed<00:01:07.380> down

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
um it he just gotta get slowed down

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.770 
um it he just gotta get slowed down
things<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.340> he<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.030> run<00:01:09.240> people<00:01:09.479> over

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
things like that he can run people over

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
things like that he can run people over
but<00:01:09.960> it'll<00:01:10.409> generally<00:01:10.920> get<00:01:11.100> caught<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
but it'll generally get caught in the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.359 
but it'll generally get caught in the
backfield<00:01:12.080> he<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.200> pretty<00:01:13.439> elusive<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.189> those

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
backfield he is pretty elusive so those

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.859 
backfield he is pretty elusive so those
jus<00:01:14.549> quips<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.030> definitely<00:01:15.450> get<00:01:15.600> around

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
jus quips can definitely get around

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.920 
jus quips can definitely get around
people<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.460> with<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.640> plus<00:01:17.939> speedrun<00:01:18.509> bonus

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
people and with my plus speedrun bonus

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.499 
people and with my plus speedrun bonus
it<00:01:19.229> definitely<00:01:20.040> makes<00:01:20.280> things<00:01:20.400> easier<00:01:20.880> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
it definitely makes things easier so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.859 
it definitely makes things easier so
this<00:01:21.659> game<00:01:21.869> plays<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> fantasy<00:01:22.770> game<00:01:22.979> um<00:01:23.869> you

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
know to get the collections for a week

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.450 
know to get the collections for a week
for<00:01:26.700> Dom<00:01:27.000> kusoo<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.100> they<00:01:29.100> had<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
for Dom kusoo and they had the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.080 
for Dom kusoo and they had the
linebacker<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.299> had<00:01:30.479> 10<00:01:30.869> secs<00:01:31.470> i<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:32.090> or

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
linebacker that had 10 secs i think or

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.179 
linebacker that had 10 secs i think or
10<00:01:33.390> tackles<00:01:33.600> something<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.159> i

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
10 tackles something like that so i

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.740 
10 tackles something like that so i
thought<00:01:35.460> why<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.270> would<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.479> perfect

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
thought why not this would be perfect

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.370 
thought why not this would be perfect
opportunity<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:39.380> I

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
opportunity to get this out now I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.730
