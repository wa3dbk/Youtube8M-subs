this game but I don't think he really
did<00:02:10.050> an<00:02:10.200> honesty<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.340> don't<00:02:12.000> know<00:02:12.060> that's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
did an honesty so I don't know that's

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.550

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
fact about the Cuban out for this

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.810 
fact about the Cuban out for this
thought<00:02:27.230> if<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.860> complete<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.550> mission

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
thought if you complete this mission

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.680 
thought if you complete this mission
without<00:02:29.660> having<00:02:30.140> completed<00:02:31.150> compound<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
without having completed compound the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.710 
without having completed compound the
job<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:34.190> think<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.760> remember<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.540> other

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
job and I think I remember the other

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.540 
job and I think I remember the other
mission<00:02:36.050> now<00:02:36.200> but<00:02:36.440> basically<00:02:37.040> three<00:02:37.250> missions

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
mission now but basically three missions

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.370 
mission now but basically three missions
which<00:02:37.700> come<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.000> bit<00:02:38.240> later<00:02:38.270> on<00:02:38.570> in<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.350> game

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
which come a bit later on in the game

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.430 
which come a bit later on in the game
then<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.550> won't<00:02:40.730> be<00:02:40.790> able<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.150> access<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.990> I

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
then you won't be able to access this I

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.470 
then you won't be able to access this I
was<00:02:43.340> gonna<00:02:43.430> call<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.850> CV<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.210> guess<00:02:44.330> this

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
was gonna call the CV I guess this

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.600 
was gonna call the CV I guess this
outfit<00:02:44.900> rather<00:02:45.200> because<00:02:45.920> they'll<00:02:46.280> put<00:02:46.460> up

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
outfit rather because they'll put up

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.210 
outfit rather because they'll put up
this<00:02:46.910> kind<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.510> bar<00:02:47.960> which<00:02:48.380> stops<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.190> from

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
this kind of bar which stops you from

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.090 
this kind of bar which stops you from
actually<00:02:49.820> getting<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.960> boy<00:02:51.500> bar<00:02:51.800> I<00:02:51.830> mean

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
actually getting it so a boy bar I mean

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.460 
actually getting it so a boy bar I mean
it's<00:02:52.250> like<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.430> blockade<00:02:53.000> which<00:02:53.380> doesn't<00:02:54.380> let

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
it's like a blockade which doesn't let

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.190 
it's like a blockade which doesn't let
you<00:02:54.680> enter<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.370> place<00:02:55.910> it's<00:02:56.540> very<00:02:56.600> odd<00:02:56.960> but

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
you enter the place it's very odd but

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.170 
you enter the place it's very odd but
they<00:02:57.320> fixed<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.920> iOS<00:02:58.220> version<00:02:58.370> actually

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
they fixed in the iOS version actually

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.120 
they fixed in the iOS version actually
so<00:02:59.480> now<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:00.350> don't<00:03:00.590> want<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.890> take<00:03:01.040> this

want to point out about that cutscene by

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.060 
want to point out about that cutscene by
the<00:03:07.970> way<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.510> fact<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:08.870> in<00:03:09.320> my<00:03:09.860> version

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
the way is the fact that in my version

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.010 
the way is the fact that in my version
it's<00:03:10.490> uncensored<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.450> actually<00:03:11.690> hear

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
it's uncensored so you actually hear

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.630 
it's uncensored so you actually hear
Avery<00:03:12.170> Carrington<00:03:12.620> saying<00:03:12.980> Haitian<00:03:13.400> gang

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
Avery Carrington saying Haitian gang

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.460 
Avery Carrington saying Haitian gang
Lord<00:03:13.940> bought<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.630> later<00:03:14.810> versions<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.350> the

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
Lord bought in later versions of the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.530 
Lord bought in later versions of the
game<00:03:15.680> they<00:03:15.980> actually<00:03:16.010> had<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.490> censor<00:03:16.760> that<00:03:17.150> so

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
game they actually had to censor that so

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.720 
game they actually had to censor that so
it<00:03:17.750> just<00:03:17.959> cuts<00:03:18.350> off<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.770> he<00:03:18.830> says<00:03:19.040> recently<00:03:19.670> a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
it just cuts off and he says recently a

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.880 
it just cuts off and he says recently a
gang<00:03:20.060> Lord<00:03:20.330> died<00:03:20.630> which<00:03:21.020> sounds<00:03:21.380> really

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
gang Lord died which sounds really

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.640 
gang Lord died which sounds really
really<00:03:22.280> off<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:24.050> reason<00:03:24.320> being<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.590> that

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
really off so the reason being is that

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.920 
really off so the reason being is that
there<00:03:24.950> were<00:03:25.070> large<00:03:25.820> protests<00:03:26.480> from<00:03:26.600> both<00:03:26.780> the

bridge I may not even have to do this

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.800 
bridge I may not even have to do this
point<00:04:04.400> just<00:04:04.520> being<00:04:04.790> safe<00:04:05.090> because<00:04:05.390> there's<00:04:05.720> a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
point just being safe because there's a

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.479 
point just being safe because there's a
voodoo<00:04:05.989> right<00:04:06.350> there<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:06.860> I<00:04:06.890> assumed<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.370> I

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
voodoo right there so I assumed that I

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.930 
voodoo right there so I assumed that I
would<00:04:07.580> be<00:04:07.640> spotted<00:04:08.270> if<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.959> were<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.550> drive<00:04:10.550> near

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
would be spotted if I were to drive near

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.800 
would be spotted if I were to drive near
it<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:11.330> yeah<00:04:11.480> I<00:04:11.510> think<00:04:11.630> it<00:04:12.050> is<00:04:12.610> should<00:04:13.610> be<00:04:13.910> I<00:04:14.330> go

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
it so yeah I think it is should be I go

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.370 
it so yeah I think it is should be I go
in<00:04:14.989> here<00:04:15.260> do<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.580> crap<00:04:16.580> no<00:04:16.940> III<00:04:17.750> remember<00:04:18.169> what

saw there there was a hearse and that is

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.420 
saw there there was a hearse and that is
the<00:04:59.420> only<00:04:59.510> time<00:04:59.840> apparently<00:05:00.590> you<00:05:01.070> can<00:05:01.220> see

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
the only time apparently you can see

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.800 
the only time apparently you can see
that<00:05:01.580> hearse<00:05:01.790> in<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.210> game<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.780> only

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
that hearse in the game and the only

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.960 
that hearse in the game and the only
time<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.200> can<00:05:03.320> obtain<00:05:03.500> that<00:05:03.680> hearse<00:05:04.100> unless

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
time you can obtain that hearse unless

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.810 
time you can obtain that hearse unless
you<00:05:05.240> obtain<00:05:06.080> it<00:05:06.230> via<00:05:06.470> cheats<00:05:06.890> but<00:05:07.520> I'm<00:05:07.640> pretty

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
you obtain it via cheats but I'm pretty

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.570 
you obtain it via cheats but I'm pretty
sure<00:05:08.060> it<00:05:08.330> spawns<00:05:08.840> outside<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.920> funeral<00:05:10.100> place

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
sure it spawns outside the funeral place

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.490 
sure it spawns outside the funeral place
but<00:05:10.880> I<00:05:10.910> might<00:05:11.090> be<00:05:11.180> thinking<00:05:11.480> of<00:05:11.630> GTA<00:05:11.990> vice<00:05:12.230> city

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
but I might be thinking of GTA vice city

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.860 
but I might be thinking of GTA vice city
stories<00:05:12.560> but<00:05:13.190> anyway<00:05:13.970> so<00:05:14.030> as<00:05:14.480> you<00:05:14.600> can<00:05:14.720> see

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
stories but anyway so as you can see

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.230 
stories but anyway so as you can see
very<00:05:14.900> easy<00:05:15.320> escape<00:05:16.250> from<00:05:16.460> Little<00:05:16.700> Haiti<00:05:16.880> well

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240

easy<00:05:26.180> a<00:05:26.300> member<00:05:26.540> of<00:05:26.600> my<00:05:26.720> original<00:05:27.050> LP

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
easy a member of my original LP

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.830 
easy a member of my original LP
I<00:05:27.760> completely<00:05:28.760> failed<00:05:29.060> at<00:05:29.390> the<00:05:29.480> mission

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
I completely failed at the mission

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.690 
I completely failed at the mission
because<00:05:30.140> I<00:05:30.350> did<00:05:30.620> it<00:05:30.650> in<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:30.860> really<00:05:31.070> stupid<00:05:31.370> way

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
because I did it in a really stupid way

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.390 
because I did it in a really stupid way
but<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.450> have<00:05:32.480> to<00:05:32.810> be<00:05:32.960> spotted<00:05:33.350> before<00:05:34.280> you

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
but you have to be spotted before you

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.590 
but you have to be spotted before you
kill<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:34.760> gang<00:05:35.000> lord

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
kill the gang lord

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.630 
kill the gang lord
otherwise<00:05:36.080> it<00:05:36.530> won't<00:05:36.710> count<00:05:37.010> and<00:05:37.340> you<00:05:37.400> can't

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
otherwise it won't count and you can't

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.640 
otherwise it won't count and you can't
actually<00:05:37.790> kill<00:05:38.240> him<00:05:38.450> without<00:05:38.930> being<00:05:39.320> spotted

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
actually kill him without being spotted

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.920 
actually kill him without being spotted
so<00:05:40.190> yeah<00:05:40.550> it's<00:05:40.730> one<00:05:40.880> of<00:05:40.910> those<00:05:41.120> things<00:05:41.720> where

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
so yeah it's one of those things where

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.990 
so yeah it's one of those things where
if<00:05:42.020> it<00:05:42.170> were<00:05:42.350> GTA<00:05:42.710> 3<00:05:43.190> that<00:05:43.370> you<00:05:43.580> probably<00:05:43.880> would

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
if it were GTA 3 that you probably would

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.090 
if it were GTA 3 that you probably would
have<00:05:44.090> passed<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.390> mission<00:05:44.810> but<00:05:45.050> they<00:05:45.260> seem<00:05:45.980> to

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
have passed the mission but they seem to

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.890 
have passed the mission but they seem to
refine<00:05:46.460> it<00:05:46.610> slightly<00:05:46.910> for<00:05:47.270> this<00:05:47.390> game<00:05:47.630> but<00:05:47.810> not

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
refine it slightly for this game but not

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.450 
refine it slightly for this game but not
too<00:05:48.110> much<00:05:48.290> because<00:05:48.530> there<00:05:49.070> have<00:05:49.160> already<00:05:49.310> been

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
too much because there have already been

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.760 
too much because there have already been
a<00:05:49.580> few<00:05:49.790> instances<00:05:50.060> in<00:05:50.480> this<00:05:50.990> LP<00:05:51.410> where<00:05:51.590> you<00:05:51.650> can

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
a few instances in this LP where you can

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.080 
a few instances in this LP where you can
see<00:05:51.920> that<00:05:52.100> they<00:05:52.220> actually<00:05:52.250> had<00:05:52.880> some

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
see that they actually had some

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.760 
see that they actually had some
oversights<00:05:53.600> where<00:05:53.840> you<00:05:53.900> could<00:05:54.020> kind<00:05:54.410> of<00:05:54.530> I

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
oversights where you could kind of I

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.820 
oversights where you could kind of I
guess<00:05:55.370> get<00:05:55.730> over<00:05:56.030> certain<00:05:56.620> objectives<00:05:57.620> in

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
guess get over certain objectives in

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.050 
guess get over certain objectives in
various<00:05:58.190> missions<00:05:58.610> and<00:05:58.760> you<00:05:58.820> can<00:05:58.940> actually

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
various missions and you can actually

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.560 
various missions and you can actually
pass<00:05:59.390> them<00:05:59.720> very<00:05:59.900> easily<00:06:00.170> so<00:06:01.120> for<00:06:02.120> example<00:06:02.510> in

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
pass them very easily so for example in

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.760 
pass them very easily so for example in
the<00:06:02.660> mission<00:06:02.900> bri'asia<00:06:03.260> where<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:03.560> don't

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
the mission bri'asia where you don't

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.620 
the mission bri'asia where you don't
have<00:06:03.890> to<00:06:04.040> get<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.460> overalls<00:06:05.060> outfit<00:06:05.480> that

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
have to get the overalls outfit that

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.080 
have to get the overalls outfit that
kind<00:06:05.810> of<00:06:05.900> thing<00:06:06.080> so<00:06:06.380> anyway<00:06:07.130> yes<00:06:07.490> that<00:06:07.820> is<00:06:07.940> the

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
kind of thing so anyway yes that is the

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.060 
kind of thing so anyway yes that is the
mission<00:06:08.240> passed<00:06:08.660> and<00:06:09.170> because<00:06:09.590> that<00:06:09.800> is<00:06:09.950> the

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
mission passed and because that is the

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.280 
mission passed and because that is the
mission<00:06:10.280> strand<00:06:10.790> over<00:06:11.060> with<00:06:11.720> we're<00:06:11.990> going<00:06:12.110> to

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
mission strand over with we're going to

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.350 
mission strand over with we're going to
return<00:06:12.650> to<00:06:13.010> side<00:06:13.280> missions<00:06:13.700> now<00:06:13.850> I<00:06:13.910> know<00:06:14.150> it

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
return to side missions now I know it

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.810 
return to side missions now I know it
you're<00:06:14.780> probably<00:06:15.080> annoyed<00:06:16.040> about<00:06:16.160> -<00:06:16.400> but<00:06:16.700> you

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
you're probably annoyed about - but you

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.370 
you're probably annoyed about - but you
know<00:06:16.940> has<00:06:17.270> to<00:06:17.420> be<00:06:17.450> done<00:06:17.540> I<00:06:17.930> have<00:06:18.020> to<00:06:18.140> kind<00:06:18.350> of

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
know has to be done I have to kind of

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.950 
know has to be done I have to kind of
fit<00:06:18.620> everything<00:06:18.920> in<00:06:19.280> in<00:06:19.490> a<00:06:20.000> compact<00:06:20.540> kind<00:06:20.840> of

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
fit everything in in a compact kind of

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.110 
fit everything in in a compact kind of
manner<00:06:21.170> so<00:06:21.650> in<00:06:22.070> the<00:06:22.340> next<00:06:22.550> part<00:06:22.790> we're<00:06:23.000> going

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
manner so in the next part we're going

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.610 
manner so in the next part we're going
to<00:06:23.240> be<00:06:23.300> going<00:06:23.450> over<00:06:23.750> all<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.080> hidden<00:06:24.500> packages

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
to be going over all the hidden packages

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.850 
to be going over all the hidden packages
in<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:25.430> gain<00:06:26.030> as<00:06:26.240> 100<00:06:27.020> hidden<00:06:27.230> packages<00:06:27.650> yeah

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
in the gain as 100 hidden packages yeah

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.320 
in the gain as 100 hidden packages yeah
so<00:06:28.010> I<00:06:28.040> decided<00:06:28.340> to<00:06:28.460> put<00:06:28.730> them<00:06:28.880> all<00:06:29.030> into<00:06:29.210> one

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
so I decided to put them all into one

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.600 
so I decided to put them all into one
video<00:06:29.630> it's<00:06:30.350> gonna<00:06:30.500> be<00:06:30.680> probably<00:06:31.160> a<00:06:31.370> long

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
video it's gonna be probably a long

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.990 
video it's gonna be probably a long
video<00:06:31.850> I<00:06:32.030> assume<00:06:32.420> but<00:06:33.110> yeah<00:06:34.040> we'll<00:06:34.280> see<00:06:34.490> how<00:06:34.790> it

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
video I assume but yeah we'll see how it

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.120 
video I assume but yeah we'll see how it
goes<00:06:35.150> I'm<00:06:35.330> going<00:06:35.480> to<00:06:35.600> speed<00:06:35.960> it<00:06:35.990> up<00:06:36.170> a<00:06:36.290> bit<00:06:36.320> make

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
goes I'm going to speed it up a bit make

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.370 
goes I'm going to speed it up a bit make
the<00:06:37.310> clips<00:06:37.610> really<00:06:37.880> short<00:06:38.180> and<00:06:38.420> hopefully<00:06:38.810> it

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
the clips really short and hopefully it

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.380 
the clips really short and hopefully it
will<00:06:39.470> be<00:06:39.530> very<00:06:40.100> Swift

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.390 
will be very Swift

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.090 
will be very Swift
I<00:06:41.420> was<00:06:41.720> gonna<00:06:41.810> say<00:06:42.020> maybe<00:06:42.170> 15<00:06:42.620> or<00:06:42.680> 20<00:06:42.950> minutes

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
I was gonna say maybe 15 or 20 minutes

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.470 
I was gonna say maybe 15 or 20 minutes
but<00:06:43.340> knowing<00:06:43.610> me<00:06:43.730> it<00:06:43.790> will<00:06:43.850> probably<00:06:44.060> still<00:06:44.420> be

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
but knowing me it will probably still be

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.170 
but knowing me it will probably still be
a<00:06:44.600> 40<00:06:44.930> minute<00:06:45.050> videos<00:06:45.700> but<00:06:46.700> we'll<00:06:46.850> see<00:06:47.000> how<00:06:47.090> it

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
a 40 minute videos but we'll see how it

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.820 
a 40 minute videos but we'll see how it
goes<00:06:47.240> so<00:06:47.630> anyway<00:06:47.930> until<00:06:48.140> then<00:06:48.440> thank<00:06:48.710> you<00:06:48.740> for

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
goes so anyway until then thank you for
