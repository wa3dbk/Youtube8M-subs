00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 yes halli hello you love this video 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.330
 unbelievable for two months 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.630
 make and now the time has come 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.759
 I'll tell you everything about striping what 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.480
 is that how it works and that you can 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.480
 do everything with it 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:28.230
 Writing is a kind of technique with whole 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.230
 thin sticky movies like tesa could be 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.420
 Imagine this glue 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.910
 Rolls are available in many different ways 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.710
 Colors if you have not seen something like that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.890
 I have a link from you 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.050
 Amazon in the infobox because you get ten 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.789
 piece for 399 or so so one 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.190
 tubes really do not cost the world 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.010
 I currently want it in three colors 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 In any case, even more of me 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.309
 get and you can different with it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.430
 make designs it's easy for her 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.680
 a strip on the nails does so 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.170
 as i told you this in the video 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.799
 have already shown or 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.540
 that you just say you make two 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.369
 different nail polishes and makes that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.220
 then dividing with his striping 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.220
 as well as you see this for example the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.560
 advantage is that could drive through that 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.240
 something like that, of course, just as a stroke 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.220
 pull with nail polish if a quiet 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.380
 hand off then you can do that too 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.479
 but I personally think that one 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.729
 nail design really just really good 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.890
 Looks if it is super top accurate 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.110
 and I manage that in person 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 frankly never and brushstrokes 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.790
 With his striping, it's easy 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.090
 always directly right properly forces out 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.920
 you have a sharp drawn with knew 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.649
 and should there not great now 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.930
 rumfummeln continue and that is really 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.299
 very fast or you just take it easy 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.009
 also two different textures so 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.140
 dull or shiny like me that 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.350
 Now here with this nail design 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.810
 just shown and yes I show 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.440
 you guys today how are you ? 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.900
 needs striping tapings for that 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.460
 and something to cut the nails are 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.440
 already painted and I want to go now 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.140
 the ring finger making a design to 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.390
 I suppose first is writing intel 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.340
 the beginning and started with one 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.700
 left excel those a little bit off too 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.700
 bludgeon 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.350
 I cut myself so many stripes 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.520
 from as I need for my design 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.990
 will work fine for me 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.520
 if I'm the kotick out of it all 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.270
 I can do that better 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.100
 use 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.720
 and now you do not have to do anything 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.810
 continue to do as with the pz 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.980
 your stripes in desired patterns 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.990
 to lay down the finger 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.970
 to somehow press it like that 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.730
 little different than liable and important 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.650
 is that above and below always such a 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.910
 bit survives and of course the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.500
 also adopted 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.630
 are glued exactly it goes on everyone 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.850
 more decent than if you were such 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.800
 Strip with a brush and pull that 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.459
 just make the special of this 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.459
 Nail design 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.550
 when you're done then you have to 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.530
 just press on and with 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.650
 your tailor the excess 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.650
 Remove pieces at the top of the needlepoint 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.940
 You also cut the bottom ones 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.350
 Edge match the nail polish knew 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.330
 and now he really only needs 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.260
 make a clear coat on it and finished 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.750
 that this you see, that's really 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.970
 not so difficult and you should 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.400
 absolutely trust you there are 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.890
 of course countless ideas you can too 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.110
 different colored stripes together 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.210
 mix that you put the middle or 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.450
 bad over or out of the middle 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.330
 So there are your fantasies on everyone 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.550
 if no limits set if you 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.470
 I liked the video then I could 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.720
 Also imagine a trading for 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.520
 to make an advanced following because 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.500
 that is not all you have to do with the 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.060
 can make striping tips if you 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.040
 that would like to get me one 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.930
 thumb up so I know if there 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.750
 interest in you there is simply a 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.070
 other nail design deposited if you 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.810
 I do not know yet 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.100
 absolutely subscribe to none of my 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.480
 to miss videos 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.790
 I'm looking forward to any event 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.240
 feedback already knew animal striping or 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.130
 that was new to you now and say 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.240
 just wait until the next video chart 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.240
 show co
