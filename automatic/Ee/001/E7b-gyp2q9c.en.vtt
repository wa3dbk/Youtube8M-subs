00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.440
 hello vestibular vestibulars of the whole 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.119
 Brazil 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.920
 Let's now comment on the language test. 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.630
 of him in 2014 I am 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.850
 teacher, and what with me here? 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.860
 teacher fabiana and teacher selma 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.400
 teachers how was the test 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.949
 hello everyone or the language test 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.800
 foreign office maintained its 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.690
 structure is the last years both the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.019
 proof of English with proof of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.019
 presented several types of 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:43.019
 text and with that same characteristic 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:46.109
 a text for each question 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:50.329
 we did not have in both tests are issues 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:53.809
 that involved ads is music poems 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.239
 articles even excerpt from a speech 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.120
 therefore maintained that variety which is 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.969
 proof feature is tongue 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.940
 alien of the Fabian teacher 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.149
 on the accused is about the 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.390
 denounced are the statements are 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.850
 always well targeted and cause 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.680
 the student already knows exactly what 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.090
 moment he has to go there in the text 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.310
 that he has to observe what he has 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.409
 to look for then announced he was already 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.200
 quite specific as well as 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.340
 alternatives they also used 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.549
 verse is excuse and verbs well 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:36.570
 differentiated and already established a 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.899
 selection was not something that required 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.960
 and we will not exclude indicating 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.479
 some alternatives because they did not 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.539
 they had no relation to that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.340
 which was presented in the text then both 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.929
 those denounced as the alternatives were 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.789
 quite prudent 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.320
 the accused already indicated directly 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.100
 what the student should look for 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.200
 there in the text and alternatives already 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.670
 directed since he understood 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.340
 that he understood that he had to 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.429
 look for alternatives already 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.899
 excluded were already excluded there was more 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.899
 easy to find answer 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.379
 the relationship to the texts now is we had 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:21.560
 for example it is in the English test there is a 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.780
 bob dylan's music and the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.599
 spanish speech of mario vargas 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.319
 is what's interesting about this guy. 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:33.950
 question of knowing the profile or the work 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.200
 the social policy position of the authors 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.930
 this contributes greatly to the reading and 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.109
 would actually happen for example in the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.980
 bob dylan's music is a critique is 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.450
 situation of wars and is a posture 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.019
 known from bob dylan in all its 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.530
 work is work is putting this criticism 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.709
 against is the political position of the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.109
 Then very coherent with the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.900
 His job would help a lot. 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:06.109
 We also see poems from both the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.879
 English is like Spanish in the poem of 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.430
 proof of English we had a 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.519
 robert frost's poem ti he comments 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.579
 on the two paths with which he 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.459
 he came across and he took the path - 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.639
 which made all the difference 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:27.079
 therefore places here in this poem the 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.889
 idea of ​​the importance it has had in the 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.620
 author 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:34.849
 the choice of the path he made and the 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.669
 Spanish poem charted from the time of the 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:41.780
 of time, so they were not 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:44.750
 complicated poems in which reading as 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.629
 if it were a test it would really help and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.840
 would give us the idea of ​​the answers we 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.819
 we had to choose is other types of 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.099
 text that we also counted in the test 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.509
 both English and Spanish in the case 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.949
 proof of English 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:00.979
 we saw that it had two 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:03.019
 articles retrieved from online magazines at 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.310
 case of the newsweek magazine and the newspaper 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.370
 new york times 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.889
 reading these articles resembles 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.659
 very much with the passages that were seen 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.949
 own Spanish in an excerpt that 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.049
 to reflect on the conditions of 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:17.989
 immigrants in Spanish history and a 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.930
 the other consisting of a stretch the 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.990
 graphic is not reading these excerpts 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.819
 as well as the article is a reading that 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.289
 as I already said 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.849
 denounced announced to direct the 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.610
 points you had to address the 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.979
 specific points of both article and 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.470
 of the passages of the language test 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.330
 Spanish language then made it 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.280
 understanding is to guess at the 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.330
 use cognate words then this 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.129
 helped a lot and another type of text 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.199
 which we also checked was in the 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.569
 proof of English we had an ad 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.539
 which were actually resembles the 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.250
 print from a web page and from the 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.190
 Spanish test we had a 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.349
 which addressed both breastfeeding and 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.900
 the print of the web page as the 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.030
 announcement of breastfeeding were texts that 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.669
 in fact encouraged the practice of a 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.490
 behavior in the case of proof of English 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.099
 the donation is the word share appeared there 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.259
 then this idea was present and not 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.740
 case of the Spanish test was the 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.449
 importance of breastfeeding 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.270
 encouraging behavior 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.969
 no more as teacher selma already said 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.409
 the English test maintained the level of 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.690
 previous evidence 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.349
 working with percy texts 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.659
 And I think this is not even a Selma teacher. 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:42.719
 exactly was to pass the profile of the two 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.940
 evidence was thank you very much for the presence 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.979

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.779
