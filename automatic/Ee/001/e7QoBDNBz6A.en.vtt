00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello everyone I'm great today for house and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.969
 this devotee the little gameplay more but 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.150
 this time of the super monday night combat 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.419
 a free to play game of steam that 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.230
 supposed to be value is similar to 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.960
 team fortress 2 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.330
 we go with almost identical characters 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.179
 etcetera team battle does not have 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.150
 that dominate the other's base but here 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.500
 there are things like robots etc. and this is going 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.350
 to be my first game game 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.540
 normal I tried the closed pleta when 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.860
 closed quotes because there was a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.670
 that universal for all 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.160
 and in nothing work nor idea of ​​how this 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.490
 game but I said I'll try to see what 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.250
 just to see what happens 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.780
 and good as well as very good I'm not 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.090
 but a little bit 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.059
 from this part I'm going to jump a little 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.309
 because you take a lot of time to lose 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.309
 a game like that people think 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.890
 normal of their faces 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.950
 I liked the motion as well as 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.149
 must be 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.149
 Yes sir 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.830
 and also games with this image is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.830
 we know well 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.070
 Let's see 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.719
 or whatever, let's move forward to who 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.719
 says some action let's see 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.190
 here and here is my partner I give myself 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.190
 mind that if I'm going to put a little 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:54.330
 of calm I the total darkness or neighborhood in 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.330
 explosion 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:09.250
 there are many olives there are many enemies 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.250
 there comes a flip 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.330
 giving right click to take life 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.500
 let's put I can build courage 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.290
 masters 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.140
 you're red, it's already dotted, we're going to 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.020
 put some flames and send us go 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.020
 we go and study 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.819
 that life 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.870
 let's pretend that I have not seen anything 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.260
 and he has a grenade for the face I am a girl 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.660
 that has given him equal passage through the monkey 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.630
 again and there 's the rookie this time it's 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.950
 mine we go now there is already an epic battle 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:10.130
 to see a jump point let's put and 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:14.560
 jump and it's worth the fact of editing in 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.560
 this is ok we go again and nothing happens 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.159
 Expressions are up from level 2 to 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.629
 level 2 because being done nothing that does not 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.540
 I am 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.730
 I raise a level without wanting it 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.250
 What I hope is that the one before 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.250
 been of such a level that well here I see a 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.709
 Battery explain six robotic robots 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.450
 5 magic and safe meter well I take advantage and 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.000
 looting coins 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.330
 that's the peel is the peel and that's what 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.330
 must be done 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:53.220
 I'll see if I can look for some robot 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:56.400
 I can not good either 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.370
 it looks like I'm spending to not 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.690
 take life from the robot to give it life 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.140
 because he is not alive here 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.140

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.670
