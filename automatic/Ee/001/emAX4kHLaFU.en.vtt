do<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.759> quick<00:00:06.029> lesson<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:07.560> bubble<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.130> the

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
do a quick lesson on the bubble and the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.910 
do a quick lesson on the bubble and the
bubble<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> reggae<00:00:09.469> keyboard<00:00:10.469> technique

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
bubble is a reggae keyboard technique

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.970 
bubble is a reggae keyboard technique
that<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.790> hear<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> lot<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.809> gives<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.500> really

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
that you hear a lot it gives a really

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.450 
that you hear a lot it gives a really
nice<00:00:14.160> full<00:00:14.549> rhythmic<00:00:15.030> sound<00:00:15.980> to<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> keyboard

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
nice full rhythmic sound to the keyboard

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.140 
nice full rhythmic sound to the keyboard
so<00:00:17.850> let<00:00:18.690> me<00:00:18.840> show<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.800> sounds<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.150> 2

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
so let me show you what it sounds like 2

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:40.910 
so let me show you what it sounds like 2
3<00:00:21.600> 4<00:00:22.410> 100<00:00:38.570> ok<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.840> bubble<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.410> really<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
3 4 100 ok so the bubble is really a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.979 
3 4 100 ok so the bubble is really a
rhythmic<00:00:41.430> technique<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.420> splits<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
rhythmic technique that splits the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.049 
rhythmic technique that splits the
rhythm<00:00:43.320> between<00:00:43.920> our<00:00:44.219> left<00:00:44.520> hand<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.969> our

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
rhythm between our left hand and our

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
rhythm between our left hand and our
right<00:00:45.239> hand<00:00:45.270> each<00:00:46.079> hand<00:00:46.410> has<00:00:46.620> its<00:00:46.770> own

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
right hand each hand has its own

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.680 
right hand each hand has its own
separate<00:00:47.309> rhythm<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> left<00:00:48.149> hand<00:00:48.480> is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
separate rhythm so the left hand is

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.470 
separate rhythm so the left hand is
going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.020> playing<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.410> all<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.950> beats<00:00:50.550> so

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
going to be playing on all up beats so

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.340 
going to be playing on all up beats so
if<00:00:51.600> our<00:00:51.780> pulse<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:53.460> two<00:00:54.059> three<00:00:54.809> four

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
if our pulse is here one two three four

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.130 
if our pulse is here one two three four
one<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> two<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.910> three<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.420> four<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.079> one

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
one and two and three and four and one

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.720 
one and two and three and four and one
and<00:00:58.410> two<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.190> three<00:00:59.609> four<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:01.340> our<00:01:02.340> right

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and two and three four and our right

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.579 
and two and three four and our right
hand<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.270> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.629> playing<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.019> beats<00:01:04.229> two

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
hand is going to be playing on beats two

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.350 
hand is going to be playing on beats two
and<00:01:04.619> four<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:06.150> our<00:01:06.210> pulses<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.930> 1<00:01:07.530> 2<00:01:08.130> 3<00:01:08.729> 4

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and four so for our pulses here 1 2 3 4

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.130 
and four so for our pulses here 1 2 3 4
1<00:01:09.990> 2<00:01:10.409> 3<00:01:10.729> 4<00:01:11.729> 1<00:01:12.390> 3<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:15.540> when<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.720> put<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.020> together

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
1 2 3 4 1 3 and when we put it together

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:38.270 
1 2 3 4 1 3 and when we put it together
it<00:01:17.009> sounds<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.520> 2<00:01:18.299> 3<00:01:18.960> 4<00:01:19.530> 1<00:01:30.710> 3<00:01:31.710> 3<00:01:35.270> 3<00:01:37.280> all

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it sounds like this 2 3 4 1 3 3 3 all

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
it sounds like this 2 3 4 1 3 3 3 all
right<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.640> let's<00:01:38.850> slow<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.390> down<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:39.990> can

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
right so let's slow that down so you can

00:01:40.200 --> 00:02:08.180 
right so let's slow that down so you can
practice<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.829> let's<00:01:41.490> do<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:42.150> 1<00:01:42.540> 2<00:01:43.320> 3<00:01:44.100> 4<00:02:07.190> all

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
practice it let's do it here 1 2 3 4 all

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.710 
practice it let's do it here 1 2 3 4 all
right<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.550> that's<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> technique<00:02:09.539> of

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
right so that's it for the technique of

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.780 
right so that's it for the technique of
the<00:02:09.840> bubble<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.860> want<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> go<00:02:11.160> over<00:02:11.310> what

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the bubble I just want to go over what

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.130 
the bubble I just want to go over what
I'm<00:02:11.879> playing<00:02:12.060> 4<00:02:12.390> chords<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:12.989> case

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
I'm playing 4 chords here in case

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.910 
I'm playing 4 chords here in case
anyone's<00:02:13.530> insert

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
anyone's insert

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.730 
anyone's insert
interested<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:14.910> what<00:02:15.450> I'm<00:02:15.540> using<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> basic

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
interested so what I'm using is a basic

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.830 
interested so what I'm using is a basic
progression<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.790> see<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.120> reggae<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> lot

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
progression that you see in reggae a lot

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.720 
progression that you see in reggae a lot
which<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.319> minor<00:02:19.709> one<00:02:20.870> -<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.989> flat<00:02:22.230> seven

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
which is the minor one - the flat seven

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.470 
which is the minor one - the flat seven
so<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:24.000> case<00:02:24.270> we're<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> key<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:26.480> C

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
so in this case we're in the key of C

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.190 
so in this case we're in the key of C
minor

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
minor

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.750 
minor
so<00:02:28.830> our<00:02:28.920> minor<00:02:29.220> one<00:02:29.580> chord<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.480> C<00:02:30.810> D<00:02:31.290> flat<00:02:31.530> G<00:02:31.760> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
so our minor one chord is C D flat G and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.440 
so our minor one chord is C D flat G and
our<00:02:33.390> flat<00:02:33.750> seven<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.709> major<00:02:34.950> chord<00:02:35.400> B<00:02:35.730> flat<00:02:36.000> D

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
our flat seven is a major chord B flat D

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.809 
our flat seven is a major chord B flat D
then<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.920> those<00:02:38.069> are<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.280> two<00:02:38.430> chords<00:02:38.700> I'm

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
then so those are the two chords I'm

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.330 
then so those are the two chords I'm
using<00:02:39.060> I'm<00:02:39.390> playing<00:02:39.989> both<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.530> them<00:02:40.709> in<00:02:40.920> second

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
using I'm playing both of them in second

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.910 
using I'm playing both of them in second
inversion<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:45.450> when<00:02:45.930> we<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.560> bubble

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
inversion so when we have the bubble

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.940 
inversion so when we have the bubble
going<00:02:47.580> from<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:49.430> bolster<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:55.440> can<00:02:55.560> also<00:02:55.680> try

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
going from this bolster you can also try

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.559 
going from this bolster you can also try
the<00:02:56.010> technique<00:02:56.459> using<00:02:56.819> different<00:02:57.150> inversions

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the technique using different inversions

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.990 
the technique using different inversions
of<00:02:57.660> chords<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.170> what<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.350> mean<00:02:58.590> by<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:59.250> say

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
of chords so what I mean by that is say

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.559 
of chords so what I mean by that is say
in<00:03:00.090> your<00:03:00.209> left<00:03:00.510> hand<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:01.140> play<00:03:01.560> both<00:03:01.739> chords

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
in your left hand you play both chords

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.229 
in your left hand you play both chords
in<00:03:03.569> root<00:03:03.810> position<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.620> your<00:03:04.830> right<00:03:05.160> hand<00:03:05.489> you

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
in root position in your right hand you

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.030 
in root position in your right hand you
could<00:03:06.450> play<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.810> chords<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.410> first<00:03:07.830> inversion

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
could play the chords in first inversion
