00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
pretty bad two cards that shut them down

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.350 
pretty bad two cards that shut them down
in<00:02:00.149> my<00:02:00.240> opinion<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> fossil<00:02:01.860> Dinah<00:02:02.070> or

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.609 

Imperial<00:02:06.360> iron<00:02:06.509> wall<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.079> really<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.469> like

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
Imperial iron wall I really really like

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.559 
Imperial iron wall I really really like
that<00:02:07.740> card<00:02:07.979> as<00:02:08.099> well<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.179> thinking<00:02:09.450> of

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
that card as well so I'm thinking of

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.510 
that card as well so I'm thinking of
doing

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
doing

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.490 
doing
something<00:02:11.330> with<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.540> not<00:02:11.960> in<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.140> main<00:02:12.290> deck

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
something with that not in the main deck

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.690 
something with that not in the main deck
or<00:02:12.620> anything<00:02:12.950> but<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.130> don't<00:02:13.310> really<00:02:13.400> know<00:02:13.580> what

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
or anything but I don't really know what

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.770 
or anything but I don't really know what
I'm<00:02:13.820> going<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:13.970> do<00:02:14.060> about<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.390> yet<00:02:14.570> but<00:02:14.690> I'm

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
I'm going to do about it yet but I'm

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.510 
I'm going to do about it yet but I'm
going<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.930> figure<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.260> out<00:02:15.320> luckily<00:02:16.310> they're

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
going to figure it out luckily they're

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.160 
going to figure it out luckily they're
not<00:02:16.550> something<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.540> be<00:02:17.630> worried<00:02:17.840> about<00:02:17.870> now

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
not something to be worried about now

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.510 
not something to be worried about now
because<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.560> babies<00:02:18.890> have<00:02:19.010> not<00:02:19.160> come<00:02:19.370> out<00:02:19.460> yet

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
because the babies have not come out yet

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.190 
because the babies have not come out yet
but<00:02:19.730> once<00:02:20.150> they<00:02:20.300> do<00:02:20.360> we're<00:02:20.900> going<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.080> have

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
but once they do we're going to have

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.380 
but once they do we're going to have
some<00:02:21.380> issues<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.760> don't<00:02:23.030> think<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:23.240> have<00:02:23.330> to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
some issues but I don't think we have to

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.930 
some issues but I don't think we have to
focus<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.870> too<00:02:24.050> hard<00:02:24.260> um<00:02:27.940> prophecies

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
focus on that too hard um prophecies

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.460 
focus on that too hard um prophecies
another<00:02:29.810> thing<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.080> want<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.230> talk<00:02:30.410> about

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
another thing I want to talk about

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.000 
another thing I want to talk about
they're<00:02:30.830> not<00:02:30.980> too<00:02:31.130> hard<00:02:31.340> either<00:02:32.620> eev<00:02:33.620> really

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
they're not too hard either eev really

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.950 
they're not too hard either eev really
wants<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.310> games<00:02:34.520> then<00:02:35.300> I'm<00:02:35.390> going<00:02:35.510> first<00:02:35.750> and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
wants the games then I'm going first and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.660 
wants the games then I'm going first and
thus<00:02:36.110> opening<00:02:36.290> up<00:02:36.590> subpar<00:02:37.010> can<00:02:37.190> be<00:02:37.280> really<00:02:37.550> bad

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
thus opening up subpar can be really bad

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.270 
thus opening up subpar can be really bad
because<00:02:38.030> spell<00:02:38.240> book<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.480> fate<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.870> just

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
because spell book of fate is just

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.500 
because spell book of fate is just
really<00:02:40.280> really<00:02:40.400> stupid<00:02:40.670> against<00:02:41.150> dark<00:02:41.300> world

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
really really stupid against dark world

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.700 
really really stupid against dark world
especially<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:42.050> they<00:02:42.140> just<00:02:42.320> banish<00:02:42.590> your

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
especially if they just banish your

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.140 
especially if they just banish your
graph<00:02:42.920> on<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.340> end<00:02:43.490> phase<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.940> can't

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
graph on the end phase and you can't

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150 
graph on the end phase and you can't
resolve<00:02:44.390> your<00:02:44.600> Eevee's<00:02:45.140> everything<00:02:46.040> just

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
resolve your Eevee's everything just

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.280 
resolve your Eevee's everything just
becomes<00:02:46.460> dead<00:02:46.790> which<00:02:47.570> is<00:02:47.720> which<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.050> really

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
becomes dead which is which is really

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.480 
becomes dead which is which is really
bad<00:02:48.470> um<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.840> I'm<00:02:51.080> I'm<00:02:51.680> not<00:02:51.860> too<00:02:52.070> too<00:02:52.220> worried

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
bad um so I'm I'm not too too worried

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.940 
bad um so I'm I'm not too too worried
about<00:02:52.520> that<00:02:53.050> because<00:02:54.050> jogging<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.620> not<00:02:54.740> really

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
about that because jogging is not really

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.990 
about that because jogging is not really
a<00:02:54.980> problem<00:02:55.070> but<00:02:55.400> then<00:02:55.550> we<00:02:55.610> get<00:02:55.730> them<00:02:55.850> going

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
a problem but then we get them going

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.340 
a problem but then we get them going
first<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.390> getting<00:02:56.630> all<00:02:56.720> those<00:02:56.810> pluses<00:02:57.200> can

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
first and getting all those pluses can

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.200 
first and getting all those pluses can
be<00:02:57.440> really<00:02:57.650> bad<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:58.040> they<00:02:58.580> have<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.790> Fate<00:02:59.000> and

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
be really bad if they have the Fate and

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.770 
be really bad if they have the Fate and
they<00:02:59.270> have<00:02:59.390> ways<00:02:59.570> out<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.750> my<00:02:59.930> place<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:01.340> i

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
they have ways out of my place so i

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.460 
they have ways out of my place so i
don't<00:03:02.780> think<00:03:02.960> i'm<00:03:03.050> going<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.230> worry<00:03:03.410> about

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
don't think i'm going to worry about

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.780 
don't think i'm going to worry about
them<00:03:03.770> i'm<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.130> concentrate<00:03:04.430> on<00:03:04.640> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
them i'm going to concentrate on the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.160 
them i'm going to concentrate on the
evil<00:03:05.060> storms<00:03:05.330> first<00:03:05.540> because<00:03:05.870> they're<00:03:06.050> going

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
evil storms first because they're going

this<00:04:02.090> original<00:04:02.510> is<00:04:02.900> only<00:04:03.050> 225<00:04:03.560> which<00:04:03.890> is

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
this original is only 225 which is

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.560 
this original is only 225 which is
pretty<00:04:04.160> sad<00:04:04.490> so<00:04:05.090> it's<00:04:05.209> only<00:04:05.360> going<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.510> be

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
pretty sad so it's only going to be

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.960
