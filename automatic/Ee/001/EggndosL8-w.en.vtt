00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.780 

two<00:00:00.420> days<00:00:00.599> ago<00:00:00.630> I<00:00:01.140> started<00:00:01.469> doing<00:00:01.740> fight<00:00:02.429> caves

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
two days ago I started doing fight caves

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.269 
two days ago I started doing fight caves
because<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.510> was<00:00:03.689> going<00:00:03.899> for<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.319> new<00:00:04.500> jad<00:00:04.890> pet

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
because I was going for the new jad pet

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.059 
because I was going for the new jad pet
and<00:00:05.609> it<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.750> very<00:00:06.960> easy<00:00:07.259> like<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.919> was

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
and it was very easy like I was

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.370 
and it was very easy like I was
surprised<00:00:08.639> how<00:00:09.000> easy<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.570> five<00:00:09.780> kids<00:00:10.080> would

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
surprised how easy the five kids would

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.919 
surprised how easy the five kids would
an<00:00:10.590> old<00:00:10.800> school<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.460> was<00:00:11.880> like<00:00:12.059> man<00:00:12.420> in

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
an old school I was like man in

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.259 
an old school I was like man in
runescape<00:00:13.349> 3<00:00:13.590> it's<00:00:14.099> actually<00:00:14.549> harder<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.940> do

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
runescape 3 it's actually harder to do

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.120 
runescape 3 it's actually harder to do
it<00:00:15.450> well<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.990> was<00:00:16.170> because<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.619> was<00:00:16.770> glitched

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
it well that was because it was glitched

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.179 
it well that was because it was glitched
out<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:18.150> position<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.020> monsters<00:00:19.560> would<00:00:19.800> never

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
out the position of monsters would never

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.840 
out the position of monsters would never
change

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
change

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.529 
change
so<00:00:21.330> if<00:00:21.570> 180<00:00:22.260> know<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.220> level<00:00:23.490> 180<00:00:23.880> spawns<00:00:24.390> in

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
so if 180 know the level 180 spawns in

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.839 
so if 180 know the level 180 spawns in
this<00:00:24.720> position<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:26.010> not<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.730> change

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
this position it is not going to change

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.900 
this position it is not going to change
so<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.930> easily<00:00:28.170> predict<00:00:28.769> where<00:00:29.099> someone's

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
so it can easily predict where someone's

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.200 
so it can easily predict where someone's
going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.150> spawn<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.500> even<00:00:31.740> afk<00:00:32.309> one

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
going to spawn and you can even afk one

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.270 
going to spawn and you can even afk one
time<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.510> try<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> fastest

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
time I try to go for like the fastest

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.910 
time I try to go for like the fastest
time<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.969> was<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> thirty<00:00:37.170> five<00:00:37.469> minutes<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
time it it was a thirty five minutes I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280 
time it it was a thirty five minutes I
think<00:00:38.160> after<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.390> did<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.750> even<00:00:39.899> try<00:00:40.200> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
think after that I did not even try I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.369 
think after that I did not even try I
was<00:00:40.680> f<00:00:41.250> getting<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> whole<00:00:41.969> time<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:43.200> you

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
was f getting the whole time and if you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
was f getting the whole time and if you
afk<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.489> four<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.329> minutes

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
afk it was like four to one minutes

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.440 
afk it was like four to one minutes
maybe<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.350> by<00:00:46.590> f<00:00:46.860> king<00:00:47.160> I'm<00:00:47.550> not<00:00:48.149> talking

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
maybe just by f king I'm not talking

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
maybe just by f king I'm not talking
about<00:00:48.510> fully<00:00:49.050> f<00:00:49.500> gable<00:00:50.039> because<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.850> way<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
about fully f gable because the way I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.750 
about fully f gable because the way I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
and the mini-map was also up like

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.820 
and the mini-map was also up like
it<00:01:20.610> shows<00:01:20.869> that<00:01:21.869> I'm<00:01:22.020> standing<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> middle

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
happened is I went from level or wave 50

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.240 
happened is I went from level or wave 50
to<00:01:31.350> almost<00:01:31.710> Jade<00:01:32.159> wave<00:01:32.630> 62<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.070> only<00:01:35.070> one

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to almost Jade wave 62 and only one

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
to almost Jade wave 62 and only one
monster<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.939> left<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.570> until<00:01:36.840> jad<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.680> had

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
monster was left to go until jad I had

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.120 
monster was left to go until jad I had
no<00:01:38.340> blues<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.740> looking

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
no blues but I was really looking

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399 
no blues but I was really looking
forward<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> fight<00:01:41.939> jad<00:01:42.299> without<00:01:42.899> even<00:01:43.200> seeing

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
forward to fight jad without even seeing

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.679 
forward to fight jad without even seeing
it<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.670> died<00:01:44.880> because<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> moved

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
it and I just died because I moved

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.920 
it and I just died because I moved
somewhere<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.560> he<00:01:47.159> may<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.670> me<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.149> even

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
somewhere and he may like me and even

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.510 
somewhere and he may like me and even
though<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> mini-map<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:50.280> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
though on the mini-map you can see that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.120 
though on the mini-map you can see that
I<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:50.820> far<00:01:51.119> away<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.720> apparently<00:01:52.560> even<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
I was far away but apparently even the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.060 
I was far away but apparently even the
