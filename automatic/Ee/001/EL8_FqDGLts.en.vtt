00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 yesterday evening the master java 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.980
 he told us he had lost 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.980
 the brooch with me the symbol of the lily of Florence 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.140

 thrown on the ground that brooch 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.500
 and I think it's a small gesture of gratitude for the great gift 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.730
 that he sold us today 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.410
 to offer his part 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.550
 to celebrate with us this really the name of the city I would like 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.550
 first of all by grace 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.080

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.490
 vs the president of the foundation 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.490
 of the Florentine May theater 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.919

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.839
 which through you 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:33.569
 we will be able to send the message of beauty ever stronger 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.419
 message 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:36.019
 universal 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.760
 of those values ​​some its excellence the historical bishop we 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:46.169
 I really thank you from the bottom of my heart for having welcomed us here tonight 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.119
 remembered thanks excellence because 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.669
 his words of collaboration from the church 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.579
 and the city 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.159
 report to each of us a commitment 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.309
 and that of being cathedral builders 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.679
 in fact the cathedral is the site of the collated meeting 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:05.679
 also of the encounter with the other 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:09.089
 it is the place where you try to experiment 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.699
 that sense of beauty that unites us 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.329
 and that I believe is a warning to us I don't even know what will happen tomorrow 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.979
 I don't even know excellence 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:21.799
 I am certain however that from tomorrow we will all be a little more proud of 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.469
