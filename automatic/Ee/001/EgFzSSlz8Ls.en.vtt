00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.469
 Curls 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.230
 this includes these clips with those 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.969
 The curlers land attached to the head 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.670
 will be different from each case 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.689
 At the beginning you would be your hair 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.800
 so that no comedy arises 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.360
 then divide your hair but in size 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.160
 here you want to have the curls if you 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.040
 So have big sacrificing wanted him happy 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.450
 piece then develops the hair on the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.030
 curlers on from bottom to top 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.090
 clean up and then attach the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.890
 curler on the top of the head with this 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.780
 clip that 's just the snap 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.780
 simple and zack 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.510
 in rome so and that does not stay that way 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.590
 I'll show you again you take yourselves 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.700
 So a strand brushes through and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.160
 then take you a curler and 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.530
 I did not turn around that 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.100
 the lure outward as I turn the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.010
 hair away from the face that opens then 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.890
 namely the curls and your face 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.000
 works like a ditch and not like that 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.120
 shut up if you understand what I mean 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.120
 my 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.970
 I come with all the highlights with gloss 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.550
 for the head as need about 15 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.060
 agree and need to fix 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.280
 I average ten to 15 minutes 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.790
 So looks about one 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.500
 minute 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.020
 but then you have the remedy 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.209
 By the way, on the back of the head, namely the hair 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.920
 so forward who has a long hair 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.099
 we perhaps a small tip 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.480
 3 and then roll it on the back of your head 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.019
 When you're done, you have something 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.610
 It looks like this and I have one 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.069
 a little bit afraid that the lure clear 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.420
 not every cliff falls down 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.849
 Keep moving 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.760
 That's why I really like a cloth 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.549
 here the widow bolte on the head that 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.530
 fix everything you have everything in place 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.370
 and can not lure again 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.049
 roll out first 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.750
 so you are also perfectly styled for the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.430
 House cleaning in any case would have to suffice 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.739
 let time pass that the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.799
 curlers can perform with me 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.019
 takes about half an hour and 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.790
 then i'll take that too and schnaps 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.209
 then the first beers shoot down 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.790
 beautiful 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.310
 then you're really fix you take the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.450
 clips away from the curlers and the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.690
 then usually roll off already 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.120
 By the way, by the way, that's the time 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.280
 needs to cool down could be easy 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.950
 Use your make- up around you 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.870
 to prepare and to prepare 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.950
 alluring to make his last 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.950
 step from styling 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.840
 By the way, this is also totally fix 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.090
 and no more than three minutes you are 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.020
 After that, you just have to be curious 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.490
 still with your fingers apart 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.270
 so they defined each other 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.520
 pass over 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.760
 the sweater right so much that I have 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.050
 like it here and then the whole thing with 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.050
 fix hairspray 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:08.060
 then you should be exactly these big ones 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.760
 defined beautiful curls have so 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.100
 is simple as this it is totally fix 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.920
 idiot-proof because at least I get 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.590
 also with it and me would 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.209
