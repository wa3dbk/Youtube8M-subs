finally decided upon a couple of them
for<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.000> background<00:00:12.480> actually<00:00:12.960> used<00:00:13.200> this

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
for the background actually used this

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.560 
for the background actually used this
material<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.700> put<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:14.940> up<00:00:15.030> against<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
material and just put it up against the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.220 
material and just put it up against the
window<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.080> kind<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.470> light<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.859> between

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
window so it kind of light up between

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.570 
window so it kind of light up between
actually<00:00:19.230> correct<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:20.010> maybe<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> should<00:00:20.460> get

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
