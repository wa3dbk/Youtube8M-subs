00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.410 
actually have to pay attention to spot
the<00:01:37.080> little<00:01:37.319> woman<00:01:37.470> stores<00:01:38.039> ie<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:38.880> are<00:01:39.000> clue

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the little woman stores ie that are clue

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.730 
the little woman stores ie that are clue
you<00:01:39.569> in<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.289> each<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> locations

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you in as to what each of the locations

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.800 
you in as to what each of the locations
as<00:01:41.550> we<00:01:41.700> say<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.090> lot<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.300> these<00:01:42.479> things<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
as we say with a lot of these things is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.040 
as we say with a lot of these things is
for<00:01:43.050> kids<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.319> all<00:01:43.380> ages<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.789> we<00:01:45.240> targeted

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
for kids of all ages and so we targeted

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.770 
for kids of all ages and so we targeted
this<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.800> would<00:01:46.950> say<00:01:47.130> an<00:01:47.280> age<00:01:47.429> range<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.970> 7

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
this and we would say an age range of 7

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.940 
this and we would say an age range of 7
to<00:01:48.899> 10<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.319> we<00:01:49.440> think<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.799> will<00:01:49.890> be

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to 10 but we think there will be

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.100 
to 10 but we think there will be
interest<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.490> both<00:01:50.670> sides<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.020> it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
interest on both sides of that and so it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.240 
interest on both sides of that and so it
really<00:01:52.289> is<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.710> anybody<00:01:53.100> who's<00:01:53.220> interested

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
really is for anybody who's interested

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.039 
really is for anybody who's interested
in<00:01:53.729> learning<00:01:53.850> more<00:01:54.030> about<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.600> things<00:01:54.990> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
in learning more about the things that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.190 
in learning more about the things that
we<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.500> display<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> park
