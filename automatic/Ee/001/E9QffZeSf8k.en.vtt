00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.900
 Winter forces us to ask, "Come back to us!" 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:32.740
 Why are we all rush, we don't know. It's time for dreams and the longest for days 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.700
 in which the frost is there, and in the night it snows. 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:45.860
 Being alone is not a good thing for me, I will meet after a bird beep. 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.060
 Spring has found us. 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:57.440
 He already knows what the sun will shine. And whoever meets you will tell you: 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.140
 "Spring has found us." 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.380
 Warm up through the woods through the woods, the melt is starting. 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.280
 And a miracle awaits in the drifts, there a leaf and a flower and a sigh. 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.960
 And in the distance, the cloud is red, disappearing behind the mountain as the bird. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.480
 Being alone is not a good thing! 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.000
 Spring has found us again! 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.280
 Spring has found us again! 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.020
 He brings us to his own. Son goes with his dad. 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.160
 And what about your mouth, how crazy is growing. And the weak are suddenly strong. 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.580
 Just who took off once will take off hundreds. 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.540
 Go on alone, it can't, I'll meet after the bird's beep. 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.460
 Spring has found us again! 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:54.760
 He already knows what the sun will shine. Whoever meets you will tell you: 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.040
 "Spring has found us." 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.180
 "Spring has found us." 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.360
 Spring is closer, it's in us.
