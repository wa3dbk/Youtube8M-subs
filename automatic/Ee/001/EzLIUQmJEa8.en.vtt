00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.710
 me 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 In countries of Europe including Germany 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:18.210
 Housing called passive house spreads 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:21.590
 The work is comfortable without using energy in the house in the sense that it is resistive and passive 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.590
 It represents to live 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:34.250
 It is a scaffolding house that is not well known in Japan 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.250
 That boasts the already explosive popularity in the environment developed countries such as the example of painting in Germany and cane 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.620
 4 of 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.850
 We have well- founded experts in Japan 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:56.640
 An expert who is representative of Japan Bassive House Center and is familiar with housing in the world 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.570
 I asked the employer Shishiko about the attractiveness of the foot house 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.160
 Pachi-bina lie craftsman's pufferfish is feverish 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.870
 air tightness 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.700
 And also from the window on the south side of sunlight 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:14.659
 that 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:16.070
 Create a building with various designs as long as it is important to say that it is important 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:22.159
 It is possible 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:27.720
 The building does not use energy, and eventually mounts solar panels on the building 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:34.320
 There is an idea that it becomes a certain power plant to make buildings n 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.860
 So, what is the "Pachib House" as the standard from now on? 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.440
 To go 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.440
 I think that there is a building that will remain for 100 years and 200 years and there is the origin of Pachiba House 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.770
 There is no observation 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.730
 From the idea of this passive house 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.700
 Tax making energy 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.700
 find direction to not use ne 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:06.950
 There is no point in a house that uses a lot of energy even if it generates electricity with solar panels 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:10.970
 Aiming at a standard for building a German house that can not be compared to Japan go insulation high airtightness 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:17.090
 It was said that it was brought close to zero energy homes 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:19.290
 Whether such that the gray also be referred No Heating if say for the live person 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.439
 It is said that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.060
 I think I can not be healthy after all 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:29.870
 Certainly improving the performance will increase the cost 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.340
 Just its initial cost and Langen's 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.190
 I think I should already be in balance 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.190
 That much of the form to say the initial cost 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.960
 That 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.560
 Think of it as a pitcher 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:48.910
 Well I have to always think about this balance, thinking about the recovery of it 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.910
 I think it may not be
