in<00:00:00.179> this<00:00:00.450> clip<00:00:00.719> we<00:00:00.870> will<00:00:00.900> be<00:00:01.020> talking<00:00:01.110> about

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
in this clip we will be talking about

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.120 
in this clip we will be talking about
the<00:00:01.829> time<00:00:02.159> signatures<00:00:02.669> that<00:00:03.030> are<00:00:03.090> less<00:00:03.570> common

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
the time signatures that are less common

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.190 
the time signatures that are less common
they<00:00:05.130> are<00:00:05.430> will<00:00:05.730> include<00:00:06.060> five<00:00:06.299> four<00:00:06.690> nine

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
they are will include five four nine

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.980 
they are will include five four nine
eight<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.680> twelve<00:00:07.980> eight<00:00:08.360> so<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.480> first<00:00:09.690> five

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
eight and twelve eight so the first five

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.730 
eight and twelve eight so the first five
four<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.240> a<00:00:12.240> time<00:00:12.929> signature<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.469> can<00:00:13.590> be

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
four is a time signature that can be

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.919 
four is a time signature that can be
divided<00:00:14.009> up<00:00:14.219> into<00:00:14.370> either<00:00:14.580> 2<00:00:14.910> plus<00:00:15.150> 3<00:00:15.509> or<00:00:15.690> 3

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
divided up into either 2 plus 3 or 3

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.779 
divided up into either 2 plus 3 or 3
plus<00:00:16.139> 2<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.730> it<00:00:17.730> refers<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.130> kind

plus 2 and it refers that that that kind

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.330 
plus 2 and it refers that that that kind
of<00:00:20.880> defining<00:00:21.539> whether<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.470> 2<00:00:22.619> plus<00:00:22.710> 3<00:00:23.039> or<00:00:23.130> 3

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
of defining whether it's 2 plus 3 or 3

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.089 
of defining whether it's 2 plus 3 or 3
plus<00:00:23.490> 2<00:00:23.730> depends<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.439> the<00:00:25.439> piece<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
2 plus 3 or 3 plus 2 and this can come

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.420 
2 plus 3 or 3 plus 2 and this can come
up<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> couple<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.950> different<00:00:38.100> time

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
up with a couple of different time

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.090 
up with a couple of different time
signatures<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.570> will<00:00:39.660> say<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.260> little<00:00:40.770> 3

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
signatures and it will say a little 3

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.600 
signatures and it will say a little 3
plus<00:00:41.579> 2<00:00:41.910> again<00:00:42.180> above<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> time<00:00:43.110> signature<00:00:43.610> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
plus 2 again above the time signature so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.880 
plus 2 again above the time signature so
the<00:00:44.730> five<00:00:45.059> four<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:46.500> two<00:00:46.649> plus<00:00:46.829> three

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the five four and a two plus three

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.540 
the five four and a two plus three
pattern<00:00:47.489> would<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:48.020> down<00:00:49.020> left<00:00:49.680> right<00:00:50.010> right

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
pattern would be down left right right

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.090 
pattern would be down left right right
up<00:00:51.379> down<00:00:52.379> left<00:00:53.190> right<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
up down left right right up and then a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.510 
up down left right right up and then a
three<00:00:56.670> plus<00:00:56.850> two<00:00:57.059> would<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.600> down<00:00:58.320> left<00:00:58.949> left

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
three plus two would be down left left

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.789 
three plus two would be down left left
right<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.989> left<00:01:01.920> left<00:01:02.250> right<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:03.799> so

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
right up down left left right up so

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.820 
right up down left left right up so
that's<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:06.360> usually<00:01:06.810> how<00:01:07.200> you'll<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that's that's usually how you'll do it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.289 
that's that's usually how you'll do it
and<00:01:07.979> it'll<00:01:08.130> say<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> score<00:01:08.820> above<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
and it'll say in the score above the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.609 
and it'll say in the score above the
time<00:01:09.450> signature<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> two<00:01:10.380> plus<00:01:10.560> three

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
time signature if it's a two plus three

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
time signature if it's a two plus three
or<00:01:10.950> three<00:01:11.010> plus<00:01:11.340> two<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:12.210> next<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.630> nine<00:01:12.900> eight

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
or three plus two the next is nine eight

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
or three plus two the next is nine eight
and<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.540> 1<00:01:15.540> 2<00:01:16.049> 3<00:01:16.619> 4<00:01:17.310> 5<00:01:17.790> 6<00:01:18.450> 7<00:01:18.900> 8<00:01:19.229> 9<00:01:19.939> 1<00:01:20.939> 2<00:01:21.150> 3<00:01:21.990> 4<00:01:22.619> 5

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.020 
and that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:01:23.759> 7<00:01:24.210> 8<00:01:24.869> 9<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.659> it's<00:01:27.659> pretty<00:01:28.259> straightforward

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
6 7 8 9 and it's pretty straightforward

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.640 
6 7 8 9 and it's pretty straightforward
12<00:01:30.030> 8<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:31.310> kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.549> 9<00:01:32.759> 8<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:34.049> 3

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
12 8 is kind of like 9 8 it's just 3

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.359 
12 8 is kind of like 9 8 it's just 3
extra<00:01:34.920> beats<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.090> 1<00:01:36.720> 2<00:01:36.960> 3<00:01:37.710> 4<00:01:38.340> 5<00:01:38.759> 6<00:01:39.329> 7<00:01:39.869> 8<00:01:40.170> 9<00:01:40.860> 10

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
extra beats so it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:50.030 
extra beats so it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11<00:01:41.670> 12<00:01:42.140> 1<00:01:43.140> 2<00:01:43.560> 1<00:01:44.520> 2<00:01:44.759> 3<00:01:45.329> 4<00:01:45.990> 5<00:01:46.350> 6<00:01:46.740> 7<00:01:47.549> 8<00:01:47.700> 9<00:01:47.840> 10<00:01:48.840> 11<00:01:49.140> 12

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
11 12 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.950 
11 12 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
so<00:01:50.759> you'll<00:01:50.970> go<00:01:51.500> down<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.790> left<00:01:54.479> left

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
so you'll go down right right left left

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.380 
so you'll go down right right left left
left<00:01:55.290> right<00:01:55.829> right<00:01:56.310> right

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
left right right right

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.179 
left right right right
up<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:01.200> books<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.770> stuff<00:02:02.040> if

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
up and it's just in books and stuff if

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.100 
up and it's just in books and stuff if
you<00:02:02.280> look<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:02.610> conducting<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.329> books<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you look up conducting in books the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.410 
you look up conducting in books the
patterns<00:02:04.469> will<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.649> described<00:02:05.250> exactly<00:02:05.430> like

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
patterns will be described exactly like

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.800 
patterns will be described exactly like
that<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.500> exactly<00:02:08.209> creates<00:02:09.920> arches

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
that so it's it's exactly creates arches

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.039 
that so it's it's exactly creates arches
and<00:02:12.810> then<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> right<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.459> then<00:02:15.000> up<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.480> it

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
and then to the right and then up and it

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.089 
and then to the right and then up and it
makes<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.290> little<00:02:16.379> bit<00:02:16.470> more<00:02:16.680> sense<00:02:16.890> when<00:02:17.010> you

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
makes a little bit more sense when you

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.730 
makes a little bit more sense when you
see<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.519> book
