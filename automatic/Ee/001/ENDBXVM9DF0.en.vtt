00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello my name is nilton this is the portal 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.629
 your image is from the portal responds videos 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.210
 that happen daily through 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.519
 facebook and brings information about 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.320
 sublimation already coexists with each of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.299
 You continue this chat to 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.340
 start here with the doubt of the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.050
 Sergio to join the group of 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.760
 Portal discussion gets hurt I created 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.980
 this group invited each of you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.320
 now it is called somatic portal 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.369
 sublimation from a to z 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.939
 so you are invited to people 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.250
 talk more about these issues 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.219
 the doubt that was the is the sÃ©rgio he says 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 the next, the way I'm okay 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.420
 researching the sublimation some time 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.280
 Today I saw a video of 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.129
 youtube it has a link from a peek 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.860
 is in the video could explain this 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 sublimation process and looks like it was 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.160
 also made of polyester fabric 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.829
 black would that be 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.100
 in this video is actually talked about 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.809
 sublimation is 100% the disclosure of a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.020
 person who works with training 100% 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.640
 In this video he sells products to his 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.480
 customers then this video on video 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 disclosure 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.159
 in this video the content of it so that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.060
 Do you understand Sergio, so many others? 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.799
 people to total sublimation 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.140
 so it was not actually stamped 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.210
 black fabric is the white fabric that was 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.280
 fully stamped 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 imagine that it is in the formation this mine 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.950
 here til some stripes 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.900
 colorful 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.299
 then it is a fabric that is white and has been 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.729
 stamped some stripes 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.350
 so white is where it was not 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.780
 stamped nothing is the color of the fabric then 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.750
 if I pick up a white and black cat 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.970
 printed on white fabric and stamping 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.159
 black sun because white there is not one 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.829
 subliminal process are however if I take 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.200
 this same white and black cat printed 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.450
 on a yellow tee shirt I'm 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.670
 stamping only the black of this cat 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.340
 then it will turn yellow and yellow and 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.259
 black is the same thing in any other 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.860
 color of the shirt and a red shirt 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.320
 approached 11 very dark red and 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.180
 to stamp this cat even though black 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.530
 whether one contains a very large contrast 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.590
 with red 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.650
 it will be a bit erased because the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.180
 situation is additive then 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.739
 It is very interesting for the confection 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.230
 to cover and work with 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.659
 large format are not large presses 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.060
 are large printers where I 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.980
 unique historical fabric type that the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.840
 white the white without pigment I paid one 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.980
 most interesting price as I buy 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.510
 a larger volume 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.409
 I still have a price drop by the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.329
 volume of the tissue and from the 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.849
 white I do any color 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.709
 so the example of my shirt is 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.400
 exactly one example I used is 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:48.269
 cat and is the example that this video brings 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.629
 that are black tees with a stamp 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.269
 in front of the fabric she is all white and 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.569
 All this black was printed so that the 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.459
 For example, the image has a 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.590
 motorcyclist is coming straight from 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.099
 Steered you all cracked fire 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.129
 Fire coming out here is this stamp she 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.409
 was done in a program where there is a 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.230
 black square around and the motorcyclist 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.900
 in the middle t-shirt before and is stitched 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.239
 she's just remember, it's just cut the fabric 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.549
 I put it in my belief stamp and 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.349
 white fabric it will get all black 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:27.030
 with the image here then I will be 100% 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.739
 but when you take a mouse 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.260
 pad for example you stamp 11 loses 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.449
 100% you take a coaster you 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.129
 shirts 100% t-shirt is the 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.799
 same thing but it is a greater presence 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.720
 so we are 100% of the same same thing 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.849
 I do with the sleeves and the back 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.220
 so there is this issue of 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.159
 training another issue he talks about 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.040
 3d realistic illustrations here 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.900
 that's part of the focus she said not 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.139
 has a special technique 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.979
 What happens is the art that is special 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.510
 for the tv this three-dimensional impression 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:03.260
 on the shirt then independent of the process 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.690
 is the art that has a construction 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.519
 interesting for this volume in the 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.319
 my shirt Sergio Thank you for 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.739
 raise this question is very good power 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.659
 Talk about some some aa aa few 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.000
 here consummation total this 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.739
 image art issue a little bit about the 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.419
 cooking a little about the great 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.630
 then forced to raise these 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.039
 doubt these doubts too. 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.360
 It's the lives of so many people. 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.620
 so in this video now 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.610
 once invited each of you to 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.400
 participate in the discussion group 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.590
 talk about this subject to us 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.330
 have a lot to share these days in 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.530
 last week I made some videos and 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.090
 listen to people very commented 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.830
 expect more and more development 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.479
 of each of you that this is very 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.199
 important so that people can generate 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.789
 more content to interact with you and 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.680
 of the continued work by 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.000
 to hurt is just a channel on youtube launched 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.830
 a facebook page 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.099
 we do so many things for 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.539
 behind the interface is these channels then 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.759
 We speak of them with the right of 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.830
 consumer to technical reports to 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.289
 control of lead in paints then 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.210
 a series of things that the portal does 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.590
 behind this channel on youtube every 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.250
 But we are growing thanks. 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.139
 thanks to the partnership between us and 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.110
 Are you watching this video now? 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.330
 so every comment she has every 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.889
 with each sharing collaborates to 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.580
 this project for growth and 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.590
 expansion 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.680
 every time a company that works 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.240
 with information recognizes the portal as 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.159
 a serious independent channel we 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.529
 we managed to win more for everyone 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:36.469
 we then we thank you in advance 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:36.469
 working together is just you and even more
