00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
a hardcore match of some sort I'm

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.830 
a hardcore match of some sort I'm
talking<00:03:53.950> about<00:03:54.010> weapons<00:03:54.730> brawls<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
talking about weapons brawls in the

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.640 
talking about weapons brawls in the
crowd<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.739> log<00:03:57.010> fire<00:03:58.200> okay<00:03:59.200> but<00:03:59.409> it<00:03:59.470> doesn't

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
crowd the log fire okay but it doesn't

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.589 
crowd the log fire okay but it doesn't
have<00:03:59.709> to<00:03:59.799> be<00:03:59.860> that<00:03:59.950> hard<00:04:00.280> core<00:04:00.519> but<00:04:00.640> still<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
have to be that hard core but still the

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.940 
have to be that hard core but still the
match<00:04:01.780> that<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.049> think<00:04:02.290> can<00:04:02.379> give<00:04:02.620> us<00:04:02.739> all<00:04:02.920> of

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
match that I think can give us all of

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.150 
match that I think can give us all of
this<00:04:03.220> is<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:04.000> midcard<00:04:04.510> mafia<00:04:05.049> vs.<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.590> A&amp;E

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
Kennedy and I think you can all agree to

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.430 
Kennedy and I think you can all agree to
I<00:04:12.640> mean<00:04:12.879> do<00:04:13.629> you<00:04:13.720> guys<00:04:13.840> think<00:04:14.079> this<00:04:14.260> would

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
I mean do you guys think this would

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.650 
I mean do you guys think this would
really<00:04:14.680> be<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:15.129> good<00:04:15.280> of<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.519> match<00:04:15.730> if<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.539> was

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
really be that good of a match if it was

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.960 
really be that good of a match if it was
a<00:04:16.690> normal<00:04:17.079> match<00:04:17.440> now<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.190> think<00:04:18.549> it<00:04:18.639> needs<00:04:18.669> that

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
a normal match now I think it needs that

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.279 
a normal match now I think it needs that
hardcore<00:04:19.239> stipulation<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:19.989> really<00:04:20.199> be

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
hardcore stipulation to really be

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.110 
hardcore stipulation to really be
entertaining<00:04:20.739> now<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.310> hear<00:04:21.579> people<00:04:21.910> saying

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
entertaining now I hear people saying

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.570 
entertaining now I hear people saying
that<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.510> knockout<00:04:22.870> ladder<00:04:23.110> match<00:04:23.380> was

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
that the knockout ladder match was

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.279 
that the knockout ladder match was
disappointing<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.760> not<00:04:25.150> nearly<00:04:25.479> as<00:04:25.660> good<00:04:26.080> as

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
disappointing and not nearly as good as

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.770 
disappointing and not nearly as good as
their<00:04:26.500> Slammiversary<00:04:27.340> match<00:04:27.580> but<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.539> truth

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
their Slammiversary match but the truth

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
their Slammiversary match but the truth
is<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.919> was<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.580> just<00:04:31.150> wasn't<00:04:31.570> as<00:04:31.800> impactful

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
is it was it just wasn't as impactful

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.310 
is it was it just wasn't as impactful
because<00:04:33.340> it<00:04:33.639> wasn't<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.060> first<00:04:34.330> one<00:04:34.539> it's<00:04:35.139> the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
because it wasn't the first one it's the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.350 
because it wasn't the first one it's the
same<00:04:35.560> reason<00:04:35.950> why<00:04:36.099> most<00:04:36.340> people<00:04:36.760> will<00:04:36.910> say<00:04:37.120> oh

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
same reason why most people will say oh

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.960 
same reason why most people will say oh
the<00:04:37.930> original<00:04:38.500> movie<00:04:38.830> is<00:04:39.010> always<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.760> best

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
the original movie is always the best

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.120

made the first match special was that it

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.770 
made the first match special was that it
was<00:05:17.949> the<00:05:18.070> first<00:05:18.340> time<00:05:18.580> we've<00:05:19.030> seen<00:05:19.240> women<00:05:19.510> do

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
was the first time we've seen women do

anything<00:05:20.110> like<00:05:20.260> that<00:05:20.289> in<00:05:20.650> a<00:05:21.039> long<00:05:21.070> time<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:22.360> it

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
anything like that in a long time so it

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.270 
anything like that in a long time so it
felt<00:05:22.870> like<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.139> big<00:05:23.380> deal<00:05:23.620> whereas<00:05:23.949> in<00:05:24.130> this

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
felt like a big deal whereas in this

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.339 
felt like a big deal whereas in this
match<00:05:24.520> we<00:05:25.240> were<00:05:25.360> already<00:05:25.539> expecting<00:05:26.110> it<00:05:26.169> to<00:05:26.320> be

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
match we were already expecting it to be

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.159 
match we were already expecting it to be
crazy<00:05:26.620> so<00:05:27.340> we<00:05:27.430> weren't<00:05:27.669> as<00:05:27.849> blown<00:05:28.300> away<00:05:28.449> by<00:05:28.990> how

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
crazy so we weren't as blown away by how

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.960 
crazy so we weren't as blown away by how
crazy<00:05:29.500> it<00:05:29.710> actually<00:05:30.070> was<00:05:30.280> and<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.760> thing<00:05:30.910> is

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
crazy it actually was and the thing is

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.400 
crazy it actually was and the thing is
we're<00:05:31.539> never<00:05:31.690> going<00:05:31.900> to<00:05:31.930> get<00:05:32.020> that<00:05:32.110> feeling

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
we're never going to get that feeling
