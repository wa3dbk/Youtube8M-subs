a 75 person server that he could host
for<00:04:47.010> me<00:04:47.130> which<00:04:47.640> would<00:04:47.790> be<00:04:47.940> awesome<00:04:48.630> like<00:04:48.660> I

would love to be able to it wouldn't be
like<00:04:50.700> my<00:04:51.030> world<00:04:51.390> I<00:04:51.840> mean<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.470> could<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.650> guess

but I think it would be more fun to like

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.240 
but I think it would be more fun to like
build<00:04:55.200> something<00:04:55.560> together<00:04:55.710> with<00:04:56.010> you<00:04:56.100> guys
