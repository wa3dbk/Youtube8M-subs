frankly<00:01:15.590> I<00:01:15.680> wish<00:01:15.800> I<00:01:15.979> could<00:01:16.130> on<00:01:16.220> both<00:01:16.369> these<00:01:16.610> and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
put them in my living room but I think

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.730 
put them in my living room but I think
this<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:18.649> might<00:01:18.860> get<00:01:19.009> a<00:01:19.039> bit<00:01:19.190> upset<00:01:19.550> about<00:01:19.580> that

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740
