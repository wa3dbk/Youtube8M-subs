for around twenty-five thousand coins on
the<00:01:32.759> Xbox<00:01:33.180> which<00:01:33.360> isn't<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.869> crazy<00:01:34.229> amount<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the Xbox which isn't a crazy amount I

the Xbox which isn't a crazy amount I
kind<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.040> thought<00:01:35.250> we'd<00:01:35.850> go<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> little<00:01:36.869> bit

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
kind of thought we'd go for a little bit

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.840 
kind of thought we'd go for a little bit
more<00:01:37.229> than<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:37.650> he<00:01:38.400> looks<00:01:38.610> pretty

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
more than that because he looks pretty

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.700 
more than that because he looks pretty
so<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.420> he's<00:01:39.570> got<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:39.930> decent<00:01:40.110> passing

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
so like he's got some decent passing

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469 
so like he's got some decent passing
some<00:01:40.860> decent<00:01:41.189> defending<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.790> some<00:01:42.270> pretty

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
some decent defending and some pretty

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.330 
some decent defending and some pretty
good<00:01:42.659> shooting<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.070> would<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
good shooting but if you would like to

pretty neglectful with that challenge
always<00:03:19.500> happens<00:03:19.920> because<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.280> try<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.519> focus

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
always happens because I try and focus

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.850 
always happens because I try and focus
too<00:03:21.060> much<00:03:21.090> on<00:03:21.360> my<00:03:21.450> main<00:03:21.630> channel<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:22.230> it's

too much on my main channel and it's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.250 
too much on my main channel and it's
really<00:03:22.920> difficult<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.880> get<00:03:24.390> together<00:03:24.600> footage
