00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.400
 the doctor of the selection giovanni 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.440
 Carcuro just left doubts for a possible 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.520
 game arturo vidal ante australia in the 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.520
 debut of style in the World Cup 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.990
 brazil-2014 the doctor of the 'red' 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.730
 analyzed the moment of the steering wheel of the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.980
 juventus and just spread the mantle of 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.600
 doubts surrounding the raposa played do not say 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.490
 King recovery percentages 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.740
 arturo and explained the determination of 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.260
 do play against Ireland buy from 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.699
 that is lived day to day moment to 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.680
 moment the player is responding 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.120
 well the recovery process goes for good 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.640
 path 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.829
 that decision probably also has 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.170
 some technical connotation about it 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.239
 because he will also have to grow those 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.559
 aspects of soccer tips behind 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.120
 before making a final decision of in 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.899
 how much to play or not to play but since 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.280
 this is an element that is going to lead 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.199
 evaluating moments moments there 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.210
 phenomena that are happening that is the 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.420
 stress where to keep trying if one says 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.850
 medical discharge of a professional footballer 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.229
 even in the rest of the campus if there 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.090
 a player who has no discomfort 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.830
 that there is no degree of 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.619
 discomfort in front of some kind of 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.820
 reaction or something practically in 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.289
 professional sport and high 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.320
 performance there are only the others 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.830
 percentages is very difficult to say no 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.210
 there is that first thing that there is percentage 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.340
 I really think it would be a 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.650
 irresponsibility and physical aspects 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.210
 football projects medical aspects 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.710
 that influence that of celebrities 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.970
 percentages I do not think there's a 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.340
 percentage that one can mention 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.840
 stocks has generated a lot of speculation 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.280
 is the fact that you have played their 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.220
 minutes during the game against 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.990
 Ireland and I want to tell you that the 10 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.870
 or 15 minutes that Arthur played in that 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.420
 party that were not in any case anymore 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.130
 intense than what he had been doing 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.570
 previously therefore not running was not 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.180
 No degree of responsibility in 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.950
 no degree but it was something 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.050
 projected and planned within your 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.390
 recovery process because also 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.979
 It was necessary to evaluate what the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.720
 behavior of arturo in front of a 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.650
 reality of game which could not be 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.650
 do in any other way
