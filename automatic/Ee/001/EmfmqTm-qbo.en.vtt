00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.550
 Here in Germany, violence is one 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.540
 Many have become an everyday problem 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.040
 People become victims of 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.200
 procurement crime 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.730
 often weaker and defenseless 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.450
 the victims with the perpetrators getting younger 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.099
 become 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.720
 Unfortunately, many are looking again and again 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.550
 people away and do not know how 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.169
 counteract is despite the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.210
 apparent idyl is behind 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.550
 peacefully acting people one 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.500
 increasing violence and thus 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.500
 resignation and fear 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.060
 you did not always want to cry 22 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.250
 everyone has to 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.250
 she should do this together 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.110
 heavy stretch us here 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.620
 People 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.620
 7 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.110
 the sweden play 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.659
 and here 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.070
 how obsessed 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.960
 the climb 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.430
 the victim actually a big fear 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.800
 does it have to be that way 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.320
 I always suspected that he was 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.170
 this 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.350
 as a small park in the big coup 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.590
 they always felt strong 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.790
 and his children to me from the best 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.710
 heavy 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:59.119
 1 still a hero 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.119
 he has too much on the streets 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.539
 the 143st 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.539
 not at all in his 72nd 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.960
 cram is 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.170
 you feel heavy and stretch 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.790
 the human 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.620
 the broke 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.129
 ran fast 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.129
 behind it is likely 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.640
 climbed 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.540
 how can 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.540
 his three years instead 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.080
 rock hard 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.830
 but he forgives 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.830
 to the white house 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.910
 and then happened 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.950
 my mother fled 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.660
 because we steer 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.280
 People are always looking away 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:28.159
 increases the readiness for violence and 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.159
 at the same time resignation and fear
