00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:04.909
 ah 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.370
 now you only see or I extract the first 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.410
 video from back to school the first video 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.590
 as you will have seen in the title is about 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.740
 ideas to decorate the backpack you know 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.840
 that I am lousy next lousy with the 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.789
 crafts are given super bad I'm going 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.340
 to give the idea and some little things that are 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.439
 super easy to make your list and the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.390
 letter the only 50 ideas that I will go 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.070
 commenting me this year I wanted something more 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.989
 simple the truth that I wanted a 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.160
 easier backpack but with a touch 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.739
 so you will see and you can buy a 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.140
 Basic black backpack totally has no 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.839
 to her too of no drawing or any 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.150
 florecita basic black or anything I 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.280
 I bought in the decathlon and it cost me four 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.589
 extra euros to go to the store 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.229
 closest you have or a backpack 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.750
 that you have not used another year 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.640
 comes basic and you want to redecorate it or what 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.320
 that is the question to spend the least 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.180
 possible money we will need 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.610
 materials that battery after everything 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.170
 that catches and for your house setting 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.350
 to the stationery I have an obsession with 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.720
 stationery so I have thousands of little things 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.009
 The truth is that I do not know about shooting or 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.979
 where I bought it because the only 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.440
 put in bazaars of stationery and things 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.600
 well so if you do not have any idea 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.040
 just simply search for your 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.080
 drawers when you have the tidbits 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.299
 stationery if you have any idea in mind 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.100
 can directly go somewhere to 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.049
 buy those materials what I more 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.509
 I recommend is to decorate what comes to be 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.780
 the pocket of the backpack and the sauce 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.580
 you can do a lot of conjugations 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.470
 with the materials that you have 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.270
 I found some super felt kittens 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.479
 nice ones that were already trimmed but 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.190
 done if you buy felt and with a cutter 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.649
 for example cut the shape of a kitten 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.270
 or a silhouette that we have found but 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.490
 find a template online and 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.580
 just download that template what 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.890
 puts and on top of the felt and already draw 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.170
 the first idea is this is very simple 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.909
 there are thousands of conjugations depending 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.340
 of your materials the second idea 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.319
 you need some wire this 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.709
 I also found it in any bazaar and 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.500
 they're going to cut a valve like that pretty 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.770
 worth more or less than enough to 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.420
 do the word you want 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.470
 what we are going to do is cut the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.940
 Salam break and let's roll over the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.980
 wire some strip me for example 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.570
 I was using the strips of these that are 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.580
 to make the gifts ties 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.140
 it looks like gold but you can 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.110
 use any yarn or wool or 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.970
 anything to decorate this bouquet 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.130
 we have decorated it whole simply 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.650
 well turning around so badly 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.420
 that we cover everything and we will give 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.910
 form to our word can you 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.490
 using a little bit of super blues 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.860
 when you are putting the ribbon around 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.080
 of the wire so that then they are not very 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.650
 how are we going to hit them with a super 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.210
 globe 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.280
 you can know this is very easy to 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.140
 things you only need a thread that is 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.000
 more or less the same color of the fabric 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.880
 hair used and what you have 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.380
 used and consell it to the backpack in 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.970
 the situation where you ye 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.520
 the truth shirt idea I thought super 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.200
 pretty is everything super ideas have been 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.080
 simple but how can you do with 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.660
 thousands of materials because they can give 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.580
 super-different conjugations the truth 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.590
 is that it's the only thing I'm going to tell you in 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.300
 this video and I will show you how I have 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.740
 the same backpack as I tell you already this 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.950
 year wanted something super 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.480
 normal and you like lomas cues but 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.390
 as you see here not put anything yet 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.880
 because what he decorated has been this here 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.720
 with lace and as a lollipop that 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.880
 it goes as with a safety pin and simply 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.430
 I put a little bit of lace in this 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.210
 zone here also in the zipper of 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.570
 hook this unicorn the truth that 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.160
 like this would be the cute backpack but 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.620
 surely this year in dollar and bird for 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.600
 nothing if I'm going to remove the lollipop and the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.850
 unicorn because I think that excessive I do not know 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.860
 this year I do not feel like it but what I do 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.160
 what I want to do is put here with the 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.930
 same lace make a loop like that a 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.360
 little bit not super big but pretty 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.460
 big date and sew it to paste these 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.360
 things I say I can use any 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.400
 super glÃ¼ck 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.230
 although it is going to stick with fabric is better 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.240
 use a special glue to 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.980
 paste fabric the truth that they are the ones that 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.230
 better work they stay super good 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.970
 pegadito and do not stain the fabric or do not 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.950
 change the color that most important or 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.480
 but you can also know them if I am 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.240
 tomorrow I really do not 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.460
 I prefer the glue that as fast 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.259
 embracing the idea very very simple and 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.270
 the truth is that what I'm going to hit 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.270
 in the comments on a truth plan 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.360
 it's a video about this I do hope that you 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.840
 like my idea the truth 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.340
 but I'm horrible with these things but 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.750
 brother I like how he has changed 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.069
 my backpack I think it's much more 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.110
 female so I do not know anything else this has 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.910
 been the first video of pasture school we 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.860
 we will see in the next one that will be on Tuesday 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.699
 and nothing we see in the next video 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.699
 goodbye 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:11.760
 it's about four euros 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.760
