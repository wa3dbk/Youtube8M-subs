00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.219
 thank you for watching 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.049
 so today I allow you 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.699
 to learn the rolled ball to your dog 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.340
 you have rugby that everyone 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.080
 knows the one with the jack russel of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.310
 christophe dechavanne 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:30.240
 so to do that you have to use 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:34.860
 as usual a motivating so a 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.870
 little treat or the ball so there 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.559
 for their demonstration it would be a 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.879
 candy and to equalize to achieve 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.550
 this exercise I advise you to 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.020
 start at home on a fairly carpet 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.780
 fleece or on a floor mat for 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.219
 to do the gym and outside we go 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.930
 I use grass because it's 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.059
