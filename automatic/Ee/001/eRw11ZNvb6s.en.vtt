00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and has really good graphics so let's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:01:25.399 
and has really good graphics so let's
check<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> out

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590 

but<00:01:26.159> as<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.399> saw<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:26.640> gameplay<00:01:27.149> was<00:01:27.299> really

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
but as you saw the gameplay was really

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.389 
but as you saw the gameplay was really
smooth<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> craft<00:01:28.409> periods<00:01:28.890> were<00:01:29.070> quite

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
smooth but the craft periods were quite

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.910 
smooth but the craft periods were quite
less<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.570> almost<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.229> expected

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
less this is almost what we expected

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.880 
less this is almost what we expected
from<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.280> mid-range<00:01:32.729> device<00:01:33.200> but<00:01:34.200> thankfully

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
from a mid-range device but thankfully

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.380 
from a mid-range device but thankfully
the<00:01:35.009> game<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.310> definitely<00:01:35.759> playable<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the game is definitely playable and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.469 
the game is definitely playable and
enjoyable<00:01:36.960> their<00:01:37.439> respective<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> graphics

enjoyable their respective the graphics

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.899 
enjoyable their respective the graphics
now<00:01:39.479> let's<00:01:39.720> try<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.140> somewhat<00:01:40.679> lighter<00:01:41.009> game

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
now let's try out somewhat lighter game

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.520 
now let's try out somewhat lighter game
dead<00:01:42.299> trigger<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> Unity<00:01:43.500> engine

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
dead trigger this is the Unity engine

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.969 
dead trigger this is the Unity engine
game<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> scales<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:45.119> well<00:01:45.299> down<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
game and scales really well down to the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
game and scales really well down to the
low-end<00:01:47.310> devices<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.939> let's<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.420> how<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
low-end devices so let's see how it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:02:25.250 
low-end devices so let's see how it
performs<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.770> three

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.960

surprisingly as you notice the graphics
and<00:02:28.120> details<00:02:28.390> we're<00:02:28.570> good<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.080> gameplay

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
and details we're good and the gameplay

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.180 
and details we're good and the gameplay
was<00:02:29.590> smooth

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
was smooth

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.660 
was smooth
but<00:02:30.730> with<00:02:31.090> occasional<00:02:31.420> lags<00:02:31.840> here<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.260> there

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
but with occasional lags here and there

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.490 
but with occasional lags here and there
they<00:02:33.670> triggered<00:02:34.000> gameplay<00:02:34.360> experiences<00:02:34.990> much

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
enjoyable in the Galaxy Tab 3 but then

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.660 
enjoyable in the Galaxy Tab 3 but then
the<00:02:38.260> occasional<00:02:38.530> lags<00:02:39.010> were<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> bit

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
the occasional lags were a bit

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.090 
the occasional lags were a bit
inhibiting<00:02:40.410> now<00:02:41.410> let's<00:02:41.620> check<00:02:41.770> out<00:02:41.950> another
