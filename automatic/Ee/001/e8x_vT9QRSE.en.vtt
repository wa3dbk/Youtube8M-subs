00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.949

 Russian legislation and preparation for 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.369

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.830
 what years the president worlds were Putin and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.830
 Medvedev 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.299
 commemorates Vladimir Berezovsky 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.740
 director of the institute of additional education 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.869
 University of Communications reads 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.610

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.729
 migrants 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.360
 among the questions for example who founded 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.939

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.040
 and when was the Kulikov battle on 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.380
 According to Vladimir Berezovsky, not everyone 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.590
 Russian citizen will answer all these 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.329
 questions and therefore training courses 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.280
 will be in demand as 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.740
 called one of the main organization 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.939
 Muslims of Russia you know bye 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.899
 preliminary tests that were carried out 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:56.370
 universities have shown that foreign nationals 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.680
 cis we are talking about them could not pass the test 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.030
 what will they take to learn 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.650
 Chinese citizens 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.810
 korean northern republic i'm not 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.520
 imagine what universities will be 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.080
 do the exam and 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.720
 preparing for it the ministry 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.280
 Education has not decided Khabarovsk for 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.350
 this is the right to fight the far east 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.420
 State University of Humanities 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.460
 University of Communications Academy 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.950
 economics and law and pacific 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.210
 State University We are the Primate 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.890
 I'll start that us Khabarovsk region 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.660
 approximately 12 thousand labor 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.360
 migrants imagine that 12,000 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.290
 need to be trained and I think that in fact 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.330
 even 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.160
 those universities that are likely to get 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.770
 that's right and under difficult to handle 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.570
 situation Khabarovsk universities have already calculated 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.390
 exam preparation courses for 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.130
 migrant workers will be worth from 5 to 20 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.650
 thousand rubles depending on 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.990
 duration is not counting the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.590
 exam for him too will need 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.010
 pay 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.860
 about 5,000 rubles immigrant we should 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.160
 understand the one that arrived and not yet 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.290
 worked here in russia 57 thousand for 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.570
 uzbekistan or tajikistan and also 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.040
 big money is on two salaries 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.410
 opinion of the chairman of the public 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.300
 Movement of Muslims Hamza Kuznetsova Law 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.790
 requiring labor migrants to take 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.580
 paid exam not fully worked out 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.020
 I think from my experience that 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.890
 most likely almost oppression means a trend 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.400
 to illegal 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.590
 to illegal employment of migrants 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.900
 which universities of the region will receive the right to conduct 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.120
 migrant exam will be known 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.400
 already in December of this year, Natalia 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.880
