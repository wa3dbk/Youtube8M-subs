two basic systems now to understand them

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.369 
two basic systems now to understand them
first<00:00:34.480> need<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.719> understand<00:00:35.079> a<00:00:35.110> little<00:00:35.140> bit<00:00:35.320> of

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
first need to understand a little bit of

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.880 
first need to understand a little bit of
history<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.969> a<00:00:36.999> very<00:00:37.329> long<00:00:37.600> time<00:00:37.649> cars<00:00:38.649> that

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
history for a very long time cars that

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.669 
history for a very long time cars that
came<00:00:39.010> with<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.219> 12-volt<00:00:39.670> battery<00:00:40.260> had<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.289> 12

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:41.679 
came with a 12-volt battery had a 12

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.020 
came with a 12-volt battery had a 12
volt<00:00:41.949> coil<00:00:42.249> in<00:00:42.489> them<00:00:42.609> that's<00:00:42.789> how<00:00:42.909> they

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
volt coil in them that's how they

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.299 
volt coil in them that's how they
operated<00:00:43.420> that<00:00:43.569> was<00:00:43.659> logical<00:00:44.199> so<00:00:44.829> if<00:00:44.949> you<00:00:45.069> fed

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
operated that was logical so if you fed

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.099 
operated that was logical so if you fed
12<00:00:45.640> volts<00:00:45.999> that's<00:00:46.179> what<00:00:46.359> volt<00:00:46.569> coil<00:00:46.839> II<00:00:46.989> would

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
12 volts that's what volt coil II would

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.270 
12 volts that's what volt coil II would
work<00:00:47.260> all<00:00:47.469> day<00:00:48.100> long<00:00:48.870> however<00:00:49.870> if<00:00:50.379> you<00:00:51.010> fed

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
work all day long however if you fed

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.149 
work all day long however if you fed
that<00:00:51.489> coil<00:00:51.789> with<00:00:52.149> less<00:00:52.479> than<00:00:52.809> 12<00:00:53.079> volts<00:00:53.649> it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
that coil with less than 12 volts it

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.669 
that coil with less than 12 volts it
might<00:00:54.489> work<00:00:54.699> poorly<00:00:55.210> it<00:00:55.780> might<00:00:56.049> not<00:00:56.289> work<00:00:56.499> at

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
might work poorly it might not work at

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.610
