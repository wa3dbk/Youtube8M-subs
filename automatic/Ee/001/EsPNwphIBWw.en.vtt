and they have new tracking devices once

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.070 
and they have new tracking devices once
I<00:00:33.710> realized<00:00:33.950> went<00:00:34.430> went<00:00:34.760> wrong<00:00:35.090> with<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.840> tags

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
I realized went went wrong with the tags

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.170 
I realized went went wrong with the tags
we<00:00:36.290> used<00:00:36.500> last<00:00:36.739> year<00:00:36.980> I<00:00:37.370> had<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.760> go<00:00:37.850> back<00:00:38.059> to

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
we used last year I had to go back to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.120 
we used last year I had to go back to
the<00:00:38.270> manufacturer<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:38.960> brainstorm<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:39.980> come

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
the manufacturer and brainstorm and come

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.799 
the manufacturer and brainstorm and come
up<00:00:40.250> with<00:00:40.340> a<00:00:40.400> new<00:00:40.610> design<00:00:40.970> we<00:00:41.420> actually<00:00:41.720> were

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
up with a new design we actually were

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.930 
up with a new design we actually were
able<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:42.110> add<00:00:42.230> an<00:00:42.410> battery<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:43.340> it<00:00:43.580> should<00:00:43.730> last

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
able to add an battery so it should last

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.620 
able to add an battery so it should last
longer

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
longer

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.869 
longer
we<00:00:45.050> increased<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.100> thickness<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.699> the

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
we increased the thickness and the

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.910 
we increased the thickness and the
strength<00:00:47.270> of<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.510> antennas<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.350> I<00:00:48.379> think<00:00:48.500> we

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
strength of the antennas so I think we

00:00:48.920 --> 00:01:02.410 
strength of the antennas so I think we
got<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.190> get<00:00:49.370> it<00:00:49.489> this<00:00:49.640> time<00:01:01.030> around<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.239> bait

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
got to get it this time around the bait

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.479 
got to get it this time around the bait
right<00:01:02.690> there<00:01:02.960> coming<00:01:03.590> in<00:01:03.739> coming<00:01:03.980> in<00:01:04.250> though
