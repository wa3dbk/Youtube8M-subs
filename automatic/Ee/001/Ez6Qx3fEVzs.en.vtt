 Hello dear friends with you sewing and 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.910
 this is the third release of developer answers 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.610
 drove 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.980
 ships of level 10 will immediately be given in 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.740
 top configuration aircraft carriers it 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.110
 an exception in my captain when showing 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.910
 ship characteristics are not taken into account 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.550
 planned then change but not in 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.950
 closest priority is considered 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.130
 problem with lead point now 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.989
 the question is still open but patch 031 will be 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.360
 changes 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.900
 Added a new card in 031 for high 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.110
 levels 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.060
 pro and volcano over time statistics 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.430
 add torpedo accuracy 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.950
 attacks as now only the main 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.170
 caliber is displayed 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.300
 smooth borders of the map there are different let's start 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.750
 with the fact that in the patch 0-1 they will be 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.670
 visually more pleasant and then we'll see 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.920
 open beta test is planned 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.030
 add two branches of development ships 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.590
 Soviet Union to level 10 in 031 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.860
 demonstrated a new system 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.170
 punishment of these dealers for finding 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.259
 the enemy when dealing damage to them 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.829
 There is no light at the current level. 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:24.060
 realistic on now we are satisfied 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.649
 constantly working on optimizing but 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.969
 64-bit system anyway 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.880
 will show the best 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:34.770
 performance so far expansion 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.039
 no pre-order assortment planned 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.619
 031 plan around mid May 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:45.700
 for hail there is a fire on the cruisers with two and 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.710
 more guns universal caliber in 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.869
 long-range plans have implementation ships 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.850
 project in germany namely linear 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.499
 hey type ships also out of 39 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.969
 Soviet Union may be a battleship 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:59.969
 project 39 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.290
 and the battleships of the Soviet Union estest 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.390
 screenshots 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.670
 screenshot drawings you now see in 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.489
 myself on the screen I no longer dug to 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.760
 Unfortunately, there is very little in these 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.970
 ships that projects like each and that 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.910
 project type 23 there is nothing wikipedia 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.760
 nowhere else I searched 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.550
 excuse me the age limit ships 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.330
 roughly 1900 and 1950s the beginning of the era 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.220
 dreadnoughts and then the sunset of the era 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.920
 artillery ships well on this 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.049
 the developers answer came to an end if 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.630
