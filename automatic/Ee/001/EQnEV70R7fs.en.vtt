00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.850 
instrument some of the instruments is
hard<00:06:18.270> I<00:06:18.570> would<00:06:18.840> say<00:06:19.110> if<00:06:19.230> the<00:06:19.320> tuba<00:06:19.620> players

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
but you'll you'll see that the diaphragm

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.370 
but you'll you'll see that the diaphragm
really<00:06:30.410> really<00:06:30.740> really<00:06:30.920> engages
