00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.410
 and then people at first he does not deserve 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.990
 this here with a samsung galaxy 3 and 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.660
 it may seem something very simple which I 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.639
 I'm going to show but a lot of people sometimes have 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.990
 Curious to know that I'm going to be 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:23.029
 showing here themes wallpapers 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:26.070
 widgets sound that even come on then it is 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.090
 start the theme here 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.160
 then she decided to put the samsung 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.500
 now the themes here and I think 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.430
 This is so cool, I had seen it. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.790
 I think in the lg I heard that I had also 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.219
 I think I have it too. 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.710
 no sony also on the line sony has vamos 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:56.520
 put here a gift or handmade the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:57.210
 apply there has already changed the whole face of 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.770
 on here 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.400
 O what he does very nice mountain 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.340
 this time it changed that lau chai 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.640
 changed to the icons, right? 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.369
 gave a different air on the icons I liked 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:21.750
 It was very cool, I hope 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:25.320
 samsung she take and apply she take is 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.119
 so she has the good sense to have a right 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.990
 download button for us to power 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.670
 download other themes 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.000
 for example installing launcher if 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.829
 install for example is the personal uses 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.100
 also the ex-wife and also to be able to 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.200
 modify that ability is to do 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.820
 download can also make a mess 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.380
 I messed with this touchwiz face, eh? 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.689
 talk to you but does not enjoy TouchWiz 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.610
 was too heavy on the heavy interface 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.469
 understood could be with less 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.869
 Such a bank has several 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.600
 facilities taste more and more 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.390
 We're going to have the next one. 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.759
 subject are the wallpapers, right? 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.830
 staff here we have main screen 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.420
 lock and start and lock screen 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.300
 main 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.390
 papers are animated ne and wallpapers 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.280
 where the first animated aquino we have 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.540
 nothing even an animated wallpaper that 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.459
 eh thing 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.950
 so we will in the other here in 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.209
 wallpapers but here in the end no 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.780
 we have nothing exciting here we 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.900
 We have this serve worked great. 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.540
 I do not particularly like it very much 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.239
 thus extremely colored 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.030
 I already like more colors, for example. 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.750
 this one that came for example nuno s5 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.970
 I already like this here with a color 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.430
 neutral with no details whatsoever and he 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.950
 I came up with this one I left to 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.110
 I did not leave, but I was 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.540
 who cares for not having him 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.980
 animations né 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.110
 Animated wallpapers they do not have 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.400
 no I did not do any 7 hardware on 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.000
 I thought nothing strange then. 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:20.690
 comes another animated wallpaper 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.730
 subject are widgets widsets are these 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.230
 programs that are running on the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.799
 lao chi and updating some information 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.110
 weather type is this one O 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.660
 but here we have a lot of configuration 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.959
 yes two themes that more than the act 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:41.500
 which I installed he also creates 11 weed 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.500
 speaking of temperature 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:49.640
 talking the battery temperature or 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.250
 as the consumption of CPU and how much being 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.790
 used in ram 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.950
 So these are the fanatics there that 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.660
 Do you like to accompany me on the island? 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.850
 keeping track of the battery percentage is 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.269
 staff for these others here does not have 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.269
 no interest 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.090
 about the south and say let's go there we have 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.430
 Here, too, the little 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.690
 other possibilities before tweets of 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.370
 smaller size or larger size 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.470
 I do not know why we have here 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.470
 setting the flashlight instance here 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.860
 the basic application is not 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.870
 Let's go back there for the widgets. 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.759
 We have here highlights are from the 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.210
 samsung stand out né 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:46.639
 we drive in the middle of a series of 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.849
 standard text already in this frame by 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:54.500
 example is changing the photos in the frame 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:56.870
 you frame it perth 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.289
 for example here you can choose 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.860
 photo album photo album photo 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.840
 illustrated 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.389
 You choose the photos you want and 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:10.039
 he will play on the screen for you 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.419
 that's also what i say is i have 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.880
 today this doubt not know if this 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.870
 consumes battery or not because he 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.419
 is processing the image that passes most 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.060
 dropbox and already interact with your 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.889

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:35.000
 nuno dropbox right and wikis and now the 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.639
 from sounds, not personal 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:45.050

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.949
 but we have others 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.840

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.840

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:25.509
 this they cut right 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.000
 to this rhythm here that I showed to 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:29.800
