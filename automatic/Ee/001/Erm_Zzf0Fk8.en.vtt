program<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.520> put<00:00:41.700> two<00:00:41.850> away<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> second

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
program we put two away in the second

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.030 
program we put two away in the second
often<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> well<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.590> said<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> gives<00:00:43.890> us

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
often it well like I said it gives us

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.170 
often it well like I said it gives us
something<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> go<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.610> new<00:00:44.700> cab<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.030> hold

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
something to go to the new cab and hold

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.380 
something to go to the new cab and hold
onto<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.770> last<00:00:47.010> year<00:00:47.430> they

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
onto a little bit like last year they

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.209 
onto a little bit like last year they
died<00:00:48.750> away<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.350> bit<00:00:49.620> when<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> scored

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
died away a little bit when you scored

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.650 
died away a little bit when you scored
the<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.520> goal<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.030> seemed<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.239> run<00:00:51.480> out<00:00:51.629> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the first goal and seemed to run out of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
the first goal and seemed to run out of
puff<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.199> little<00:00:52.230> bit<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> last<00:00:52.789> 10<00:00:53.789> minutes

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
puff a little bit in the last 10 minutes

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.520 
puff a little bit in the last 10 minutes
or<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.809> think<00:00:54.960> that's<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.199> factor<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
or so do you think that's a factor that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.139 
or so do you think that's a factor that
may<00:00:55.800> come<00:00:55.980> into<00:00:56.160> play<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> second<00:00:56.820> leg<00:00:56.940> -

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
may come into play in the second leg -

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.060 
may come into play in the second leg -
yeah<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.559> down<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> us<00:00:58.890> as

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
yeah I think I think it's down to us as

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.680 
yeah I think I think it's down to us as
well<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.280> pressed<00:00:59.520> them<00:00:59.670> more<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.420> know<00:01:00.539> we

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
well we pressed them more we know we

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.880 
well we pressed them more we know we
were<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> fit<00:01:00.960> team<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.379> knew<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.770> go

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
were a fit team and we knew we can go

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.349 
were a fit team and we knew we can go
for<00:01:02.039> 90<00:01:02.160> minutes<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.300> that

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
for 90 minutes and we have to do that

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.520 
for 90 minutes and we have to do that
again<00:01:03.480> at<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> new<00:01:03.899> count<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.350> press
