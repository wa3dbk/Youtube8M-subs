00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
this is what it looks like without the

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.700 
this is what it looks like without the
body<00:04:29.340> or<00:04:29.819> without<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.210> exoskeleton<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.560> can

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
body or without the exoskeleton you can

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.260 
body or without the exoskeleton you can
see<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.190> injection<00:04:32.669> holes<00:04:32.879> and<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.120> can

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
see to injection holes and you can

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.580 
see to injection holes and you can
actually<00:04:33.389> see<00:04:33.599> that<00:04:33.840> below<00:04:34.110> right<00:04:34.940> there

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
actually see that below right there

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.580 
actually see that below right there
sorry<00:04:37.590> it's<00:04:37.800> backwards<00:04:38.629> so<00:04:39.629> I<00:04:39.659> guess<00:04:40.199> the<00:04:40.500> way

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
sorry it's backwards so I guess the way

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
just kind of pulled out there because it

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.279 
just kind of pulled out there because it
did<00:05:44.490> kind<00:05:44.699> of<00:05:44.729> happen<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.060> me<00:05:45.210> so<00:05:45.960> if<00:05:46.050> you<00:05:46.169> just

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
little bit and it usually fixes a

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.680 
little bit and it usually fixes a
problem<00:05:52.469> so<00:05:54.380> wait<00:05:55.819> spit<00:05:56.819> in<00:05:56.940> there<00:05:57.150> and<00:05:57.419> push

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690
