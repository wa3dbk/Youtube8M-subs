Washington Monument built here by the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.620 
Washington Monument built here by the
time<00:01:22.740> you'd<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.040> done<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.310> this

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
time you'd be done with this

time you'd be done with this
demonstration<00:01:24.630> right<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:25.020> come<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.560> great

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
demonstration right they come in great

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.249 
demonstration right they come in great
geometric<00:01:26.520> shapes<00:01:27.000> these<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.540> squares<00:01:27.990> we've

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
geometric shapes these are squares we've

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.690 
geometric shapes these are squares we've
got<00:01:28.439> triangles<00:01:29.070> you're<00:01:29.310> gonna<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.579> you've

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
got triangles you're gonna see you've

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.609 
got triangles you're gonna see you've
got<00:01:29.880> sectors<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.570> arches<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.290> Senate

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
got sectors and arches with this Senate

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.530 
got sectors and arches with this Senate
also<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.250> wheels<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:32.850> everything<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.329> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
also the wheels now everything that you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.569 
also the wheels now everything that you
make<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:34.380> magformers<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> become

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
make with magformers is going to become

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.429 
make with magformers is going to become
completely<00:01:35.909> mobile<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.380> you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
completely mobile so all you do is you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
completely mobile so all you do is you
build<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.310> dimension<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> table

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
build on a one dimension on the table

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.020 
build on a one dimension on the table
and<00:01:39.659> then<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.020> lift<00:01:40.560> them<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.280> they<00:01:41.790> become

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and then you lift them and they become

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.090 
and then you lift them and they become
three-dimensional<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
three-dimensional just like that so a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.980 
three-dimensional just like that so a
little<00:01:44.399> house<00:01:44.640> how<00:01:44.939> cool<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.360> right<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
little house how cool is that right and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.230 
little house how cool is that right and
so<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.829> our<00:01:46.950> multicolored<00:01:47.579> set<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.060> is

so this is our multicolored set this is

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
so this is our multicolored set this is
the<00:01:48.270> house<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.869> was<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.110> easy<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> did<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
the house it was so easy to do I did it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.210 
the house it was so easy to do I did it
with<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.390> triangles<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.540> squares<00:01:52.110> awesome

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
with just triangles and squares awesome

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.039 
with just triangles and squares awesome
so<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> multicolor<00:01:54.240> we're<00:01:54.420> calling<00:01:54.689> rainbow

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
so the multicolor we're calling rainbow

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.840 
so the multicolor we're calling rainbow
you<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.619> your<00:01:55.740> choice<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.520> then

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
over here we're gonna demonstrate with a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
over here we're gonna demonstrate with a
set<00:01:58.799> called<00:01:58.979> blue<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.399> green<00:01:59.579> so<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.850> have

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
blue or green and the QVC price on this

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
blue or green and the QVC price on this
is<00:02:03.750> $44<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:04.979> three<00:02:05.189> easy<00:02:05.369> monthly

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
is $44 we have it on three easy monthly

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.199 
is $44 we have it on three easy monthly
payments<00:02:06.119> though<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:07.729> $14.67<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.060> now

payments though for $14.67 and so now
I've<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.539> put<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.780> together<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
I've just put this together and the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.630 
I've just put this together and the
other<00:02:10.560> little<00:02:10.709> one<00:02:10.920> was<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.190> course<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.520> one

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
other little one was of course the one

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.100 
other little one was of course the one
that<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:11.910> drop<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> floor<00:02:12.750> but<00:02:12.989> what

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that you just drop to the floor but what

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.790 
that you just drop to the floor but what
this<00:02:13.260> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
this is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.890 
this is
is<00:02:13.890> now<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.550> wheels<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.390> if<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.570> put<00:02:15.780> them

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
is now on wheels and so if I put them

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.020 
is now on wheels and so if I put them
together<00:02:16.080> actually<00:02:16.590> they<00:02:17.310> would<00:02:17.460> connect<00:02:17.850> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
together actually they would connect and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.160 
together actually they would connect and
they<00:02:18.090> would<00:02:18.210> be<00:02:18.300> able<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.510> pull<00:02:18.810> each<00:02:18.990> other

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
they would be able to pull each other

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.380 
they would be able to pull each other
that's<00:02:19.440> how<00:02:19.620> strong<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.580> magnets<00:02:21.000> are<00:02:21.210> in

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
that's how strong the magnets are in

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.090 
that's how strong the magnets are in
here<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:21.780> they're<00:02:21.930> terrific<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:22.920> way

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
here so they're terrific to do that way

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.790 
here so they're terrific to do that way
this<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.180> great<00:02:24.510> because<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.380> our<00:02:25.680> sphere

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
this is great because this is our sphere

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.100 
this is great because this is our sphere
and<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.730> call<00:02:26.880> them<00:02:26.970> tricks<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.630> kids<00:02:27.810> love

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
and we call them tricks the kids love

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.780 
and we call them tricks the kids love
this<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.740> then<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.950> see<00:02:28.980> how<00:02:29.310> easy<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
this and then you see how easy this

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.240 
this and then you see how easy this
comes<00:02:30.120> together<00:02:30.300> again<00:02:31.110> just<00:02:31.860> putting<00:02:32.160> it

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
comes together again just putting it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.370 
comes together again just putting it
from<00:02:32.430> one<00:02:32.640> dimension<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.900> lifting<00:02:34.290> it

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
from one dimension and just lifting it

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.100 
from one dimension and just lifting it
up<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> center<00:02:35.040> just<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.810> it

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
up in the center just like that and it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.480 
up in the center just like that and it
comes<00:02:37.320> together<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:37.860> makes<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.160> sphere

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
comes together and it makes a sphere

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.850 
comes together and it makes a sphere
just<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:39.660> easy<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.200> look<00:02:40.590> at<00:02:40.680> this

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
just like that so easy and look at this

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.140 
just like that so easy and look at this
I<00:02:41.070> don't<00:02:41.220> even<00:02:41.340> need<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.580> worry<00:02:41.760> about<00:02:41.880> real

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
I don't even need to worry about real

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.110 
I don't even need to worry about real
soft<00:02:42.390> hands<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:43.110> really<00:02:43.620> strong<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.580> again

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
soft hands it's really strong and again

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.470 
soft hands it's really strong and again
here's<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:45.990> wheels<00:02:46.790> I'll<00:02:47.790> get<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.150> there<00:02:48.330> and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
here's the wheels I'll get on there and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.050 
here's the wheels I'll get on there and
I<00:02:48.690> like<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.080> because<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.370> size<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
I like it because the the size of the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.880 
I like it because the the size of the
pieces<00:02:51.330> even<00:02:52.170> though<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.560> recommended

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
pieces even though this is recommended

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.160 
pieces even though this is recommended
for<00:02:53.160> ages<00:02:53.400> 6<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:53.940> up<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.750> younger<00:02:55.140> ones

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
for ages 6 and up for the younger ones

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.600 
for ages 6 and up for the younger ones
cuz<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.920> know<00:02:56.040> they're<00:02:56.160> always<00:02:56.280> trying<00:02:56.520> to

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
cuz you know they're always trying to

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.730 
cuz you know they're always trying to
play<00:02:56.760> with<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.970> older<00:02:57.600> siblings<00:02:57.990> toys<00:02:58.260> sure

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
play with the older siblings toys sure

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.380 
play with the older siblings toys sure
the<00:02:58.950> pieces<00:02:59.190> are<00:02:59.490> big<00:02:59.670> enough<00:02:59.910> they're<00:03:00.210> not

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
the pieces are big enough they're not

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.420 
the pieces are big enough they're not
going<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> get<00:03:01.020> first<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.470> all<00:03:01.590> lost<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.370> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
going to get first of all lost and a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.400 
going to get first of all lost and a
seat<00:03:02.640> cushions<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.390> mean<00:03:03.720> unless<00:03:03.900> they<00:03:04.050> Jam<00:03:04.230> em

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
seat cushions I mean unless they Jam em

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.260 
seat cushions I mean unless they Jam em
in<00:03:04.560> there<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.010> there<00:03:05.370> there's<00:03:05.670> just<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:06.000> lot

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
in there and there there's just a lot

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.790 
in there and there there's just a lot
easier<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.780> put<00:03:06.930> together<00:03:07.020> because<00:03:07.470> I've<00:03:07.590> seen

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
easier to put together because I've seen

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.220 
easier to put together because I've seen
so<00:03:08.070> much<00:03:08.250> frustration<00:03:08.600> from<00:03:09.600> my<00:03:09.720> kids<00:03:10.020> when

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
so much frustration from my kids when

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.670 
so much frustration from my kids when
they<00:03:10.260> use<00:03:10.530> traditional<00:03:10.880> building<00:03:11.880> block<00:03:12.090> sets

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
they use traditional building block sets

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.740 
they use traditional building block sets
that<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.860> end<00:03:14.040> up<00:03:14.160> building<00:03:14.850> more<00:03:15.210> for<00:03:15.510> them

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
that we end up building more for them

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.090 
that we end up building more for them
than<00:03:15.890> them<00:03:16.890> doing<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.340> work<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.959> it's<00:03:19.860> all

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
than them doing the work and it's all

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.720 
than them doing the work and it's all
about<00:03:20.400> wanting<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.790> kind<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.450> get<00:03:22.320> and

motivate them to be creative and to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.310 
motivate them to be creative and to
spark<00:03:25.860> their<00:03:26.130> ingenuity<00:03:26.810> really<00:03:27.810> have<00:03:27.989> them

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
spark their ingenuity really have them

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.930 
spark their ingenuity really have them
involved<00:03:28.620> instead<00:03:29.070> of<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.310> being<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.640> spectator

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
involved instead of it being a spectator

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.490 
involved instead of it being a spectator
sport<00:03:30.630> let's<00:03:30.810> gonna<00:03:30.930> see<00:03:31.080> if<00:03:31.140> they're<00:03:31.260> really

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
sport let's gonna see if they're really

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.540 
sport let's gonna see if they're really
gonna<00:03:31.709> get<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.040> here<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.310> they're<00:03:32.430> gonna

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
gonna get in here and they're gonna

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.949 
gonna get in here and they're gonna
become<00:03:32.910> little<00:03:33.150> engineers<00:03:33.660> they're<00:03:33.840> gonna

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
become little engineers they're gonna

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.690 
become little engineers they're gonna
understand<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:35.070> what<00:03:35.250> they're<00:03:35.430> building

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
understand that what they're building

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.790 
understand that what they're building
actually<00:03:36.390> won't<00:03:36.540> come<00:03:36.810> down<00:03:37.020> will<00:03:37.290> fall<00:03:37.560> down

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
actually won't come down will fall down

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.100 
actually won't come down will fall down
or<00:03:38.400> will<00:03:38.700> stay<00:03:38.940> up<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.180> base<00:03:39.720> on<00:03:39.930> its

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
or will stay up just base on its

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.050 
or will stay up just base on its
strengths<00:03:40.560> just<00:03:40.950> like<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.370> here's<00:03:41.910> the

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
strengths just like that here's the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.340 
strengths just like that here's the
other<00:03:42.150> side<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:42.750> watch<00:03:43.050> this<00:03:43.200> we're

right here it's just on there we're
gonna<00:04:24.720> do<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.020> sphere<00:04:25.350> that<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:25.560> just<00:04:25.770> made

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
gonna do the sphere that we just made

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.710 
gonna do the sphere that we just made
this<00:04:26.220> simple<00:04:26.490> together<00:04:27.060> so

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
this simple together so

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.480 
this simple together so
put<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.080> together<00:04:28.290> like<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.710> we're<00:04:29.430> gonna

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
put this together like that we're gonna

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.300 
put this together like that we're gonna
put<00:04:29.760> three<00:04:30.090> over<00:04:30.480> here<00:04:30.680> three<00:04:31.680> over<00:04:31.980> here

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
put three over here three over here

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.610 
put three over here three over here
again<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.120> instructions<00:04:33.630> tell<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:33.990> how<00:04:34.260> many

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
again the instructions tell you how many

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.370 
again the instructions tell you how many
that<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:35.100> need<00:04:35.370> one<00:04:36.360> in<00:04:36.480> each<00:04:36.660> corner<00:04:37.020> I'm

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
that you need one in each corner I'm

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.250 
that you need one in each corner I'm
gonna<00:04:37.500> add<00:04:37.740> triangles<00:04:38.610> look<00:04:39.150> at<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.960> so

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
gonna add triangles look at this and so

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.660 
gonna add triangles look at this and so
it'll<00:04:40.380> tap<00:04:40.650> them<00:04:40.890> out<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.220> tell<00:04:41.340> them<00:04:41.520> how

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
it'll tap them out and tell them how

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.120 
it'll tap them out and tell them how
many<00:04:41.910> they<00:04:42.090> need<00:04:42.270> of<00:04:42.390> each<00:04:42.570> one<00:04:43.040> putting<00:04:44.040> this

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
many they need of each one putting this
