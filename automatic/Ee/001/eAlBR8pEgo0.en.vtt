cars if you guys are going to slamming

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.560 
cars if you guys are going to slamming
your<00:00:10.200> cars<00:00:10.559> it's<00:00:11.219> basically<00:00:11.700> putting<00:00:12.059> an<00:00:12.360> air

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
your cars it's basically putting an air

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.799 
your cars it's basically putting an air
suspension<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.440> negative<00:00:14.340> cambering<00:00:15.179> your

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
suspension and negative cambering your

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.670 
suspension and negative cambering your
car<00:00:16.139> negative<00:00:17.039> cambering<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.730> when<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:19.140> put

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
car negative cambering is when you put

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.599 
car negative cambering is when you put
the<00:00:19.859> camber<00:00:20.400> which<00:00:20.910> basically<00:00:22.310> defines<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
the camber which basically defines the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.099 
the camber which basically defines the
position<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> rim<00:00:24.420> when<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.689> put<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:24.990> to

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
position of the rim when you put it to

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.990 
position of the rim when you put it to
the<00:00:25.199> negative<00:00:25.590> or<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.369> twist<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> left

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the negative or you twist it to the left

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.439 
the negative or you twist it to the left
and<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:28.410> justice<00:00:28.769> spring<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.970> makes<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
and the justice spring and it makes it

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.560 
and the justice spring and it makes it
look<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.650> like<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> froggy<00:00:32.309> wheels<00:00:32.669> so

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
look like for like a froggy wheels so

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.020 
look like for like a froggy wheels so
it's<00:00:33.960> cambered<00:00:34.559> negatively<00:00:35.340> see<00:00:35.850> they're

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
it's cambered negatively see they're

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.360 
it's cambered negatively see they're
like<00:00:36.180> tilted<00:00:36.559> when<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:37.829> their<00:00:37.980> negative

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
like tilted when when their negative

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.650 
like tilted when when their negative
camber<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.480> bottom<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.440> bottom<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.660> rim

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
camber the bottom the bottom of the rim

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.310 
camber the bottom the bottom of the rim
is<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.070> outside<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.480> top<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
is to the outside and the top is to the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.529 
is to the outside and the top is to the
inside<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.450> negative<00:00:49.230> camber<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.539> also

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
inside so it's negative camber and also

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.689 
inside so it's negative camber and also
this<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.440> has<00:00:52.469> an<00:00:52.710> air<00:00:52.920> suspension<00:00:53.129> or

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
this one has an air suspension or

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.619 
this one has an air suspension or
airbags<00:00:54.539> which<00:00:55.260> basically<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:56.390> drops<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
airbags which basically just drops the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
airbags which basically just drops the
car<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.109> way<00:00:58.260> down<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.489> see

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
car all the way down and you can see

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.360 
car all the way down and you can see
like<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.960> side<00:01:01.230> skirt<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:01.949> literally

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
like the side skirt it's like literally

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.859 
like the side skirt it's like literally
inside<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.570> map<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.970> slammed<00:01:06.450> all

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
inside the map so it's like slammed all

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.660 
inside the map so it's like slammed all
the<00:01:07.049> way<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.710> I'm<00:01:07.799> gonna<00:01:07.890> show<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> guys<00:01:08.189> how
