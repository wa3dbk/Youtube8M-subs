00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
passenger peg well I knew I didn't have

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.580 
passenger peg well I knew I didn't have
to<00:01:52.500> remove<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.180> but<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.360> did<00:01:54.600> remove<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.259> on

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770 
the stock one and then after I got it up
I<00:01:59.159> realized<00:01:59.340> what<00:02:00.119> don't<00:02:00.270> mind<00:02:00.450> taking<00:02:00.600> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
I realized what don't mind taking that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.149 
I realized what don't mind taking that
off<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> there's<00:02:01.530> no<00:02:01.710> need<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.950> even

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
off for it there's no need to even

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.789

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.310 
brake pedal when it's actually on the
bike<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.090> recommend<00:04:30.450> putting<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.110> on

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
bike so I recommend putting that on

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.170 
bike so I recommend putting that on
before<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.480> can<00:04:33.690> be<00:04:33.810> done<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.910> that's<00:04:35.910> the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
before but it can be done and that's the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.810 
before but it can be done and that's the
way<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.360> would<00:04:36.720> do<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.430> next<00:04:38.430> thing<00:04:38.610> I'm

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
way I would do it and next thing I'm

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.940 
way I would do it and next thing I'm
