00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.170

 your family to your own health 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.110
 it is the opium to present what God gave you the resemblance of the garden that was given 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.800
 to take 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.550
 and because many people are 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.110
 losing everything 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.869
 I usually say the following 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.700
 your life 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.079

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.699
 You know why it's lost. 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.709

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.629
 Why did she make it worse? 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:49.759
 preferred 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.630

 Why are you putting your eyes on what is forbidden? 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.200
 because you stop tapping in place 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.059
 where 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.309
 should not have stopped 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.770
 think of it there is no way to raise 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.540
 who made the wrong choice 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.090

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.430
