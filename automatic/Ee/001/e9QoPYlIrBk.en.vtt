00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
right there and this is one of the best

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.260 
right there and this is one of the best
systems<00:00:47.100> ever<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> lot<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.760> people<00:00:47.969> consider

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270

this<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.629> best<00:00:48.809> handheld<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.350> all<00:00:49.469> time<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
this the best handheld of all time I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.160 
this the best handheld of all time I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
think it's the Game Boy SP but this

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
think it's the Game Boy SP but this
might<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> best<00:00:52.770> DS<00:00:53.070> because<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.730> so

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
might be the best DS because it's so

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.580 
might be the best DS because it's so
tiny<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.449> perfect<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.110> pocket<00:00:55.500> and
