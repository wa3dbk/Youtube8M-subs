 You know since yesterday evening you could 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.119
 Operation whiteout on the servers 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.039
 play attracts the service community 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.320
 testament and there can each of the one 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.439

 Download the little one again 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.150

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.130
 to gamble, so to speak 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.829
 the servers are very busy right now 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.660
 clear, of course, logically and one 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.920
 as I said before in the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.270
 moment just yet operation whiteout 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.610
 gamble and then tonight 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.170
 hopefully again the next map 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.000
 the dlc around that a bit 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.680
 to test a bit to give feedback 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 If you're a bitch you just look at who 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.539
 Of course you can also play 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.399
 play along 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.110
 I hope that we have enough there too 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.370
 their servers will otherwise meet if we 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.649
 Then we come up with an alternative 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.239
 let and tonight will be the first 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.710
 even a kind of fixed schedule 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.420
 that means we will say then 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.699
 for example, that's just how 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.979
 said as an example of 19 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.710
 to 21:00 we will we will 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.010
 battlefield 4 are already playing around us 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.810
 give an overview and 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.100
 was playing, for example, from 21:00 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.689
 then the next game has something in it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.740
 Next vote then just come out 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.600
 only that you ever have such a rough one 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.580
 imagination of it has like the whole 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.990
 running like long stream does not hang around 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.490
 from how long you want to have 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.650
 but we will probably be up 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.759
 be at 22 o'clock 30 am start unless 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.020
 it happen again any 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.270
 strange things then it can be earlier 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.659
 but if so preferably 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.460
 from 18 to 22 o'clock 30 full throttle and 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.380
 just keep playing 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.400
 if you still like gravel 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.920

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.270
 and I can do that right again 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.009
 That's why I am so at the moment 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.240
 a bit careful what the whole 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.070
