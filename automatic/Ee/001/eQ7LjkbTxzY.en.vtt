all the load is in good with that I have
covered<00:01:19.430> everything<00:01:19.640> above<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.150> water<00:01:20.330> line

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.100 
covered everything above the water line
she's<00:01:22.850> gonna<00:01:22.970> make<00:01:23.180> my<00:01:23.300> way<00:01:23.450> back<00:01:23.480> over<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:24.050> a

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
water access hatch then we'll get a look

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.200 
water access hatch then we'll get a look

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
at our water exits ladder as you can see

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.530 
at our water exits ladder as you can see
it<00:01:32.330> does<00:01:32.540> have<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:32.780> cage<00:01:33.050> completely<00:01:33.620> around<00:01:33.860> it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
it does have a cage completely around it

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.940 
it does have a cage completely around it
and<00:01:35.540> we<00:01:35.750> did<00:01:35.870> some<00:01:35.900> chipping<00:01:36.410> off<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.740> flaking

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
and we did some chipping off and flaking

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.210 
and we did some chipping off and flaking
off<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.370> protective<00:01:37.490> coating<00:01:37.940> in<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.270> metal

off the protective coating in a metal

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.460 
off the protective coating in a metal
for<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.250> cage

for the cage

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.980 
for the cage
but<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.560> didn't<00:01:43.830> have<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.450> some<00:01:45.450> decent<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
but we didn't have a some decent and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.100 
but we didn't have a some decent and
good<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.260> I<00:01:46.350> don't<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:46.620> it<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:46.800> well<00:01:48.110> within

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
good and I don't want it as well within

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.050 
good and I don't want it as well within
our<00:01:49.320> ladder<00:01:49.650> itself<00:01:50.160> it's<00:01:50.370> in<00:01:50.550> fair<00:01:50.850> condition

our ladder itself it's in fair condition

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.890 
our ladder itself it's in fair condition
just<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.810> page<00:01:53.450> chipping<00:01:54.450> off<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
just like the page chipping off and

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.730 
just like the page chipping off and
peeling<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:56.660> corrosion<00:01:57.660> at<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.900> wrongs<00:01:58.470> where

probably<00:02:05.160> about<00:02:05.310> now<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:05.820> ahead<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.060> follow

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
probably about now go ahead and follow

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.780 
probably about now go ahead and follow
this<00:02:06.600> peg<00:02:06.870> down<00:02:07.110> looking<00:02:08.100> at<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> outside<00:02:08.340> of

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
this peg down looking at the outside of

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.420 
this peg down looking at the outside of
our<00:02:08.880> ladder<00:02:09.090> here<00:02:09.710> and<00:02:10.710> you<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.920> see<00:02:11.100> we<00:02:11.250> make

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
our ladder here and you can see we make

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.060 
our ladder here and you can see we make
our<00:02:11.580> descent<00:02:12.080> yeah<00:02:13.080> ladder<00:02:13.440> teams<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.830> get<00:02:13.980> in

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
our descent yeah ladder teams to get in

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.250 
our descent yeah ladder teams to get in
better<00:02:14.250> shape<00:02:14.370> she's<00:02:14.940> mostly<00:02:15.660> occurring<00:02:16.110> up

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
better shape she's mostly occurring up

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.840 
better shape she's mostly occurring up
