different footer variation of sort of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.460 
different footer variation of sort of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
free formation in a way but in the end

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
free formation in a way but in the end
you've<00:01:16.590> not<00:01:16.770> gone<00:01:16.890> deep<00:01:17.340> blind<00:01:17.610> payment

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
advance forward in my opinion because

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.070 
advance forward in my opinion because
Chelsea<00:05:38.520> required<00:05:39.030> airstrikes<00:05:39.420> to<00:05:39.600> work<00:05:39.780> and

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 
quite explanatory obviously they like to

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.570 
quite explanatory obviously they like to
play<00:07:06.740> through<00:07:06.980> the<00:07:07.070> middle<00:07:07.280> like<00:07:07.400> already

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
play through the middle like already

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.270

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
said and that's pretty much it the

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.490 
said and that's pretty much it the
playmaker<00:07:10.670> is<00:07:10.970> gonna<00:07:11.150> be<00:07:11.300> matter<00:07:11.960> because

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
playmaker is gonna be matter because

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.750 
playmaker is gonna be matter because
he's<00:07:12.590> behind<00:07:12.830> the<00:07:13.010> strike<00:07:13.220> he's<00:07:13.490> gonna<00:07:13.580> get

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:13.760 
he's behind the strike he's gonna get

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.340

hopefully<00:07:15.710> toys<00:07:15.950> can<00:07:16.130> do<00:07:16.280> something<00:07:16.700> you

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
hopefully toys can do something you

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.400 
hopefully toys can do something you
can't<00:07:17.300> play<00:07:17.420> a<00:07:17.450> target<00:07:17.840> manner<00:07:17.990> torres<00:07:18.380> by

don't really use the target man so it's

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.330

working there for two three one
formation<00:07:25.300> that's<00:07:26.300> pretty<00:07:26.630> much

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690 
formation that's pretty much

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.820 
formation that's pretty much
self-explanatory<00:07:27.020> because<00:07:27.680> obviously

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830 
self-explanatory because obviously

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.070 
self-explanatory because obviously
Chelsea<00:07:28.610> are<00:07:28.820> quite<00:07:29.120> complex<00:07:29.510> team<00:07:29.780> in<00:07:29.960> real

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
Chelsea are quite complex team in real

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.900 
Chelsea are quite complex team in real
life<00:07:30.230> to<00:07:30.350> understand<00:07:30.800> but<00:07:31.370> this<00:07:31.460> is<00:07:31.580> how<00:07:31.730> they

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:31.910 
life to understand but this is how they

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.790 
life to understand but this is how they
work<00:07:32.060> in<00:07:32.210> a<00:07:32.270> nutshell<00:07:32.480> I<00:07:32.930> don't<00:07:33.470> really<00:07:33.650> like

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 
work in a nutshell I don't really like

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.260 
work in a nutshell I don't really like
this<00:07:33.920> wave<00:07:34.160> playing<00:07:34.520> on<00:07:34.670> four<00:07:34.850> major<00:07:35.030> in

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
this wave playing on four major in

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.430 
this wave playing on four major in
particular<00:07:35.510> because<00:07:35.900> it<00:07:36.020> doesn't<00:07:36.290> really

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 
particular because it doesn't really

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.480 
particular because it doesn't really
work<00:07:36.680> because<00:07:36.950> you're<00:07:37.070> not<00:07:37.130> gonna<00:07:37.250> have<00:07:37.460> the

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.490 
work because you're not gonna have the

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.000 
work because you're not gonna have the
wingers<00:07:37.880> especially<00:07:38.600> for<00:07:38.750> much<00:07:38.870> of<00:07:38.960> 2013<00:07:39.770> it's

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.010 
wingers especially for much of 2013 it's

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.470 
wingers especially for much of 2013 it's
been<00:07:40.190> more<00:07:40.370> prevailed<00:07:40.730> that<00:07:40.940> you<00:07:41.030> have<00:07:41.210> two

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:41.480 
been more prevailed that you have two

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.660 
been more prevailed that you have two
wingers<00:07:41.780> go<00:07:42.650> to<00:07:42.710> the<00:07:42.860> byline<00:07:43.160> cross<00:07:43.400> the<00:07:43.550> ball

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:43.670 
wingers go to the byline cross the ball

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.980 
wingers go to the byline cross the ball
in<00:07:43.790> and<00:07:43.970> then<00:07:44.060> you<00:07:44.150> scored<00:07:44.450> a<00:07:44.510> goal<00:07:44.660> that's

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:44.990 
in and then you scored a goal that's

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.480 
in and then you scored a goal that's
literally<00:07:45.350> how<00:07:45.410> it<00:07:45.590> works<00:07:45.770> in<00:07:45.950> full<00:07:46.070> merger

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.490
