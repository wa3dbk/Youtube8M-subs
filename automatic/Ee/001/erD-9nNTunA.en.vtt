so<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:14.580> microphone<00:02:15.330> works<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> very

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
so that this microphone works is a very

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.690 
so that this microphone works is a very
good<00:02:16.020> alternative<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.770> scent<00:02:16.980> I'll<00:02:17.130> send

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
good alternative to the scent I'll send

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.580 
good alternative to the scent I'll send
Heiser<00:02:17.850> because<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> Sennheiser<00:02:19.080> needs<00:02:19.350> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
Heiser because the Sennheiser needs a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.570 
Heiser because the Sennheiser needs a
little<00:02:20.330> watch<00:02:21.330> battery<00:02:21.890> where<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.130> you

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
little watch battery where is this you

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.340 
little watch battery where is this you
can<00:02:23.760> just<00:02:23.940> powered<00:02:24.600> through<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.930> wire<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.320> you

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
can just powered through the wire so you

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.900 
can just powered through the wire so you
don't<00:02:25.530> have<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.770> bother<00:02:26.370> with<00:02:26.490> having<00:02:26.790> any

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
don't have to bother with having any

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.760 
don't have to bother with having any
extra<00:02:27.060> batteries<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.410> also<00:02:28.560> has<00:02:28.710> a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
extra batteries and it also has a

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.470 
extra batteries and it also has a
shorter<00:02:29.100> wire<00:02:29.280> which<00:02:29.490> may<00:02:29.760> seem<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:30.180> a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
shorter wire which may seem like a

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.660 
shorter wire which may seem like a
disadvantage<00:02:31.350> but<00:02:31.560> actually<00:02:31.860> it's<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.460> big

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
disadvantage but actually it's a big

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.460 
disadvantage but actually it's a big
advantage<00:02:33.180> because<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.750> why<00:02:33.870> they<00:02:34.020> use<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
advantage because of why they use on the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.010 
advantage because of why they use on the
Sennheiser<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.210> basically<00:02:36.210> it's<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.930> a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
Sennheiser is basically it's a it's a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.930 
Sennheiser is basically it's a it's a
low<00:02:37.170> quality<00:02:37.410> while<00:02:37.770> which<00:02:38.010> means<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.430> that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
low quality while which means it that

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.140 
low quality while which means it that
you'll<00:02:39.780> get<00:02:39.960> noise<00:02:40.340> as<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.580> travels<00:02:41.970> down<00:02:42.120> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
you'll get noise as it travels down the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.360 
you'll get noise as it travels down the
wire<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.870> basically<00:02:43.290> will<00:02:43.590> reduce<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
wire so it's basically will reduce the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.100 
wire so it's basically will reduce the
quality<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:46.140> microphone<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:48.270> comes<00:02:49.080> with

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
quality of the microphone so comes with

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.840 
quality of the microphone so comes with
a<00:02:49.230> short<00:02:49.470> cable<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.070> then<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.310> course<00:02:50.340> if<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
a short cable but then of course if you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.420 
a short cable but then of course if you
spend<00:02:51.210> about<00:02:51.960> 10<00:02:52.200> pounds<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.680> get<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:53.040> nice

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
spend about 10 pounds you can get a nice

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.000 
spend about 10 pounds you can get a nice
quality<00:02:53.700> extension<00:02:54.420> lead<00:02:55.110> which<00:02:55.350> will<00:02:55.380> not

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
quality extension lead which will not

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.480 
quality extension lead which will not
add<00:02:56.220> noise<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.650> sound<00:02:58.650> um<00:02:59.430> so<00:03:00.650> that's<00:03:01.650> kind

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
add noise to the sound um so that's kind

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.290 
add noise to the sound um so that's kind
of<00:03:02.550> most<00:03:03.480> avoids<00:03:03.900> what<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.710> really<00:03:04.950> um<00:03:05.300> and

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
of most avoids what it is really um and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.090 
of most avoids what it is really um and
I<00:03:06.390> just<00:03:06.510> want<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.720> take<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> quick<00:03:07.620> moment<00:03:07.830> to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
I just want to take a quick moment to

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.800 
I just want to take a quick moment to
compare<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:10.200> sound<00:03:11.070> quality<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.810> my

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
compare it to the sound quality of my

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.150 
compare it to the sound quality of my
Civic<00:03:13.610> rode<00:03:14.690> videomic<00:03:15.690> which<00:03:16.620> I'm<00:03:16.890> using

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
Civic rode videomic which I'm using

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.370 
Civic rode videomic which I'm using
right<00:03:17.580> now<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.850> I've<00:03:17.970> been<00:03:18.000> using<00:03:18.239> for<00:03:18.570> a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
right now and I've been using for a

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.650 
right now and I've been using for a
while<00:03:19.830> okay<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:20.640> I've<00:03:20.880> now<00:03:21.030> switched<00:03:21.330> over<00:03:21.540> to

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
while okay so I've now switched over to

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.350 
while okay so I've now switched over to
the<00:03:21.959> lapel<00:03:22.410> mic<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.890> can<00:03:23.070> see<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.430> I've<00:03:23.580> got

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
the lapel mic you can see that I've got

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.190 
the lapel mic you can see that I've got
it<00:03:24.480> running<00:03:25.050> into<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.560> zoom<00:03:25.739> h1<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.959> is

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
it running into the zoom h1 and this is

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.110 
it running into the zoom h1 and this is
a<00:03:28.230> pretty<00:03:28.500> good<00:03:28.709> setup<00:03:28.920> in<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.580> same<00:03:29.760> way<00:03:29.970> that

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
a pretty good setup in the same way that

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.060 
a pretty good setup in the same way that
I<00:03:30.180> rode<00:03:30.420> mic<00:03:30.840> into<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> zoom<00:03:31.500> h1<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.920> pretty

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
I rode mic into a zoom h1 is a pretty

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.820 
I rode mic into a zoom h1 is a pretty
good<00:03:32.220> setup<00:03:32.750> because<00:03:33.750> like<00:03:34.350> anything<00:03:34.620> with

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
good setup because like anything with

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.949 
good setup because like anything with
audio<00:03:35.130> if<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.760> can<00:03:35.880> get<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> good<00:03:36.270> quality

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
audio if you can get a good quality

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.199 
audio if you can get a good quality
recorder<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.739> get<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.489> microphone<00:03:38.850> nice<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
recorder and get the microphone nice and

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.729 
recorder and get the microphone nice and
close<00:03:39.390> then<00:03:40.050> you're<00:03:40.170> going<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.320> get<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.530> pretty

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
close then you're going to get a pretty

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.620 
close then you're going to get a pretty
clean<00:03:41.130> audio<00:03:41.910> track<00:03:42.830> so<00:03:43.830> yeah<00:03:44.390> I'm<00:03:45.390> going<00:03:45.570> to

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
clean audio track so yeah I'm going to

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.970 
clean audio track so yeah I'm going to
let<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.810> decide<00:03:46.080> for<00:03:46.140> yourself<00:03:46.290> whether<00:03:46.860> you

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
let you decide for yourself whether you

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.979 
let you decide for yourself whether you
think<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:47.250> quality<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.970> good<00:03:48.390> whether<00:03:48.900> it's

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
think this quality is good whether it's

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.890 
think this quality is good whether it's
better<00:03:49.230> or<00:03:49.380> worse<00:03:49.530> than<00:03:49.709> them<00:03:49.880> rode<00:03:50.880> mic<00:03:51.180> now<00:03:51.870> I

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
better or worse than them rode mic now I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.540 
better or worse than them rode mic now I
think<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.410> quality<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:52.980> better<00:03:53.250> than<00:03:53.400> the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
think the quality is better than the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.000 
think the quality is better than the
rode<00:03:54.090> microphone<00:03:54.570> but<00:03:55.350> that<00:03:55.620> does<00:03:55.769> make<00:03:55.950> sense

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
rode microphone but that does make sense

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.460 
rode microphone but that does make sense
since<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.700> road<00:03:56.850> might<00:03:57.060> costs<00:03:57.480> 70<00:03:58.110> pounds<00:03:58.410> and

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
since the road might costs 70 pounds and

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.650 
since the road might costs 70 pounds and
this<00:03:58.590> costs<00:03:59.040> 40<00:03:59.640> pounds<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.300> it's<00:04:00.450> kind<00:04:00.600> of

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
this costs 40 pounds and it's kind of

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.170 
this costs 40 pounds and it's kind of
worth<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:01.019> because<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.290> do<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:02.970> lot

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
worth it because you do it this is a lot

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.509 
worth it because you do it this is a lot
more<00:04:03.209> versatile<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.890> don't<00:04:05.100> have<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.340> set<00:04:05.489> up

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
more versatile you don't have to set up

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.040 
more versatile you don't have to set up
a<00:04:05.670> boom<00:04:05.820> pole<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.600> don't<00:04:06.750> have<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.930> have

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
a boom pole you don't have to have

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.720 
a boom pole you don't have to have
someone<00:04:07.230> standing<00:04:07.739> there<00:04:07.769> we<00:04:08.340> don't<00:04:08.519> have<00:04:08.610> to

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
someone standing there we don't have to

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.120 
someone standing there we don't have to
put<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:10.470> know<00:04:10.500> standing<00:04:10.890> there<00:04:11.040> holding

it and you have to put it on a mic stand

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.110 
it and you have to put it on a mic stand
or<00:04:12.870> anything<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.560> just<00:04:13.760> will<00:04:14.760> clip<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.060> your

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
go so that's um yes I'm now going to do

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.029 
go so that's um yes I'm now going to do
a<00:04:20.580> comparison<00:04:21.180> between<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.620> two<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.919> them

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
a comparison between the two of them

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.850 
a comparison between the two of them
this<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.760> an<00:04:23.850> audio<00:04:24.120> test<00:04:24.419> using<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.350> as<00:04:25.530> den

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
this is an audio test using the as den

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.520 
this is an audio test using the as den
ax<00:04:26.280> 503

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
ax 503

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.959 
ax 503
this<00:04:28.530> is<00:04:28.710> an<00:04:28.770> audio<00:04:29.009> test<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.819> rode

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:29.969 
this is an audio test of the rode

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.170 
this is an audio test of the rode
videomic<00:04:31.280> so<00:04:32.280> yeah<00:04:32.400> have<00:04:32.699> a<00:04:32.729> listen<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.060> that

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
videomic so yeah have a listen to that

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.200 
videomic so yeah have a listen to that
to<00:04:34.110> those<00:04:34.229> two<00:04:34.500> clips<00:04:34.979> moving<00:04:35.759> a<00:04:35.819> go<00:04:35.939> and

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
to those two clips moving a go and

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.939 
to those two clips moving a go and
replay<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:36.840> making<00:04:37.199> sure<00:04:37.319> you're<00:04:37.740> listening

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
replay it making sure you're listening

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.570 
replay it making sure you're listening
of<00:04:38.189> headphones<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.669> really<00:04:38.969> get<00:04:39.659> an<00:04:39.750> idea<00:04:39.810> of

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
of headphones to really get an idea of

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.939 
of headphones to really get an idea of
you<00:04:41.580> know<00:04:41.669> which<00:04:41.849> one<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.240> prefer

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
you know which one you prefer

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.929 
you know which one you prefer
but<00:04:43.949> yeah<00:04:44.069> so<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.830> think<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:47.009> quality<00:04:47.639> of<00:04:47.729> the

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:47.939 
but yeah so I think the quality of the

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.140 
but yeah so I think the quality of the
road<00:04:48.569> is<00:04:48.810> better<00:04:49.770> but<00:04:50.490> that's<00:04:50.639> that's

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
road is better but that's that's

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.550 
road is better but that's that's
understandable<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.930> know<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.169> is<00:04:52.289> a<00:04:52.319> more

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
understandable you know it is a more

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.219 
understandable you know it is a more
expensive<00:04:52.710> mic<00:04:53.159> and<00:04:53.780> with<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:54.900> being<00:04:54.930> a

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
expensive mic and with it being a

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.219 
expensive mic and with it being a
shotgun<00:04:56.009> microphone<00:04:56.990> opposed<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.110> this

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
shotgun microphone opposed to this

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.170 
shotgun microphone opposed to this
omnidirectional<00:04:58.590> microphone<00:04:59.430> it<00:04:59.849> is<00:05:00.060> going

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
omnidirectional microphone it is going

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.839 
omnidirectional microphone it is going
to<00:05:00.270> pick<00:05:00.419> up<00:05:00.539> less<00:05:00.750> background<00:05:01.080> noise<00:05:01.849> Aldon

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
to pick up less background noise Aldon

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.629 
to pick up less background noise Aldon
but<00:05:03.689> the<00:05:04.469> good<00:05:04.800> thing<00:05:04.830> about<00:05:05.009> this<00:05:05.310> one<00:05:05.490> is<00:05:05.610> you

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
but the good thing about this one is you

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.420 
but the good thing about this one is you
do<00:05:05.879> get<00:05:06.029> that<00:05:06.240> versatility<00:05:07.279> you<00:05:08.279> know<00:05:08.370> you

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
do get that versatility you know you

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.709 
do get that versatility you know you
don't<00:05:08.639> have<00:05:08.819> to<00:05:08.939> have<00:05:09.029> someone<00:05:09.360> standing

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
don't have to have someone standing

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.019 
don't have to have someone standing
there<00:05:09.779> with<00:05:10.469> a<00:05:10.500> boom<00:05:10.740> pole<00:05:10.979> so<00:05:11.819> you<00:05:11.879> have<00:05:11.969> the

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:12.029 
there with a boom pole so you have the

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:13.719 
there with a boom pole so you have the
things<00:05:12.180> that<00:05:12.240> this<00:05:12.360> would<00:05:12.509> work<00:05:12.629> well<00:05:12.870> for<00:05:12.900> is

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
things that this would work well for is

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.290 
things that this would work well for is
weddings<00:05:14.729> would<00:05:14.879> work<00:05:15.029> pretty<00:05:15.180> nicely

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
weddings would work pretty nicely

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.390 
weddings would work pretty nicely
because<00:05:16.169> you<00:05:16.620> know<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:16.770> know<00:05:16.949> you<00:05:17.099> don't<00:05:17.189> have

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
because you know you know you don't have

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.309 
because you know you know you don't have
a<00:05:17.460> boom<00:05:17.639> pole<00:05:17.819> set<00:05:18.029> up<00:05:18.120> there<00:05:18.330> but<00:05:18.930> this<00:05:19.169> would

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
a boom pole set up there but this would

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.469 
a boom pole set up there but this would
capture<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.849> speaking<00:05:20.849> parts<00:05:21.090> pretty<00:05:21.300> well

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
capture the speaking parts pretty well

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.409 
capture the speaking parts pretty well
it'll<00:05:22.289> also<00:05:22.439> work<00:05:22.560> if<00:05:23.009> you're<00:05:23.699> trying<00:05:24.029> to<00:05:24.090> do<00:05:24.240> a

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
it'll also work if you're trying to do a

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.899 
it'll also work if you're trying to do a
wide<00:05:25.169> shot<00:05:25.199> and<00:05:25.439> a<00:05:25.560> short<00:05:25.800> film<00:05:26.009> and<00:05:26.159> again

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
wide shot and a short film and again

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.749 
wide shot and a short film and again
shots<00:05:27.539> so<00:05:27.719> wide<00:05:27.930> that<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:28.460> you'll<00:05:29.460> be<00:05:29.580> able<00:05:29.639> to

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
shots so wide that you you'll be able to

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.089 
shots so wide that you you'll be able to
see<00:05:29.909> the<00:05:30.090> boom<00:05:30.599> operator<00:05:30.810> so<00:05:31.589> again<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:31.949> can

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
see the boom operator so again you can

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.519 
see the boom operator so again you can
probably<00:05:32.310> consider<00:05:32.909> one<00:05:33.060> of<00:05:33.089> these

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 
probably consider one of these

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.350 
probably consider one of these
reasonably<00:05:34.529> easily<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:35.039> then<00:05:36.029> the<00:05:36.240> other

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
reasonably easily and then the other

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.180 
reasonably easily and then the other
reason<00:05:36.569> is<00:05:36.839> if<00:05:36.990> you're<00:05:37.199> doing<00:05:37.949> something

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
reason is if you're doing something

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.279 
reason is if you're doing something
where<00:05:38.339> you're<00:05:38.460> moving<00:05:38.580> around<00:05:38.849> a<00:05:39.060> lot<00:05:39.289> you

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
where you're moving around a lot you

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.529 
where you're moving around a lot you
know<00:05:40.860> it<00:05:41.099> may<00:05:41.250> make<00:05:41.490> probably<00:05:42.270> make<00:05:42.360> more

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
know it may make probably make more

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.499 
know it may make probably make more
sense<00:05:42.750> to<00:05:42.870> use<00:05:43.169> a<00:05:43.520> lavalier<00:05:44.520> microphone<00:05:44.969> as

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
sense to use a lavalier microphone as

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.420 
sense to use a lavalier microphone as
opposed<00:05:45.990> to<00:05:46.050> having<00:05:46.229> someone<00:05:46.529> chasing<00:05:47.400> you

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
opposed to having someone chasing you

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.649 
opposed to having someone chasing you
around<00:05:47.550> with<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:47.849> boom<00:05:48.000> Pole<00:05:49.580> so<00:05:50.580> yeah<00:05:50.699> it's<00:05:51.539> a

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
around with the boom Pole so yeah it's a

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.999 
around with the boom Pole so yeah it's a
pretty<00:05:52.370> simple<00:05:53.370> device<00:05:53.819> really<00:05:54.860> but<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:55.979> know

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
pretty simple device really but you know

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.749 
pretty simple device really but you know
it<00:05:56.189> works<00:05:56.339> works<00:05:57.120> well<00:05:57.599> for<00:05:57.629> the<00:05:57.930> price<00:05:58.110> and
