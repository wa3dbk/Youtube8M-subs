00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
revealed if you remember back to the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.790 
revealed if you remember back to the
teaser<00:00:36.270> from<00:00:36.540> nightmare<00:00:36.989> fredbear<00:00:37.290> he<00:00:37.649> was

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
teaser from nightmare fredbear he was

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.459 
teaser from nightmare fredbear he was
very<00:00:38.250> dark<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.059> gray<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.480> color<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.170> scott

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
very dark and gray in color like scott

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.080 
very dark and gray in color like scott
was<00:00:40.620> trying<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> mask<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.700> only<00:00:41.940> bear

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
was trying to mask it the only bear

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.819 
was trying to mask it the only bear
color<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> picture<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> purple

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
color in the picture was the purple

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.520 
color in the picture was the purple
bowtie<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:45.090> obviously<00:00:45.270> think<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
bowtie and we obviously think that the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.049 
bowtie and we obviously think that the
color<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.129> significant<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
color is going to be significant to the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.700 
color is going to be significant to the
story<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.510> popping<00:00:48.960> him<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.230> full<00:00:49.469> color

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
story so popping him in a full color

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.020 
story so popping him in a full color
trailer<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.640> having<00:00:50.879> him<00:00:50.969> in

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
trailer and having him in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.639 
trailer and having him in
black-and-white<00:00:51.300> wouldn't<00:00:52.140> make<00:00:52.320> too<00:00:52.350> much

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
black-and-white wouldn't make too much

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.400 
black-and-white wouldn't make too much
sense<00:00:52.789> yet<00:00:53.789> definitely<00:00:54.120> because<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.079> are

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
sense yet definitely because we are

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
sense yet definitely because we are
speculating<00:00:55.770> whether<00:00:56.430> fredbear's<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
speculating whether fredbear's going to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.459 
speculating whether fredbear's going to
be<00:00:57.510> brown<00:00:57.840> purple<00:00:59.239> golden<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.289> still

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
be brown purple golden but we still

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.560 
be brown purple golden but we still
don't<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:01.739> yet<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.280> I'm<00:01:02.730> pretty<00:01:02.969> sure<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
don't know yet and I'm pretty sure and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.660 
don't know yet and I'm pretty sure and
it's<00:01:04.140> over<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> future<00:01:05.280> teaser

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
it's over going to be a future teaser

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.520 
it's over going to be a future teaser
possibly<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.510> definitely<00:01:06.990> thinking<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
possibly but I definitely thinking the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.210 
possibly but I definitely thinking the

would<00:03:24.360> be<00:03:24.480> amazing<00:03:24.810> if<00:03:25.200> they<00:03:25.380> were<00:03:25.440> able<00:03:26.400> to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
would be amazing if they were able to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.699 
would be amazing if they were able to
separate<00:03:27.209> through<00:03:27.480> Freddy<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.380> kind<00:03:28.620> of

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
separate through Freddy and it kind of

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.720 
separate through Freddy and it kind of
looks<00:03:28.920> like<00:03:28.980> that's<00:03:29.250> going<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.489> be<00:03:29.549> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
looks like that's going to be the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.580 
looks like that's going to be the
mechanic<00:03:29.850> for<00:03:30.150> Freddy<00:03:30.570> yeah<00:03:31.049> whether<00:03:31.260> that

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
mechanic for Freddy yeah whether that

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.979 
mechanic for Freddy yeah whether that
some<00:03:31.950> if<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.400> cuz<00:03:32.940> we've<00:03:33.239> been<00:03:33.360> warned<00:03:33.750> to

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
some if you cuz we've been warned to

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.229 
some if you cuz we've been warned to
watch<00:03:34.019> our<00:03:34.410> back<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.280> if<00:03:35.519> we<00:03:35.700> don't<00:03:35.880> watch<00:03:36.060> our

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
watch our back so if we don't watch our

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.940 
watch our back so if we don't watch our
back<00:03:36.390> long<00:03:36.660> enough<00:03:36.780> does<00:03:37.049> that<00:03:37.110> mean<00:03:37.380> Freddy

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
back long enough does that mean Freddy

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.360 
back long enough does that mean Freddy
comes<00:03:38.220> back<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.850> retrieve<00:03:39.360> his<00:03:39.720> riddles<00:03:40.709> yeah

comes back to retrieve his riddles yeah
and<00:03:41.549> that's<00:03:41.640> when<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:41.940> get<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.150> jump<00:03:42.330> scare

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
and that's when you get the jump scare

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.270 
and that's when you get the jump scare
yeah<00:03:42.989> because<00:03:43.230> if<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.769> actually<00:03:43.920> look<00:03:44.160> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
yeah because if you actually look the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.280 
yeah because if you actually look the

and then jump scares us maybe maybe

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.410 
and then jump scares us maybe maybe
that's<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.610> mechanic<00:04:22.030> that's<00:04:22.240> going<00:04:22.360> to

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
that's the the mechanic that's going to

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.720 
that's the the mechanic that's going to
be<00:04:22.480> working<00:04:22.720> but<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:23.500> does<00:04:23.740> seem<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:24.100> Freddy

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
be working but it does seem like Freddy

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.510 
be working but it does seem like Freddy
is<00:04:25.030> Freddy's<00:04:25.930> absence<00:04:26.530> can<00:04:26.770> maybe<00:04:27.250> be

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
is Freddy's absence can maybe be

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.760 
is Freddy's absence can maybe be
explained<00:04:28.000> by<00:04:28.150> him<00:04:28.360> hiding<00:04:28.690> under<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.290> bed<00:04:29.410> I

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
explained by him hiding under the bed I

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.500 
explained by him hiding under the bed I
think<00:04:29.830> that<00:04:30.070> would<00:04:30.190> be<00:04:30.220> really<00:04:30.790> quite<00:04:31.240> creepy

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510
