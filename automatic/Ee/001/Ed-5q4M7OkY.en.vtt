spinning awesome yeah the right
low-impact<00:01:41.610> perfect<00:01:42.120> thing<00:01:42.240> sweat<00:01:42.660> it<00:01:42.900> was

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
low-impact perfect thing sweat it was

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.770 
low-impact perfect thing sweat it was
great<00:01:43.290> okay<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:43.980> we<00:01:44.610> are<00:01:44.760> here<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.150> this<00:01:45.540> bike

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
great okay so we are here on this bike

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
great okay so we are here on this bike
and<00:01:46.140> I'm<00:01:46.230> going<00:01:46.440> kind<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.770> pretty<00:01:47.070> much<00:01:47.250> at<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and I'm going kind of pretty much at the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.220 
and I'm going kind of pretty much at the
same<00:01:47.700> pace<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.360> some<00:01:48.510> ways<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.690> can<00:01:48.900> kick

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
same pace what are some ways we can kick

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.350 
same pace what are some ways we can kick
it<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.530> notch<00:01:49.560> maybe<00:01:50.070> mix<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.000> workout<00:01:51.330> a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it up a notch maybe mix up the workout a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.060 
it up a notch maybe mix up the workout a
little<00:01:51.510> bit<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:51.990> those<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.320> maybe<00:01:52.530> can't<00:01:52.920> go

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
little bit for those that maybe can't go

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
little bit for those that maybe can't go
to<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.280> spin<00:01:53.580> class

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
to a spin class

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.730 
to a spin class
sure<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.110> want<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> build<00:01:55.560> your<00:01:55.680> own

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
sure so if you want to build your own

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010 
sure so if you want to build your own
profile<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.730> can<00:01:56.880> add<00:01:57.120> resistance<00:01:57.420> by

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
profile you can add resistance by

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.450 
profile you can add resistance by
turning<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.620> knob<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.220> simulate

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
turning the knob that will simulate

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.610 
turning the knob that will simulate
being<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.120> hill<00:02:00.420> slowing<00:02:01.050> down<00:02:01.170> your<00:02:01.410> page

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
being on a hill slowing down your page

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.280 
being on a hill slowing down your page
or<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.610> take<00:02:02.820> resistance<00:02:03.480> off<00:02:03.690> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
or if you can take resistance off and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.080 
or if you can take resistance off and
pick<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.770> your<00:02:04.950> page<00:02:05.160> simulating<00:02:05.850> going

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
pick up your page simulating going

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.740 
pick up your page simulating going
downhill<00:02:06.360> as<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> sprint<00:02:07.440> awesome<00:02:08.540> so<00:02:09.540> yeah<00:02:09.660> as

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
downhill as a sprint awesome so yeah as

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.420 
downhill as a sprint awesome so yeah as
you<00:02:09.869> twist<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.380> little<00:02:10.619> knob<00:02:10.770> here<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.190> kind

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
you twist this little knob here it kind

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.610 
you twist this little knob here it kind
of<00:02:11.490> slows<00:02:12.240> down<00:02:12.570> your<00:02:12.720> cadence<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.260> little<00:02:13.500> bit

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
of slows down your cadence a little bit

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.410 
of slows down your cadence a little bit
makes<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.950> push<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> little<00:02:14.490> bit<00:02:14.730> harder<00:02:14.790> and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
makes you push a little bit harder and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.360 
makes you push a little bit harder and
I'm<00:02:16.200> really<00:02:16.380> feeling<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.770> especially<00:02:17.100> after

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
I'm really feeling it especially after

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.820 
I'm really feeling it especially after
taking<00:02:17.700> her<00:02:17.970> class<00:02:18.240> for<00:02:18.600> an<00:02:18.690> hour<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.530> one<00:02:19.710> of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
taking her class for an hour but one of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.950 
taking her class for an hour but one of
the<00:02:19.920> greatest<00:02:20.280> things<00:02:20.790> about<00:02:21.000> spin<00:02:21.480> class<00:02:21.720> and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
the greatest things about spin class and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.390 
the greatest things about spin class and
which<00:02:22.470> makes<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.770> really<00:02:22.800> good<00:02:23.100> that's<00:02:23.280> been

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
which makes a really good that's been

I<00:02:39.810> would<00:02:40.290> suggest<00:02:40.440> staying<00:02:41.400> with<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> beat<00:02:41.970> of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
I would suggest staying with the beat of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.990 
I would suggest staying with the beat of
the<00:02:42.209> music<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.290> defense<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.670> maintain

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
the music and a defense if you maintain

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.660 
the music and a defense if you maintain
your<00:02:45.480> cadence<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.500> resistance<00:02:47.160> you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
your cadence and have resistance you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.470 
your cadence and have resistance you
know<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:47.970> you're<00:02:48.120> always<00:02:48.150> increasing<00:02:48.900> your

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
know that you're always increasing your

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.690 
know that you're always increasing your
power<00:02:49.870> expenditure<00:02:50.709> okay<00:02:51.190> for<00:02:51.370> those<00:02:51.489> at<00:02:51.670> home

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
power expenditure okay for those at home

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.309 
power expenditure okay for those at home
that<00:02:51.940> don't<00:02:52.060> know<00:02:52.209> what<00:02:52.360> Cadence's<00:02:52.900> that's<00:02:53.170> as

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
that don't know what Cadence's that's as

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.199 
that don't know what Cadence's that's as
fast<00:02:53.620> as<00:02:54.010> your<00:02:54.250> wheel<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.849> turning

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
fast as your wheel is turning

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.240 
fast as your wheel is turning
correct<00:02:55.480> correct<00:02:56.049> okay<00:02:56.260> cool<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:56.769> go<00:02:57.129> ahead

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
correct correct okay cool so go ahead

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.729 
correct correct okay cool so go ahead
and<00:02:57.370> add<00:02:57.580> some<00:02:57.610> here<00:02:58.140> hold<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.290> pace<00:02:59.530> to

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
and add some here hold that pace to

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.780 
and add some here hold that pace to
things<00:03:01.950> get<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:02.980> little<00:03:03.040> bit<00:03:03.250> harder
