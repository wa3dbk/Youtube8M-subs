00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.650
 the news that marcelo polino wants 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.420
 become part of the heart seems 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.130
 that took deep in some members of 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.710
 the entertainment to the extreme that many 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.699
 they ended up telling something as intimate as 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.970
 the desire to be parents when I had two 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.970
 years 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.060
 suffered the abandonment of the father he was raised without 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.949
 of the father besides that he has his mom 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.710
 he grew up but he was created without the father and without 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:37.430
 brothers and I felt that place had 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.739
 to return it to a true this 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.500
 place of good father we are second 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.140
 It may be that something here because there are people 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.059
 very serious irresponsible are already many 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.239
 years of work in minority and 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.760
 Doctors are the ones who are advising me 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.590
 to internalize how the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.290
 item 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.850
 It is not the intention to be a father like everyone 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.110
 you so nothing if we start the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.720
 marcelo's work of the idea la 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.520
 intention of this 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.740
 well thank you very much and like on TV 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.780
 They look expensive but very rare see hearts 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.850
 some names even surprised us 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.370
 as Rodrigo Lussich who also 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.890
 confessed his desire to be a dad and matilda 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.660
 that told open-hearted how life 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.000
 he was denied fulfilling the dream more 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.330
 precious of a woman becoming 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.330
 mom 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.440
 if I really wanted to fulfill 40 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.790
 years of little and like they make me every 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.960
 Again the desire to be dad 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.300
 we have a different sexual erection 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.640
 maybe we have to think like good 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.260
 as we would face adopting or seeing the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.430
 way is something I would not do without a 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.430
 partner i am not in a couple 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.280
 that's why the world would be the way 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.229
 that I do not bring I think I would have to if I 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.570
 something happens have another person you are the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.310
 who wants it in the same way and what 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.680
 take care of that way I do not think that having a 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.980
 son is resigning himself to a lot of things 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.780
 and it is to renounce selfishness 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.660
 have a child give up forever 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.690
 selfishness it seems to me that it would make me very 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.690
 well would do very well 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.690
 matilda if I in my case had 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.600
 many treatments I invent other 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.480
 it's stronger for me 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.819
 I did many treatments and I did not keep it 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:34.980
 pregnant and good 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:37.920
 Well, it was because they are very hard because it is 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.110
 they get very involved and good sometimes the 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.730
 couple is not so strong, no, you can not 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.230
 sustain from where from where to where 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.470
 hit 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.319
 and it's like you start to feel nothing in a 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.690
 moment is how good is this 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.700
 possibility we're going to do it and you start 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.879
 with much desire and you do it but good 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.530
 every time is more down you get frustrated and 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.620
 I thought many times about a lot of things 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.640
 not in adopting good after I separated 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.500
 to adopt the go to Miami and then 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.140
 I'm going to rent a belly butt factor 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.599
 another surprising case although different 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.360
 of the others is the one of mariano iÃºdica that 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.310
 even being a biological father he did not hesitate 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.840
 the possibility of becoming a father 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.269
 Heart of a nine year old boy 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.280
 who today is one more child in his family 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.190
 I have a son of the heart who is a son 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.860
 my more is a son who is called 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.450
 I value that of my house that that is that 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.180
 is the son of mixed and who lives with me 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.629
 five years ago he has 15 came home the 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.220
 9 and for saviors his brother for his 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.319
 sisters is your brother to me is my 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.870
 son and dad says 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.250
 would sometimes sometimes yes sometimes they would do sometimes 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.900
 Maria but her biggest physics 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.200
 from my first marriage I also 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.200
 they are treated as they are corrected. 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.680
 I have one more child 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.730
 this teacher and 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.209
 and said sorry my son in my house is 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.879
 our son and dominate in a gesture of 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.510
 wonderful generosity treats it as 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.430
 as a son or a son more parties or 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.009
 more member in the family 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.900
 we got to know the stories of celebrities and 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.759
 it is impossible that it does not touch us in the most 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.039
 deep in our heart but what 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.470
 true is that there are many people and many 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.509
 couples who are waiting to adopt and 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.610
 also many children who need a 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.009
 home and a family that's why we celebrate 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.349
 the decision of marcelo polino like that of 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.750
 thousands of anonymous people who also dream of 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.110
 that special person that I called them dad 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.110
 or mom
