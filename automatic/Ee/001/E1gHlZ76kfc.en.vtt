 Halim in today's quicktipp video 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.109
 i want to give you a new breakfast 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.690
 idea of david and that is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.150
 the couscous breakfast cranberry vanilla 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.309
 with shazam which I have recently 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.529
 discovered in the organic store and before I 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.539
 was very enthusiastic and happy with 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.279
 would like to share here for this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.560
 Tasty breakfast then only needed 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 still milk your choice and plant 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.580
 maybe a little agave ticks on if 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.099
 you the whole thing a little sweeter sometimes 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.910
 Of course , the breakfast from David 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.809
 which here in so small portion bag 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.309
 bottled she could be too 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.260
 let's see the list of ingredients 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.820
 if interested in what the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.940
 Breakfast is already included 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.489
 We start by adding 120 milliliters 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.579
 I take our vegetable milk 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.239
 now here the spelled milk is taken and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.219
 heat 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.660
 this then because I have no microwave 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.489
 and do not buy it in the pot 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.110
 I would like to have you too 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.860
 taken away from the press, that works 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.570
 quite well 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.559
 you can also do that again 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.800
 bag contents yes before the sources 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.660
 look at 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.030
 I will give that in a cereal 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.090
 bowl and wait for the milk to warm 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.880
 has become and then just give it 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:16.229
 so it stir the whole a 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.140
 bit and leave that for ten now 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.360
 The liquid is 15 minutes 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.270
 is almost gone and so could 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.970
 see that it is unique according to the sources 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.740
 less liquid has it looks like that 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.740
 whole now serves construction and I have to 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.750
 say that is really a very delicious 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.540
 alternative to the normal porridge the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.310
 I usually have breakfast and just 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.009
