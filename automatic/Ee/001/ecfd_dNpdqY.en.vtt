00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
have better control over your wet signal

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.969 
have better control over your wet signal
down<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.080> longer<00:01:28.470> control

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
down it's going to have longer control

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.740

of decay to to exist longer but be under

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.749 
of decay to to exist longer but be under
control<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> decay<00:01:34.920> knob<00:01:35.160> which<00:01:35.520> is

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
control we have the decay knob which is

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.020 
control we have the decay knob which is
going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> allow<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.710> signal<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.550> wet<00:01:38.700> signal

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
going to allow the signal the wet signal

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.639 
going to allow the signal the wet signal
to<00:01:39.149> stick<00:01:39.360> around<00:01:39.450> longer<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.200> how<00:01:40.320> long<00:01:40.500> it's

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
to stick around longer or how long it's

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:41.780 
to stick around longer or how long it's
going<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:40.890> how<00:01:41.190> long<00:01:41.310> you're<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.550> to<00:01:41.610> have

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
going to how long you're going to have

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.910 
going to how long you're going to have
basically<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.300> feedback<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.830> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
basically a feedback then we have the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.880 
basically a feedback then we have the
depth<00:01:44.160> snap<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:44.940> allows<00:01:45.660> you<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> either

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
depth snap which allows you to either

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.130 
depth snap which allows you to either
have<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.310> short<00:01:47.729> room<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.450> vibe<00:01:48.660> or

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
have a really short room kind of vibe or

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.270 
have a really short room kind of vibe or
you<00:01:49.259> flip<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> way<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.160> it's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
you flip it all the way up and it's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.670 
you flip it all the way up and it's
going<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.610> really<00:01:50.970> long<00:01:51.229> super<00:01:52.229> awesome

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
going to be a really long super awesome

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.490 
going to be a really long super awesome
ambient<00:01:53.369> reverb<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.869> level<00:01:55.229> which<00:01:55.350> is

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
ambient reverb and then level which is

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.520 
ambient reverb and then level which is
just<00:01:55.530> your<00:01:55.830> wet<00:01:56.009> dry<00:01:56.280> mixture<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.410> can

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
just your wet dry mixture so you can

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.050 
just your wet dry mixture so you can
pull<00:01:58.679> this<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:58.950> or<00:01:59.069> down<00:01:59.220> each<00:01:59.580> one<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.970> these

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
pull this up or down each one of these

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.350 
pull this up or down each one of these
is<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:00.450> customizable<00:02:01.310> get<00:02:02.310> wide<00:02:02.850> plethora

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
is very customizable get wide plethora

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.910 
is very customizable get wide plethora
of<00:02:03.569> different<00:02:03.810> types<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.229> reverb<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.709> of<00:02:04.800> this

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
of different types of reverb out of this

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.490 
of different types of reverb out of this
pedal<00:02:05.149> then<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.360> your<00:02:06.539> boost<00:02:06.750> switch

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
pedal then you have your boost switch

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.320 
pedal then you have your boost switch
which<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.130> going<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> allow<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.819> push<00:02:09.030> your

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
which is going to allow you to push your

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.350 
which is going to allow you to push your
wet<00:02:09.509> signal<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> much<00:02:11.100> more<00:02:11.360> saturated

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
wet signal to a much more saturated

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.970 
wet signal to a much more saturated
place<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.380> completely<00:02:13.770> customize

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
place and you can completely customize

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.280 
place and you can completely customize
that<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.880> then<00:02:15.030> your<00:02:15.240> true<00:02:15.480> bypass<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that and then your true bypass on and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.250 
that and then your true bypass on and
off<00:02:16.380> switch<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.400> oh<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.690> pedal<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.080> called

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
off switch so oh this pedal is called

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.199 
off switch so oh this pedal is called
the<00:02:19.350> Surfrider<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.310> thought<00:02:20.550> what<00:02:21.120> would

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
the Surfrider and I thought what would

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.210 
the Surfrider and I thought what would
be<00:02:21.270> better<00:02:21.599> than<00:02:21.900> playing<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.530> incredibly

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
be better than playing this incredibly

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.820 
be better than playing this incredibly
