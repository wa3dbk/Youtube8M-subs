 For Christmas decorations we can use natural fir trees 

00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:28.701
 we do not think that our fir is taken from the wild wood, in reality in Europe the Christmas trees are grown specifically 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.099
 to be used in winter, and for each cut or grubbed tree a new specimen will be planted to grow 

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:36.341
 we remind, however, that these are alpine plants, which do not tolerate the home climate, especially in winter 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:46.400
 So if possible place our tree outdoors, in a place away from direct sunlight, so that it can enjoy the winter cold 

00:01:54.197 --> 00:02:00.200
 If we want to keep our tree at home, we try to avoid losing all the needles because of the heat 

00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:10.280
 Whether it is a tree with roots or a top, or a tree cut at the base of the trunk, our Christmas spruce can survive at home for a few weeks 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.080
 however, it is essential that it does not receive excessive heat and that it can enjoy a little humidity 

00:02:19.274 --> 00:02:27.270
 So if possible place it in a not very heated room, or in any case far from any heat source 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.290
 In the saucer, we always leave a little water, and possibly place a humidifier near the plant 

00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:45.160
 or a basin full of water, to increase the ambient humidity 

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:56.410
 If possible we also vaporize the foliage frequently, as long as the lights and decorations placed on the tree allow it
