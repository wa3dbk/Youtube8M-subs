00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hey people come to my new video 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.190
 here in the video a little bit 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.340
 warning and that is again a new one 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.740
 amazon fraud mail surfaced 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.040
 I can tell you one time we fade here 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.770
 take a closer look at this mail 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.439
 she about this mail will notice the above 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.240
 e-mail address is 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.380
 at first glance, not as a fake 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.660
 recognizable 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.550
 that is very dangerous what 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.650
 I am also extremely pleased with this e-mail 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.230
 Dangerous you will come here with 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.649
 the regular with its regular name 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.170
 addressed and sees all this mail 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.960
 damned after amazon so the whole thing 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 The whole formulation is right 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.969
 is pretty well done and on the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.600
 At first glance, it does not fall at all 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.930
 this is a fake e-mail 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 Here you are then asked 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.239
 something to check here is a mistake 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.399
 accumulated in your account or 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.100
 noticed and you should fix that 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.680
 as we bottom click the link here 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.010
 then you almost logs on identifies 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 and fixes this error as usual 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.140
 here in this e-mail, please, nothing 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.600
 click 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.850
 but instead of deleting such emails 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.270
 I recommend something different here 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.610
 Just go on amazon 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.820
 or say more just google 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.159
 and google narrow following text amazon 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.229
 Report fraud mail 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.390
 then you usually end up on one 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.040
 Amazon's help site is best like 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.420
 said google this page since this 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.250
 Help yourself every now and then 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.329
 changed or the link to this page 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.979
 That's why I can change them 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.009
 not below in the biblical video 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.950
 description a post then opens 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.840
 this page you have found and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.259
 Here you will usually receive an e-mail 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.750
 get address from Amazon and there 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.079
 this e-mail address depends on yours 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.610
 fake amazon mail and send it 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.399
 amazon is warned amazon and can 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.680
 countermeasures against these e-mails quasi 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.350
 one suffering so i hope i could give you 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.599
 with this video sufficient before this 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.660
 E-mail and can warn again and again 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.630
 expressly point out 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.210
 on these dangerous e-mails 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.030
 By now it is getting harder and harder 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.670
 So here it is different 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.260
 fake it is a real amazon mail 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.940
 important you can always say clicks 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.690
 at best nothing in any e 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.790
 mails on 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.950
 do you have any concerns here 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.900
 these e-mails, however, directly on yours 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.660
 Amazon account and look there 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.610
 Something would be there in the impure 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.510
 be or not quite agree that 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.010
 already standing there 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.920
 that is still the safest 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.410
 So let me know and then e-mail 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.350
 delete so I hope I could with 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.460
 This video again reasonably 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.960
 have help you continue the video 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.030
