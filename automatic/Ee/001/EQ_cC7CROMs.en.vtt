00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.500
 everybody had here you always 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.020
 will know that the instrument 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.090
 it's not because you often have a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.980
 difficulty in a particular note is 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.950
 with some tuning problem then 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.690
 this is what the strip does at first 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.010
 you are seeing serious note force is 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.619
 hard to leave 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.020
 so this here you will see damage and will 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.750
 in the light of surrender makes us mine 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 preferably on Saturday, whoever has 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.840
 very well done will have a light when 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.520
 The moment shoe does not agree 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.430
 You open a little here, he already 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.710
 delivery, see if it opens a little bit 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 so this little light that already delivers 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.500
 I'm having trouble is not tava 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.780
 giving this question of writing 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.329
 really not interesting to anyone 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.850
 already has a technical part I do not even know 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.579
 who is who is really professional 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.039
 lutheria this branch because not 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.620
 You wish you had to move because 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.059
 You will not know the ways, right? 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.800
 is a complex instrument is a 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.570
 Precision instrument has one thing 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.860
 with the guy then it's no use 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 most of the time people will see a 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.710
 thing so get a hammer or hit the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.020
 business for the thing beam and there you 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.780
 it gets worse it can not resolve on time 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.820
 Closed thing turned out great. 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.250
 But when there and what happens? 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.380
 you will spend the machine tool 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.970
 in the political world is really to do 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.740
 when it came from growth has already hit 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.700
 already tried when you make a slipper 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.290
 correct time once he has already 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.240
 were going to have problem 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.520
 the instrument begins to damage 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.970
 the instrument then but it would be 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.159
 speaking this sharing is made of 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.799
 Moorish pelt then means the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.170
 temperature time this line he 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.579
 watering is that no shoe you 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.189
 A time comes when you have to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.009
 wanting to tear will stick to the law only you 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:55.110
 have the period of the inspiration of dodo 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.930
 the period of time the shoe 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.880
 depends on me depends on the person depends 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.680
 of use 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.130
 wind snow on average a musician 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.189
 professional is believe that one should 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.259
 To change I must be trading for the 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.090
 work study is many hours 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.430
 so are you studying time there 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.319
 using 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.959
 instruments within a period of 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.130
 two years at most you have to 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.130
 change all sharing
