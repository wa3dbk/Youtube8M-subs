00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.305
hello friends

00:00:09.725 --> 00:00:11.477
it’s my last vlog from DreamHack

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:14.582
as you already know, the tournament has already finishes and

00:00:14.582 --> 00:00:15.864
now we’re in Kiev, in Na’Vi office

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:18.331
where I’m making this vlog

00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:22.793
I wanna tell you about the 3rd day of the tournament

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:24.426
I haven’t made vlog about this day

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:27.680
what I had to tell you

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.146
you saw everything by yourselves

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:32.457
Na’Vi has won with the score 6-0

00:00:32.457 --> 00:00:34.543
without loss of any map

00:00:34.543 --> 00:00:37.292
at last they’ve broken this curse

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:39.743
I should add that this is the 4th trip to Sweden and

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:42.597
Na’Vi haven’t won this tournament ever before

00:00:42.597 --> 00:00:48.269
this was the only tournament which our Dota2 lineup

00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:49.933
couldn’t win

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:53.699
it was a great pleasure they did it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.731
especially on such a tournament

00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:56.755
with such a strong participants

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.399
I’m talking about the International champions, Alliance

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.991
who weren’t in a perfect shape though played at home and lost to Na’Vi

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:12.371
and Fnatic who also showed a great play

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.599
everyone understood that on Friday when we lost them 0-3

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:23.510
it seemed like, Na’Vi, with such a game, what should be done?

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.398
though the guys have pulled themselves together

00:01:26.398 --> 00:01:28.834
had a good rest and

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:31.504
first won Alliance with the score 3-0

00:01:31.504 --> 00:01:35.806
which showed a great play despite they weren’t in a perfect shape

00:01:36.148 --> 00:01:39.520
we can see it in the 3rd game

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.866
where it seemed like Swedish had a comeback

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:45.069
though Loda didn’t take a Rapier

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.430
I don’t know whether it could help them or not

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:51.481
in any case it was impossible to change the game

00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:54.649
so we became the champions and passed to the Grand Final

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:02.008
after that we morally broke Fnatic with the score 3-0

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.368
it was good shown in the 3rd game

00:02:06.582 --> 00:02:08.254
after Fnatic made some strange picks

00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:09.864
as they haven’t used

00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:13.053
I’d call it snowball effect

00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:19.447
in such a case we have a score 3-0 and a victory

00:02:19.447 --> 00:02:22.040
many people asked me whether Zhenya fulfilled his promise

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.640
yes, he did it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.051
whether Xeo fulfilled his promise

00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:28.534
no, he didn’t

00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:30.615
it surprised me a lot as

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:32.728
everyone treated it like a joke

00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:37.145
it’s cool to swim but it’s almost December and

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:41.941
the lake is so cold

00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:45.991
it’s not recommended to swim, especially at night

00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:49.917
in any case, I thought it was a joke

00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:53.898
though in the morning, at 5 or 6 am

00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:55.616
when I went to bed

00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:59.106
Zhenya, XBOCT and other guys went to the lake and

00:02:59.106 --> 00:03:01.166
Zhenya took a dip

00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:06.834
this proves that our Dota 2 manager is a real man

00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:08.178
he promised and he did it

00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:09.895
my respect to him

00:03:09.895 --> 00:03:12.865
what else can I tell you about the DreamHack?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.544
actually, nothing more I think

00:03:17.544 --> 00:03:19.553
it was rather hard tournament for us

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:24.269
we did it great

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.270
the next one will be EMS One in Poland

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.394
the participants will be rather strong there

00:03:34.394 --> 00:03:36.677
there will be Alliance as well as the Chinese team

00:03:36.677 --> 00:03:40.784
unfortunately DK didn’t manage to get visa

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:43.447
that’s why another Chinese team will change them

00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:46.254
Vici Gaming

00:03:46.473 --> 00:03:48.486
unfortunately I don’t know how to pronounce the name of this team right

00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:49.945
there will be Fnatic as well

00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:53.083
so there will be a real struggle there

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:59.105
I hope that our guys will have enough strength and passion

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:01.607
to win the last LAN of this year and

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:03.884
have a good rest after that

00:04:04.084 --> 00:04:06.383
in any case, it deals only with LANs

00:04:06.383 --> 00:04:11.169
as there much more games online

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.264
tomorrow we’ll play on D2League

00:04:13.264 --> 00:04:15.983
to play on trials to the tournament

00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:18.863
which final will be held in January in Las Vegas

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:21.271
we’ll also have a play of in our league with Virtus.pro on D2CL

00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:23.091
and of course, StarLadder

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:29.504
you’ll see many games of Na’Vi by the end of the New year’s holidays

00:04:29.504 --> 00:04:31.975
I hope we’ll surprise you

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:33.682
Midas gaming is cool

00:04:33.682 --> 00:04:38.567
though this strategy trend won’t be long-lasting

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:40.943
despite it’s cool

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:48.379
soon we’ll see what to expect in the nearest tournaments

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:50.955
so stay with us

00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:52.677
