00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.890
 point of rolling on the knots we can 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.399
 calabrese ham with stuffing of its 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.560
 Preferably the curled up so no 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.870
 we need to get through again because 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.750
 Ingredients 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.520
 make the flour to adhere to the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.540
 marbles 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.980
 we do so and put in the flour 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:16.670
 stirring so we leave it and we will do 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.560
 but we can leave them in the flour 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.340
 that from the moment she stays in 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.380
 flour by the core of another note 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:30.550
 so we're finishing rolling 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.550
 our cookies passed in flour 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.350
 we squeeze the flour password on the cookie 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.350
 what do you know about appliance 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.060
 we made assorted sizes then 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.460
 gave 20 units 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.060
 in a pan we'll put look at the 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.160
 enough to affect our cupcakes 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.010
 a very important tip for us 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.290
 we know the oil temperature is we 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.150
 put a wooden spoon 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.730
 if she steals as soon as the fat is gone 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.500
 at the point to receive the fry that 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.540
 it was on high heat 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.550
 we lowered the fire because it already reached the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.400
 temperature we want 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.540
 so we're putting the cookies 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.800
 so it has to be very fast because 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.800
 they not only brown 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.490
 they do not need to cook around 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.600
 who suffer that we move with care 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.990
 for new stains here people stay 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.860
 so now it's just enough to 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.860
 brown 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.670
