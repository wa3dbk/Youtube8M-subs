00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello friends with you again sasha dragon day 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.279
 look at the report with you 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.279
 release gear boom 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.949
 Well today, amber say one thing very 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.640
 interesting 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.439
 but the principle of historical 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.159
 there is the so-called getting up 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:25.329
 Filipino ROC 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.159
 this is what you insert 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.449
 continuous trick 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.010
 as you remember 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.340
 Now I will explain how this husband 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370
 if just ordinary media 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.370
 usually seat on your arm 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.950
 stroke rate 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.580
 we put in some kind of extra 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.450
 movements 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.620
 percentage either in the shoulder 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.550
 I have a secret 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.200
 Here I am for example 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.200
 special handwriting 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
 we get that 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.780
 key points i have my limit 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.820
 for example i can do it on the shoulder 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.000
 I can do 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.240
 and add a ring 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.280
 and withdraw 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.530
 I already did further 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.050
 a 1.2 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.600
 also i can make a whole trajectory 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.680
 it will be cool to watch 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.090
 so I did find the transfer 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.090
 and therefore such 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.680
 and here I came to Berlin 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.790
 the core did something 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.570
 i came here 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.080
 can be divided somewhere on average 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.870
 3 3 types of such became 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.080
 that is, for example, it's just 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.770
 shift somewhere 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.390
 example then well 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.090
 it's just gonna eat 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 further found 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.840
 well, then it may be equal to only one 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.479
 Goal 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.479
 Well, for example on the thigh 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.999
 importantly well 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.059
 and third it may be that he is already 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.869
 showed 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.889
 it could be some kind of hoof trajectory 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.039
 drawing for example from the leader 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.039
 what such 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.699
 i mean i do 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.699
 neck passengers 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.349
 and respected 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.909
 that with you was I Sasha dragon we are with you 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.149
 watched released dedicated 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:51.769
 this is what will help you figure it out 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.439
 in principle of the oncoming 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.680
 Well, let's be free
