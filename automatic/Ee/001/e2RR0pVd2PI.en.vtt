00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.350
 well I knew I was on my knees and I 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.230
 touches the part of the fence fence bent 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.570
 the right the back right does not work 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.300
 to the cuete 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.630
 and the only thing I did was 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.529
 kicked the clutch and the car 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.570
 I jump and leave the post but well no 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.790
 I invented it, they are all copies of the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.949
 previous old 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.440
 but that 's what drew attention 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.829
 from that time it did not arrive in three wheels or 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.010
 in rim or on fire 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.480
 and those were heroic moments what good 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.829
 that moment you realize that you were 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.920
 making history when that was finished 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.920
 career put at that time for example 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.090
 the car burned suppose I follow and 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.320
 it is turned on and turned on and instead of 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.320
 to get it right I get it wrong 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.870
 I got low I threw the car burns it 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.350
 burning or chau 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.140
 reindeer people came true 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.080
 because not for that before for the win and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.080
 not to do another that says days 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.010
 and the same thing from them was a going 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.050
 and back today if a pilot were to 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.530
 something happens in the engine 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:36.549
 and go on and break it 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.480
 and without laburo I followed that I was losing 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:43.360
 Your license 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.360
 good for you I will be the engine 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.090
 it's just like people but I'm going to 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.830
 make a new one wants to blame me 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.730
 I was already 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.730
 The lost
