 Miami is the sence of all the instructors. 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.399
 accredited to give zumba class 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.350

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.939

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.860
 choreographed many of us the 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.720
 teacher he will adapt according to your 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.520
 shift in the way that we think 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.170
 easy because working in class 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.030
 but we get this material from people 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.920
 have to follow a pattern then the burning 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.560
 calorie is too big you can lose 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.659
 400 to 1000 calories per class depends on 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.340
 of the student's physical conditioning 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.590
 As he goes to class as he 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.240
 he goes on evolving physical conditioning 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.220
 he will be able to do more choreography 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.289
 strong and will be able to do faster 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.420
 and will create and also develop 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.860
 choreographic ability because the best 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.989
 people come in time for you 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.970
 You need to know how to dance it comes to 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:56.739
 willingness to make a 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.640
 activity other than traditional 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.640
 that she had been practicing 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.700
 I assumed it was indicated for all tracks 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.660
 for all sexes because 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.330
 depends on the content of your physical condition 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.920
 if you do not have a chronic problem 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.170
 you can do an aerobic activity 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.270
 You can do the language, it's not samba. It 's a 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.890
 modality that came to stay all 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.230
 They are enjoying physical activity a lot 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.330
 because besides being a technical class where 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.920
 Do you work muscle body work? 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.170
 you have fun too 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.150
 so it's a very fun class and 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.440
 I would like everyone to come and meet 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.440
 You 'll surely fall in love. 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.620
