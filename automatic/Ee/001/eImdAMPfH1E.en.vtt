00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.990
 television and good moving on to other 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.790
 things maybe many remember that does 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.620
 one year most of the experts 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.990
 announced the disappearance of those 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.420
 computers better known as fish 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.440
 or the famous desktop since as 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.270
 cell phones were expected 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.279
 smart and the tablets dominated 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.990
 sales in the market and well the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.650
 revolutionary pc seemed to be already 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.910
 unnecessary boring and obsolete without 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.890
 But the truth is that in the offices 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.840
 there are many people that nothing more adult this 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.579
 clear but good system but then that 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.649
 a smartphone is great to be able 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.210
 read emails for example or 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.250
 take pictures and even be able to configure 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 wherever and we also know that the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.360
 tablets are perfect to be able to see 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 videos or buy online all the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.200
 you only have that nowhere 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.850
 fixed but below do not discard your 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.289
 pc if they have one since the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 manufacturers of different fields 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.829
 companies are currently working 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.920
 in returning to the market to these machines 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.879
 and if your question is how are you going to do 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.890
 saying for example on new screens 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.440
 copied high resolution that will be 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.180
 vÃ­ctor to watch videos or play 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.159
 also video games besides that 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.540
 they would have other functions that they can not 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.640
 offer the devices 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.710
 because this is very clear and listen 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.300
 more within the many novelties with 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.920
 what computer makers 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.050
 they will try to recover the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.910
 consumers will also offer check 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.640
 these machines with cameras with sensors 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.320
 high- end which will serve to 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.760
 recognize the face of the owner and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.400
 so you can unlock your equipment 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.050
 easily and good will also serve to 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.600
 games that those that respond to 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.040
 gestures of the head of the hands things 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.440
 that can not be played on a device 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.360
 Mobile plus they promise they will 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.340
 a memory capacity for 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.660
 file storage printing and 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.810
 Well of course these functions 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.850
 newer ones will not be railings but that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.740
 will try to try different software 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.300
 and offer functions that make 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.979
 consumers, we need one because 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.990
 We will see that they offer these different 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.030
 brands that are in the market and good to 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.070
 see who you find it to be very 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.180
 useful to buy in one and well then there 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.740
 to mention what you said 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.570
 I'm still not quite 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.190
 obsolete because still many by 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.930
 audio designers example 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.930
 design designers 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:25.260
 the writers engineers and good what 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.910
 that yes they will have to compete with 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.650
 the famous computers as we were 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.270
 saying to read the apple for 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.950
 satisfy the different ones from those of the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.720
 people with a lot of intelligence and 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.300
 because it is canyons are two things 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.410
 totally different as you use a 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.560
 machine 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.340
 are different you buy the one that more 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:50.070
 The water is put to work by people who 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.530
 they got out to use it or just as easily 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.210
