00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.023
 I tested several cameras for these photos. 

00:00:07.058 --> 00:00:09.514
 The first was the Coolpix S9900. 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.475
 It is extremely convenient to always carry it with you. 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.932
 She holds my pocket and is everywhere with me. 

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:19.015
 An important part of my job is to look for posts for posters, 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.728
 I want to take pictures of them and take them home. 

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:23.514
 It has a 30x optical zoom, 

00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:26.268
 I can connect it to my phone via a Wi-Fi connection 

00:00:26.303 --> 00:00:28.708
 and upload pictures online really fast. 

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:33.245
 Follows Nikon 1 J5. 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.150
 This is a camera type 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.583
 with interchangeable lenses, but still very small. 

00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:41.628
 Works great with super fast series of photos, 

00:00:41.663 --> 00:00:43.316
 can also shoot slow motion movies. 

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:45.998
 Since there is a touch screen at the back, 

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.040
 is very easy to use. 

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.002
 You can touch the screen, 

00:00:49.037 --> 00:00:51.065
 to choose where to focus, and everything is going really fast. 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.172
 It can not be simpler. 

00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:56.404
 Now it's with the whale lens. It's really good and versatile. 

00:00:57.413 --> 00:01:02.360
 If I want to get closer, I use a 10-100mm lens. 

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:07.947
 It's also nice, versatile, but has a 10x optical zoom. 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.989
 This is the D5500 - it is a DSLR. It's cool! 

00:01:13.024 --> 00:01:14.990
 It also has a touchscreen display, 

00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:17.223
 I can touch the screen again, 

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:20.536
 to focus and shoot. The screen has a variable angle. 

00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:22.971
 Autofocus is really fast. 

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.150
 Even when someone moves very quickly, 

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.862
 I can stop the action and get a very clear shot. 

00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:32.275
 For the best frame I recommend it, 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.838
 especially when it's dark, it may be a little harder, 

00:01:34.873 --> 00:01:36.504
 because the person is moving really fast. 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.576
 The frame is extremely clear even when there is a lot of movement 

00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:39.760
 and the lighting is weak. 

00:01:41.087 --> 00:01:44.119
 The camera is incredibly fast when shooting the contestants 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.875
 on parkour, jumping in front of the posters in Marseilles. 

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.716
 I just point it, hold my finger on the trigger 

00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:51.163
 and I use the series of photos. 

00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:53.654
 It is very easy to capture the key moment 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.606
 and you can upload everything via Wi-Fi. 

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:58.873
 I'm not used to DSLR, 

00:01:58.908 --> 00:02:00.730
 but I learned a lot about it. 

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:02.501
 Obviously his potential is much bigger 

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:04.703
 and I can not wait to shoot even better shots with him. 

00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:11.018
 18-140 mm is an alternative to the whale lens. 

00:02:11.053 --> 00:02:13.755
 There is a larger magnification and a larger range of angles 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.348
 to take pictures of really clear shots. 

00:02:15.383 --> 00:02:18.622
 It's 35 mm f / 1.8. It enters a lot of light. 

00:02:18.657 --> 00:02:20.639
 So it's very good for really clear shots 

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:22.113
 in low light situations. 

00:02:22.148 --> 00:02:25.274
 You can also blur the background, 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:26.908
 with distinct foreground. 

00:02:28.892 --> 00:02:31.142
 Here is another equipment I carry in my purse - 

00:02:31.177 --> 00:02:34.615
 I have two small tripods, posters and scotch, 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.409
 so I can pin them 

00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:37.834
 and take off as fast as you can. 

00:02:39.147 --> 00:02:41.241
 With the right equipment 

00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:43.114
 you do not have much to shoot the desired footage.
