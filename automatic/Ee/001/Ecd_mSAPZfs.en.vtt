paddle<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.590> added<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.310> little<00:01:41.430> note

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
paddle and then I I added a little note

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.399 
paddle and then I I added a little note
here<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.210> other<00:01:42.360> charging<00:01:42.840> technology<00:01:42.990> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
here for other charging technology it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.520 
here for other charging technology it
says<00:01:43.619> solar<00:01:44.100> trees<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:45.020> continued<00:01:46.020> down<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
says solar trees I continued down to

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.520 
says solar trees I continued down to
charging<00:01:47.280> station<00:01:47.579> brand<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.259> small<00:01:49.259> paddle

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
charging station brand and small paddle

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.350 
charging station brand and small paddle
inductive<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> actually<00:01:50.340> magnet<00:01:50.700> charge<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.299> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
inductive is actually magnet charge so I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.270 
inductive is actually magnet charge so I
put<00:01:51.600> five<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.470> match<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.950> number<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
put five so I match the number of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
put five so I match the number of
technologies<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.630> number<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.170> brands

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
technologies with the number of brands

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.800 
technologies with the number of brands
so<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:56.520> here<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:56.880> are<00:01:56.969> down<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> little<00:01:57.659> bit

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
so now here we are down a little bit

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
so now here we are down a little bit
further<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.290> map<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.369> really

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
further on the map and this is a really

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.090 
further on the map and this is a really
interesting<00:02:00.299> tool<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.110> we've<00:02:01.229> got<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:01.590> you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
interesting tool that we've got here you

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.620 
interesting tool that we've got here you
can<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> was<00:02:02.670> dragging<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.210> marker

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
can see I was dragging that marker

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.090 
can see I was dragging that marker
around<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.259> did<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> GPS

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
around and as I did so the GPS

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.130 
around and as I did so the GPS
coordinates<00:02:05.520> changed<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.600> watch<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.049> do

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
coordinates changed now watch what I do

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.260 
coordinates changed now watch what I do
when<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.380> watch<00:02:08.069> what<00:02:08.280> happens<00:02:08.580> when<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.759> add<00:02:08.849> an

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
when I watch what happens when I add an

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.430 
when I watch what happens when I add an
address<00:02:09.479> above

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
address above

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.710 
address above
I'm<00:02:10.560> typing<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.580> when<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> click<00:02:12.360> out<00:02:12.540> of

here<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> am<00:02:39.630> zooming<00:02:39.900> around<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.320> map<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.650> can

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
here I am zooming around the map you can

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.830 
here I am zooming around the map you can
see<00:02:40.800> Google<00:02:41.310> has<00:02:41.520> tons<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.970> solar<00:02:42.150> panels<00:02:42.690> on

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
see Google has tons of solar panels on

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.320 
see Google has tons of solar panels on
their<00:02:42.990> roof<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.490> particular<00:02:44.790> spot

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
their roof but this this particular spot

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.420 
their roof but this this particular spot
that's<00:02:45.630> where<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.080> electric<00:02:47.040> vehicle

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
that's where the electric vehicle

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.160 
that's where the electric vehicle
chargers<00:02:47.850> are<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.420> I'm<00:02:48.510> dragging<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.050> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
chargers are so I'm dragging it and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.170 
chargers are so I'm dragging it and
again<00:02:49.440> as<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.860> do<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.370> can<00:02:50.400> see<00:02:50.700> below<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
again as I do that you can see below the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.180 
again as I do that you can see below the
latitude<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.660> longitude<00:02:51.810> are<00:02:52.290> auto-updating

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
latitude and longitude are auto-updating

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.620 
latitude and longitude are auto-updating
so<00:02:53.640> that's<00:02:53.760> really<00:02:54.000> important<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.510> helps

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
so that's really important it helps

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.250 
so that's really important it helps
people<00:02:54.930> identify<00:02:55.580> where<00:02:56.580> at<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.000> facility<00:02:57.390> they

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
people identify where at a facility they

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.410 
people identify where at a facility they
should<00:02:58.470> go<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.890> order<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.280> charge<00:02:59.520> now<00:03:00.360> the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
should go in order to charge now the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.450 
should go in order to charge now the
thing<00:03:00.630> about<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.930> Googleplex<00:03:01.460> headquarters

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
thing about the Googleplex headquarters

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.570 
thing about the Googleplex headquarters
or<00:03:03.390> any<00:03:03.510> google<00:03:03.810> campus<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.190> can't

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
or any google campus is that you can't

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.460 
or any google campus is that you can't
charge<00:03:06.000> unless<00:03:06.510> you're<00:03:06.660> an<00:03:06.720> employee<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.380> I

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
charge unless you're an employee and I

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.140 
charge unless you're an employee and I
think<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.800> that's<00:03:08.130> an<00:03:08.340> important<00:03:08.730> note<00:03:08.880> so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
think that that's an important note so

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.180 
think that that's an important note so
here<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.390> am<00:03:09.510> adding<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.230> say<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:11.100> know
