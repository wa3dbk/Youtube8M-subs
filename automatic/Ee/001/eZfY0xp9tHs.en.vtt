I'm<00:01:02.340> actually<00:01:02.719> elevating<00:01:04.880> you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.119> choose<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
I'm actually elevating you can choose to

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.380 
I'm actually elevating you can choose to
have<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.619> elevated<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.549> sticking<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
have them elevated so sticking up and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.880 
have them elevated so sticking up and
just<00:01:09.570> pin<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.900> bottom<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.680> lay

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
just pin at the bottom or you can lay

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.859 
just pin at the bottom or you can lay
them<00:01:11.070> flat<00:01:11.100> against<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> head<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.689> all

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
them flat against the head this all

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.810 
them flat against the head this all
depends<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.619> how<00:01:13.920> thick<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.340> hair<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.700> if

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
depends on how thick your hair is if

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.700 
depends on how thick your hair is if
you've<00:01:14.939> got<00:01:14.970> thicker<00:01:15.360> hair<00:01:15.659> then<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.290> likely

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you've got thicker hair then it's likely

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.310 
you've got thicker hair then it's likely
that<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.009> top<00:01:17.280> portions<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:18.000> hair<00:01:18.450> will<00:01:18.960> fall

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that the top portions of hair will fall

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.020 
that the top portions of hair will fall
over

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
over

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.469 
over
these<00:01:21.030> elevated<00:01:21.540> pin<00:01:21.960> curls<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.090> hide<00:01:24.090> them

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
these elevated pin curls and hide them

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.539 
these elevated pin curls and hide them
and<00:01:24.659> they<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.140> simply<00:01:25.290> add<00:01:25.619> volume<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:26.369> your

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and they will simply add volume if your

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.980 
and they will simply add volume if your
hair's<00:01:26.820> thinner<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.450> likely<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.930> they

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
hair's thinner it's likely that they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.539 
hair's thinner it's likely that they
will<00:01:28.140> poke<00:01:28.409> through<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.740> top<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.220> top

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
will poke through the top of that top

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.370 
will poke through the top of that top
layer<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.509> an<00:01:30.659> idea<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.110> lay<00:01:31.259> your

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
layer so it's an idea to lay your

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.069 
layer so it's an idea to lay your
pincurls<00:01:31.799> flat<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.750> thinner<00:01:33.750> hair

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
pincurls flat if you have thinner hair

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
pincurls flat if you have thinner hair
but<00:01:34.740> simply<00:01:35.130> work<00:01:35.310> across<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.880> back<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.210> your

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
but simply work across the back of your

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.480 
but simply work across the back of your
head<00:01:36.540> pin<00:01:37.229> curling<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.799> leaving<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> ends

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
head pin curling and leaving the ends

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.859 
head pin curling and leaving the ends
out<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:39.180> what<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.390> doing<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.780> just

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
out now what I'm doing here is just

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.140 
out now what I'm doing here is just
using<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.350> ceramic<00:01:40.619> curling<00:01:41.009> wand<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.640> smooth

using a ceramic curling wand to smooth

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.149 
using a ceramic curling wand to smooth
those<00:01:42.570> ends<00:01:42.899> into<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.229> nice<00:01:43.530> flick<00:01:43.950> at<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
those ends into a nice flick at the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.080 
those ends into a nice flick at the
bottom<00:01:46.310> you're<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.579> repeat<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
bottom you're going to repeat this

bottom you're going to repeat this
process<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.869> pin<00:01:49.439> curling<00:01:49.890> leaving<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> ends

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
process of pin curling leaving the ends

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.850
