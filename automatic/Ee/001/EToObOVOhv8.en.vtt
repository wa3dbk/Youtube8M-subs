wind<00:02:02.320> our<00:02:02.740> voice<00:02:03.400> coil<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.930> we'll<00:02:05.380> use<00:02:05.680> the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
wind our voice coil so we'll use the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.930 
wind our voice coil so we'll use the
number<00:02:06.640> 28<00:02:07.150> wire<00:02:08.160> first<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.490> be<00:02:09.729> sure<00:02:09.760> that

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940

the<00:04:44.920> wire<00:04:46.680> in<00:04:47.680> this<00:04:47.860> handle<00:04:51.480> like<00:04:52.480> so<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:53.050> then

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
the wire in this handle like so and then

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.330 
the wire in this handle like so and then
scrape<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.410> insulation<00:04:56.440> off<00:04:57.010> with<00:04:57.250> the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
scrape the insulation off with the

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.150 
scrape the insulation off with the
sandpaper<00:04:57.700> by<00:04:57.940> squeezing<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.480> wire<00:04:58.960> between

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
hands to clean the insulation on well

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.070 
hands to clean the insulation on well
we've<00:05:12.490> added<00:05:12.670> a<00:05:12.790> few<00:05:12.970> more<00:05:13.150> turns<00:05:13.450> to<00:05:13.870> bring

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
we've added a few more turns to bring

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.010 
we've added a few more turns to bring
the<00:05:14.320> resistance<00:05:15.160> of<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.430> coil<00:05:15.670> up<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.600> about<00:05:16.720> 5

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
the resistance of the coil up to about 5

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.360 
the resistance of the coil up to about 5
ohms<00:05:17.640> but<00:05:19.140> it's<00:05:20.140> not<00:05:20.380> very<00:05:20.560> loud<00:05:20.860> as<00:05:21.100> you<00:05:21.130> can

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
ohms but it's not very loud as you can

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:28.769 
ohms but it's not very loud as you can
hear<00:05:22.110> get<00:05:23.110> up<00:05:23.230> close<00:05:23.470> to<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.710> there

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.540 

so<00:05:29.779> we<00:05:30.110> just<00:05:30.319> need<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:31.009> drive<00:05:31.249> it<00:05:31.430> with

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
so we just need to drive it with

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:41.089 
so we just need to drive it with
something<00:05:31.759> a<00:05:31.939> bit<00:05:32.059> stronger

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.469 

let's<00:05:42.099> see<00:05:42.279> we'll<00:05:42.460> try<00:05:42.610> to<00:05:42.669> find<00:05:42.849> an<00:05:43.029> amplifier

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
let's see we'll try to find an amplifier

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.330 
let's see we'll try to find an amplifier
a<00:05:43.509> little<00:05:43.779> more<00:05:43.900> strength<00:05:47.129> well<00:05:48.129> we've<00:05:48.309> got

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
a little more strength well we've got

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.450 
a little more strength well we've got
our<00:05:48.550> homemade<00:05:48.879> speaker<00:05:49.830> hooked<00:05:50.830> up<00:05:51.009> to<00:05:51.249> the

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
our homemade speaker hooked up to the

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.219 
our homemade speaker hooked up to the
shoebox<00:05:52.360> 1000<00:05:53.229> homemade<00:05:54.270> amplifier<00:05:55.270> and<00:05:56.110> this

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
shoebox 1000 homemade amplifier and this

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.290 
shoebox 1000 homemade amplifier and this
is<00:05:56.379> a<00:05:56.409> high<00:05:57.039> power<00:05:57.309> amplifier<00:05:57.849> we<00:05:58.029> ought<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.240> be

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
is a high power amplifier we ought to be

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.519 
is a high power amplifier we ought to be
really<00:05:58.509> be<00:05:58.599> able<00:05:58.659> to<00:05:58.749> the<00:05:58.900> sounds<00:05:59.229> come<00:05:59.379> out<00:05:59.409> of

00:05:59.519 --> 00:05:59.529 
really be able to the sounds come out of

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:02.820 
really be able to the sounds come out of
this<00:05:59.589> thing<00:05:59.770> now<00:05:59.979> so<00:06:00.969> we're<00:06:01.210> going<00:06:01.330> to<00:06:01.830> power

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
this thing now so we're going to power

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.079 
this thing now so we're going to power
this<00:06:03.009> thing<00:06:03.069> up<00:06:03.400> here<00:06:03.689> and<00:06:05.400> see<00:06:06.400> see<00:06:06.879> how<00:06:06.999> it

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
this thing up here and see see how it

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:15.730 
this thing up here and see see how it
sounds

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.439 

Oh<00:06:15.800> humming<00:06:16.639> noise

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:30.480 

that<00:06:19.960> doesn't<00:06:20.289> look<00:06:20.379> too<00:06:20.529> good<00:06:21.599> my<00:06:22.599> gosh

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.520 

hmm<00:06:31.960> well<00:06:32.960> the<00:06:33.460> shoebox<00:06:34.460> 1000<00:06:35.290> home<00:06:36.290> build

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
hmm well the shoebox 1000 home build

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.900 
hmm well the shoebox 1000 home build
amplifier<00:06:37.040> was<00:06:37.190> a<00:06:37.220> little<00:06:37.400> bit<00:06:37.490> too<00:06:37.670> strong

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
amplifier was a little bit too strong

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.560 
amplifier was a little bit too strong
for<00:06:38.240> this<00:06:38.330> and<00:06:38.510> I<00:06:38.570> guess<00:06:38.780> I<00:06:40.030> hope<00:06:41.030> the<00:06:41.210> output

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
for this and I guess I hope the output

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.360 
for this and I guess I hope the output
transistors<00:06:42.260> crossref<00:06:42.800> eight

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.909 

okay<00:06:46.210> I<00:06:46.449> guess<00:06:47.199> that's<00:06:47.229> about<00:06:47.470> enough<00:06:47.590> for

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
okay I guess that's about enough for

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:57.300 
okay I guess that's about enough for
this<00:06:47.979> experiment

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.370
