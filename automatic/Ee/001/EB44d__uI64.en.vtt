00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
work I wanted it to do better than the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.189 
work I wanted it to do better than the
conventional<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:20.160> be<00:00:21.119> able<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.480> say<00:00:21.840> I'm

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
conventional and be able to say I'm

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.950 
conventional and be able to say I'm
growing<00:00:22.800> organically<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.300> really<00:00:24.660> think

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
growing organically and I really think

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.230 
growing organically and I really think
organic<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> better<00:00:25.859> way<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.070> go<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.849> this

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
organic is the better way to go but this

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.880 
organic is the better way to go but this
is<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.599> problem<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.990> I've<00:00:28.230> encountered<00:00:28.590> so

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890

organic nutrients than it is the
conventional<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.640> uses<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> lot<00:01:54.299> more

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
product and it's also very difficult to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.149 
product and it's also very difficult to
balance<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.170> pH<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.520> organic<00:01:59.820> side

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
balance the pH on the organic side

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.499 
balance the pH on the organic side
