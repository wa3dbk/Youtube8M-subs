00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.730
 and well, now I'm going to explain 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.670
 how to use what is guitar pro and a 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.480
 once you have downloaded 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.480
 more than anything between the crack 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.430
 how I explained this program to me 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.309
 I consider it very good since it shows you 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.829
 what the frets are you can already give 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.829
 more to the idea of ​​how to position the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.320
 and can show you tabs 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.960
 they are very important there are also several 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.450
 several songs against nature 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.800
 generally pop rock 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.800
 Well now 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.060
 well that problem is very simple 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.070
 create songs is very advanced I do not know 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.799
 I recommend 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.750
 I would say use more to be able 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.750
 play songs that you like 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.990
 next I will show you 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.270
 the songs 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.549
 they can play any 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.549
 we are 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.420
 they can install us anywhere 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.710
 of any command 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.170
 we wait for a moment what it loads 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.300
 I think I charge twice 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.220
 good the song to choose is a 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.490
 known band some like some 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.780
 well it depends in general this song is 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.780
 of magic and my car mans 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.240
 good 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.300
 you can use what is the 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.530
 the spacing here or they can give you 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.870
 here 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.540
 they remember that I told them the numbering 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.590
 of each fret are given when it is here 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.360
 the 6 and it is in these lines here are 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.360
 the ropes on the fifth string 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.540
 in the sixth 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.550
 fret and then shows them 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.660
 the rhythm and sequence that should lead 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.660
 in the song 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.400
 the original song is heard so happy 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.129
 today the mission 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.150
 I 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.070
 I 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.010
 nothing is not going to be the same sound 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.010
 they just simulate it 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.009
 and 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:34.900
 Well, it's a good 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.900
 Program 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.980
 Well, I hope it serves you 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.980
 I went up 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.139
 a guitar pro you know the direction in the 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.560
 downstairs 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:56.499
 already together with the keys and the licenses 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.840
 so they can acquire it without any 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:01.590
