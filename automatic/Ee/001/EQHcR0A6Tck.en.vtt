big ones take a while to spawn i think

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.810 
big ones take a while to spawn i think
so<00:01:34.530> that's<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> why<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.130> hop<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.369> between

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
so that's kind of why I hop in between

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.460 
so that's kind of why I hop in between
I'm<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.659> not<00:01:36.810> standing<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.380> way

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I'm just so I'm not standing there way

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.770 
I'm just so I'm not standing there way
for<00:01:37.590> them<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> spawn<00:01:38.040> back<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.640> especially<00:01:39.509> if

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
for them to spawn back so especially if

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.999 
for them to spawn back so especially if
you<00:01:39.840> use<00:01:39.869> arrows<00:01:40.259> against<00:01:40.500> those<00:01:40.619> things<00:01:40.890> they

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you use arrows against those things they

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.590 
you use arrows against those things they
will<00:01:41.130> definitely<00:01:41.400> die<00:01:41.820> alot<00:01:42.090> faster<00:01:42.270> so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
will definitely die alot faster so

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.730 
will definitely die alot faster so
you'll<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> wait<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.140> too<00:01:43.200> long<00:01:43.409> for

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you'll have to wait you too long for

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.520 
you'll have to wait you too long for
spawn<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.180> yeah<00:01:45.360> definitely<00:01:45.570> i'm<00:01:46.229> Parton's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
spawn so yeah definitely i'm Parton's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.749 
spawn so yeah definitely i'm Parton's
going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> use<00:01:46.829> water<00:01:47.009> brought<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.520> plus

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
going to use water brought your plus

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.010 
going to use water brought your plus
it's<00:01:47.939> easier<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.329> soulsplit<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.869> that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it's easier to soulsplit with that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.480 
it's easier to soulsplit with that
because<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.560> detect<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.399> know

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
because you can detect like you know

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.880 
because you can detect like you know
five<00:01:50.790> cal<00:01:51.060> fights<00:01:51.299> at<00:01:51.450> once<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:51.780> whatever<00:01:51.990> but

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
five cal fights at once or whatever but

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.590 
five cal fights at once or whatever but
ya<00:01:53.009> doing<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.610> definitely<00:01:54.149> i<00:01:54.210> think<00:01:54.420> i'll<00:01:54.509> be

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
ya doing this definitely i think i'll be

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840 
ya doing this definitely i think i'll be
taking<00:01:54.720> cal<00:01:55.049> points<00:01:55.200> off<00:01:55.409> my<00:01:55.770> lair<00:01:56.280> block<00:01:56.610> for

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
taking cal points off my lair block for

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
taking cal points off my lair block for
sure<00:01:57.090> um<00:01:57.329> i<00:01:57.930> guess<00:01:57.990> i<00:01:58.170> could<00:01:58.229> put<00:01:58.439> something

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
sure um i guess i could put something

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.770 
sure um i guess i could put something
else<00:01:58.829> there<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.430> a<00:02:00.180> lot<00:02:00.299> better<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
else there now for a lot better of a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.050 
else there now for a lot better of a
task<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.229> um<00:02:01.560> probably<00:02:02.159> put<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.850> don't

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
task to um probably put like I don't

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.240 
task to um probably put like I don't
know<00:02:03.180> ever<00:02:03.570> tas<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.860> these<00:02:05.009> days
