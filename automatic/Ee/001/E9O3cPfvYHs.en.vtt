digital reverb delay pedal set like a
really<00:00:27.029> fast<00:00:27.269> delay<00:00:27.660> like<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> quick

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
really fast delay like a just a quick

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.350 
really fast delay like a just a quick
like<00:00:28.830> slap<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:30.859> so<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.360> doesn't

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
like slap like so it's just like doesn't

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.520 
like slap like so it's just like doesn't
doesn't<00:00:33.739> feedback<00:00:34.739> at<00:00:34.920> all<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.280> one

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
doesn't feedback at all it's just one

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.690 
doesn't feedback at all it's just one
that<00:00:37.530> kind<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.739> soften<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.520> this

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
that kind of soften it up with this

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.080 
that kind of soften it up with this
reverb<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.750> little<00:00:39.930> bit<00:00:40.309> sometimes<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.610> put<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
reverb a little bit sometimes I put the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.750 
reverb a little bit sometimes I put the
compressor<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.469> can

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
compressor on a little bit just so I can

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.010 
compressor on a little bit just so I can
get<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:44.969> bit<00:00:45.120> more<00:00:45.300> definition<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
get a little bit more definition out of

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.299 
get a little bit more definition out of
the<00:00:46.079> notes<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.739> don't<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the notes but we don't need to do that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.119 
the notes but we don't need to do that
right<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.500> main<00:00:49.710> sort<00:00:50.070> of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
play kind of really fast and I'm picking

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:21.340 
play kind of really fast and I'm picking
and<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.450> play

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.450 

they<00:02:22.350> don't<00:02:22.560> clean<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.800> little<00:02:23.160> bit<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.430> can

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
they don't clean a little bit so you can

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:34.860 
they don't clean a little bit so you can
see<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.730> little<00:02:23.970> bit<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.210> here<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.630> over

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:44.250 

you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.470 

so<00:02:45.260> many<00:02:45.530> quarters<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.040> see<00:02:46.220> see<00:02:47.060> them<00:02:47.270> but

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
so many quarters you see see them but

00:02:47.480 --> 00:03:03.920 
so many quarters you see see them but
it's<00:02:47.599> like

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.649 

so<00:03:04.920> I'm<00:03:05.250> basically<00:03:05.400> picking<00:03:05.970> out<00:03:06.180> as<00:03:06.299> fast<00:03:06.510> as

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
so I'm basically picking out as fast as

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.009 
so I'm basically picking out as fast as
I<00:03:06.750> can

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
I can

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.339 
I can
or<00:03:07.319> something<00:03:08.069> like<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.489> close<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.689> so

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
or something like it close to that so

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.679 
or something like it close to that so
then<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.670> only<00:03:11.790> other<00:03:11.879> parts<00:03:12.329> of<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.480> song

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
then the only other parts of the song

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.000 
then the only other parts of the song
are<00:03:12.870> there's<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.079> solo<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.650> then<00:03:13.799> there's<00:03:13.950> a

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
are there's a solo and then there's a

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.119 
are there's a solo and then there's a
bridge<00:03:14.189> section<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.819> guess<00:03:15.390> I'll<00:03:15.540> show<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
bridge section I guess I'll show you the

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.920 
bridge section I guess I'll show you the
solo<00:03:17.129> part<00:03:17.489> feels<00:03:17.879> like<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.390> play<00:03:18.569> it<00:03:18.689> with

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
solo part feels like this I play it with

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.559 
solo part feels like this I play it with
a<00:03:18.989> much<00:03:19.140> more<00:03:19.319> over<00:03:19.620> driven<00:03:19.920> sound<00:03:20.159> but

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
a much more over driven sound but

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.550 
a much more over driven sound but
important<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.659> that<00:03:21.780> sound<00:03:22.079> though<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.379> this

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
important to that sound though is this

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.020 
important to that sound though is this
delay<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:24.720> slap<00:03:25.109> back<00:03:25.400> slap<00:03:26.400> look<00:03:26.670> like<00:03:26.819> just

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
delay this slap back slap look like just

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:58.910 
delay this slap back slap look like just
a<00:03:27.120> quick<00:03:27.359> little<00:03:27.750> delay

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:08.000 

next<00:03:59.670> is<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.910> bridge<00:04:00.120> section<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:07.770> I<00:04:07.800> wrote

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
next is the bridge section so I wrote

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.370 
next is the bridge section so I wrote
that<00:04:08.040> part<00:04:08.370> on<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.580> piano<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.420> just<00:04:10.170> kind<00:04:10.319> of

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
that part on the piano so I just kind of

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.080 
that part on the piano so I just kind of
doubled<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.830> on<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.010> guitar<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.550> then<00:04:11.940> the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
doubled it on the guitar and then the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:40.130 
doubled it on the guitar and then the
underlying<00:04:12.510> chords

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.900 

and<00:04:41.140> then<00:04:41.290> that's<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.680> that's<00:04:42.220> all<00:04:42.430> this<00:04:42.730> is

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
and then that's it that's all this is

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.880 
and then that's it that's all this is
the<00:04:43.060> because<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:44.290> think<00:04:44.410> that's<00:04:44.620> pretty<00:04:44.770> much

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
the because I think that's pretty much

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.850 
the because I think that's pretty much
all<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.310> parts<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:45.760> song<00:04:45.970> and<00:04:46.960> so<00:04:47.530> there

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
all the parts of the song and so there

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.010 
all the parts of the song and so there
you<00:04:47.950> have<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.160> that's<00:04:48.460> adolescence<00:04:50.010> enjoy
