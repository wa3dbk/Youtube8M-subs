00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.960
 a greeting from androidworld at the stand 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.320
 samsung is trying if no galaxy 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.210
 also 8.08 point zero of course the 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.919
 screen size with resolution 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:25.819
 dual screen tft android to version 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:28.759
 4 2 jelly bean quad core processor from 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:30.440
 1.6 ghz 2 GB ram 5 camera 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.840
 megapixel 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.190
 see what i can call address from 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.960
 1.3 megapixels 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.780
 here we have 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.270
 one flap for the 1 sim for the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.739
 micro sd then expandable love over i 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.079
 check audio this year also 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.780
 camera without flash the ignition 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.920
 budget balance and sometimes 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.730
 red 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.000
 below we have double micro speaker door 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.940
 usb and the slot for read it well in 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.470
 this case is 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.760
 nola but we can't 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.989
 because you have entered it 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.989
 in front we have the key of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.070
 exactly like in galaxy design 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 note galaxy s Greek 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.270
 obviously 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 the system is really very very 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.860
 reactive you see all the optimization 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.810
 of samsung has carried on over the years 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.430
 like various smartphones now also up 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.050
 no tablet like this though 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.560
 definitely 2gb of ram 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.030
 however solidity can really put it 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.580
 many of the other tablets are embarrassed 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.520
 opponents important thing to say 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.800
 obviously galaxy note then 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.660
 possibility to use all the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.750
 pen system with all the various 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.530
 gesture then key back open 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.530
 so menu key 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.530
 by carving out we can show 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.130
 we can make a cutout taking 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.090
 pressed the button on the pen for later 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.100
 share it, edit it, etc. 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.840
 etc 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.920
 we have the phone option 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.350
 because this is the 16 gigabyte version 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.240
 with telephone possibility of course 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.260
 this is the version presented in a 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.020
 happy there will be others in the future 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.910
 here we have pressed the m key 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.930
 you see appeared for the dart stickers 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.910
 to do 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.430
 we have the multi window so we can 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.580
 for example open chromates and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.080
 androidworld can open the map for 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.210
 show the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.950
 so two apple apps started 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.069
 at the same time this thing 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.620
 important to say here is the key 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.829
 for her diamond and we also have cossu 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.180
 the speaker to call classes is 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.689
 positioned exactly like one 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.939
 smartphone 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.469
 what does it mean that the tablet from 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.719
 object being used would not be 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:43.060
 always 8-inch phone calls too 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.560
 therefore bringing it closer to the head 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.180
 supporting it directly with values and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.879
 that makes it very interesting 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.180
 design quite attractive too 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:55.490
 if already used 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.580
 and above all also very very light 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.580
 then
