00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.610 

also<00:02:32.580> wired<00:02:33.110> before<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.140> showed<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.590> a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
also wired before I showed you a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.250 
also wired before I showed you a
Bluetooth<00:02:35.070> one<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:35.610> now<00:02:36.600> let's<00:02:38.180> show<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:40.970> my

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
wired keyboard and again plug it in so

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.380 
wired keyboard and again plug it in so
I'm<00:02:48.990> doing<00:02:49.140> all<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.560> plugging<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.130> now<00:02:50.700> for

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
I'm doing all the plugging in now for

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.110 
I'm doing all the plugging in now for
some<00:02:51.600> reason<00:02:51.990> when<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.260> plug<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.740> hub

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
some reason when you plug in the hub

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.570 
some reason when you plug in the hub
just<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.240> hub<00:02:54.560> connected<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.709> your<00:02:55.860> Nexus<00:02:56.250> 7

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
just the hub connected to your Nexus 7

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.110 
just the hub connected to your Nexus 7
and<00:02:57.800> then<00:02:58.800> click<00:02:59.130> connect<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.970> other

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
and then click connect the other

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.080 
and then click connect the other
peripherals<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.990> doesn't<00:03:01.860> recognize<00:03:02.850> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
peripherals it doesn't recognize the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.210 
peripherals it doesn't recognize the
other<00:03:03.240> peripherals<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.380> if<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:05.040> all<00:03:05.190> at

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
other peripherals so if you do it all at

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.310 
other peripherals so if you do it all at
the<00:03:05.580> same<00:03:05.610> time<00:03:05.820> connect<00:03:06.810> what<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.050> want<00:03:07.230> to

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
the same time connect what you want to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.820 
the same time connect what you want to
the<00:03:07.440> bub

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
the bub

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.949 
the bub
then<00:03:08.130> plug<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.519> in<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:09.480> going<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.750> work<00:03:09.930> just

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
then plug it in it's going to work just

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:22.270 
then plug it in it's going to work just
fine<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:12.530> let's<00:03:13.530> now<00:03:13.980> do<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.280> connecting

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.820 

and<00:03:22.820> you'll<00:03:22.970> see<00:03:23.240> those<00:03:24.050> two<00:03:24.290> lights<00:03:24.500> on<00:03:24.740> the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
and you'll see those two lights on the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.620 
and you'll see those two lights on the
hub<00:03:25.010> just<00:03:25.040> meant<00:03:25.520> that<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.850> others<00:03:27.430> parts

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
hub just meant that the others parts

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.440 
hub just meant that the others parts
registered<00:03:30.280> now<00:03:31.280> let's<00:03:31.460> do<00:03:31.640> some<00:03:31.850> rearranging

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
registered now let's do some rearranging

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:43.240 
registered now let's do some rearranging
so<00:03:32.780> we<00:03:33.740> can<00:03:33.950> see<00:03:34.160> everything<00:03:36.310> all<00:03:37.310> right

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.400 

so<00:03:44.250> I'll<00:03:44.730> just<00:03:45.030> show<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.239> out<00:03:45.510> here<00:03:45.959> just<00:03:46.290> so

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
so I'll just show it out here just so

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
you can see it's working then I'll focus

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.720 
you can see it's working then I'll focus
back<00:03:48.300> in<00:03:48.330> on<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.840> Nexus<00:03:49.200> 7<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:49.739> as<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.550> can

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
peripherals you can even use the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.379 
peripherals you can even use the
trackpad<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:14.130> scroll<00:04:14.489> up<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:14.819> down<00:04:14.910> um<00:04:17.239> or<00:04:18.239> the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
call it but basically you want to go to

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.400 
call it but basically you want to go to
language<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.590> input<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.870> then<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:24.990> can<00:04:25.169> see

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
going to increase the sensitivity it's

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.280 
going to increase the sensitivity it's
much<00:04:43.590> much<00:04:44.040> much<00:04:44.280> better<00:04:44.490> okay<00:04:45.120> so<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:46.080> can

so<00:04:52.260> let's<00:04:52.470> zoom<00:04:52.800> back<00:04:53.550> in<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.030> Nexus<00:04:54.390> just

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
so let's zoom back in on the Nexus just

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.360 
so let's zoom back in on the Nexus just
so<00:04:54.750> it's<00:04:54.900> easier<00:04:55.200> for<00:04:55.289> you<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.590> focus<00:04:56.010> on

so it's easier for you to focus on
what's<00:04:56.610> important<00:04:57.090> which<00:04:57.510> is<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.810> fact<00:04:58.080> that

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
what's important which is the fact that

that<00:05:15.379> it<00:05:16.009> is<00:05:16.090> recognizing<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.210> keyboard<00:05:17.689> and

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
that it is recognizing the keyboard and

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.320 
that it is recognizing the keyboard and
you<00:05:18.400> can<00:05:19.400> actually<00:05:19.550> set<00:05:19.909> up<00:05:19.939> the<00:05:20.150> keyboard

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
you can actually set up the keyboard

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.010 
you can actually set up the keyboard
layout<00:05:20.689> if<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:21.199> wanted<00:05:21.909> you<00:05:22.909> know<00:05:23.060> there's

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
layout if you wanted you know there's

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.260 
layout if you wanted you know there's
different<00:05:24.499> languages<00:05:25.009> you<00:05:25.069> can<00:05:25.370> have<00:05:25.550> Dvorak

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
different languages you can have Dvorak

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.300 
different languages you can have Dvorak
set<00:05:26.659> up<00:05:26.840> so<00:05:27.319> it's<00:05:27.710> really<00:05:27.979> quite<00:05:28.490> an<00:05:28.699> extensive

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
set up so it's really quite an extensive

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.730 
set up so it's really quite an extensive
way<00:05:31.569> and<00:05:32.569> you<00:05:32.870> can<00:05:33.020> press<00:05:33.139> escape<00:05:33.319> on<00:05:33.710> the

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
way and you can press escape on the

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.080 
way and you can press escape on the
keyboard<00:05:33.830> to<00:05:34.249> go<00:05:34.370> back<00:05:34.580> that's<00:05:34.849> what<00:05:34.999> I'm

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
keyboard to go back that's what I'm

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.029 
keyboard to go back that's what I'm
doing<00:05:35.330> right<00:05:35.360> now<00:05:35.539> pressing<00:05:35.960> escape<00:05:36.259> which<00:05:37.009> is

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
doing right now pressing escape which is

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.080 
doing right now pressing escape which is
pretty<00:05:37.370> cool<00:05:37.629> the<00:05:38.629> windows<00:05:38.960> button<00:05:40.090> doesn't

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
pretty cool the windows button doesn't

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.670 
pretty cool the windows button doesn't
do<00:05:41.389> anything<00:05:41.810> but<00:05:42.050> we<00:05:42.169> you<00:05:42.289> know<00:05:42.319> you<00:05:42.439> can

I'm see you can use the mouse I'm using
the<00:05:48.589> keys<00:05:48.830> right<00:05:49.759> now<00:05:52.300> to<00:05:53.300> do<00:05:53.479> and<00:05:53.810> operate<00:05:54.229> and

the keys right now to do and operate and

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.929 
the keys right now to do and operate and
use<00:05:54.620> what<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:54.889> keyboard<00:05:55.310> and<00:05:55.370> mouse<00:05:55.430> should<00:05:55.759> do

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:55.939 
use what a keyboard and mouse should do

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.149 
use what a keyboard and mouse should do
it's<00:05:56.150> kind<00:05:56.360> of<00:05:56.389> cool<00:05:56.569> all<00:05:56.979> connected<00:05:57.979> through

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
it's kind of cool all connected through

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:03.339 
it's kind of cool all connected through
USB<00:05:58.550> so<00:05:59.509> let's<00:05:59.990> go<00:06:00.199> over<00:06:00.409> and<00:06:01.389> write<00:06:02.389> an<00:06:03.169> email

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
USB so let's go over and write an email

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:12.719 
USB so let's go over and write an email
to<00:06:04.300> my<00:06:05.300> users<00:06:06.310> press<00:06:07.310> tab<00:06:10.599> hello<00:06:11.599> everyone

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
to my users press tab hello everyone

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.439 
to my users press tab hello everyone
this<00:06:13.729> is<00:06:13.789> a<00:06:14.060> really<00:06:15.020> simple<00:06:15.830> way<00:06:16.219> to<00:06:16.279> show<00:06:16.939> how

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
this is a really simple way to show how

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:35.610 
this is a really simple way to show how
to<00:06:17.509> connect<00:06:19.539> keyboard<00:06:20.539> and<00:06:20.659> mouse

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.380 

so<00:06:36.620> as<00:06:36.680> you<00:06:36.830> can<00:06:36.950> see<00:06:37.010> it's<00:06:37.370> pretty<00:06:37.550> simple<00:06:38.120> you

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
so as you can see it's pretty simple you

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.990 
so as you can see it's pretty simple you
can<00:06:38.540> do<00:06:38.660> all<00:06:38.810> the<00:06:38.960> backtracking<00:06:39.530> if<00:06:40.460> I<00:06:40.610> wanted

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
can do all the backtracking if I wanted

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.210 
can do all the backtracking if I wanted
I<00:06:41.740> can<00:06:42.740> highlight<00:06:43.250> you<00:06:43.910> can't<00:06:44.180> really<00:06:45.220> you

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
I can highlight you can't really you

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.820 
I can highlight you can't really you
have<00:06:46.340> to<00:06:46.520> still<00:06:46.790> use<00:06:47.030> what's<00:06:47.390> there<00:06:48.020> in<00:06:48.320> the<00:06:48.500> OS

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
have to still use what's there in the OS

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.040 
have to still use what's there in the OS
so<00:06:49.460> I<00:06:49.490> can't<00:06:49.730> really<00:06:49.850> drag<00:06:50.270> and<00:06:50.570> click<00:06:50.720> at

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
so I can't really drag and click at

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.440 
so I can't really drag and click at
least<00:06:51.320> not<00:06:51.560> in<00:06:51.590> this<00:06:52.240> application<00:06:53.240> maybe

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
least not in this application maybe

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.930 
least not in this application maybe
other<00:06:53.690> applications<00:06:54.380> allow<00:06:54.620> for<00:06:54.920> but<00:06:55.670> it

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
other applications allow for but it

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.810 
other applications allow for but it
still<00:06:56.590> does<00:06:57.590> a<00:06:57.620> good<00:06:58.520> job<00:06:58.580> I<00:06:59.150> can<00:06:59.300> cut<00:06:59.510> it<00:06:59.660> I<00:07:00.820> can

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
still does a good job I can cut it I can

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.600 
still does a good job I can cut it I can
paste<00:07:02.060> it<00:07:02.330> and<00:07:05.320> here<00:07:06.320> it<00:07:06.410> is<00:07:06.440> keyboard<00:07:07.400> and

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
paste it and here it is keyboard and

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.930

other devices as well that's support OTG

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.470 
other devices as well that's support OTG
it<00:07:14.450> works<00:07:14.690> for<00:07:14.900> the<00:07:15.080> Motorola<00:07:15.710> Xoom<00:07:16.480> pretty

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.330 
it works for the Motorola Xoom pretty
much<00:07:17.600> any<00:07:17.840> of<00:07:17.900> the<00:07:18.110> Tegra<00:07:18.440> devices<00:07:18.919> out<00:07:19.070> there

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
much any of the Tegra devices out there

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.200 
much any of the Tegra devices out there
that<00:07:19.820> support<00:07:20.240> OTG<00:07:20.720> and<00:07:21.400> many<00:07:22.400> many<00:07:22.640> others<00:07:23.000> so

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
that support OTG and many many others so

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.450 
that support OTG and many many others so
let<00:07:26.210> me<00:07:26.330> know<00:07:26.419> what<00:07:26.570> you<00:07:26.660> think<00:07:27.310> there<00:07:28.310> is<00:07:28.430> a

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
let me know what you think there is a

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.270 
let me know what you think there is a
question<00:07:28.970> on<00:07:29.060> the<00:07:29.210> battery<00:07:29.570> drain<00:07:29.979> this<00:07:30.979> thing

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 
question on the battery drain this thing

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.670 
question on the battery drain this thing
is<00:07:31.580> you<00:07:32.090> know<00:07:32.210> powering<00:07:32.810> the<00:07:32.930> hub<00:07:33.169> it's

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 
is you know powering the hub it's

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.920 
is you know powering the hub it's
powering<00:07:34.220> the<00:07:34.490> keyboard<00:07:34.940> powering<00:07:35.630> the<00:07:35.750> mouse

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
powering the keyboard powering the mouse

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.730 
powering the keyboard powering the mouse
so<00:07:36.590> if<00:07:36.650> you<00:07:36.740> have<00:07:36.830> a<00:07:36.890> power-hungry<00:07:38.740> keyboard

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:39.740 
so if you have a power-hungry keyboard

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.710 
so if you have a power-hungry keyboard
and<00:07:40.010> mouse<00:07:40.160> you<00:07:40.610> know<00:07:40.640> you<00:07:40.790> might<00:07:41.210> be<00:07:41.240> seeing

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 
and mouse you know you might be seeing

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.080 
and mouse you know you might be seeing
not<00:07:42.530> that<00:07:42.710> many<00:07:42.860> hours<00:07:43.040> out<00:07:43.340> of<00:07:43.370> the<00:07:43.550> Nexus<00:07:43.940> 7

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.090 
not that many hours out of the Nexus 7

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:50.500 
not that many hours out of the Nexus 7
so<00:07:44.390> that's<00:07:44.510> a<00:07:44.690> drawback<00:07:45.700> but<00:07:46.700> I<00:07:48.970> am<00:07:49.970> going<00:07:50.300> to

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.510 
so that's a drawback but I am going to

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.409 
so that's a drawback but I am going to
look<00:07:50.720> into<00:07:51.050> how<00:07:51.260> um<00:07:52.220> I'm<00:07:52.760> getting<00:07:53.120> a<00:07:53.180> power

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:53.419 
look into how um I'm getting a power

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:55.719 
look into how um I'm getting a power
source<00:07:53.720> later<00:07:54.050> this<00:07:54.260> evening<00:07:54.410> and<00:07:54.830> so<00:07:55.370> I'm

00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:55.729 
source later this evening and so I'm

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:57.760 
source later this evening and so I'm
hoping<00:07:56.240> that<00:07:56.390> I<00:07:56.419> can<00:07:56.630> connect<00:07:57.080> a<00:07:57.200> power<00:07:57.380> source

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:57.770 
hoping that I can connect a power source
