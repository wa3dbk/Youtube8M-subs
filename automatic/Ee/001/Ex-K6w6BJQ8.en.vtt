 international electronics as an option 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.890

 everything to maintain the essence of the seal 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.730
 make good events with the stamp 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.590
 promote the seal well and above all 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.620
 take great care of the electronics and make it 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.680
 an elegant purist electronic and without 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.270
 move to the commercial side that stops 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.270
 we are the dark side I think 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.230

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.450
