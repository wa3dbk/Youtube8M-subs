00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.069
 hi girls in this video I 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.799
 bet from the base 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.000
 how to wash your hair 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.980
 correctly you will see that is going 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.480
 change your life no there has not been 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.219
 millions of ways to wash your hair 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.009
 but there are still some rules of 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.380
 basis to respect 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.449
 rule number 1 we brush our hair 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.300
 before going in the shower why 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.980
 because it avoids filling the drink 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.599
 of hair thinks personally 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.019
 me intimidated motton who are disgusting 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.519
 to his ouster who in addition 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.750
 completed I do because when we 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.120
 think I'm doing in the mouth follows 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.559
 no hair is a hundred times more these 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.600
 case types so it's more are 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.050
 fragile when you're a doctor 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.270
 rule number 2 we apply a doctor 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.030
 which are about shampoo only 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.489
 at the root of the hair suit mass 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.680
 and at the war the fingertips the 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.170
 pack is missed we will massage gently 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.670
 it's useless to come mass and 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.110
 hair if he thinks everything is okay 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.570
 think it can create menus 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.969
 saleh would be to break them it's not 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.859
 really seconds so a little 25 under 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.350
 shampoo the one I use 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.240
 otherwise it's the work of art 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.909
 oil to heal seems to flourish 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.499
 but I want to add my brilliant so 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.649
 if the man has not more than that line the 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:21.509
 number 3 we march and we still mass 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.409
 think a little bit about the passage you 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.689
 receive when you go to the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.079
 hairdresser but it gives no more than ten 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.780
 seconds 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.609
 no to lisbon 2 minutes of relaxation 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.289
 it'll be plenty to clean up 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:36.509
 your rule number 4 is washed with water 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.189
 warm and rinse with cold water because 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.259
 another one to sing it's going to dry up 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.579
 the hair we are going to have more and more 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.929
 to present it's really not good 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.250
 since it comes with more water 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.719
 cool when we will succeed 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.399
 it will give a little more shine 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.780
 to the hair is going to close them also 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.119
 to have an area where you can be more 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 shining rule number 5 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.780
 the conditioner is applied to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.340
 lengths only good level of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.849
 roots because it's going to weigh down the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.709
 hair 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.450
 if you have too much volume 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.009
 your taste there you can go with 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.879
 a little bit of revitalizing in my 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.729
 roots 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:06.239
 rule number 6 we wash potron often 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.579
 the hair 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.079
 ideally 2 to 3 weeks is what 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.000
 is advised but if you are able 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.160
 to do like me the little confession 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.180
 I wash them once a week 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
 only 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.569
 it's not easy to arrive I'm 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.010
 arrived by may appear is that the 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.290
 market responds with gentleman's hair 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.480
 but try a little more 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.220
 wash maybe one day at a time 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.290
 independent but you will end up there 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.690
 go you go see you will not have them 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.510
 greasy hair and number 7 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.970
 we apply a care without rinsing on the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.310
 spikes my favorite product is that 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.560
 from dove 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.569
 nourishing oil that is really 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.770
 add shine that moisturizes and 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.090
 the hair so we even tiny 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.250
 little when the hair is still tied to 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.110
 the end of the shower we liked it like that 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.209
 I'm just a little bit in your skin 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.709
 too powerful will dry after all that goes 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.660
 really moisturize the hair there 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.220
 will have no crisis of type feed in 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.290
 same time it's for nothing in the world 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.030
 and that's how we wash 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.170
 good hair if you have any 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.700
 questions or comments left 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.830
 the justiciers in wood that will make a 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.120
 pleasure to answer is also remember
