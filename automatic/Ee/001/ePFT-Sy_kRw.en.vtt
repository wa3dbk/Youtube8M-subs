00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 i 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.230
 m 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.720
 hello girls that such today I bring you a tag 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.599
 I was asked by some girls that is the 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.550
 tag clouds confidential is worth what good and 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.070
 the lips I carry the market jumbo in 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.410
 the garnet tone and good I go with the 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.670
 questions are only 77 questions so 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.629
 Good to tell you that everything I 'm going to 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.629
 teaching is what I'm taking 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.400
 right now in this season because if 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.800
 answer questions with everything 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.480
 I have to teach other things 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.860
 different is worth but right now the clothes 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.420
 of winter I have it saved so 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.550
 well, I teach what I'm using 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.949
 right now first question the most 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.000
 old that you have in your wardrobe is worth 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.769
 chosen a short because it is not so 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.299
 remember I think it's the oldest 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.970
 that I have a I think I bought it for 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.550
 I know 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.650
 with 16 17 years old I know but I did not 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.290
 put much the same if I think that is what 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.390
 oldest I have I also have a 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.100
 good coat but now I no longer have 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.190
 this this here is a normal being 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.230
 without more is from bershka 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.820
 of a summer collection and well then 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.080
 I think to write it with the center 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.310
 incorporated and I think it's the most 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.340
 old that I have 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.659
 after 2 the newest thing you have in your 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.000
 good closet you know that I recently 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.619
 I went shopping first so then 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.119
 I teach one of the clothes that I still do not 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.170
 premiere could teach us but 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.170
 Well lame and the same 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.640
 is this here for example you see that 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.229
 It still has the label and well 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.049
 As it is unused, I will say that 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.670
 it's the most of the last thing that I've 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.940
 bought so what's newer than 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.940
 I have 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.600
 that the most expensive is worth the most expensive 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.300
 I have actually is a coat of these 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 expensive, but it's saved 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.290
 then I have chosen some sandals 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.930
 for now for this season that are 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.759
 of the most expensive I have, they are worth 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.569
 one moment 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.989
 are there still are not these are the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.689
 platform zara sandals in a 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.819
 red tone and that is tied here to the ankle 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.999
 I know 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.769
 black and good I think it cost me 40 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:31.750
 euros because they were not on sale so 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:34.810
 Well, I'm going to say these burn 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.120
 no that 's the 3 pardon 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.640
 4 the cheapest thing you have so good I've 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.680
 caught 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.360
 this that coincidentally is still without 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.250
 premieres because it does not make time for 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.830
 premiere it but good I already have it from 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.280
 a little while ago is this shirt 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.830
 here 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.890
 It's a black shirt that has a combination 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.410
 the cotton with with this fabric as well as 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.960
 of blouse has a favorite below and 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.720
 if you do not remember evils of bloods 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.000
 and it cost me two euros are such a thing 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.980
 that's why I say it's very cheap so 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.370
 Well, I've chosen this as the most 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.370
 cheap 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.950
 of the bargain it's worth as a band I've caught 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.510
 a shirt any of these from 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.849
 lefties worth it could have caught another 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.590
 but a party because I love you 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.630
 in a mino tone with this pattern here 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.280
 in the neck beautiful and good is that 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.840
 for me everything I bought in lefties from 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.790
 rebates is bargain because maybe in 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.010
 season costs 13 euros ten euros 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.830
 this I do not know what it would cost 10 euros 8 euros 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.680
 out there and of rebates is a euro two 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.660
 euros then I think a bargain like that 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.640
 that therefore this same for example of 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.930
 leptis is worth 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.310
 6 biggest loss of money not really 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.110
 I have nothing of this that says to the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.840
 thrown away the money I no longer use it because I 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.790
 everything I buy I use but good 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.970
 chosen one 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.370
 good and the mess 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.410
 in short I have chosen this white American 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.440
 so not American of sanÃ¡ if I do not remember 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.840
 bad summer I bought because I di 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.340
 mind that I would like to have 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.960
 had a white American with several 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.510
 times I needed it but then the 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.330
 buy and looking a bit at best with 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.290
 some dress from time to time but not 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.270
 I like the effect that the 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.489
 American as the kind of dresses that 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.890
 I wear in the summer I prefer a windbreaker 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.530
 cowgirl or something like that then this one does not 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.880
 I'm putting practically nothing 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.040
 I took it from sales that cost me 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.020
 ten euros so it's also not a throw 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.060
 a lot of money but let's say that 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.139
 is what I have so I use less than 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.569
 I bought 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.919
 and then the last question and you choose 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.599
 your three favorites of the moment 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.610
 tried to take varied things to not 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.560
 teach all clothes if not everything would be taught 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.479
 so I 've chosen this blouse 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.789
 Primark that I love and I am 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.370
 putting lots because it drives me crazy is 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.229
 so I like both the way 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.139
 the the fabric as the design then 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.990
 Well, in love with her, it's worth it, you know 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.180
 which is the lovely butterflies like that 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.699
 What a good choice I have chosen a 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.289
 I have chosen this bag that I wear it 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.639
 more than I thought but I know that 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.620
 the color I had was not going to combine 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.960
 so much but nevertheless I love it for 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.460
 example with a total look in one color 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.879
 for example as black or navy blue or 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.490
 well and break with this color in the bag 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.930
 it fascinates me then I'm using it 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.599
 very much now in spring of January what 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.430
 I will use even more this glasses of 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.870
 stradivarius I bought it in sales and then 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.870
 that very charming with him 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.210
 and this is the favorite 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.140
 forgive me even though I have fallen, I have chosen 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.780
 a necklace that I'm putting on 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.240
 much more than I thought too 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.210
 what is this I think is blood if not 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.610
 I remember badly 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.470
 ok it 's like that black and then it's that I 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.000
 combines for example look today if not 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.520
 had as a post and I would combine 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.289
 ok with shirts with blouses with 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.080
 jerseys is that it combines me with many 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.370
 things and it's so nice I do not know my 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.169
 I like how it is with everything 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.340
 necklaces that you can not put it with 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.810
 everything for example this necklace is a bit 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.090
 harder to combine I do not know why 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.580
 but I find it more difficult to combine it but this 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.110
 for example very easy with any 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.030
 you wear it when I do not know what necklace 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.680
 put a resource to him that is already 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:11.080
 solved so good as this one 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.669
 and those are my three favorites and nothing else 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.289
 I hope you liked the tav 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.139
 who asked me to have it 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:20.460
 liked it too and we encourage you to do it 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.460
 besito chao
