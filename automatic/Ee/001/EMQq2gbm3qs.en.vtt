00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.420
 iphone 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.709
 I am with my iphone here as you 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.600

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.880
 I give now 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.240
 works on all versions 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.140
 the first thing would have to be the first 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.090
 downloaded new program that 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:27.530
 you can find it here on the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:29.480
 desk esi to open so the whole 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.080
 open now 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.190
 so now this window has appeared 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.930
 to jailbreak 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.520
 the very first thing we have in this now 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.820
 program has to do is you have to 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.000
 do not push anything but you just have to 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:49.640
 Plug the USB cable to your iphone 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.400
 So just a little bit now is my iphone 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.080
 connected to the computer here 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.390
 He also shows me jailbreak directly here 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.620
 and it's really pretty easy 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.210
 install it all now 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.210
 he just presses jailbreak once 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.900
 and now comes this beam thereby 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.390
 that should go pretty fast and 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.370
 Your iphone should be jailbroken 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.680
 So you do not need fashion before that 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.560
 So it's really pretty easy 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.230
 may take only five minutes and 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.820
 already you have the jailbreak on your 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.820
 iphone installed 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.129
 if we have to continue now we have to 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.709
 first unlock our device and now 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.409

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.400
 minutes is super easy and 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.930
 go really fast 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.150
 we can do all this on the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.410
 computer also theoretically close 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.870
 we now have to stop just yet 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.299
 wait until our device restarts 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.300
