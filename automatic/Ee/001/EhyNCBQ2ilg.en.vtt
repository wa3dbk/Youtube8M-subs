to major in chemical engineering because

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.380 
to major in chemical engineering because
I<00:00:42.270> enjoyed<00:00:42.629> math<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.260> science<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.950> chemistry

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
Institute of chemical engineers and on

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.060 
Institute of chemical engineers and on
the<00:02:06.179> chemi<00:02:06.390> car<00:02:06.660> composition<00:02:07.320> team<00:02:07.530> with

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
the chemi car composition team with

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.469 
the chemi car composition team with
something<00:02:08.399> called<00:02:08.550> Cammy<00:02:08.850> car<00:02:09.149> competition

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
something called Cammy car competition

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.650 
something called Cammy car competition
which<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:09.959> basically<00:02:10.440> constructing<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.250> car

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
which is basically constructing a car

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.300 
which is basically constructing a car
using<00:02:12.660> chemical<00:02:13.110> engineering<00:02:13.440> principles

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
using chemical engineering principles

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.979 
using chemical engineering principles
that<00:02:14.519> is<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.360> supposed<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.750> run<00:02:15.930> a

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
that is that is supposed to run a

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.690 
that is that is supposed to run a
certain<00:02:16.230> distance<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.860> traditionally<00:02:17.430> we've

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
certain distance and traditionally we've

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.330 
certain distance and traditionally we've
we've<00:02:18.030> done<00:02:18.060> very<00:02:18.420> well

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.830 

we<00:02:21.850> also<00:02:22.000> have<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> brand<00:02:22.390> new<00:02:22.450> chemical

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
we also have a brand new chemical

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.199 
we also have a brand new chemical

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
engineering Student Center which is

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.640 
engineering Student Center which is

what's going on in it are going it is a
difficult<00:02:48.160> major<00:02:48.670> but<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.330> rewards<00:02:49.780> are<00:02:49.930> well

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
difficult major but the rewards are well

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.800 
difficult major but the rewards are well
worth<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.709> effort
