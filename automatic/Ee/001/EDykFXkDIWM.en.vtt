00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.350
 wiemer i'm right that gas i have 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.810
 the only thing that has to live is 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.420
 So I should do the halves accordingly 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.520
 I watch my race for so long 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.650
 do not hold that when I'm burdening him 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.930
 enter that on yourself 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.150
 within a short time these blades of grass 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.770
 it is the race to land 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.440
 it 's bad what about the 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.120
 other breeds shaded half of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.699
 I can barras with wide half 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.559
 shorter pieces hold and they look there 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.410
 so it really springs and if I once 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.790
 it's over again immediately 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.530
 many come and say I leave too 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.780
 my grass so beautiful, we grow as 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.370
 quite nice one comes from the lawnmower 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.040
 and then somehow on this 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.980
 higher and mowed right bottom just zack 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.950
 the blade of grass is the only thing that is 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.050
 in principle, the lungs of the gas when they 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.610
 come and let the grass grow that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.680
 grazes on this metabolism 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.690
 set and say okay I have now 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.940
 the area available my lungs it 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.060
 healthy and then comes the lawn mower and 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.600
 what does god cut 84% away one man 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.920
 Get the clear grass first shock 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.659
 accordingly it starts and reduces 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.409
 its growth that makes no reserves 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.760
 cost more 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.790
 so look for this first 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.100
 injury shock to heal a lot 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.659
 It is more important when they go and 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.220
 the gas to a certain length 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.049
 then set the grass on his 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.729
 adjust metabolism and 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.510
 keep that through weekly 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.610
 more on one not too deep but on 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.890
 a height and just go there and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.840
 say okay my glass can 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.960
 metabolism moderately to these conditions 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.040
 set and accordingly it can 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.570
 continue to grow when I am 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.759
 go too low just go in heat 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.580
 burns my floor because of the soil 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.009
 heats up when it is heat than even 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.780
 make sense to let the grass longer with it 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.310
 between the blades of grass microclimate 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.560
 can form that the grass quasi the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.380
 Ground shaded and protects as well 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.160
 These are very important things the length 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.230
 the grass plays a big role in it 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.820
 in the moment big the grass regularly 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.799
 Mow I said it branches 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.780
 then, by the way , a completely different one 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.579
 Tear resistance when in shivering 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.410
 lawn have then they have a few 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.269
 blades of grass they step on 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.980
 that does not feel good for the feet 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.980
 the lake barefoot but also the lawn 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.750
 passes 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.970
 The power per halls is just too big 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.440
 he breaks in when they race the dense 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.180
 then they can just go smooth 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.180
 go over it then it is very relaxed
