weekend I've got to go back to work on

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.440 
weekend I've got to go back to work on
Monday<00:00:10.219> which<00:00:11.219> means<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.639> next<00:00:11.849> post<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.300> not

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
Monday which means the next post is not

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.960 
Monday which means the next post is not
going<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.599> be<00:00:12.750> until<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.950> following<00:00:14.130> weekend

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.060 

my<00:00:17.970> last<00:00:18.180> series<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.630> videos<00:00:18.869> was<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.380> bit

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
my last series of videos was a bit

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.609 
my last series of videos was a bit
technical<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:21.000> apologize<00:00:21.630> for<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.230> so

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
technical I do apologize for that but so

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.099 
technical I do apologize for that but so
it's<00:00:23.220> an<00:00:23.369> ongoing<00:00:23.490> project<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.410> do<00:00:25.410> eventually

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
it's an ongoing project I do eventually

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.000 
it's an ongoing project I do eventually
want<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.260> see<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.560> through<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.769> completion

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
want to see it through to completion

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.160 
want to see it through to completion
because<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.699> did<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.359> lead<00:00:30.599> working

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
because I did have that lead working

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.410 
because I did have that lead working
fully<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.669> properly<00:00:33.170> some<00:00:34.170> years<00:00:34.350> back<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:36.239> I

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
fully and properly some years back and I

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.959 
fully and properly some years back and I
fully<00:00:36.660> intend<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> gate<00:00:37.230> working<00:00:37.620> again<00:00:37.969> but

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
fully intend to gate working again but

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.020 
fully intend to gate working again but
anyway<00:00:40.520> this<00:00:41.520> video<00:00:42.950> you<00:00:43.950> may<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:44.579> you've

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
anyway this video you may if you've

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.520 
anyway this video you may if you've
watched<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.750> last<00:00:45.870> video<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
watched the last video and if you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.430 
watched the last video and if you
haven't<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.160> blame<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:48.230> but<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> may

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
haven't I don't blame you but you may

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.840 
haven't I don't blame you but you may
have<00:00:49.469> noticed<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> directory<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
have noticed in the directory that I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.470 
have noticed in the directory that I
build<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.379> from<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.800> desk<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.730> little<00:00:54.300> file

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
build up from the desk was a little file

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
build up from the desk was a little file
called<00:00:54.750> spectrum<00:00:56.390> yes<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.199> spectrum

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
called spectrum yes it is a spectrum

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.479 
called spectrum yes it is a spectrum

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
emulator for the Commodore 64 something

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.780 
emulator for the Commodore 64 something
you<00:01:02.609> may<00:01:02.910> or<00:01:03.480> may<00:01:03.719> not<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:04.290> seen<00:01:04.500> before<00:01:04.890> I'll

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you may or may not have seen before I'll

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.609 
you may or may not have seen before I'll
just<00:01:06.000> fight<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> older<00:01:07.049> win<00:01:07.409> vice

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
just fight up on the older win vice

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:18.210 
just fight up on the older win vice
emulator<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> look

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.560 

there<00:01:19.220> we<00:01:19.340> are

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.410 

spectrum<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.880> was<00:01:25.060> made<00:01:25.299> by<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:27.790> programmed<00:01:28.299> I

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
spectrum it was made by all programmed I

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.060 
spectrum it was made by all programmed I
should<00:01:28.570> say<00:01:28.750> by<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:28.990> company<00:01:29.350> called<00:01:29.409> Whitby

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
should say by a company called Whitby

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.370 
should say by a company called Whitby
computers<00:01:31.170> way<00:01:32.170> back<00:01:32.380> in<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.590> day<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:35.140> only

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
computers way back in the day the only

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.999 
computers way back in the day the only
downside<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:37.600> does<00:01:37.960> emulate<00:01:38.560> spectrum

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
downside is it does emulate spectrum

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.609 
downside is it does emulate spectrum
perfectly<00:01:39.549> but<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.000> only<00:01:40.119> emulates<00:01:40.810> spectrum

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
perfectly but it only emulates spectrum

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.289 
perfectly but it only emulates spectrum
basic<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:44.049> Commodore<00:01:44.439> 64<00:01:45.009> was<00:01:45.220> never<00:01:45.670> fast

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
basic the Commodore 64 was never fast

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.840 
basic the Commodore 64 was never fast
enough<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:49.020> emulate<00:01:50.130> another<00:01:51.130> processor<00:01:51.729> it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
enough to emulate another processor it

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.310 
enough to emulate another processor it
was<00:01:51.970> only<00:01:52.119> barely<00:01:52.360> fast<00:01:52.689> enough<00:01:52.929> to<00:01:53.049> run<00:01:53.080> it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
was only barely fast enough to run it

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.990 
was only barely fast enough to run it

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
could never hope to emulate a z80

processor<00:02:05.250> which<00:02:06.250> run<00:02:06.549> much<00:02:06.789> faster<00:02:07.030> natively

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
processor which run much faster natively

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.800 
processor which run much faster natively
if<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.259> remember<00:02:08.739> then<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.729> Commodore<00:02:10.119> 64<00:02:10.630> did

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
if I remember then the Commodore 64 did

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.270 
if I remember then the Commodore 64 did
anyway<00:02:11.760> even<00:02:12.760> with<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.269> cp/m<00:02:14.100> cartridge<00:02:15.100> which

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
anyway even with a cp/m cartridge which

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.070 
anyway even with a cp/m cartridge which
had<00:02:15.459> as<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.700> 80<00:02:15.850> processor<00:02:16.480> built<00:02:16.600> in<00:02:16.810> it

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
had as that 80 processor built in it

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.009 
had as that 80 processor built in it
still<00:02:17.410> could<00:02:17.650> not<00:02:18.060> fully<00:02:19.060> emulate<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.569> spectrum

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
still could not fully emulate a spectrum

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.930 
still could not fully emulate a spectrum
however<00:02:22.709> wepa<00:02:23.709> computers<00:02:24.250> did<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.459> very<00:02:24.670> very

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
however wepa computers did a very very

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.550 
however wepa computers did a very very
good<00:02:25.209> job<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:26.579> emulating<00:02:27.579> spectrum<00:02:28.030> basic

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
good job of emulating spectrum basic

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.699 
good job of emulating spectrum basic
they<00:02:29.560> made<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.859> look<00:02:30.160> like<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.760> spectrum<00:02:31.709> when

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
they made it look like the spectrum when

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.760 
they made it look like the spectrum when
it<00:02:32.829> but<00:02:33.010> when<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.340> fires<00:02:34.030> up

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.790 

and<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.310> has<00:02:37.460> all<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:38.050> all<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.110> beat<00:02:39.410> commands

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
and it has all the all the beat commands

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.090 
and it has all the all the beat commands
and<00:02:40.010> everything<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.930> tried<00:02:45.140> its<00:02:45.350> best<00:02:45.380> and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
and everything and it tried its best and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.450 
and everything and it tried its best and
we<00:02:46.280> like<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.990> memory<00:02:48.350> model<00:02:49.190> as<00:02:49.310> well

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
we like the the memory model as well
