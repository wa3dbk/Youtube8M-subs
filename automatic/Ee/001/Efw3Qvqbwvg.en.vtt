bucks<00:00:53.280> apiece<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.270> replaced<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.969> bottom

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
bucks apiece so I replaced this bottom

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.720 
bucks apiece so I replaced this bottom
of<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> fender<00:00:57.620> which<00:00:58.620> inside<00:00:59.280> if<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.609> can

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of the fender which inside if you can

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.170 
of the fender which inside if you can
