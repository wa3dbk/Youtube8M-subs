00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.670
 looking at the illusion I do not see a team 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.259
 so bad is a very good team I say 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.240
 unfortunately we have found 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.830
 have suffered from injuries that have not 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.620
 We may also love to have your equipment 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.269
 complete but it was barrier the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.960
 important hiring and bud came what 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.910
 his knee not unfortunate situation and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.830
 has come from touching the saved bus 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.800
 pardoned a torrado saved also a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.930
 long time he was injured and after 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.320
 doing it was injured Castro or is it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.700
 come like this in some bad ones or with 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.170
 we hurt the Chaco 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.719
 fortunately it is not a serious injury 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.450
 that today he has it back in the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.219
 courts then are circumstances but 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.540
 gave has the players have the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.280
 names has the campus for in 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.660
 any time wake up what does not 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.680
 we want to heal with us that's why there's 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 than having the ball you have to be 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.640
 attentive and play with that determination 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.700
 that we have been showing 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.350
 reiterate I tell you if you see the way in 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.570
 extracted from the equipment if it should be 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.190
 well but in a game with the players 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.949
 that they have with the specific fish 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.559
 they can not rely bone can 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.900
 arrive at the best time with the best 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.130
 numbers in the league but in the cup in 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.159
 this moment the pairings of the two 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.960
 transforms semifinal 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.299
 they obviously come with people 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.520
 recovering people who studied who was 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.079
 injured but nothing is a team 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.200
 easy, not the other way around, it's a very 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.179
 very strong with important names that 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.770
 obviously they have not been able to amalgamate 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.079
 to be able to play what they were doing 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.270
 in other tournaments you have not subscribed 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.789
 but if you play a tournament in this type of 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.280
 demand to win it and we have 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.380
 taken very seriously and we are not yet 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.000
 in an instance where we can think of 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.099
 win it we're just in the semifinal 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.770
 I will not think about consul today in the 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:46.159
 tomorrow night to aspire to 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.310
 what follows but concentrated on that not 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.079
 I believe that in this team for more than 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.379
 you win a tournament enough what 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.840
 you also have to go out and win 

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:59.810
 Here you earn a title and do not know 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.700
 you are ready the requirement of each year of 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.709
 each tournament and each competition of 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.090
 this team is to win it 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.439
 that's why it marks the story and it's the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.730
 This club's tradition is not 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.620
 so 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.270
 the ones you tell me today that they said the cup 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:16.250
 it's more than enough new for nothing 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.920
 the most sure are rubens and much rubens 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.500
 because it's still not 100 if we go 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.630
 have it on the court but we can not 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.200
 knowing that they are not 100 we can not 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.090
 put 22 loads so strong we are going to 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.120
 wait as safely as expected 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.980
 tomorrow, a little 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.080
 fatigued from the area where where 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.510
 they have the discomforts I train well 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.460
 but it is fatigued then I do not 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.940
 I want to put double charge let's wait 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.830
 tomorrow but a lot yes is discarded 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.570
 let's try to play with the idea of 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.160
 that we want to win is not because 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.720
 respect and to say to respect 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.330
 is playing and now I'm not going to play 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.490
 with those in the situation of the 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.190
 foreigners is more difficult because the 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.610
 regulation does not allow me 3 to use 3 in 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.370
 the court not because it allows me one more 3 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.500
 but of the 5 I have to choose three and of 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.510
 boyfriends and a mine but good things if 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.650
 you are the tournament's top scorer and 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.650
 if then to respect it
