00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360
 hi I'm brave avoided capable of you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:11.360
 Are you watching comics? 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.600
 Your beauty, my name is vinícius. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.490
 program is in the comics the goal I 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.310
 I hope some of you take this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.289
 Gulf reference is than what 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.150
 if you know how we say super 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.689
 goal reinforced today I decided to bring 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.009
 Schedule 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.590
 the monthly magazine of the avengers 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.930
 published by panini here in brazil she 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.340
 since the edition number 23 to increase its 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.840
 very important for everything that goes 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.790
 It happens from now on in the universe 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.739
 marvel comics did not let open 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.289
 A parenthesis, I have arrived all this 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.350
 phase and such I did not take it I needed 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.460
 even secret wars and I knew that 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.050
 those are consequences of what was 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.000
 happening here in that monthly then 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.160
 I tried to read everything that the river wrote the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.510
 avengers until the secret wars and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.120
 also my first four 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.710
 issues including that legal mega saga only 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.229
 to situate you let me pick up the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.510
 my cola is here measuring the panini 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.110
 In this of the avengers we have the edition 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.070
 18 of the new avengers and 29th edition of the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.470
 Avengers 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.140
 while united sides to new magazine 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.900
 Avengers finished the 33rd edition and the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.850
 avengers in issue 44 then only to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.170
 have a sense of what happened and how much 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.689
 We have to get there to get there. 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.950
 delay here in brazil for 19 10 months in 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.049
 mouth what is happening in the states 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.180
 united but what I want to comment with 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.610
 You're the one who likes it too much, it's worth it. 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.229
 every second each page because the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.750
 hickmann really got it right 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.479
 both in the new avengers and in the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.670
 avengers in fact before here 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.860
 edition 23 of the magazine when it started 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.540
 actually in the avengers 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.750
 I was finding it annoying all that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.240
 idea of using the dodô ex mil come 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.280
 to land I found a foolishness that the new 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.530
 characters that came from nowhere to place 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.750
 none but he always fought hard in the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.579
 part of the 22 has always been a magazine 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.530
 very cool and now at that point 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.930
 specific I think it starts to hit 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.850
 in the two only taking what he did in 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.770
 new avengers in it at the very beginning 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.479
 You must have heard this whole idea 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.640
 I say this on the channel but I have 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.620
 that cite the province is complete 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.599
 It's all this plot of das 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.860
 the alternatives will clash with the 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.720
 soon ours 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.580
 the avengers arguing if it is to be 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.680
 morally acceptable destroyed another 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.750
 planet just to save one of them putz 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.430
 man, this sucks because I do not have 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.680
 way to define why something is the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.230
 seal the captain america with the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.239
 bandit the week deals with something else 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.579
 and you have to decide on the future of 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.769
 whole planet I was accustomed to 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.900
 the stage of the good of the avengers where they 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.180
 they fought harder than the bandits 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.280
 minors did not have something of a scale 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.709
 so big so often 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.840
 and here the rhythm put the heroes minute 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.959
 scale up to that point in the journal 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.180
 is all this plot of the incursions they were 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.819
 a secret of the illuminati only they knew 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.099
 only they tried to deal with the problem and 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.390
 now thanks to original sin is 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.060
 following everything knows what I am 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.829
 speaking this secret it was revealed and the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.930
 from now on, I think that the 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.549
 two magazines have in this mix that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.430
 with the avengers they are 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.310
 interesting because their focus they 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.769
 are to circulate the focus of them are thus 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.239
 with their incursions to achieve because 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.989
 talk while in the new 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.209
 Avengers 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.700
 we see the illuminati still having to 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.310
 to deal with the planets by clashing with 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.650
 ours on the part of the avengers 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.690
 You will see Captain America hunting the 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.669
 Tony Stark and I will not tell you why dish 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.650
 lessa magazine because the reason is very 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.169
 cool, then let me stop for a moment 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.209
 here in this video to him to expose the 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.129
 how much hickmann is a good writer created a 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.400
 problem for avengers on a scale 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.560
 absurd in the interdimensional brought 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.680
 tony stark and steve return conflict 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.239
 rogers but in a justified way knows 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.329
 they are not fighting for free do not have 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.280
 a good built face very good motif 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.169
 even and it also works very well 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.199
 the conflict between the courtship and the panther 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.129
 black and it's more of a hero fight 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.930
 justified that expensive 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.239
 so they 're not fighting over 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.980
 nothing because I see many comics from 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.959
 heroes being published where the 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.720
 characters are always fighting more 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.329
 rarely the reasons convince me and here 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.789
 Man is everything very well worked and by 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.440
 order the rich menu and he took everything 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.449
 he did it in the marvel from the beginning everything 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.610
 that he did in the fantastic quartet in the 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.469
 supreme and now that the avengers and 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.389
 put everything in the same story for 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:28.830
 which will be the hors circuit 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.919
 a meg-knowledge that is selling that neither 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.840
 water in the marvão commercial success absurd 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.219
 I like to practice a 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.409
 prostitute is one of my writers 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.150
 favorites there also write project 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.860
 manhattan whats the picture is very good 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.569
 and finally, I do not like to follow everything 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.520
 what happens in the marvel universe wants 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.319
 stay inside the sagas that is 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.930
 happening with the characters 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.029
 this is a good starting point and 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.099
 if they are looking for an attack right at the beginning they 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:55.020
 explain everything that has already happened 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.479
 a summary I think you can understand 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.789
 quietly most importantly a comic book 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.889
 quality hero I think my 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.889
 Lefler is going to like it 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.819
 Good now, I'll update you on 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.500
 some aspects of the comics I created a 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.779
 twitter by channel sim 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.580
 after years we have a twitter has the 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.139
 My instagram is not really in the 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.240
 personal instagram but perhaps within the 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.889
 Channel I do not know, I'm betting everything. 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.930
 I read every day, I know I go there. 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.550
 I hit a picture like that and put it on 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.039
 I'll tell you then, if you want 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.289
 follow that friend collector of you 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.389
 It's there to actually stay. 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.279
 than to learn to touch a stranger who 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.279
 interdirectly to see the last 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:38.279

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:40.199

 click there and have a look I created the blog 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.000
 mainly because there is a lot 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.000
 that I can not produce a video is 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.770

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.490
