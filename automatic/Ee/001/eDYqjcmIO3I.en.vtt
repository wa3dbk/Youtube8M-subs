00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.359 
the unboxing of the multimedia Bluetooth
controller<00:00:16.240> by<00:00:16.840> the<00:00:16.900> famous<00:00:17.349> company<00:00:17.829> I<00:00:17.859> pega

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
controller by the famous company I pega

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.329 
controller by the famous company I pega
so<00:00:19.179> I<00:00:19.239> previously<00:00:19.839> did<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.079> video<00:00:20.560> on<00:00:21.069> one<00:00:21.310> of

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:21.339 
so I previously did a video on one of

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.159 
so I previously did a video on one of
their<00:00:21.550> lower<00:00:21.759> end<00:00:21.970> models<00:00:22.329> and<00:00:22.810> this<00:00:22.960> is<00:00:23.050> the

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
their lower end models and this is the

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.739 
their lower end models and this is the
updated<00:00:23.499> one<00:00:23.800> with<00:00:23.980> multimedia<00:00:24.339> controls<00:00:25.060> so

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:25.749 
updated one with multimedia controls so

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.300 
updated one with multimedia controls so
I<00:00:25.779> have<00:00:26.140> to<00:00:26.259> say<00:00:26.380> I<00:00:26.409> had<00:00:26.679> pretty<00:00:26.919> mixed

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
I have to say I had pretty mixed

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.620 
I have to say I had pretty mixed
opinions<00:00:27.729> about<00:00:27.880> the<00:00:28.089> other<00:00:28.239> one

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
opinions about the other one

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.300 
opinions about the other one
I<00:00:28.659> mean<00:00:28.839> I<00:00:28.929> found<00:00:29.199> the<00:00:29.319> actual<00:00:29.679> feel<00:00:29.919> of<00:00:29.949> it<00:00:30.189> to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
I mean I found the actual feel of it to

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.679 
I mean I found the actual feel of it to
be<00:00:30.429> kind<00:00:30.669> of<00:00:30.789> nice<00:00:30.939> and<00:00:31.239> it<00:00:31.329> was<00:00:31.419> very<00:00:31.569> very

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
be kind of nice and it was very very

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.930 
be kind of nice and it was very very
portable<00:00:32.169> however<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.190> actual<00:00:33.309> buttons<00:00:33.790> and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
portable however the actual buttons and

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.360 
portable however the actual buttons and
the<00:00:34.000> joysticks<00:00:34.480> felt<00:00:34.870> pretty<00:00:35.200> crummy<00:00:35.590> so

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
the joysticks felt pretty crummy so

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.010 
the joysticks felt pretty crummy so
while<00:00:36.670> that<00:00:36.700> controller<00:00:37.360> sells<00:00:37.720> for<00:00:37.870> around

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
while that controller sells for around

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.110 
while that controller sells for around
15<00:00:38.530> pounds<00:00:38.770> this<00:00:39.040> one<00:00:39.370> sells<00:00:39.610> for<00:00:39.730> more<00:00:39.970> like

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
15 pounds this one sells for more like

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.080 
15 pounds this one sells for more like
20<00:00:40.600> so<00:00:40.990> I<00:00:41.320> guess<00:00:41.680> more<00:00:41.920> or<00:00:42.010> less<00:00:42.130> $30<00:00:42.820> if<00:00:42.970> you're

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
20 so I guess more or less $30 if you're

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.060 
20 so I guess more or less $30 if you're
in<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.300> US<00:00:43.630> and<00:00:43.900> for<00:00:44.470> that<00:00:44.590> price<00:00:44.860> you're

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
in the US and for that price you're

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.530 
in the US and for that price you're
basically<00:00:45.610> you<00:00:45.970> know<00:00:46.060> you're<00:00:46.180> paying<00:00:46.330> as<00:00:46.510> much

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
basically you know you're paying as much

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.330 
basically you know you're paying as much
as<00:00:46.810> you<00:00:46.900> would<00:00:47.020> for<00:00:47.140> an<00:00:47.230> Xbox<00:00:47.560> 360<00:00:48.130> or<00:00:48.160> a

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
as you would for an Xbox 360 or a

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.910 
as you would for an Xbox 360 or a
PlayStation<00:00:48.940> 3<00:00:48.970> controller<00:00:49.630> so<00:00:49.930> I<00:00:50.200> guess<00:00:50.800> we

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
PlayStation 3 controller so I guess we

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.790 
PlayStation 3 controller so I guess we
can<00:00:51.070> set<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.280> budget<00:00:51.490> compared<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.180> that<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.710> the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
can set a budget compared to that so the

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.230 
can set a budget compared to that so the
packaging<00:00:54.190> has<00:00:54.280> come<00:00:54.490> a<00:00:54.730> little<00:00:54.850> bit<00:00:55.030> messed

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
packaging has come a little bit messed

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.450 
packaging has come a little bit messed
up<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:55.660> honestly<00:00:56.170> it's<00:00:56.380> not<00:00:56.710> quite<00:00:57.010> as<00:00:57.190> nice

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
up and honestly it's not quite as nice

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.100 
up and honestly it's not quite as nice
as<00:00:57.700> I<00:00:57.820> was<00:00:57.970> sort<00:00:58.150> of<00:00:58.240> hoping<00:00:58.300> it<00:00:58.660> would<00:00:58.780> be<00:00:58.810> it

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
as I was sort of hoping it would be it

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.380 
as I was sort of hoping it would be it
feels<00:00:59.350> a<00:00:59.650> little<00:00:59.980> bit<00:01:00.070> superficial<00:01:00.730> but<00:01:01.329> I

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
feels a little bit superficial but I

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.569 
feels a little bit superficial but I
have<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.660> say<00:01:01.840> this<00:01:02.140> controller<00:01:02.560> looks<00:01:02.800> really

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
have to say this controller looks really

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.910 
have to say this controller looks really
really<00:01:03.940> cool<00:01:04.150> I<00:01:04.449> mean<00:01:04.869> I<00:01:05.019> have<00:01:05.259> to<00:01:05.350> say<00:01:05.500> fully

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
really cool I mean I have to say fully

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.649 
really cool I mean I have to say fully
looks<00:01:06.159> better<00:01:06.399> than<00:01:06.609> the<00:01:06.729> 360<00:01:07.329> and<00:01:07.359> the<00:01:07.509> ps3

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
looks better than the 360 and the ps3

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.050 
looks better than the 360 and the ps3
controller<00:01:07.960> I<00:01:08.560> really<00:01:09.399> do<00:01:09.520> think<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.819> wagon

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
controller I really do think the wagon

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.639 
controller I really do think the wagon
block<00:01:10.270> works<00:01:10.600> nicely<00:01:10.929> and<00:01:11.350> this<00:01:11.439> is<00:01:11.619> a

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
block works nicely and this is a

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.709 
block works nicely and this is a
significant<00:01:12.460> update<00:01:12.609> from<00:01:12.969> the<00:01:13.119> previous<00:01:13.539> one

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
significant update from the previous one

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.840 
significant update from the previous one
you<00:01:13.749> can<00:01:14.020> already<00:01:14.289> tell<00:01:14.530> that<00:01:14.590> much<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.609> first

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
you can already tell that much so first

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.279 
you can already tell that much so first
of<00:01:15.999> all<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.240> can<00:01:16.390> tell<00:01:16.600> that<00:01:16.749> the<00:01:16.869> joysticks

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
of all you can tell that the joysticks

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.139 
of all you can tell that the joysticks
are<00:01:17.409> raised<00:01:17.649> so<00:01:18.009> they're<00:01:18.549> raised<00:01:18.729> just<00:01:18.939> as

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
are raised so they're raised just as

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.639 
are raised so they're raised just as
much<00:01:19.329> as<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.479> standard<00:01:19.929> console<00:01:20.289> controller

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
much as a standard console controller

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.319 
much as a standard console controller
which<00:01:20.920> means<00:01:21.159> they're<00:01:21.369> easier<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.729> move<00:01:22.030> and

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
which means they're easier to move and

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.760 
which means they're easier to move and
it<00:01:22.719> also<00:01:22.810> means<00:01:23.109> you<00:01:23.200> can<00:01:23.319> press<00:01:23.530> them<00:01:23.710> down

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
it also means you can press them down

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.669 
it also means you can press them down
for<00:01:24.159> an<00:01:24.219> extra<00:01:24.490> control<00:01:24.969> option<00:01:25.359> so<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.319> d-pad

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
for an extra control option so the d-pad

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.139 
for an extra control option so the d-pad
still<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.009> little<00:01:27.249> bit<00:01:27.369> mushy<00:01:27.579> but<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.969> side

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
still a little bit mushy but the side

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.669 
still a little bit mushy but the side
buttons<00:01:28.509> are<00:01:28.600> definitely<00:01:28.929> improved<00:01:29.319> and<00:01:29.619> the

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
buttons are definitely improved and the

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.580 
buttons are definitely improved and the
ones<00:01:29.829> on<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.009> bottom<00:01:30.039> feel<00:01:30.520> very<00:01:30.819> nice<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:32.530> I

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
ones on the bottom feel very nice see I

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.319 
ones on the bottom feel very nice see I
have<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:32.920> say<00:01:33.039> overall<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.459> initial<00:01:33.999> feel<00:01:34.179> of

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
have to say overall the initial feel of

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.270 
have to say overall the initial feel of
this<00:01:34.420> is<00:01:34.659> really<00:01:34.990> really<00:01:35.139> good<00:01:35.439> it's<00:01:36.039> still

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
this is really really good it's still

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.219 
this is really really good it's still
very<00:01:36.639> very<00:01:36.939> light<00:01:37.149> probably<00:01:37.659> a<00:01:37.719> little<00:01:37.899> bit<00:01:38.109> on

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
very very light probably a little bit on

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.139 
very very light probably a little bit on
the<00:01:38.380> 2<00:01:38.590> light<00:01:38.799> side<00:01:39.100> over<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.850> actual

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
the 2 light side over the actual

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.520 
the 2 light side over the actual
placement<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.689> these<00:01:40.780> back<00:01:41.020> buttons<00:01:41.380> as<00:01:41.499> well

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
placement of these back buttons as well

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.139 
placement of these back buttons as well
is<00:01:41.829> actually<00:01:41.950> quite<00:01:42.369> nifty<00:01:42.789> and<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:42.939> think

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
is actually quite nifty and I think

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.309 
is actually quite nifty and I think
they've<00:01:43.329> done<00:01:43.359> a<00:01:43.509> really<00:01:43.689> good<00:01:43.899> job<00:01:43.959> with<00:01:44.139> the

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
they've done a really good job with the

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.379 
they've done a really good job with the
ergonomics<00:01:44.799> here<00:01:45.009> now<00:01:45.579> I<00:01:45.639> mean<00:01:45.969> Android

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
ergonomics here now I mean Android

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:47.879 
ergonomics here now I mean Android
Bluetooth<00:01:46.719> controllers<00:01:47.229> have<00:01:47.350> always<00:01:47.560> had<00:01:47.859> a

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
Bluetooth controllers have always had a

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:50.010 
Bluetooth controllers have always had a
problem<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.579> sort<00:01:49.359> of<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.479> slight<00:01:49.719> lack<00:01:49.869> of

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
problem of sort of a slight lack of

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.959 
problem of sort of a slight lack of
optimization<00:01:50.859> I<00:01:51.069> don't<00:01:51.700> think<00:01:51.819> there's

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
optimization I don't think there's

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.879 
optimization I don't think there's
anyone<00:01:52.329> art<00:01:52.569> which<00:01:52.810> flawlessly<00:01:53.380> allows<00:01:53.709> you

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:53.889 
anyone art which flawlessly allows you

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:55.980 
anyone art which flawlessly allows you
to<00:01:54.069> navigate<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.880> Android<00:01:55.240> UI<00:01:55.420> with<00:01:55.959> a

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
to navigate the Android UI with a

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.440 
to navigate the Android UI with a
Bluetooth<00:01:56.380> controller<00:01:56.829> like<00:01:57.069> this<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.420> is

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
Bluetooth controller like this but it is

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.849 
Bluetooth controller like this but it is
improving<00:01:59.109> and<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.380> number<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.709> actual

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
improving and the number of actual

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.639 
improving and the number of actual
supported<00:02:00.490> games<00:02:00.729> is<00:02:00.880> also<00:02:01.090> on<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.569> rise<00:02:01.779> so<00:02:02.619> I

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
supported games is also on the rise so I

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.199 
supported games is also on the rise so I
suppose<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:03.249> usefulness<00:02:03.609> of<00:02:03.819> something<00:02:04.119> like

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
suppose the usefulness of something like

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.519 
suppose the usefulness of something like
this<00:02:04.389> is<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:04.810> going<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:05.020> continue<00:02:05.409> to

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:05.529 
this is just going to continue to

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:07.709 
this is just going to continue to
increase<00:02:05.679> so<00:02:06.249> I<00:02:06.429> think<00:02:07.029> it'll<00:02:07.299> be<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.479> pretty

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
increase so I think it'll be a pretty

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.109 
increase so I think it'll be a pretty
worthy<00:02:08.140> investment<00:02:08.679> anyway<00:02:09.580> guys<00:02:09.700> thanks<00:02:10.090> for

worthy investment anyway guys thanks for
