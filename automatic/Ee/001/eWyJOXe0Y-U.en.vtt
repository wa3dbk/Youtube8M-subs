00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
into the air cleaner bottom there so

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.900 
into the air cleaner bottom there so
that's<00:03:01.110> cool<00:03:03.560> snap<00:03:04.560> there<00:03:05.160> held<00:03:05.400> together<00:03:05.580> but

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
that's cool snap there held together but

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.690 
that's cool snap there held together but
it's<00:03:06.030> right<00:03:06.360> with<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.570> spring<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.220> let's<00:03:08.370> get<00:03:08.520> to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
it's right with a spring so let's get to

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.190 
it's right with a spring so let's get to
the<00:03:08.790> part<00:03:09.030> we've<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.330> going<00:03:09.630> for<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.990> mower

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
the part we've all going for the mower
