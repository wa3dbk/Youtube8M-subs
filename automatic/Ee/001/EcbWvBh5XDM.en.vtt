00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
absolutely yes that's exactly what

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
absolutely yes that's exactly what
happened<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.090> me<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.450> see<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:02.660> refrain

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
happened to me and I see that refrain

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.819 
happened to me and I see that refrain
particularly<00:03:04.590> amongst<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.370> young<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.959> the

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
particularly amongst the young in in the

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.490 
particularly amongst the young in in the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
West and it causes me some concern

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.920 
West and it causes me some concern
because<00:03:10.890> what<00:03:11.099> kept<00:03:11.280> taking<00:03:11.760> on<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.269> just

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
because what kept taking on is just

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.020 
because what kept taking on is just
parts<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.530> identity<00:03:14.310> which<00:03:14.459> really<00:03:14.730> don't

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
parts of identity which really don't

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.120 
parts of identity which really don't
have<00:03:15.239> anything<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.840> that's<00:03:16.109> also<00:03:16.650> happening

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
have anything is that's also happening

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.960 
to Muslims in India are Muslims today
going<00:03:19.650> through<00:03:19.889> the<00:03:19.980> same<00:03:20.190> experience<00:03:20.850> that

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
going through the same experience that

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.330 
going through the same experience that
Muslims<00:03:21.690> in<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> Western<00:03:22.319> victim<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.889> think

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
Muslims in the Western victim I think

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.479 
Muslims in the Western victim I think
the<00:03:23.549> Muslims<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.269> India<00:03:25.040> in<00:03:26.040> spite<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
the Muslims in India in spite of the

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.220 
the Muslims in India in spite of the
fact<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:27.000> there<00:03:27.269> have<00:03:27.420> been<00:03:27.450> communal<00:03:28.049> riots

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
fact that there have been communal riots

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.199 
fact that there have been communal riots
in<00:03:28.590> spite<00:03:28.829> of<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.069> fact<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.519> justice<00:03:30.030> has

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
in spite of the fact that justice has

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.349 
in spite of the fact that justice has
not<00:03:30.239> been<00:03:30.709> got<00:03:31.709> even<00:03:32.670> then<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:32.880> think<00:03:33.239> the

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
not been got even then I think the

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.210 
not been got even then I think the
Indian<00:03:33.720> Muslim<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.350> safer<00:03:34.829> place

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
Indian Muslim is in a safer place

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.410 
Indian Muslim is in a safer place
because<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.540> Indian<00:03:37.170> Muslim<00:03:37.620> has<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.579> stake

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
because the Indian Muslim has a stake

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.580 
because the Indian Muslim has a stake
and<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.950> space<00:03:41.459> in<00:03:41.730> India's<00:03:42.329> democracy<00:03:42.989> it's<00:03:43.380> a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
and a space in India's democracy it's a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.259 
and a space in India's democracy it's a
very<00:03:43.950> huge<00:03:44.310> thing<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.730> we<00:03:44.850> are<00:03:44.910> part<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.150> a

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
very huge thing that we are part of a

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.660 
very huge thing that we are part of a
democracy<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.989> Indian<00:03:46.680> Muslim<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.310> aspire

people weren't really affected with
during<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.259> December<00:04:37.830> rats<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.729> when

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
during the December rats and when

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.180 
during the December rats and when
January<00:04:39.629> happened<00:04:39.990> when<00:04:40.229> they<00:04:40.590> got<00:04:40.860> affected

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
January happened when they got affected

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.129 
January happened when they got affected
it's<00:04:41.520> when<00:04:41.699> they<00:04:41.879> woke<00:04:42.240> up<00:04:42.389> but<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.960> thing<00:04:43.110> is

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
it's when they woke up but the thing is

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.659 
it's when they woke up but the thing is
because<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.590> was<00:04:43.740> right<00:04:43.979> there<00:04:44.220> on<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.430> streets

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
because I was right there on the streets

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.520 
because I was right there on the streets
and<00:04:44.789> I'm<00:04:44.849> so<00:04:45.030> completely<00:04:45.449> consumed<00:04:46.020> by<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.259> the

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
and I'm so completely consumed by it the

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.619 
and I'm so completely consumed by it the
minute<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:46.830> would<00:04:47.039> speak<00:04:47.460> about<00:04:47.849> it<00:04:48.090> there

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
minute I would speak about it there

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:50.719 
minute I would speak about it there
would<00:04:48.780> be<00:04:48.810> this<00:04:49.050> hushed<00:04:49.620> kind<00:04:50.039> of<00:04:50.190> silence<00:04:50.610> I

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
would be this hushed kind of silence I

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.999 
would be this hushed kind of silence I
was<00:04:50.879> not<00:04:51.240> allowed<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.900> talk<00:04:52.110> about<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.860> and

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
was not allowed to talk about it and

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.980 
was not allowed to talk about it and
suddenly<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.580> was<00:04:53.729> being<00:04:53.970> branded<00:04:54.419> a<00:04:54.539> Muslim

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
suddenly I was being branded a Muslim

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.499 
suddenly I was being branded a Muslim
but<00:04:55.650> my<00:04:56.069> reaction<00:04:56.550> was<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:56.819> same<00:04:56.849> during<00:04:57.389> the

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
but my reaction was the same during the

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.930 
but my reaction was the same during the
secrets<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.349> I<00:04:58.620> had<00:04:58.770> reacted<00:04:59.009> exactly<00:04:59.430> in<00:04:59.819> the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
secrets and I had reacted exactly in the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.029 
secrets and I had reacted exactly in the
same<00:05:00.150> way<00:05:00.330> at<00:05:00.509> that<00:05:00.539> time<00:05:00.750> this<00:05:01.139> wasn't<00:05:01.800> flung

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
same way at that time this wasn't flung

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.089 
same way at that time this wasn't flung
at<00:05:02.190> me<00:05:02.340> so<00:05:02.550> that<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.419> me<00:05:03.449> was<00:05:04.080> very<00:05:04.860> very
