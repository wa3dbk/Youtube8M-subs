00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.610
 a data about two to a new good video 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.440
 news nothing quite pretty 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.779
 interesting are you going to freak out some 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.920
 very much very much very much good I 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.330
 the truth is that it has caught me quite 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.840
 by surprise it's not the typical news that 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.340
 you see from glancing and flipas pretty good 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.199
 it seems that there is a project in progress 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.999
 For several years now, I really 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.800
 I just found out today right now 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.089
 our instants or formative is 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.449
 investigating a little more about a game 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:27.819
 more than one game about titan and how good 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.460
 which is in development and also if 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.689
 plus a pint totally 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.610
 amazing tell us a little about the 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.560
 project and so on, I think it's a 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.100
 Project financed in kickstarter and 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.410
 It is also an indie project and as I say 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.510
 then it will go to pc xbox quan and 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.490
 playstation 4 seems to be wrong 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.220
 have printed 4 has been confirmed during 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.480
 today if I'm not wrong and 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.940
 Also, I was going to use the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.360
 kremlin free and in the end they will use it in a 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.010
 1,004 to dry and that 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.390
 good as I say graphic engine change 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.160
 and the truth is that it looks totally 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.900
 awesome the video you have it in the 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.319
 description in case you want to throw a 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.060
 look and well the game will have two 

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:10.210
 playable sections 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.220
 to be able to explore all the entire titanic of 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.100
 done will be a whole recreation of everything 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.049
 the ship extensively whole and 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.990
 possibly be one of the most 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.600
 detailed that we can see even from 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.789
 movies of what is also known 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.979
 about what is known is being 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.470
 detailed to the millimeter and put in 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.020
 practice in this game with what then 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.229
 it is promised will be part of an experience 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.500
 playable only be the part as well 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.700
 a guide we could say for the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.289
 story the truth is that it is something 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.539
 quite interesting enough apart from 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.500
 it possibly has a mode with 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.659
 history in which we must do 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.950
 different things and so on to do that 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.659
 we will also live the collapse of the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.849
 boat and all this 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.979
 the bad part because it really does not 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.509
 know the departure date or anything for the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.220
 style does not cost enough to find 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.630
 information about when it will come out and other 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.970
 the game that seems to be not very 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.560
 followed by the press and all this from 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.170
 done as I say I found out about miracle 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.520
 of text and we will see if they are coming out 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.679
 more news about this game because 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.209
 they paint very very very interesting like 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.459
 when it is finished finished and others 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.300
 Well, we have more news about him and 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.010
 all this but 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.270
 it's hard to keep track of 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.200
 done so I'm going to get down to 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.180
 work 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.340
 keeping me pages and others but good 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.960
 we will see to see that what ends up suffering 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.280
 with all this age as I say it seems 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.430
 a pretty pretty project 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.860
 surprising and I do not know if these get to 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.570
 move on or the graduates if 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.300
 they need more money to complete what 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.410
 what is really going to happen if he wins 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.120
 we will have to wait and see what it is 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.010
 it happens but as I say it is a project 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.270
 quite interesting enough so 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.870
 good nothing more kids 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.870
 we go
