bundle I think they won't lose a lot of

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
bundle I think they won't lose a lot of
money<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.079> do<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> price<00:02:08.009> drop<00:02:08.160> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
money but if they do do a price drop I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.050 
money but if they do do a price drop I
think<00:02:08.520> they<00:02:08.580> should<00:02:08.729> come<00:02:08.789> out<00:02:08.879> with<00:02:08.970> a
