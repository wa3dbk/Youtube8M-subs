00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
thing that they have in common is that

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.620 
thing that they have in common is that
they're<00:00:23.310> both<00:00:23.460> vertebrates<00:00:24.119> or<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.600> a

they're both vertebrates or they have a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.689 
they're both vertebrates or they have a
backbone<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:25.949> means<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.640> that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
backbone and what this means is that

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.939 
backbone and what this means is that
when<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.150> study<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> gene<00:00:27.960> function<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> fish

when we study a gene function in a fish

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.460 
when we study a gene function in a fish
it's<00:00:29.279> remarkably<00:00:30.179> similar<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.199> see

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it's remarkably similar to what we see

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
it's remarkably similar to what we see
in<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.679> human<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> huge<00:00:33.210> advantage<00:00:33.360> of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
in a human this is a huge advantage of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.810 
in a human this is a huge advantage of
zebrafish<00:00:34.230> over<00:00:34.800> lots<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.190> other<00:00:35.309> organisms

because<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.780> allows<00:00:37.020> us<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.500> really<00:00:37.860> good

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
because it allows us to do really good
