00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.410
 the blood towards ramÃ³n that I play more 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:18.859
 malevolent rookies minus hat-trick 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.859
 this is how football is sad 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.810
 do not 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.460
 hey guys today I tell you another video of how 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.570
 customize the league of legends in 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.520
 this case I will show you how 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.630
 customize the messages that appear 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.090
 by screen like the murder 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.830
 quintuple doublet murder scored a 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.930
 so much or a mini one has destroyed one 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.580
 turret for that let's go to 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.239
 directory where we have installed the 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.100
 league of legends i in disk ce riot 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.239
 games and now for everyone to do the same 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.800
 and goff legends rats projects and here 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.920
 we have three folders that are the ones 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.460
 we are interested in the game client followed by 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.860
 something is that is for the Spaniards the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.260
 they have in Spanish of Europe what is 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.110
 by bus for those who have it in English 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.850
 from North America and heavy for those who 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.740
 they have it in English from Western Europe 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.310
 in my case I was going to change the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.220
 Spanish let's go to ministrils then 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.170
 same and now we have many here 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.119
 folders let's go to the last of all 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.190
 In this case this will contain the 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.840
 files that we want but if not with 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.090
 had to go right to 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.609
 previous 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.909
 we go to the folder that we want data 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.259
 menu I repeat that is exactly the 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.390
 procedure equal only that this 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.280
 file that is the one that we are going to modify 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.329
 I will modify Spanish people 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.340
 that you have it in English you will have to 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.890
 modify it in English first of all what 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.110
 we are going to copy and paste this file it 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.429
 can open like this normal but I'm going to 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.880
 open a text editor that is the 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.880
 notepad 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.300
 once the file is open this is 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.730
 file we're going to have to modify and 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.360
 as you see it has a lot of content 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.460
 has up to 10 thousand 829 lines and it is not 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.500
 plan to go searching online online what 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.900
 that we want to change so you can 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.140
 copy and paste good and look rather 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.770
 what I'm going to put the description 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.560
 control s 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.000
 and here it is here is pretty much what 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.160
 you have to change the league of legends 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.800
 we can continue searching here for 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.590
 example double murder we can 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.000
 Change it for 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.000
 two rookies less 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.860
 and for example here more things come out in 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.620
 larger installments are you can fix 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.730
 how he killed not that is very bland 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.769
 as he has killed has annihilated such 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.510
 person is pointing to a double murder 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.940
 this will appear first and then 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.170
 will appear the two rookies less than this 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.360
 we know everyone in league of 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.129
 legends we can also go to change 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.750
 directly the message we want by 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:02.730
 Control example f 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.700
 first 30 the first blood 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.300
 since this first blood that we can 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.300
 Change it for 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.800
 the battle has already begun 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.720
 and more messages like these what you have 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.610
 what with what you have to have a lot 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.040
 care is just changing what is 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.870
 between the quotes and never eliminate them 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.209
 the quotation marks are the same as saying 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.709
 saves is like this is going to give you an error and we 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.390
 will show the message well so 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.550
 always have backup by 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.080
 if you do not change what is 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.050
 before the equal always what is 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.030
 after the equal and the quotes and if 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.250
 you see almost everything there is 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.570
 that can be changed has the tag this 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.020
 which is the one that I have put you in 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.480
 description after this you save it 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.400
 I have kept if she would be here on 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.530
 file now when we play we are going to 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.420
 appear the messages that we have changed 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.310
 we possibly raise the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.380
 description a file that is what 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.790
 I have changed for whoever wants it for 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.180
 that is very brave to change it and what 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.830
 what to have minimally customized 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.240
 remember to have this copy and when 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.760
 applied a new patch here will appear 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.040
 another folder more so what can you 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.090
 do is directly copy the file 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.760
 that you have here we have 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.470
 us or also make a copy of 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.209
 security of the file that we have 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.250
 modified as soon as a new one is applied 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.320
 patch automatically everything we have 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.700
 changed will create another file and 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.200
 start and we will have to change it from 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.630
 new or directly with the backup 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.610
 replace the file I hope you have 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.550
