 the match is totally immortal 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.350
 the day before the match in the classic verbal skirmishes ali takes 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.480
 literally not around the ass that's another thing to his opponent 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.240
 calling him a gorilla and inviting him into the bottle and into the words by doing 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.250
 guess why this came from the web 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.180
 phranger says only two things 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.270
 hops to kill I want to rip his heart out 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.620

 ovi summary times this posthumous ali meeting said I never have 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.080
 felt so close to dying 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.620
 the situation is dramatic because at the fourteenth round a waterwalk phranger 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.710
 totally swollen and closed 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.330
 halley's text no longer sees it 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.590
 basically alien truck continuously and in malin will confess 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.740

 neither of them will fully recover because 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.810
 it was never anything more than a wild thing 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.780
