00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For this tutorial, I have already prepared my skin. After applying Mac foundation and Benefit Concealer we will continue with the eyes

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.000
First I will apply as a primer Mac Painterly on my entire eyelid

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.000
Then I will apply Mac Naked lunch with Brush E60 by Sigma

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.000
To create the perfect angle apply some tape at the corner of your eye.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:27.000
Apply shade Satin Taupe with Sigma E30 in the crease.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.000
Then you know the rule : Blend, Blend ,Blend

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:04.000
With an angled brush by Sigma E70, apply shadow Twinks in the corner of the eye by creating a V-shape

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.000
Blend the harsh lines in the corner

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.000
I like to retouch the base shadow Naked lunch, and then blend again

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:44.000
I will apply eyeliner by MAC Blacktrack with Mac 208 angled brush

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.000
Curl your lashes and apply some mascara

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I will use a black pencil eyeliner for my lower part of lashes

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.000
Smudge with color Twinks

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.000
For my contour I will use the two darker colors of Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I am lightly applying Dior Rosy Glow as a  blush

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.000
I will use some highlighter on my cheekbones

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I am applying Dior lipliner to contour my lips

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.000
Then I will apply lipstick by Deborah, shade 2 and lightly Nars Turkish delight

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And we are done!

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.000
Enjoy your Romantic date night! 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.000
You look fabulous!
