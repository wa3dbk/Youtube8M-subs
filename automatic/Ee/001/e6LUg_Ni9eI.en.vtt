00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.490 
of the leaps in one of the bounds um
well<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.270> my<00:01:33.840> stars<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.230> been

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
well for me my stars have been

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.470 
well for me my stars have been
inconsistent<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.580> I<00:01:35.820> think<00:01:36.120> I've<00:01:36.240> made<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
inconsistent so I think I've made a

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.140 
inconsistent so I think I've made a
change<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.080> should<00:01:37.620> should<00:01:38.520> help<00:01:38.730> that<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
change that should should help that and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.020 
change that should should help that and
I<00:01:39.300> feel<00:01:39.600> very<00:01:39.900> confident<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.030> obviously

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
I feel very confident in it so obviously

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.600 
I feel very confident in it so obviously
tonight<00:01:42.420> will<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.720> good<00:01:43.110> test<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.800> we'll

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
tonight will be a good test and we'll

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.830 
tonight will be a good test and we'll
see<00:01:44.790> what<00:01:44.940> we<00:01:44.970> came<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
see what we came up with but I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.810 
see what we came up with but I
definitely<00:01:46.350> feel<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.890> made<00:01:47.040> progress<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
definitely feel like I made progress and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.969 
definitely feel like I made progress and
that<00:01:48.210> that's<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.570> huge<00:01:48.900> leap<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> bound<00:01:49.440> for<00:01:49.830> me

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that that's a huge leap and bound for me

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.410 
that that's a huge leap and bound for me
is<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.340> getting<00:01:50.820> my<00:01:50.970> starts<00:01:51.270> more

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
is just getting my starts more

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.690 
is just getting my starts more
consistent<00:01:52.050> huh<00:01:52.200> i<00:01:52.440> would<00:01:53.220> say<00:01:53.370> on<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> good

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
consistent huh i would say on a good

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.910 
consistent huh i would say on a good
start<00:01:54.000> i<00:01:54.120> just<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.630> consistent<00:01:55.260> so<00:01:55.470> i

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
start i just have not consistent so i

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920 
start i just have not consistent so i
think<00:01:56.280> i<00:01:56.400> got<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.670> under<00:01:56.820> control<00:01:56.940> so<00:01:57.600> i

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
think i got that under control so i

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.649 
think i got that under control so i
think<00:01:57.990> that'll<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> huge<00:01:59.220> key<00:01:59.580> for<00:01:59.790> me<00:01:59.909> we

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
think that'll be a huge key for me we

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.300 
think that'll be a huge key for me we
heard<00:02:00.870> it<00:02:00.930> from<00:02:00.990> jake<00:02:01.229> weimer<00:02:01.470> consistency

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
heard it from jake weimer consistency

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.830 
heard it from jake weimer consistency
and<00:02:02.460> hopefully<00:02:02.790> income<00:02:03.030> over<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.330> second<00:02:03.750> win

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and hopefully income over the second win

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.930 
and hopefully income over the second win
of<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:03.960> season<00:02:04.200> here<00:02:05.070> tonight<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.430> San<00:02:05.610> Diego
