00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
constellation or our galaxy some are

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.730 
constellation or our galaxy some are
brighter<00:00:20.880> than<00:00:21.119> others<00:00:21.480> some<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:21.810> blue<00:00:22.140> some

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
brighter than others some are blue some

are white some are orange what's coming
up<00:00:26.699> now<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.300> little<00:00:27.539> blue<00:00:27.689> object<00:00:28.470> that

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
up now is this little blue object that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.339 
up now is this little blue object that
you<00:00:28.980> see<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.910> screen<00:00:30.300> that's<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.750> most<00:00:30.990> of

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
you see on the screen that's in most of

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.920 
you see on the screen that's in most of
these<00:00:31.579> what<00:00:32.579> they<00:00:32.730> look<00:00:32.940> like<00:00:32.969> our<00:00:34.010> antennas

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
these what they look like our antennas

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.920 
these what they look like our antennas
from<00:00:36.930> some<00:00:37.260> other<00:00:37.380> world<00:00:38.510> there<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:39.780> go

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
from some other world there we go

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
from some other world there we go
there's<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.410> real<00:00:40.770> good<00:00:41.040> shot<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:43.340> things<00:00:44.340> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
there's a real good shot of things that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.200 
there's a real good shot of things that
hide<00:00:45.090> inside<00:00:45.600> these<00:00:45.840> antenna<00:00:46.649> type<00:00:48.050> objects

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
hide inside these antenna type objects

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.470 
hide inside these antenna type objects
anyway<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.390> patient<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:53.120> this<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:54.270> take

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
anyway be patient because this will take

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.410 
anyway be patient because this will take
you<00:00:54.660> into<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.879> more<00:00:56.879> in-depth<00:00:57.480> look<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.260> what's

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
you into a more in-depth look at what's

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.830 
you into a more in-depth look at what's
on<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:01.140> side<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.890> these<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.690> with

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
on the side of these here we go with

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.300 
on the side of these here we go with
blue<00:01:04.080> lines<00:01:04.610> in<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.850> blue<00:01:05.970> lines<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.750> these

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
blue lines in the blue lines are these

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.170 
blue lines in the blue lines are these
ground<00:01:08.960> type<00:01:10.010> objects<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.119> if

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
ground type objects I don't know if

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.420 
ground type objects I don't know if
there<00:01:12.330> are<00:01:12.360> ships<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:14.070> know<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.280> they

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
there are ships I don't know what they

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.810 
there are ships I don't know what they
are<00:01:15.710> but<00:01:16.710> we'll<00:01:16.860> go<00:01:16.979> into<00:01:17.130> each<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:19.820> some

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
are but we'll go into each one here some

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.649 
are but we'll go into each one here some
of<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.210> brighter<00:01:21.900> than<00:01:22.170> others<00:01:23.659> but

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
of them are brighter than others but

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.070 
of them are brighter than others but
anyway<00:01:25.020> we'll<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.560> watch<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.080> you'll

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
anyway we'll just watch here and you'll

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.530 
anyway we'll just watch here and you'll
get<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.350> idea<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.740> what's<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.400> these<00:01:29.549> lines<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
get an idea of what's in these lines and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.109 
get an idea of what's in these lines and
oh<00:01:31.079> by<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.290> way<00:01:31.439> these<00:01:31.710> lines<00:01:31.979> are<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.430> over

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
oh by the way these lines are all over

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.120 
oh by the way these lines are all over
the<00:01:33.210> universe<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.869> well<00:01:34.970> there's<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:37.130> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the universe as well there's one and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.249 
the universe as well there's one and
there's<00:01:38.310> another<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.790> that's<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.900> little<00:01:40.079> bit

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
there's another one that's a little bit

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.679 
there's another one that's a little bit
bluer

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.459 

and<00:01:44.590> we're<00:01:44.799> gonna<00:01:44.890> keep<00:01:45.130> going<00:01:45.490> up<00:01:45.609> here

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
and we're gonna keep going up here

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.800 
and we're gonna keep going up here
because<00:01:47.469> they're<00:01:47.799> all<00:01:48.009> over<00:01:48.429> the<00:01:48.909> place<00:01:48.939> some

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
because they're all over the place some

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.859 
because they're all over the place some
are<00:01:49.929> orange<00:01:50.350> I've<00:01:50.649> seen<00:01:51.069> orange<00:01:51.399> ones<00:01:51.869> just

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
are orange I've seen orange ones just

00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:03.830 
are orange I've seen orange ones just
another<00:01:53.200> blue<00:01:53.439> one<00:01:55.560> far<00:01:56.560> out<00:01:56.740> isn't<00:01:57.640> it<00:02:00.420> okay

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.510 

there's<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:04.899> real<00:02:05.170> bright<00:02:05.439> one<00:02:05.649> right<00:02:06.159> next<00:02:06.369> to

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
there's a real bright one right next to

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.749 
there's a real bright one right next to
the<00:02:06.670> star<00:02:06.969> it's<00:02:07.299> bigger<00:02:07.630> than<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.259> star<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.640> it

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
the star it's bigger than the star so it

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.490 
the star it's bigger than the star so it
gives<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.090> an<00:02:10.209> idea<00:02:10.239> of<00:02:10.569> how<00:02:10.810> big<00:02:11.049> they<00:02:11.230> really

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
gives you an idea of how big they really

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.160 
gives you an idea of how big they really
are<00:02:12.060> there's<00:02:13.060> another<00:02:13.360> blue<00:02:13.660> one<00:02:13.690> way<00:02:13.959> over

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
are there's another blue one way over

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.289 
are there's another blue one way over
here<00:02:15.870> there<00:02:16.870> we<00:02:16.989> go<00:02:17.459> look<00:02:18.459> at<00:02:18.579> that<00:02:21.150> that's<00:02:22.150> the

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
here there we go look at that that's the

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.590 
here there we go look at that that's the
end<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.480> my<00:02:22.569> video<00:02:22.870> thanks<00:02:23.379> guys
