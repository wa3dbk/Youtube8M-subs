00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.939
 and the captain 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.480
 on the other hand 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.590
 - the outlook for 2010 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.100
 he adds that management 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.570
 I thought it was a joke 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 quÃ©bec quebec yes 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
 Christine Lagarde 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.830
 I did good 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 if philippe malige the arbitrator 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.580
 I am happy 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.430
 which is not the case 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.599
 this start of transfer window 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.959
 the goal is to register 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.519
 I came across the subject 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.519
 what changes 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.999
 what I am saying 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.839
 what I hope 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.489
 the highest step of the podium 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.669
 I never hid the goal of the Republicans 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.229
 no one could avoid the tumble 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.229
 a small job 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.459
 these three clubs 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:00.279
 the association 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.599
 the object of this meeting 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.080
 for example 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.520
 the show 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.539
 in this case m 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.240
 we will remember 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:10.479
 this is valid 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.479
 welcome 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.580
 stoppage 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.830
 with respect to the suspect 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:44.649
 it's a historic day
