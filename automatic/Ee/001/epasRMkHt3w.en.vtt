00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.180
 it also includes the updates that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.949
 will you be taking such snacks 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.070
 jet that they take out every time every week and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.020
 that 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.270

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.920
 play and watching the updates that 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.010
 they have and everything is very interesting to me 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.130
 they like it a lot and good they just have to give 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.500
 double click they open it is very simple I 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.909
 I think everyone has used something there 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.250
 very similar then they will not have 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.690
 disadvantages with that depending if it's 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.680
 the first time they open it, it's going to 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.810
 delay a little here opening 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.450
 downloading some things that are like 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.950
 folders and all the game files 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.410
 this is the profile of you if you 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.880
 they want they can edit profile or make one 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.580
 new I will leave it with as it is 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.740
 here they choose the version of the chosen one 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.630
 here in choose version or enable the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.910
 snacks I can enable alpha here 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.030
 and the betas of all versions 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.060
 here is that it is a safe version 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.700
 old with beta rooms from 2010 to 2011 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.030
 and the old versions of 2010 and 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.600

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.880
 good name this 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.640
 Do not touch this because if you do not 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.340
 to scrub the 20 is going to damage and ready 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.739
 they only started the game 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.110
 gives you when you start and when you take out of the jar 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.310
 they also ask you to connect low you have 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.620
 a name then they write any 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.440
 name but the low prize they put what 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.379
 premium and choose any name that 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.160
 they want and they connect and they have 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.140
 initial game that's all here goes if 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.549
 they do not have that version let's say and never 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.500
 they played that version then they're going to 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.780
 download nothing die a little bit more 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.299
 of arrest is not delayed nothing just like that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.239
 like because I already had the 1.7 point 10 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.209
 then they were already discharged equality 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.780
 for the 1.8 it's the same they just have to 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.140
 change here edit profile and choose the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.420
 1.8 or if there is a newer version 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.980

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.360

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.849
 all things sound options 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.569
