in the poll said you wanted a tutorial

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.740 
in the poll said you wanted a tutorial
on<00:00:22.949> pattern<00:00:23.369> making<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.210> that's<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.689> is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
on pattern making so that's what this is

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.250 
on pattern making so that's what this is
going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.849> now<00:00:26.849> let's<00:00:27.060> be<00:00:27.180> frank<00:00:27.359> there<00:00:28.080> is

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
going to be now let's be frank there is

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.320 
going to be now let's be frank there is
no<00:00:28.560> way<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.160> make<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:29.730> tutorial<00:00:30.060> on

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
no way I can make just one tutorial on

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.240 
no way I can make just one tutorial on
pattern<00:00:30.689> making<00:00:30.869> there's<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.830> ton<00:00:32.219> of

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
pattern making there's a ton of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.100 
pattern making there's a ton of
different<00:00:32.460> topics<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.180> possible<00:00:33.570> tutorials

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
different topics and possible tutorials

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440 
different topics and possible tutorials
I<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
I can do so this one just going to be a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330 
I can do so this one just going to be a
general<00:00:36.750> overview<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.530> sort<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.980> where<00:00:38.309> to

general overview a sort of where to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.940 
general overview a sort of where to
begin<00:00:38.550> guide<00:00:38.910> no<00:00:39.750> don't<00:00:39.930> worry<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.290> totally

plan<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.489> making<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.879> bunch<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.210> different

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
plan on making a bunch of different

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.119 
plan on making a bunch of different
tutorials<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.140> how<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.680> make<00:00:43.950> your<00:00:44.070> own

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
tutorials like how to make your own

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.549 
tutorials like how to make your own
sloper<00:00:44.820> how<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> modify<00:00:45.600> necklines<00:00:46.200> but

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
sloper how to modify necklines but

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.910 
sloper how to modify necklines but
that's<00:00:47.190> another<00:00:47.489> tutorial<00:00:48.260> now<00:00:49.260> there<00:00:49.800> are

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that's another tutorial now there are

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.069 
that's another tutorial now there are
three<00:00:49.980> ways<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.610> make<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> pattern<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.570> sloper

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
three ways I make a pattern or sloper

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.139 
three ways I make a pattern or sloper
pattern<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.590> should<00:00:53.430> probably<00:00:53.520> stop<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
pattern I should probably stop and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.119 
pattern I should probably stop and
explain<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> slow<00:00:54.960> /<00:00:55.110> pattern<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
explain what a slow / pattern is the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
explain what a slow / pattern is the
Slover<00:00:56.520> pattern<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.449> basic<00:00:58.109> no-frills

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
Slover pattern is a basic no-frills

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.700 
Slover pattern is a basic no-frills
fitted<00:00:59.460> top<00:00:59.670> that<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.539> know<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:01.020> fit<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> person

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
fitted top that I know will fit a person

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.359 
fitted top that I know will fit a person
exactly<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:03.840> use<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> base<00:01:05.010> to

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
exactly that I can then use as a base to

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.480 
exactly that I can then use as a base to
make<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.270> additional<00:01:06.750> patterns<00:01:07.140> often

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
make all additional patterns often

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.340 
make all additional patterns often
before<00:01:08.490> working<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.090> any<00:01:09.270> costume<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.049> need

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
before working with any costume I need

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.250 
before working with any costume I need
to<00:01:10.500> build<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> these<00:01:11.810> now<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.110> own

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
to build one of these now for my own

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.289 
to build one of these now for my own
Christmas<00:01:13.740> Loper<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.280> made<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> using<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
Christmas Loper I made it using a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.490 
Christmas Loper I made it using a
technique<00:01:15.659> called<00:01:15.720> pattern<00:01:16.320> drafting

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
technique called pattern drafting

there's a great book you can get and I'm

going to put the link at the bottom of
this<00:01:20.009> video<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:21.030> goes<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> process<00:01:21.900> but

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
this video that goes to the process but

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.469 
this video that goes to the process but
it's<00:01:22.920> very<00:01:23.070> math<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.640> numbers<00:01:23.790> based<00:01:24.180> or<00:01:24.360> be

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it's very math and numbers based or be

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.719 
it's very math and numbers based or be
warned<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.770> say<00:01:26.070> though<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.250> you'll<00:01:26.520> get

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
warned I will say though that you'll get

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.319 
warned I will say though that you'll get
a<00:01:26.759> very<00:01:27.360> accurate<00:01:27.479> sloper<00:01:28.170> pattern<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.619> way

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
a very accurate sloper pattern this way

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.060 
a very accurate sloper pattern this way
but<00:01:30.329> you'll<00:01:30.479> need<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.689> take<00:01:30.900> between<00:01:31.470> 40<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
but you'll need to take between 40 and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
but you'll need to take between 40 and
60<00:01:32.490> different<00:01:32.670> measurements<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.509> that's<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
60 different measurements and that's a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.830 
60 different measurements and that's a
whole<00:01:34.049> lot<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.490> those<00:01:35.729> numbers<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.720> can

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
whole lot but with those numbers you can

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.940 
whole lot but with those numbers you can
get<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> pattern<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.680> fit<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
get a pattern that will fit you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.940 
get a pattern that will fit you
perfectly<00:01:38.460> without<00:01:38.579> trial<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.360> error<00:01:39.950> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
perfectly without trial and error the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.679 
perfectly without trial and error the
second<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> make<00:01:41.729> patterns<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.450> use<00:01:42.570> an

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
second way I make patterns is to use an

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.050 
second way I make patterns is to use an
existing<00:01:42.930> shirt<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.590> asked<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.850> shirt<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
existing shirt I asked for a shirt a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.969 
existing shirt I asked for a shirt a
vest<00:01:45.360> that's<00:01:45.570> snug<00:01:45.840> thing<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.500> tie<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
vest that's snug thing not tie it and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.280 
vest that's snug thing not tie it and
not<00:01:47.159> loose<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.759> made<00:01:48.450> from<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> non<00:01:48.899> stretchy

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
not loose and made from a non stretchy

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.440 
not loose and made from a non stretchy
material<00:01:49.700> dress<00:01:50.700> shirts<00:01:50.939> work<00:01:51.149> really<00:01:51.329> well

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
material dress shirts work really well

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.899 
material dress shirts work really well
for<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.189> can<00:01:53.189> then<00:01:53.310> put<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:53.880> on

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
for this I can then put them down on

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.120 
for this I can then put them down on
newsprint<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.659> pin<00:01:54.990> along<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> shirt<00:01:55.649> going

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
newsprint and pin along the shirt going

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.490 
newsprint and pin along the shirt going
around<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> scene<00:01:56.670> ones<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.110> trace

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
around the scene ones then I trace

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.520 
around the scene ones then I trace
around<00:01:58.829> making<00:01:59.340> note<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.640> darts<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.149> such

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
around making note of darts and such

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.020 
around making note of darts and such
after<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:02.460> take<00:02:02.640> some<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
after that I can then take some of the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
after that I can then take some of the
pins<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.689> shift<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> fabric<00:02:04.500> over<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
pins out and shift the fabric over to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.370 
pins out and shift the fabric over to
the<00:02:04.979> next<00:02:05.130> piece<00:02:05.540> at<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.780> point<00:02:07.079> when<00:02:07.350> I

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the next piece at that point when I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.169 
the next piece at that point when I
finished<00:02:07.799> tracing<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.429> my<00:02:08.550> pieces<00:02:08.789> I

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
finished tracing all my pieces I

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.630 
finished tracing all my pieces I
transfer<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> pattern<00:02:09.989> from<00:02:10.410> newsprint<00:02:11.370> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
transfer the pattern from newsprint to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.470 
transfer the pattern from newsprint to
muslin<00:02:12.060> or<00:02:12.150> cheap<00:02:12.390> cotton

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
muslin or cheap cotton

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.210 
muslin or cheap cotton
market<00:02:13.840> with<00:02:13.959> things<00:02:14.140> like<00:02:14.230> seam<00:02:14.560> allowances

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
market with things like seam allowances

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.280 
market with things like seam allowances
and<00:02:15.519> marks<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.540> will<00:02:16.659> help<00:02:16.810> me<00:02:16.930> align<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
and marks that will help me align the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.339 
and marks that will help me align the
pieces<00:02:17.620> correctly<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:19.480> third<00:02:19.780> way<00:02:20.019> I<00:02:20.049> make

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
pieces correctly the third way I make

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.100 
pieces correctly the third way I make
patterns<00:02:20.799> is<00:02:21.010> also<00:02:21.549> much<00:02:21.730> fun<00:02:22.000> way<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.420> invite

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
patterns is also much fun way I invite

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.630 
patterns is also much fun way I invite
the<00:02:23.260> person<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.620> want<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:23.860> take<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.190> pattern<00:02:24.519> up

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
the person I want to take the pattern up

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.759 
the person I want to take the pattern up
over<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.510> grab<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> plastic<00:02:26.290> bag<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.470> duct

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
over and grab a plastic bag and duct

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.259 
over and grab a plastic bag and duct
tape<00:02:26.970> no<00:02:27.970> I'm<00:02:28.450> not<00:02:28.569> doing<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.900> keys<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:30.239> cut<00:02:31.239> a

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
tape no I'm not doing that keys I cut a

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.210 
tape no I'm not doing that keys I cut a
hole<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.629> the<00:02:31.720> plastic<00:02:31.840> bag<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.620> let<00:02:33.099> them

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
hole in the plastic bag and let them

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.770 
hole in the plastic bag and let them
wear<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.489> kind<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.819> like<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> small<00:02:34.360> keeps<00:02:34.629> you

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
wear it kind of like a small keeps you

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.289 
wear it kind of like a small keeps you
at<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.900> hair<00:02:35.049> salon<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.670> wrap<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.000> duct

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
at a hair salon then I wrap the duct

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.990 
at a hair salon then I wrap the duct
tape<00:02:37.480> around<00:02:37.629> their<00:02:37.900> entire<00:02:38.230> torso<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:39.010> try<00:02:39.940> to

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
tape around their entire torso I try to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.360 
tape around their entire torso I try to
follow<00:02:40.269> where<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:40.660> seams<00:02:41.049> are<00:02:41.290> like<00:02:41.890> going

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
follow where the seams are like going

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.030 
follow where the seams are like going
over<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.879> shoulder<00:02:43.239> instead<00:02:43.569> of<00:02:43.720> cross<00:02:44.040> but

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
over the shoulder instead of cross but

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.740 
over the shoulder instead of cross but
basically<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.730> wrap<00:02:45.910> them<00:02:46.090> up<00:02:46.239> until<00:02:46.420> it's<00:02:46.660> a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
basically you wrap them up until it's a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.559 
basically you wrap them up until it's a
really<00:02:47.019> snug<00:02:47.530> fitting<00:02:47.829> top<00:02:48.489> made<00:02:49.060> entirely<00:02:49.390> of

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
really snug fitting top made entirely of

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.140 
really snug fitting top made entirely of
duct<00:02:49.870> tape<00:02:49.959> then<00:02:50.920> carefully<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.730> has<00:02:51.819> not<00:02:52.000> to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
duct tape then carefully it has not to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.960 
duct tape then carefully it has not to
cut<00:02:52.299> their<00:02:52.450> clothes<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:52.930> cut<00:02:53.379> up<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.590> back<00:02:53.970> it's

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
cut their clothes I cut up the back it's

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.270 
cut their clothes I cut up the back it's
point<00:02:55.269> I've<00:02:55.510> got<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:55.989> torso<00:02:56.440> double<00:02:56.829> instead<00:02:57.160> of

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
point I've got a torso double instead of

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.400 
point I've got a torso double instead of
a<00:02:57.430> slow<00:02:57.640> /<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.420> can<00:02:58.629> do<00:02:58.720> two<00:02:58.870> things<00:02:58.900> with<00:02:59.260> it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
a slow / and I can do two things with it

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.130 
a slow / and I can do two things with it
I<00:02:59.590> can<00:03:00.370> cut<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.579> up<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.879> front<00:03:01.090> along<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.930> side

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
I can cut it up the front along the side

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.440 
I can cut it up the front along the side
and<00:03:02.440> shoulder<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:02.980> then<00:03:03.370> put<00:03:03.640> up<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:04.000> dart<00:03:04.359> in

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
and shoulder and then put up a dart in

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.119 
and shoulder and then put up a dart in
the<00:03:04.569> front<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.959> back<00:03:05.109> to<00:03:05.709> make<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:05.920> pattern

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
the front the back to make the pattern

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.390 
the front the back to make the pattern
lie<00:03:06.370> flat<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.970> give<00:03:07.390> me<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.510> slow<00:03:07.780> /<00:03:07.989> or<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:08.950> can

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
lie flat and give me a slow / or I can

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.670 
lie flat and give me a slow / or I can
stick<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.819> whole<00:03:10.060> torso<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.840> my<00:03:10.900> breasts<00:03:11.440> form

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
stick the whole torso on my breasts form

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.729 
stick the whole torso on my breasts form
and<00:03:11.890> stuff<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.730> make<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.090> body<00:03:13.299> double<00:03:13.739> both

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
and stuff it make a body double both

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.470 
and stuff it make a body double both
methods<00:03:15.069> would<00:03:15.400> work<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:15.760> give<00:03:15.910> me<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.030> form<00:03:16.359> to

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
methods would work to give me a form to

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.110 
methods would work to give me a form to
work<00:03:16.660> with<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:18.190> technique<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:18.639> great<00:03:18.880> if<00:03:19.030> you

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
work with this technique is great if you

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.420 
work with this technique is great if you
can<00:03:19.209> only<00:03:19.450> get<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.930> single<00:03:20.169> fitting<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.859> you

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
can only get in a single fitting and you

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.280 
can only get in a single fitting and you
can't<00:03:21.669> have<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.970> person<00:03:22.299> there<00:03:22.480> well<00:03:22.870> why<00:03:23.260> not

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
can't have the person there well why not
