our<00:01:11.750> ranking<00:01:12.140> at<00:01:12.259> a<00:01:12.289> decent<00:01:12.920> level<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.460> try<00:01:13.700> and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
our ranking at a decent level to try and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.899 
our ranking at a decent level to try and
secure<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.240> two<00:01:14.390> spots<00:01:14.719> for<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:14.899> nation<00:01:15.289> and

secure the two spots for the nation and

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.370 
secure the two spots for the nation and
myself<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.030> Dennis<00:01:17.299> managed<00:01:17.689> to<00:01:17.840> do<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:17.990> so

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
myself and Dennis managed to do that so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.529 
myself and Dennis managed to do that so
at<00:01:18.560> least<00:01:18.710> we<00:01:18.979> have<00:01:19.159> some<00:01:20.119> some

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
at least we have some some

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.539 
at least we have some some
representation<00:01:21.079> in<00:01:21.469> in<00:01:21.710> London<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.249> I<00:01:22.310> think

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
representation in in London and I think

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.069 
representation in in London and I think
good<00:01:22.729> representation<00:01:23.329> I<00:01:23.539> think<00:01:23.719> we<00:01:23.780> both<00:01:23.899> have

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
good representation I think we both have

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.929 
good representation I think we both have
a<00:01:24.140> decent<00:01:24.320> chance<00:01:24.530> of<00:01:24.829> of<00:01:25.039> trying<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.789> bring

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
a decent chance of of trying to bring

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.779 
a decent chance of of trying to bring
something<00:01:26.359> home<00:01:26.390> for<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.719> nation<00:01:27.079> and

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
something home for the nation and

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.830 
something home for the nation and
preparations<00:01:28.789> are<00:01:28.969> no<00:01:29.060> per<00:01:29.270> Global's

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
preparations are no per Global's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.480 
preparations are no per Global's
Champions<00:01:30.259> Tour<00:01:30.560> obviously<00:01:31.159> there<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.399> an

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
Champions Tour obviously there is an

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.340 
Champions Tour obviously there is an
awful<00:01:31.609> lot<00:01:31.789> of<00:01:31.850> pressure<00:01:32.149> for<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:32.960> Olympics

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
awful lot of pressure for the Olympics

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.550 
awful lot of pressure for the Olympics
is<00:01:33.560> different<00:01:34.130> isn't<00:01:34.399> much<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.939> same<00:01:35.119> I<00:01:35.560> think

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
is different isn't much the same I think

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.020 
is different isn't much the same I think
it's<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:36.950> think<00:01:37.039> it's<00:01:37.189> more<00:01:37.429> pressure<00:01:37.789> because

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
it's I think it's more pressure because

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.020 
it's I think it's more pressure because
for<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.079> GCT<00:01:39.829> and<00:01:40.219> normal<00:01:40.579> Grand<00:01:40.759> Prix's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.739

competing for yourself but you're

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.760

performing really well for quite a long

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.680 
performing really well for quite a long
period<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.430> time<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:31.000> lot<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.420> is<00:04:31.510> down

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
period of time and a lot of it is down

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.900 
period of time and a lot of it is down
to<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.960> owners<00:04:32.230> and<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.980> course<00:04:33.220> it's<00:04:33.520> really

to the owners and of course it's really

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.000 
to the owners and of course it's really
to<00:04:34.210> athletes<00:04:34.870> here<00:04:35.080> we<00:04:35.260> have<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.560> whoreson

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
to athletes here we have the whoreson

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.490 
to athletes here we have the whoreson
yourself<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:37.570> pressure<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.110> mental

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
yourself and the pressure the mental

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.340 
yourself and the pressure the mental
pressure<00:04:38.680> must<00:04:39.070> be<00:04:39.190> tremendous<00:04:39.900> yeah<00:04:40.900> I

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
pressure must be tremendous yeah I

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.520 
pressure must be tremendous yeah I
suppose<00:04:42.390> writing<00:04:43.390> isn't<00:04:43.720> like<00:04:44.020> other<00:04:44.140> sports

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
suppose writing isn't like other sports

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.990 
suppose writing isn't like other sports
it's<00:04:44.740> not<00:04:44.920> like<00:04:45.100> an<00:04:45.220> extension<00:04:45.610> of<00:04:45.820> your<00:04:45.940> arm

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
it's not like an extension of your arm

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.240 
it's not like an extension of your arm
to<00:04:46.450> play<00:04:46.750> tennis<00:04:47.140> or<00:04:47.320> a<00:04:47.350> football<00:04:47.800> it's<00:04:48.040> you're

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
to play tennis or a football it's you're

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.640 
to play tennis or a football it's you're
dealing<00:04:48.520> with<00:04:48.550> another<00:04:48.940> animal<00:04:49.360> who<00:04:50.110> also<00:04:50.320> has

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
dealing with another animal who also has

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.030 
dealing with another animal who also has
you<00:04:51.130> know<00:04:51.280> a<00:04:51.310> way<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.580> thinking<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:52.710> how<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.890> is

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
you know a way of thinking and how it is

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.010 
you know a way of thinking and how it is
performing<00:04:54.700> physically<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.360> you<00:04:55.450> have<00:04:55.900> to

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
performing physically so you have to

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.360 
performing physically so you have to
worry<00:04:56.200> not<00:04:56.350> only<00:04:56.590> about<00:04:56.740> yourself<00:04:56.800> how<00:04:57.340> you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
worry not only about yourself how you

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.770 
worry not only about yourself how you
are<00:04:57.700> mentally<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.150> physically<00:04:58.450> but<00:04:58.630> you're

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
are mentally and physically but you're

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.510 
are mentally and physically but you're
also<00:04:58.870> you<00:04:59.440> know<00:04:59.560> worrying<00:04:59.890> about<00:05:00.070> your<00:05:00.280> horse

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
also you know worrying about your horse

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
also you know worrying about your horse
so<00:05:01.980> I'm<00:05:02.980> probably<00:05:03.370> biased<00:05:03.700> but<00:05:04.030> it's<00:05:04.180> maybe<00:05:04.420> a

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
so I'm probably biased but it's maybe a

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.610 
so I'm probably biased but it's maybe a
little<00:05:04.660> bit<00:05:04.810> more<00:05:04.930> difficult<00:05:05.170> than<00:05:05.470> other

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
little bit more difficult than other

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.970 
little bit more difficult than other
sports<00:05:06.010> but<00:05:06.250> maybe<00:05:06.640> i<00:05:06.760> would<00:05:06.970> say<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.830> but<00:05:08.830> no

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
sports but maybe i would say that but no

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.160 
sports but maybe i would say that but no
you<00:05:09.460> know<00:05:09.580> like<00:05:09.880> I<00:05:09.910> say<00:05:10.180> it's<00:05:10.450> it's<00:05:10.750> been<00:05:10.990> going

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
you know like I say it's it's been going

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.600 
you know like I say it's it's been going
really<00:05:11.290> really<00:05:11.500> well<00:05:11.680> for<00:05:12.100> quite<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.550> long

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
really really well for quite a long

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.940

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
to treat them a little bit like another

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.020
