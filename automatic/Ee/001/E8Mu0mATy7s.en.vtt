00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
think I organized it again but you know

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.219 
think I organized it again but you know
you<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.450> when<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> accidentally<00:01:16.080> takes

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you know when you accidentally takes

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.270 
you know when you accidentally takes
something<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.619> messes<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.040> your<00:01:17.070> whole

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
something out and messes up your whole

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
something out and messes up your whole
Bank<00:01:17.520> well<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.030> I've<00:01:18.240> done<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
Bank well I think I've done that a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
Bank well I think I've done that a
couple<00:01:18.600> times<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.320> that's<00:01:19.979> why<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.280> looks

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
couple times and that's why it looks

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.399 
couple times and that's why it looks
sort<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> messy<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.659> these<00:01:21.810> are<00:01:21.900> all<00:01:21.990> three

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
sort of messy but these are all three

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.960 
sort of messy but these are all three
clue<00:01:22.619> items<00:01:22.920> which<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.310> don't<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.729> any

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970

my<00:01:34.860> cooking<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.030> bought<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> lot<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> lobsters

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
my cooking I bought a lot of lobsters

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.649 
my cooking I bought a lot of lobsters
and<00:01:37.860> swordfish<00:01:38.250> right<00:01:38.670> now<00:01:39.000> swordfish<00:01:39.299> mostly

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and swordfish right now swordfish mostly

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.090 
and swordfish right now swordfish mostly
the<00:01:39.750> lobsters<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.439> haven't<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.829> been

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the lobsters but I haven't really been

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.520 
the lobsters but I haven't really been
cooking<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:42.140> but<00:01:43.140> i<00:01:43.200> probably<00:01:43.350> could

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
cooking at all but i probably could

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
cooking at all but i probably could
start<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.770> soon<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.579> say<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:44.790> gang<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> while

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
start that soon to say if gang it while

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.510 
start that soon to say if gang it while
I<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.570> some<00:01:45.689> schoolwork<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.250> where<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.369> got

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
I do some schoolwork this is where I got

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.060 
I do some schoolwork this is where I got
some<00:01:47.670> more<00:01:47.729> money<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.259> have<00:01:49.259> full<00:01:49.439> captain's<00:01:49.799> my

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
some more money I have full captain's my

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.740 
some more money I have full captain's my
Cyrus<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.570> fury<00:01:52.009> with<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.220> bunch<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:54.600> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
Cyrus or fury with a bunch of which of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.240 
Cyrus or fury with a bunch of which of
barrows<00:01:55.049> things

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
barrows things

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.400 
barrows things
I<00:01:56.310> Carol's<00:01:57.030> top<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.390> bottom<00:01:59.870> so<00:02:00.870> I<00:02:00.900> got<00:02:01.050> I<00:02:01.260> got

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
I Carol's top and bottom so I got I got

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.180 
I Carol's top and bottom so I got I got
a<00:02:01.560> crystal<00:02:01.770> shield<00:02:02.160> 24<00:02:03.680> mostly<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:04.740> decays

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
a crystal shield 24 mostly for decays

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.440 
a crystal shield 24 mostly for decays
when<00:02:05.400> I<00:02:05.460> go<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:05.910> I<00:02:06.150> think<00:02:06.360> it's

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
when I go there because I think it's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
when I go there because I think it's
better<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:07.440> can<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.680> crystal<00:02:07.979> bow<00:02:08.070> and<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
better you can have a crystal bow and a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.770 
better you can have a crystal bow and a
crystal<00:02:08.580> shield<00:02:08.820> but<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> find<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.509> better<00:02:09.660> to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
crystal shield but I find it better to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.580 
crystal shield but I find it better to
have<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:11.250> room<00:02:11.880> crossbow<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.600> Ruby<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
have a room crossbow and Ruby and the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.220 
have a room crossbow and Ruby and the
throw<00:02:13.770> bolts<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.700> works<00:02:14.820> out<00:02:14.970> better

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
throw bolts I think it works out better

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.300 
throw bolts I think it works out better
I'm<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.440> some<00:02:16.530> farming<00:02:16.830> stuff<00:02:16.950> at<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.190> end

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
I'm just some farming stuff at the end

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.699 
I'm just some farming stuff at the end
so<00:02:17.970> somebody<00:02:18.900> eyes<00:02:18.959> were<00:02:19.080> requesting<00:02:19.440> me<00:02:19.530> just

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
so somebody eyes were requesting me just

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.710 
so somebody eyes were requesting me just
to<00:02:19.800> do<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> quick<00:02:20.160> Bank<00:02:20.400> update<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.940> stats<00:02:21.540> wise

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
to do a quick Bank update and stats wise

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.990 
to do a quick Bank update and stats wise
I'm<00:02:22.410> world<00:02:22.740> 3<00:02:22.920> 30<00:02:23.130> which<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.490> apparently<00:02:23.670> like

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
I'm world 3 30 which is apparently like

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
a mini world one did not know

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.630 
a mini world one did not know
about<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:27.410> 1586<00:02:28.410> total<00:02:28.739> now<00:02:28.830> I've<00:02:29.430> gone

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
about that but 1586 total now I've gone

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.270 
about that but 1586 total now I've gone
up<00:02:29.700> seven<00:02:30.660> farming<00:02:31.020> levels<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> week

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
up seven farming levels and like a week

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.790 
up seven farming levels and like a week
I<00:02:32.750> could<00:02:33.750> could<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.230> done<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.440> like<00:02:34.590> two

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
I could could have done that like two

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.170 
I could could have done that like two
three<00:02:34.830> days<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.580> just<00:02:35.760> haven't<00:02:35.940> really

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
three days but I just haven't really

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.540 
three days but I just haven't really
been<00:02:36.270> consistent<00:02:37.080> with<00:02:37.200> my<00:02:37.380> three<00:02:37.650> runs<00:02:37.860> but

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
been consistent with my three runs but

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.479 
been consistent with my three runs but
I'm<00:02:38.670> two<00:02:39.239> more<00:02:39.390> trees<00:02:39.630> except<00:02:40.380> throw<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:41.340> more

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489

the health of and I'll have 60 so as you
guys<00:02:45.570> know<00:02:45.630> my<00:02:45.810> goal<00:02:45.930> was<00:02:46.050> pretty<00:02:46.110> much<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.440> get

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
guys know my goal was pretty much to get

guys know my goal was pretty much to get
60<00:02:46.860> l<00:02:46.980> stats<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.940> all<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.180> done<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.720> after

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
60 l stats so all of that done and after

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.100 
60 l stats so all of that done and after
that<00:02:48.959> I'll<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.350> need<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.590> do<00:02:49.650> fire-making

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
that I'll just need to do fire-making

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.949 
that I'll just need to do fire-making

hunter construction Andrew grafting and
then<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.620> thieving<00:02:56.040> level<00:02:56.310> which<00:02:56.430> should<00:02:56.610> be

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
then a thieving level which should be

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.300 
then a thieving level which should be
proceeded<00:02:57.030> gets<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:58.050> yeah<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.530> after<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.980> I

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
proceeded gets and yeah so after that I

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.890 
proceeded gets and yeah so after that I
don't<00:02:59.489> know<00:02:59.550> what<00:02:59.670> I'll<00:02:59.760> do<00:02:59.880> after<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.269> I'll

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
don't know what I'll do after that I'll

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.170 
don't know what I'll do after that I'll
probably<00:03:01.080> just<00:03:01.230> be<00:03:01.350> AF<00:03:01.650> King<00:03:01.890> do<00:03:02.400> AFK<00:03:02.880> skills

not a huge board cutting fan I don't

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.560 
not a huge board cutting fan I don't
know<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.769> get<00:03:07.920> XP<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.370> I'm<00:03:08.430> not<00:03:08.580> XP

voicing you know I want to do stuff that

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.590 
voicing you know I want to do stuff that

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
I'm not really sure if legacy mode is

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.560 
I'm not really sure if legacy mode is
coming<00:03:44.549> out<00:03:44.640> like<00:03:44.790> I'm<00:03:44.910> not<00:03:45.030> sure<00:03:45.209> what<00:03:45.480> the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
coming out like I'm not sure what the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.910 
coming out like I'm not sure what the
votes<00:03:45.750> are<00:03:45.900> at<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.140> moment<00:03:46.440> but<00:03:46.530> if<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.769> does

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
votes are at the moment but if it does

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.289 
votes are at the moment but if it does
come<00:03:47.010> out<00:03:47.280> i'll<00:03:47.459> definitely<00:03:47.820> be<00:03:47.850> trying<00:03:48.150> it

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
come out i'll definitely be trying it

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.729 
come out i'll definitely be trying it
out<00:03:49.130> because<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.519> legit<00:03:51.269> i<00:03:51.450> would<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.530> one

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
out because the legit i would the one

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.920 
out because the legit i would the one
reason<00:03:53.100> i<00:03:53.250> would<00:03:53.430> play<00:03:53.610> legacy<00:03:54.269> mode<00:03:54.420> its<00:03:54.750> to

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
reason i would play legacy mode its to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.720 
reason i would play legacy mode its to
just<00:03:55.110> do<00:03:55.230> revs<00:03:55.440> again<00:03:55.769> because<00:03:56.220> as<00:03:56.400> he<00:03:56.430> has<00:03:56.579> no

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
just do revs again because as he has no

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.430 
just do revs again because as he has no
revs<00:03:56.970> or<00:03:57.150> probably<00:03:57.480> my<00:03:57.630> favorite<00:03:58.019> thing<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.290> do

revs or probably my favorite thing to do

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.530
