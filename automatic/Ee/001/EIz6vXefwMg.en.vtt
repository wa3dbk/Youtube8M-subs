00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 welcome to tripolis tv 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.419
 Today I want to show you about the glass 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.509
 or 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.500
 The display at a puff 15 changes 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.059
 by the way, in a video description 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.260
 you will find spare parts and tools the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.460
 I also just use times 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.780
 read so do not let us now 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:24.930
 Time for the expensive tools in the hand 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:28.820
 and let's get started so let's start 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.820
 The first thing the mobile phone turns off 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.850
 it should not be possible as in 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.110
 In this case, then keep the button off 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.550
 pressed for a few seconds then 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.020
 the phone should go off automatically 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.890
 Next, remove the sim cards 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.329
 holder then we take one 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.039
 plastic chair and solve all clips 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.149
 backcover please no metal tool here 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.140
 use and no scratches or 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.140
 cause damage 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.080
 if you have that we have to do that now 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.700
 Protective film tries to remove the film 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.070
 as little as possible to destroy us 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.869
 they need to re-attach next 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.100
 we can only unscrew a screw 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.720
 we use the bracket with a plastic chair 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.430
 Separate attention to the bracket is the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.259
 nfc antenna is tuned connected at 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.580
 remove extra care as they are on 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.580
 battery is lightly adhered 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.850
 Now we solve the battery connection 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.229
 take a flat plastic chair and 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.179
 remove the battery and place it 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.159
 aside attention only at the shown 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.729
 Do not pry around any flex cables 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.729
 to destroy 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.619
 then we solve two more above 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:02:00.390
 then screw with the same plastic 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:02:01.829
 tool to remove the cover 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.239
 the lower side we solve four now 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.160
 more screw the speakers 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:11.509
 just fix the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.509
 Lever out speakers 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.420
 Next we solve all flex 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.500
 connections have mainboard and 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.500
 remove the main camera 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.989
 then we solve on the right 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.890
 side a screw and remove the 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:47.540
 long thin bracket now moves with 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.069
 your finger the silver clip easily 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.420
 in your direction and push the mainboard 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.680
 Be careful, it is still one 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.370
 antenna cable on the lower side 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:01.519
 connected 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:02.989
 please solve it carefully 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.859
 we both do not lose buttons 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.859
 we take you to the side 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.590
 next take ordinary many 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.450
 put on the highest level and 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.459
 Heat the glass for about a minute 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.109
 you can do that without a hair dryer but 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.549
 This helps to remove the display 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.819
 The glue is easily its property 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.349
 Lose now we take a metal 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.189
 tool and release the display from 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.409
 medium frame 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.359
 Please be very careful 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.920
 because the glass splinters extremely when it 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.189
 is doing gloves and one 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.189
 safety goggles 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.130
 then we clean thoroughly 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.430
 the whole medium frame of the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.430
 glass splinter 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.110
 so now we take thin 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.760
 double-sided adhesive tape and glue 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.760
 once the medium free around it 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.729
 The glue should be on some of you 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.139
 you can not hold well on everyone 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.680
 put some seconds on it 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.680
 dribble 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.770
 Now we take the new display 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.660
 push the upper flex cable first 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.990
 through the slot and put the display 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.990
 at the top 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.870
 only then can we flex the second one 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.060
 cable by pushing attention please 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.620
 make sure you do not have a flex cable 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.620
 clamps as they are very sensitive 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.920
 so now we build the grandpa found in 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.420
 reverse order together 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.810
 First we bring the mainboard 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.810
 back to 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.770
 Now we bring the main camera again 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.770
 connect and connect all flex cables 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.620
 then the upper bracket again 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:55.860
 attach with the screws again 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:57.360
 now tighten the antenna cable 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.229
 reconnect and the bracket 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.229
 mount on it again 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:24.540
 then the speakers again 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:25.950
 mount and tighten everything if 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:31.290
 you have that we bring the battery again 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:32.670
 and connect now the nfc 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:37.920
 mount the antenna with the holder and 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.960
 screw it down and last but not least 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.420
 backcover and that's it 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.600
 now europe enemy 5 should look like 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.010
 new so i hope you guys have that 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.630

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.250
