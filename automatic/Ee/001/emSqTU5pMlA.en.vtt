as<00:02:38.260> Intel<00:02:38.709> from<00:02:38.889> Heinz<00:02:39.129> Field<00:02:39.370> I've<00:02:39.670> been<00:02:39.879> here

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
as Intel from Heinz Field I've been here

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.580 
as Intel from Heinz Field I've been here
before<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:41.590> really<00:02:42.840> poorly<00:02:43.840> represents

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
before and this really poorly represents

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.759 
before and this really poorly represents
it<00:02:44.709> I<00:02:44.980> mean<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.579> looks<00:02:45.849> like<00:02:45.939> it<00:02:46.269> but<00:02:47.049> there's

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
it I mean it looks like it but there's

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.449 
it I mean it looks like it but there's
some<00:02:48.010> minor<00:02:48.489> features<00:02:49.030> here<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.650> should

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
some minor features here that the should

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.000 
some minor features here that the should
have<00:02:51.549> been<00:02:51.669> fixed<00:02:52.060> like<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:53.409> ends<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.799> the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
have been fixed like the ends of the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.800 
have been fixed like the ends of the
entrances<00:02:54.669> to<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.909> field<00:02:55.150> should<00:02:55.389> be<00:02:55.450> more

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
entrances to the field should be more

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.440 
entrances to the field should be more
out<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.319> side<00:02:56.560> right<00:02:56.799> here<00:02:57.269> they<00:02:58.269> should

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
out to the side right here they should

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.179 
out to the side right here they should
be<00:02:58.540> more<00:02:58.750> out<00:02:58.900> they<00:02:59.230> should<00:02:59.379> be<00:02:59.470> farther<00:02:59.799> out<00:02:59.980> I

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
be more out they should be farther out I

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.409 
be more out they should be farther out I
don't<00:03:03.189> know<00:03:03.370> if<00:03:03.459> it's<00:03:03.579> just<00:03:03.879> this<00:03:04.030> game<00:03:04.269> that

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
don't know if it's just this game that

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.440 
don't know if it's just this game that
does<00:03:04.599> that<00:03:04.810> or<00:03:05.109> if<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.669> the<00:03:06.669> one<00:03:06.819> on<00:03:06.909> the<00:03:07.000> ps3

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
does that or if it's the one on the ps3

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:19.640 
does that or if it's the one on the ps3
and<00:03:07.480> 360<00:03:07.870> or<00:03:08.260> not

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.810 

so<00:03:20.650> let's<00:03:20.800> see<00:03:20.920> these<00:03:21.070> fans<00:03:21.370> aren't<00:03:21.610> very

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
interactive but it's a ps2 game so I'm

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.450 
interactive but it's a ps2 game so I'm
not<00:03:26.650> gonna<00:03:26.800> get<00:03:27.010> very<00:03:27.310> crazy

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460
