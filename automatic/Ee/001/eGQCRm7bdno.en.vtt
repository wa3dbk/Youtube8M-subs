00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.410
 the grammy antwerp wins the pot in the third group match of the season 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.060
 of 2 from a mix from then 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.420
 for the game there currently jalil was rather hit and miss 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.420
 on how we played we generally actually think good 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:22.869
 print the score before the match a goal 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.480
 the world tour through the crazy public you 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.210
 What do you think about it was a year that was really indescribable 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.210
 what is fantastic to be able to score disney 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.100
 that ceo ambitions for this season at juventus do not antwerp 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.420
 the name provides the window for this scenario 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.590
 to learn as much as possible about anp is actually included in everything 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.670
 if the structure is everything that is added so basically well taken to the Eek 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.050
 gets a lot of fun 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.690
 base place but play opportunities this season 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.530
 but also which one we played on of course only a year as I said 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.300
 and I work very hard the name every training 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.040
 yes worth living 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.520
 but to join the group and ensure that the room can contribute 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.570
 that's a good team 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.890
 how do you feel as a player on this not least in Antwerp 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.320
 after a year too long 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.770
 last year of the trash rather difficult why it was that with 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.410
 raids because I find it difficult to make a difference in healthcare 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.210
 Korea was quite complicated the team started turning the new the supporters 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.470
 actually perceive 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.620
 tost yes it was a parliament already difficult after a year entered this would it 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.180
 know well 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.970
 claire concrete example of how yellow they are 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.970
 neither is the atmosphere in the dressing room over the year 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.660
 it's much better 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.730
 fine 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.090
 more police can already make preparations 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.670
 quite a bit of space, though 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.080
 yes actually good on the training it does rest well in peace I guess 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.920
 why year now is the first street name cast by a broker after 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.650
 overload 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.350
 holdijk there was or you afterwards I am full of you again
