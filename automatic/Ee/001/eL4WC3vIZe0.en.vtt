00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.330 
there a little bit easier to get Sherman
since<00:03:01.960> they<00:03:02.140> have<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.380> legacy<00:03:02.770> collectibles

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
since they have the legacy collectibles

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.280 
since they have the legacy collectibles
impacts<00:03:03.700> know<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.300> good<00:03:04.540> thing<00:03:04.750> now

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
impacts know so that is a good thing now

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.690 
impacts know so that is a good thing now
it's<00:03:05.440> not<00:03:05.560> gonna<00:03:05.680> make<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:05.950> any<00:03:06.130> easier<00:03:06.220> cuz

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
it's not gonna make it any easier cuz

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.760 
it's not gonna make it any easier cuz
you<00:03:06.790> still<00:03:07.000> gotta<00:03:07.150> play<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> ton<00:03:07.690> of<00:03:07.720> games<00:03:07.990> you

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
you still gotta play a ton of games you

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.530 
you still gotta play a ton of games you
still<00:03:09.010> gotta<00:03:09.160> knock<00:03:09.340> out<00:03:09.460> a<00:03:09.520> ton<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.820> solos<00:03:10.270> but

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
still gotta knock out a ton of solos but

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.780 
still gotta knock out a ton of solos but
legacy<00:03:11.320> collectibles<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:12.010> guess<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.400> odds<00:03:12.700> of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
legacy collectibles I guess the odds of

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.580 
legacy collectibles I guess the odds of
getting<00:03:12.850> them<00:03:13.180> are<00:03:13.270> up<00:03:13.450> now<00:03:13.690> since<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.470> can

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
getting them are up now since you can

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.870 
getting them are up now since you can
kind<00:03:14.739> of<00:03:14.800> get<00:03:14.920> them<00:03:15.010> out<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.130> packs<00:03:15.370> now<00:03:15.640> don't

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
kind of get them out of packs now don't

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.070 
kind of get them out of packs now don't
think<00:03:15.970> they're<00:03:16.120> actionable<00:03:16.570> but<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.840> can't

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
think they're actionable but you can't

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.210 
think they're actionable but you can't
pull<00:03:17.290> them<00:03:17.410> out<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.560> packs<00:03:17.739> with<00:03:17.890> your<00:03:18.010> school

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
pull them out of packs with your school

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.490 
pull them out of packs with your school

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
in this season since we did just get

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.590 
in this season since we did just get
done<00:03:20.800> doing<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.250> all<00:03:21.520> matter<00:03:21.820> run<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.090> think<00:03:22.510> I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
done doing the all matter run I think I

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.720

think<00:03:22.780> what<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.930> might<00:03:22.989> do<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.950> might<00:03:24.489> start

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
think what I might do is I might start

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.460 
think what I might do is I might start
up<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.940> budget<00:03:25.300> squad<00:03:25.570> cuz<00:03:26.050> I<00:03:26.110> kind<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.320> wanna

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
up the budget squad cuz I kind of wanna

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.170

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
do that and I believe I said I would I'm

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.460 
do that and I believe I said I would I'm
gonna<00:03:28.360> stick<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.660> my<00:03:28.780> word<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.170> think<00:03:29.290> I'm

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
gonna stick to my word so I think I'm

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.770 
this account I think we might just do
wagers<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.550> try<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.910> grind<00:03:34.120> out<00:03:34.270> some<00:03:34.450> seasons

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
wagers and try to grind out some seasons

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.390 
wagers and try to grind out some seasons
and<00:03:34.840> get<00:03:34.989> closer<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.470> getting<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.860> 99<00:03:36.190> overall

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
and get closer to getting the 99 overall
