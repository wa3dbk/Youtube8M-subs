00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.580 
these are metal and they are honking
heavy<00:01:18.010> so<00:01:18.580> they<00:01:19.210> weigh<00:01:19.390> probably<00:01:19.600> about<00:01:19.900> seven

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
eight nine times normal I sort of have a

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.429 
eight nine times normal I sort of have a
marker<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.740> knowing<00:01:54.490> when<00:01:54.729> I'm<00:01:55.109> warmed<00:01:56.109> up<00:01:56.259> and

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
marker of knowing when I'm warmed up and

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.429 
marker of knowing when I'm warmed up and
it's<00:01:57.039> this<00:01:57.340> if<00:01:57.609> I<00:01:57.700> can<00:01:57.880> do<00:01:57.999> this<00:02:01.259> about<00:02:02.259> that

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
it's this if I can do this about that

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.950 
it's this if I can do this about that
speed<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:03.880> know<00:02:03.999> I'm<00:02:04.149> warmed<00:02:04.389> up<00:02:04.509> now<00:02:04.810> when

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
speed then I know I'm warmed up now when

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.539
