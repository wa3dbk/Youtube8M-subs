00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.210
 what happens they keep the good as 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.970
 have the previous video today I bring the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.320
 issue to open the excessive console I'll 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.269
 to teach the console april give you the 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.249
 way is worth a more comfortable way so 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.050
 say it is simply that it opens 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.999
 the start of the game once 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.290
 we start the game the console is launched and 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.350
 it remains open to some who 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.180
 close they could not be opened until 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.100
 we will close games will make it nice and 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.649
 the second option that happens in the second 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.989
 part of the video is going to be the subject of 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.719
 open it when we want to say 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.670
 we press the key and it opens so 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.460
 let's go to the good mess the first option 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.760
 It would be like I said that only 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.399
 open for when we press when it opens 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.800
 forgiveness when we launched only be 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.359
 baited in this case quite a lot more 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.530
 simple that the other normal to another is 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.089
 a little more hidden but good to put 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.820
 a video 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.399
 the first action is quite clear 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.399
 would be sting have our 6 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.970
 we give properties like in the video 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.680
 previous properties 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.119
 once properties do not come out several 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.460
 tabs up with which we go the one that 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.479
 you open the first one that is general and 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.340
 after generating we're going to 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.289
 set the launch gene a 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.179
 time within these versions of 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.409
 birth we have several in the sunsets 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.719
 if we have any kind 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.039
 in the opposite way, such as, for example, 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.229
 this way that I have I is for the subject 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.999
 of your glasses times to leave a link 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.170
 in the video itself and in the description 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:45.630
 of the channel so you can enter and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.120
 also then we have fps then already 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.970
 you have something like for example me 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.100
 a space and with the description the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.620
 earned well I wrote it added a space 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.800
 in that space to put with sun that does not 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.980
 you have nothing you put with soles vale 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.940
 I can simply do without space without anything 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.040
 would you let me 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.080
 it would be adding the commands 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.270
 personalized and we will accept would we give 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.910
 to close and we will launch and now you will see that 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.560
 opens with only to understand the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.600
 you do not know what the console only 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.090
 little window we can not open a lot of 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.100
 commands I can open a bunch of 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.960
 commands that serve us then to for 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.030
 use a lot of example things here 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.940
 you see also open what says point a 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.640
 thing dismantling to the start command 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.040
 from the website to the we put then 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.170
 we can tear is always clear and it 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.080
 is erased, well, so far in 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.450
 first part that open the console 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.460
 according to launch options 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.290
 without that we continue with the second 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.480
 good the second option to establish 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.070
 the console and using keys in 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.860
 any time you can open the 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.390
 console is playing or is a menu of 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.910
 start or in a competitive like 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.400
 so you want to activate it we have the 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.580
 next the valuation is a sign of 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.380
 game that have not been distributed not very 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.810
 far that is the fourth line activate 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.070
 Developer Console default comes 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.070
 well marked not 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.540
 and it is clear that if we press that if 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.010
 we leave it on and simply without explaining 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.710
 nothing since the bullet not only active 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.750
 that a lot would have triggered this and not 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.940
 it will have worked clear the key is missing 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.820
 to enable it to us we will not 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.650
 back once again we 're going again 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.630
 options options but these versions 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.160
 of keyboard and mouse why because there 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.260
 than to assign a key a key of 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.230
 console let 's mouse key and the 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.180
 We have the theme of 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.000
 activate the console I for example I have 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.000
 this key that is the old 1.6 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.950
 we give you here the key this in particular 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.270
 is between the tabulator and 1 of a 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.240
 cycle of hours I will put a photo in the 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.340
 video so you know collage is 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.460
 simply already the pulse even of 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.990
 make her sorry by just pressing this one and 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.410
 without applying or anything I bet you the 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.810
 key to activate console I go back and 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.940
 And now when we start is 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.890
 true that is fixed and look selecting 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.299
 the key and here I open the console with 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.730
 the key that we said that between 1 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.930
 and the 2 for if you put there are times that if 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.820
 put the mouse half of the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.650
 screen down is not going to open the 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.180
 console without viewing opens the console 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.680
 when he finished the beginning of seven 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.020
 interface that you are seeing right now 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.720
 just go opening by 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.940
 example and church age 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.010
 Well once this step and 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.750
 the console is done we 're going to 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.340
 talk now as I told you or as I have 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.920
 said at the beginning we're going also in 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.240
 black is black 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.480
 basically the subject of 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.680
 the fish and the server pin 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.400
 development of the server the terrat of 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.670
 server and all these things I'm going to 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.040
 make a small summary of the graf 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.540
 extra ps theme for the theme of tirat and 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.280
 all this I already explained it in video 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.390
 more advanced and more detailed 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.800
 but as you are seeing here as 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.110
 we have open people as you want 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.259
 with the step a few steps as it leaves the 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:16.440
 cojones let's talk clear 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:21.470
 the black console in the description of 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:26.060
 channel so that the little ones a small 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:28.340
 sandwich then in this case I had 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.070
 by default at zero the missing 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.930
 exists with us we put them black to 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.410
 one to see that this does not come out that will 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.460
 down we can see the afp s as you see 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.460
 twice by default at least about 120 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.460
 119 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.040
 and well then we have detailed the 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.350
 other points that I have said 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.530
 that we want to see the fps instead 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.390
 to put black in another place for another 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.430
 method because it gives us the balls 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.520
 basically these commands from the rest of the 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.350
 tight and support then simply because 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.940
 we go here and deactivating our 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.000
 black that does not take up a lot of in 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.760
 screen we leave them disabled 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.930
 and if I'm not mistaken it 's the fps it's 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.759
 incorrect 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.919
 they have attraction to prove it 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.960
 fps to follow with commands always 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.800
 the client's 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.750
 fps 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.760
 up on the left the fps will be 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.430
 current 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.250
 more chiquititos and green fps up as 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.050
 Arteaga that our channel and if not 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.760
 we use the other commands that by the way 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.100
 in previous versions like for example 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.140
 in that design they were allowed because we 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.680
 we used to the cps up and that's it 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:46.280
 what are the advantages of black versus afp 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.690
 cps are black yes we can see 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.580
 how about servers that land has 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.370
 a server and what variation does a 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.170
 server then for example a day that 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.300
 we are linked we can know if it is the 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.590
 product sells shit as many 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.990
 we know the competitive ones that goes 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.720
 bad enough that the penalties on earth 64 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.550
 team we can not simply in a 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.340
 public case to Spanish and I what 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.800
 so you want to see lands of the cb of 628 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.870
 yes yes it is super saturated and it is not 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.670
 saturated but good that I will teach 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.530
 in the next video pulls so that the 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.290
 identifies and that's not it was a little bit 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.139
 where to play at home especially in 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.370
 competitive we all know 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:25.580
 they are trash 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.889
 but good guys seen this I leave you 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.910
 already calm and days when a lot 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.910
 for ass yogurt
