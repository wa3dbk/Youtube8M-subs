00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.480
 hello very good to all with echo and 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.220
 welcome to a new episode of the 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.990
 weapons guide and in this case as you see 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.759
 the title I'm going to analyze a little bit the 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.090
 carbine covenant a weapon that butt 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.830
 it's very, very bad at 26 it costs a lot 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.570
 win with this weapon because very recently 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.110
 damage but good let's start 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.410
 analyze it 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.080
 for the basic things he has then 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.660
 as I said as I just said this 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.790
 weapon has very little damage are you going to 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.280
 need as a minimum charger medium 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.050
 to kill someone then think that if 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.580
 fails is a few shots or so these 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.040
 already become three quarters of 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.280
 charger or even a whole charger and 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.440
 many times you will kill one and give us 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.600
 the bullets from what's left of the charger 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.980
 to kill another then we have to 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.070
 Quickly change to the gun 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.829
 secondary because my mother is going to 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.940
 cost a lot to kill with this gun 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.260
 because it is very bad to go to the good that 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.270
 has is that it has very good precision 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.190
 I was quite surprised at the 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.810
 use it I've only used it for 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.040
 is for this video for this guide and not 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.660
 I'm going to manage to use it or it's 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.070
 accelerate or clear but good me 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.290
 he was quite surprised because you did not 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.450
 I knew I had as good Ammo 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.100
 reticle is not increased as the as the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450
 of m &amp; r that is like the light rifle 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.149
 it does not increase so it always follows 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.600
 same and that will give you continuous accuracy 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.400
 all the time 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.250
 and the good thing also that you have to 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.330
 shoot very fast is semi automatic 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.340
 as you will all know and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.869
 semiautomatic then if you have a 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.700
 good trigger shoots pretty fast and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.380
 you can release all the bullets enough 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.119
 quick the problem is that what not 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.979
 does no harm then you need 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.070
 many many many bullets to kill 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.560
 one 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.780
 and well I also recommend you to kill 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.340
 with this weapon the types of game and 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.950
 now decide on the types of game 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.260
 because good in types of part of 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.940
 killer for example the goal 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.250
 The main thing is to kill your opponent. 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.840
 say one in a one against one or in what 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.210
 that is to kill your enemy and already 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.470
 you have no other fixation in times 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.330
 starting target for example as 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.840
 you are watching crazy ball or it can be 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.310
 capture the flag the goal of 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.530
 enemies is not to kill you but to go to 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.630
 for the purpose then that gives you a 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.820
 little bit of distraction that can 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.010
 help kill I 'm telling you that 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.050
 can you help us that is going to make you kill 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.580
 so how am I seeing in this 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.250
 gameplay as many of the enemies are 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.110
 they fix on the ball or whatever or 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.239
 other enemies or in other companions 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.970
 because it is very chaos is the type of departure 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.800
 then that is going to make you catch 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.780
 unprepared several enemies and os 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.100
 help get more casualties 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.420
 easy 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.590
 then classes also classes os 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.120
 I recommend that you always take 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.760
 automatic sentinel because the sentinel 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.800
 automatic helps you a lot if 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.350
 you get to hit him a few shots for 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.420
 the sentinel to an enemy that's going to 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.070
 help remove a part of the shield and 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.470
 so what's left of the shield is going to 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.600
 give time to remove it with the carbine 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.490
 and kill him because if you catch him with the 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.080
 whole shield in a one against one in 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.970
 against for example a weapon that is a lot 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.250
 better than m &amp; r because it's going to 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.990
 destroy or destroy us because it is 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.670
 MRT that kills twice before 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.990
 that you can remove the shield with the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.150
 carbine then that helps the 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.740
 sentinel because that's how it distracts 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.210
 enemies and takes away part of the shield 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.220
 that that always comes right then I 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.780
 I'm going to advise two two things one thing 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.970
 well survive a lot of time that is 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.040
 If you survive time to spend 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.310
 all the ammunition first you have to play 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.480
 a little and see if you survive the time 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.460
 enough to spend all the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.870
 ammunition if you run out of ammunition or what 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.850
 let it be if you run out of ammunition and 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.420
 you survive long enough 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.730
 you must take 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.680
 the ammunition advantage because well 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.230
 will give more ammo and you will have more bullets 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.580
 to shoot because we already know that a 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.319
 charger to kill one then 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.469
 imagine 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.379
 then if you see if you see that you are with 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:54.060
 the carbine and do not kill or osma so much 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.260
 while we have time to spend all the time 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.510
 ammunition do not ever stay without 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.099
 ammunition what I recommend for maps 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.989
 short-range because this weapon is 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.560
 only short-range map map 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.120
 that is, hey see things like that because others 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.609
 maps like it's not going to be that not because 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.549
 you're going to win the m &amp; r insurance then 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.719
 if you see that you are dying many not 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.409
 gives time to spend all the ammunition and 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.510
 all that 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.220
 I recommend you take the recharge 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.739
 fast because like that 6-3 body fight to 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.570
 body recharge is faster and get 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.610
 shoot more bullets in less time 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.919
 then that always comes in handy and 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.870
 It always helps if you do not wear the 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.180
 recharge fast as the recharge 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.910
 quick also gives you the change of weapon 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.630
 faster what you have to carry is 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.650
 a gun 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.419
 I take the four runner pistol 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.740
 always because it's the shotgun mode and 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.610
 then it's also pretty good 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.889
 shooting normal 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.180
 So that if you take the study away 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.000
 without ammunition the charger change 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.800
 quickly and finish it off with the gun 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.780
 that always comes well and that I do 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.569
 quite in these gameplay in these 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.830
 gameplays then then also what 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.569
 good thing he has is that if the enemies 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.449
 are pointing to the m &amp; r by 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.280
 example I already know that they have more damage than 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.840
 carbine but still get shoot at 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.360
 an enemy that is aiming with the 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.909
 face with the tail with the carbine forgiveness 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.169
 there goes that I swallow my mother if 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.879
 you manage to shoot an enemy that 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.219
 is pointing therefore with that of m &amp; r the 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:15.069
 weapon that is what destabilizes a lot 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:16.810
 much much is the look is going to go 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.129
 up completely I can not no 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.050
 will be able to shoot unless you have the 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.880
 advantage that it does not stabilize but 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.700
 well that's something else 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.250
 you are going to get him to remove the 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.680
 zoom in the gun then that's going to 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.820
 help a lot because that's the way 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.250
 unsuspecting will take a while to 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.620
 remove the zoom and all that then you go 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.530
 to have more possible to kill 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.210
 then I also recommend you take 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.070
 many grenades in the advantage of 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.240
 I also recommend grenades 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.500
 I'm carrying it because if it's not going to be 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.290
 impossible something you have to do is 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.970
 Making the most of the stands is not 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.710
 like m &amp; r, how good can you give 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.110
 like to carry grenades or not because of 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.090
 four shots you kill but this one is very 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.580
 advisable to carry grenades and the advantage 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.740
 of grenades to carry three because well 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.250
 granada you remove the shield to one or you 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.400
 you want and that piece that you want is what 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.350
 what you need to kill him with the rest 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.090
 of the carbine's charger because he 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.510
 It will not kill you faster and ran 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.919
 all then carry grenades always and 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.690
 use them as you never have 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.430
 used because it is that if you do not dare with 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.770
 this weapon you always have to do what 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.020
 that is to take away the enemy shield 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.280
 to the enemy and kill him you have to 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.680
 use all possible tools 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.539
 to help kill the enemy because 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.910
 this weapon alone is not going to kill that 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.930
 have it clear then also the bad thing that 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.510
 has is that it is a machine to make 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.949
 assists you will see how our 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.020
 attendance ratio will go up 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.699
 very much using this weapon 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.220
 because it's going to be assistance back 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:45.169
 it's science after resistance then 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.430
 nothing a pretty bad weapon the truth I 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.169
 I will not catch it again after 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.759
 this video then I do not recommend it 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:52.250
 but hey here is a guide for more 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.840
 or less how to use it and nothing I hope 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.370
 that has helped you that you liked 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.370
 and until the next video
