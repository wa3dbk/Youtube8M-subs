00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
that I might I think those are on par

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.390 
that I might I think those are on par
the<00:02:34.940> knife<00:02:35.120> skills<00:02:35.480> through<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.690> bit

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
the knife skills through a bit

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.280 
the knife skills through a bit
lackluster<00:02:37.400> yeah<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.020> know<00:02:39.050> they

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
lackluster yeah but that you know they

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.330 
lackluster yeah but that you know they
they<00:02:39.740> tackled<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.220> well<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:41.440> think<00:02:42.440> tommy

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
they tackled it well but I think tommy

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.970 
they tackled it well but I think tommy
was<00:02:43.640> probably
