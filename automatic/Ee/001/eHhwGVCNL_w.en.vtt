cents for it I actually saw something

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.080 
cents for it I actually saw something
like<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> those<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.220> t<00:01:38.549> seen

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
like this on one of those as on t seen

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.850 
like this on one of those as on t seen
on<00:01:39.240> TV<00:01:39.600> things<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.140> did<00:01:40.259> want<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> pick<00:01:40.680> up

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
on TV things and I did want to pick up

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.069 
on TV things and I did want to pick up
because<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.600> good<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.899> any

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
because I think it's good to have any

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.280 
because I think it's good to have any
leak<00:01:43.409> sealer<00:01:43.770> stuff<00:01:44.040> around<00:01:44.310> its<00:01:44.610> handy<00:01:45.290> okay

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
leak sealer stuff around its handy okay

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.100 
leak sealer stuff around its handy okay
so<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.310> whole<00:01:47.490> pile<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.090> think<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:48.810> supposed

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
so that whole pile I think was supposed
