00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello here speaks capital insert 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.259
 Welcome to a video about 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.490
 the previous weapons patches this in the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.929
 black ops 2 gave 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.849
 actually I always wanted that 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.259
 deal a little bit individually but in 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.630
 black ops 2 there are just too many 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.279
 patches are coming out for the weapons 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.779
 That's why there is always one 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.289
 to make a single video like me 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.279
 also in mw3 actually did that 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.900
 I want to say it's not worth it 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.650
 but it would just take too much time in 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.779
 claim 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.670
 and therefore it were today once a 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.320
 small little summarized video 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.210
 from all these weapons patches and how 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.980
 I stand for it because I have so well 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.710
 still my somewhat detailed reform 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.300
 this video or this topic on the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.500
 Channel of giotto gameplays uploaded 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.910
 The link to this I will again in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.329
 the video description pack to this 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.590
 Video 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.930
 You can do that again 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.390
 look for maybe a little bit more 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.559
 more detailed information but I have 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.079
 meanwhile also some new ones 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.760
 Findings for me personally too 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.649
 I just won this video then 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.300
 I 'm going to wrap it up here 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.699
 playing on the map crown game player 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.960
 So one of the dlc maps with very 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.000
 low killstreaks with the hesse 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 packages the lightning and the gun 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.420
 and ice classes setup I had mine 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.280
 current favorite class in black ops 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.869
 2 here and although the mp 7 only with 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 magazine extension i play it 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.900
 sometimes with muffler in the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.130
 gameplay just because the mapco one too 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.140
 but smaller is better then 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.250
 with magazine extension because of 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.409
 muffler somehow more or 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.880
 less unnecessary than perks I have 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.650
 five at the same time and bulletproof 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.810
 vest hardliner plunder toughness and 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.060
 agility and then have the last 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.960
 class point still invested in the c4 and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.880
 that's actually the big one 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.530
 advantage of this class that you just 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.600
 plays with only one tower weapons 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.579
 still five ports with the can and that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.939
 but very very important c4 in black ops 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.040
 2 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.930
 which I personally succeeded very well 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.549
 I think I have to say that too 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.840
 mp 7 is one of the few weapons that 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.549
 Actually, that's the same thing 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.710
 Feel like at the beginning of black ops 2 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.149
 and even a little this yes this 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.310
 powerful machine guns we from the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.369
 at the beginning of the black ops 2 were used 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.229
 actually so maintained and somehow so 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.180
 a little bit of that feeling from the beginning 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.040
 from black ops 2 also returns or 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.990
 That's why I like this class 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.240
 I love it and I have it there too 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.829
 so far my best backup two gameplay 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.700
 plays the video then becomes on 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.899
 come on friday 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.459
 I really want to go here too 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.950
 directly into the topic and indeed 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.440
 Overall, I think it's good that 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.790
 I care so much for the weapons 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.290
 or even around the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.880
 balancing the player but you 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.110
 I have to exaggerate for the black ops 2 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.510
 honestly say I found the black 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.580
 ops 1 very well in mw3 up to the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.620
 when they really get wild 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.850
 patched at the end of this 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.730
 play to somehow get alive 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:36.930
 that there are still some weapons like that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:38.910
 It has actually been mp5 dpm 29 ever since 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.430
 black ops 1 always so that you really 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.020
 extremely strong weapons down a bit 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.760
 patched but not complete 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.440
 the structure taken from these weapons 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.510
 So for example has the pharmaceutical or 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.670
 the ak just the black ops to the mp 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.960
 7 in mw3 were all a little weaker 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.700
 but not made and playable 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.590
 and I think that's in black ops 2 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.420
 just been put wrong so that 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.030
 machine guns except for a few 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.430
 Exceptions were really extremely down 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.310
 patched also several times down 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.660
 patched so annoyed and just the pgw 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.660
 really had to be very strong 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.350
 suffer and have just in the whole 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.360
 weapon systems black ops 2 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.120
 completely destroyed in my eyes and 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.800
 not only that, there are also now 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.600
 still some weapons easy 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.980
 are too strong and even more 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.209
 made stronger such as the 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.230
 easy machine gun what i 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.120
 can not understand why 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.440
 this weapons group in a call of 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.640
 Duty actually has to be fast action 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.110
 should go and the easy 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.790
 Machine guns are actually slow 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.320
 Weapons are why these weapons group 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.790
 still so strong is that 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.739
 Personally, I just do not understand 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.209
 and also towers again target seeker 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.230
 could quite a bit 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.239
 be weakened 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.860
 a little more recoil could 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.120
 be awarded this essay 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.620
 no idea why that was not done 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.000
 on the other hand I have to say too 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.260
 that the guns in my opinion 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.120
 way too strong for that is it 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.160
 secondary weapons are above all the k 40 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.959
 but also the single shot operated 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.150
 I think weapons are too strong and above all 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.310
 but the sniper because you just have to 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.870
 say you get so few hit makers 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.340
 Backing is just always instant 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.900
 death and if you look at how many 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.070
 hit brand actually one other 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.510
 weapons and how bad the hit 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.100
 action actually in total in black ops 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.050
 2 is then it is easy 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.250
 disproportionately crass as strong 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.780
 Actually the snipers are and how 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.420
 easy it had been with snipers 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.830
 really the opponents or a very 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.870
 very good hit action to get there 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.000
 I think is a disproportionate and 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.680
 proportionality I give 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.590
 actually does not want to accept that 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.240
 the quick scoping black ops two very 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.039
 simply it's okay the snipers have today 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.880
 a very large proportion of call of duty 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.320
 won 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.660
 you will never get away like that again 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.700
 but I just have to say this 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.870
 this action stopped for the sniper is 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.160
 just too good in 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.540
 quotes in relation to the 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.720
 other weapons and that too 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.250
 especially with the fully automatic weapons 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.630
 from the snipers ago is practically like 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.430
 in the case of storm rifles they have them at all 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.230
 no recoil and I think so 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.370
 not a good thing in the patches the 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.140
 But I have to appeal to them 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.600
 really extremely successful and find that 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.370
 the storm rifles are the clear ones 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.630
 I was also very much strengthened 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.920
 well I think because the black ops in a 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.720
 already very much liked that 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.070
 assault rifles are really extremely strong 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.410
 that she personally more and more 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.240
 has fallen if it is strong 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.770
 storm rifles gave as if other weapons 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.480
 Groups are very strong so have that 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.830
 she really well done but overall 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.960
 just became the weapons structures 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.340
 black ops 2 changed too much and me 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.540
 I am already long over time 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.400
 shot out but I wanted 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.620
 just give my opinion 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.090
 and yes, as I said, look forward to that 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.880
 gameplay or on the 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.410
 That's why I say Friday 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.410
 the place chips until next time
