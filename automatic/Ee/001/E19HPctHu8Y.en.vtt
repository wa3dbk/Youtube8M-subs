isn't like a little kitty you know um I

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.330 
isn't like a little kitty you know um I
think<00:03:34.690> that's<00:03:35.109> what<00:03:35.410> but<00:03:35.620> if<00:03:35.859> you<00:03:35.980> watch<00:03:36.099> found

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
think that's what but if you watch found

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.589 
think that's what but if you watch found
an<00:03:36.430> anime<00:03:36.790> series<00:03:37.150> you're<00:03:37.239> not<00:03:37.329> going<00:03:37.449> to<00:03:37.510> be

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
an anime series you're not going to be

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.939 
an anime series you're not going to be
embarrassed<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.109> watch<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.590> because<00:03:38.680> it's

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
embarrassed to watch it because it's

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.229 
embarrassed to watch it because it's
actually<00:03:39.160> a<00:03:39.190> good<00:03:39.310> shown<00:03:39.519> they<00:03:39.669> never<00:03:39.940> dumbed

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
actually a good shown they never dumbed

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.720 
actually a good shown they never dumbed
it<00:03:40.389> down<00:03:40.449> I<00:03:40.930> think<00:03:41.470> that's<00:03:41.620> again<00:03:42.099> compared<00:03:42.549> to

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
it down I think that's again compared to

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.189 
it down I think that's again compared to
these<00:03:42.849> shows<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.150> that's<00:03:43.419> why<00:03:43.540> why<00:03:43.900> you're

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
these shows and that's why why you're

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.140 
these shows and that's why why you're
just<00:03:44.230> as<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.650> Green<00:03:44.859> Lantern<00:03:44.889> was<00:03:45.280> replaced<00:03:45.849> is

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
just as a Green Lantern was replaced is

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.180 
just as a Green Lantern was replaced is
because<00:03:46.419> they<00:03:46.540> want<00:03:46.750> dumb<00:03:47.079> down<00:03:47.410> shows<00:03:47.799> and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
because they want dumb down shows and

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.800 
because they want dumb down shows and
I've<00:03:48.730> have<00:03:48.940> feeling<00:03:49.359> that's<00:03:49.510> what<00:03:49.569> be<00:03:49.780> a

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
that's why I'm watching it um so I think

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.290 
that's why I'm watching it um so I think
compared<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.370> eighteen<00:04:43.580> nineties<00:04:43.910> cartoons

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
compared to eighteen nineties cartoons

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.270 
compared to eighteen nineties cartoons
that's<00:04:44.660> what<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.320> think<00:04:45.920> they<00:04:46.070> should

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
that's what it is I think they should

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.640 
that's what it is I think they should
make<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:47.060> audience<00:04:47.180> wider<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:48.260> I<00:04:48.410> think

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
make the audience wider and I think

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.160 
make the audience wider and I think
that's<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.890> downfall<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.850> kids<00:04:50.150> networks<00:04:50.990> I

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
that's the downfall of kids networks I

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.690 
that's the downfall of kids networks I
think<00:04:51.440> that's<00:04:51.650> what<00:04:51.860> nickelodeon's<00:04:52.430> been

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
think that's what nickelodeon's been

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.310 
think that's what nickelodeon's been
doing<00:04:53.090> on<00:04:53.330> that's<00:04:53.660> why<00:04:53.780> it's<00:04:53.900> doing<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.170> little

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
doing on that's why it's doing a little

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.990 
doing on that's why it's doing a little
better<00:04:54.410> i<00:04:54.560> feel<00:04:54.860> is<00:04:55.130> because<00:04:55.730> they're<00:04:55.850> not

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
better i feel is because they're not

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.100 
better i feel is because they're not
dumbing<00:04:56.360> down<00:04:56.390> there<00:04:56.690> shows<00:04:56.900> they're

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
dumbing down there shows they're

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.660 
dumbing down there shows they're
actually<00:04:58.090> respect<00:04:59.090> their<00:04:59.240> older<00:04:59.570> fans<00:04:59.810> and

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
actually respect their older fans and

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.160 
actually respect their older fans and
like<00:05:01.670> Legend<00:05:02.090> of<00:05:02.120> Korra<00:05:02.330> they<00:05:02.660> respect<00:05:03.050> her

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
like Legend of Korra they respect her

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.660 
like Legend of Korra they respect her
all<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.350> fans<00:05:03.560> that<00:05:03.650> may<00:05:03.770> let<00:05:04.010> your<00:05:04.160> core<00:05:04.370> um

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
all the fans that may let your core um

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.540 
all the fans that may let your core um
not<00:05:05.480> you<00:05:06.140> know<00:05:06.260> again<00:05:06.590> dumb<00:05:06.890> down<00:05:07.130> but<00:05:07.460> they

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
not you know again dumb down but they

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.750 
not you know again dumb down but they
made<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.940> on<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.660> characters<00:05:09.320> older<00:05:09.680> and<00:05:09.890> that

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
made it on the characters older and that

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.580 
made it on the characters older and that
way<00:05:10.850> people<00:05:11.030> older<00:05:11.780> fans<00:05:11.930> can<00:05:12.140> relate<00:05:12.380> to<00:05:12.410> it

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
way people older fans can relate to it

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.280 
way people older fans can relate to it
and<00:05:12.920> it<00:05:13.790> actually<00:05:13.970> had<00:05:14.360> depth<00:05:14.690> story<00:05:14.930> it<00:05:15.230> was

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
and it actually had depth story it was

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.200 
and it actually had depth story it was
just<00:05:15.500> animation<00:05:16.190> and<00:05:16.430> that's<00:05:16.700> what<00:05:16.850> cartoon

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
just animation and that's what cartoon

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.800 
just animation and that's what cartoon
should<00:05:17.480> be<00:05:17.600> it's<00:05:17.930> not<00:05:18.050> a<00:05:19.060> in<00:05:20.060> that<00:05:20.240> kid<00:05:20.570> show

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
should be it's not a in that kid show

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.780 
should be it's not a in that kid show
but<00:05:21.020> just<00:05:21.230> animation<00:05:21.890> you<00:05:22.070> know<00:05:22.190> telling<00:05:22.580> you

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
but just animation you know telling you

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.070 
but just animation you know telling you
stories<00:05:22.970> around<00:05:23.300> may<00:05:23.540> shape<00:05:23.750> because<00:05:23.990> it

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
stories around may shape because it

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.690 
stories around may shape because it
might<00:05:24.170> be<00:05:24.230> better<00:05:24.530> throughout<00:05:24.890> of<00:05:25.100> nation<00:05:25.460> and

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
might be better throughout of nation and

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.670 
might be better throughout of nation and
I<00:05:26.090> think<00:05:26.330> that's<00:05:26.540> what<00:05:26.780> networks<00:05:27.320> have<00:05:27.530> to

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
I think that's what networks have to

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.310 
I think that's what networks have to
learn<00:05:27.830> is<00:05:28.190> that<00:05:28.550> it's<00:05:28.850> not<00:05:29.060> cartoons<00:05:29.900> are<00:05:30.020> just

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
learn is that it's not cartoons are just

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.920 
learn is that it's not cartoons are just
not<00:05:30.470> for<00:05:30.740> kids<00:05:30.950> animation<00:05:31.730> people<00:05:32.600> can<00:05:32.780> enjoy

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
not for kids animation people can enjoy

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.890 
not for kids animation people can enjoy
and<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:33.860> think<00:05:34.100> like<00:05:34.280> Simpsons<00:05:35.090> family<00:05:35.240> Guy<00:05:35.510> you

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
and I think like Simpsons family Guy you

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.540 
and I think like Simpsons family Guy you
know<00:05:36.050> that's<00:05:36.410> been<00:05:36.620> accepted<00:05:37.070> why<00:05:37.220> can't<00:05:37.460> that

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
know that's been accepted why can't that

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.030 
know that's been accepted why can't that
be<00:05:37.610> accepted<00:05:38.180> through<00:05:38.740> you<00:05:39.740> know<00:05:39.830> these

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
be accepted through you know these

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.460 
be accepted through you know these
networks<00:05:40.670> that<00:05:40.940> do<00:05:41.090> have<00:05:41.270> cartoon<00:05:41.720> cartoon

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
networks that do have cartoon cartoon

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.260 
networks that do have cartoon cartoon
network<00:05:42.710> should<00:05:42.890> be<00:05:43.040> I<00:05:43.070> understand<00:05:43.730> that<00:05:44.000> um

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
network should be I understand that um

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
network should be I understand that um
but<00:05:45.140> yeah<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:45.950> that's<00:05:46.130> my<00:05:46.340> um<00:05:47.140> you<00:05:48.140> know

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
you think this is what the network

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.050 
you think this is what the network
networks<00:05:54.290> do<00:05:54.500> are<00:05:54.770> there<00:05:55.040> shows<00:05:55.340> now<00:05:55.700> that

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
networks do are there shows now that

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.540 
networks do are there shows now that
they<00:05:56.510> haven't<00:05:56.750> canceled<00:05:57.620> because<00:05:57.830> they<00:05:58.280> feel

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
they haven't canceled because they feel

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.000 
they haven't canceled because they feel
like<00:05:58.730> the<00:05:58.910> kids<00:05:59.150> won't<00:05:59.360> enjoy<00:05:59.780> it<00:05:59.919> respect<00:06:00.919> the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
like the kids won't enjoy it respect the

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.590 
like the kids won't enjoy it respect the
kids<00:06:01.340> they'll<00:06:01.610> understand<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:02.210> story<00:06:02.419> and

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
kids they'll understand the story and

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.300 
kids they'll understand the story and
like<00:06:02.780> as<00:06:03.050> much<00:06:03.230> of<00:06:03.500> the<00:06:03.650> adults<00:06:04.070> they're<00:06:04.190> not

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
like as much of the adults they're not

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.280 
like as much of the adults they're not
gonna<00:06:04.490> I<00:06:04.730> think<00:06:05.540> when<00:06:05.630> they<00:06:05.750> grow<00:06:05.900> up<00:06:05.930> they'll

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
gonna I think when they grow up they'll

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.810 
gonna I think when they grow up they'll
respect<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.770> show<00:06:06.950> more<00:06:07.280> and<00:06:07.520> I<00:06:07.790> think

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
respect the show more and I think

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.630 
respect the show more and I think
networks<00:06:08.720> have<00:06:08.900> to<00:06:09.020> learn<00:06:09.140> that<00:06:09.440> so<00:06:10.220> timing

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
networks have to learn that so timing

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.250 
networks have to learn that so timing
comes<00:06:10.940> below<00:06:11.120> what<00:06:11.330> you<00:06:11.419> think<00:06:11.660> and<00:06:11.960> I'll<00:06:12.140> have

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260
