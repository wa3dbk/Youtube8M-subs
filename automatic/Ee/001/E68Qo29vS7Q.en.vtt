00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
 half markt life 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.709
 very good totals since we are in a 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.690
 video to mp you gave many for the 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.820
 comments and such for it will teach you 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.110
 my statistics is worth then what 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.970
 I will do without being a statistic of 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.470
 white 2 voucher since the ghost and the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.720
 strong war do not play much but if 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.720
 you want to hear some other day but another 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.970
 video is worth one we have seen tickets 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.750
 of things are worth a proportion 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.170
 64 I started playing something 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.149
 to whites 2 last year in January is worth 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.059
 had a rate of 0 87, and there's 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.739
 friends of witnesses and well then 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.140
 every time it made more casualties more costs 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.989
 raise the ratio is already known so 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.609
 it costs a lot to upload the modes 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.890
 of game obviously domain and domain 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.510
 extreme the most played this is that it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.510
 look up there is ups domain when I play 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.890
 but good eat we supply before 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.329
 I was very hooked on demolition 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.519
 always the game demolition and demolition 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.080
 and demolition if you see if you see very videos 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.729
 old techniques to see is that if they are not 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 there is only in demolition priest and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.570
 such but good nothing else the rates of 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.130
 victories and defeats 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.050
 it is very difficult nuclear nuclear 80 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.370
 many are doing their for loving it and for 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.410
 example when a vile too little should 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.030
 help marley a lot that many 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.770
 sonante we make a powder there and some 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.640
 demolition country and such that it made me 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.009
 before 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.830
 and good few more are action drive in 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:35.580
 which the casualties of outrages is that a 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.470
 little the medals of these as it is 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.540
 many low and ultra low strings and one 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.390
 work is to be then things more 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.080
 that normal after points nights the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.500
 most used are the what to be 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.600
 undefeated worth with little difference are 30 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.090
 differentiated drops that I take a 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.560
 with another but is more used to be 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.020
 that I saw that the video the scope of 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.050
 king in subjects with him knows this well since 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.490
 are 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.900
 it is good now more important the 27 as 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.480
 it's in everything that starts now 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.390
 practically and that and the n 124 of the n 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.940
 124 these people who have used the most 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.700
 94 had almost 10,000 casualties more than the m 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.650
 27 at the end of the day and now they are 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.780
 Now it 's the 27th that's the most 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.870
 low has it got him already almost seven 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.120
 a thousand and well then we have the mmc of the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.530
 peacekeeper that I like more than is the m 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.160
 gets in but of course I was using 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.840
 way league I have it there and good is 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.550
 other weapons the letters I like a lot 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.730
 use operas in portions as you see 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.050
 they are quite low and that and good of what 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.030
 then used the c4 and the insert 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.590
 tactical as not because the grenade I do not know 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.630
 how is it that I have 11 thousand I guess that's 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.150
 linked mode of when plays before we know 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.520
 well that, however, I still have some 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.270
 I will stay bunting 21 I do not have left 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.940
 no d 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.750
 lethal death to get me out of the 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.330
 challenges and well I will try to get out 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.630
 also the possible challenges since I 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.650
 there are few one here you see the gusts of 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.680
 points 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.570
 huawei response and the hospital as the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.210
 most used of the package helps a low 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.210
 as well as why did you have to do centuries 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.830
 I do not wear it but good 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.660
 as you see here the lobi stars as I have 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.820
 said before I use it more than the beatle that 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.170
 I have it here and the casualties are before 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.480
 lowercase are 330 casualties does not arrive or passes 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.340
 a little more 30 casualties is already the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.720
 canine unit there are swarms do not I 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.050
 I put in a lot since I do not like it that much 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:38.920
 but yes they kill pretty good we're going to 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:40.530
 markers 376 career points are worth 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.750
 would speak 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.750
 and good to see what else we can do 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.460
 domain bookmarks are worth 537 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.560
 score per minute is worth 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.560
 pretty good with 56 thousand casualties and 28,000 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.349
 deaths is a ratio of 2 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.819
 we 'll show you if the cards 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.080
 I have all the golden weapons 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.130
 I'm almost missing 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.100
 to climb we need to climb to the maximum 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.510
 these five weapons several in these five 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.610
 weapons are worth the shield of the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.620
 two shotguns and two snipers 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.470
 creams and adam bahl the rest I have it 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.320
 everything went up to the maximum of prestige and of 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.880
 gold are worth and good as you see demos of 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.560
 game is also missing little I think good 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.990
 we are missing enough in missed more of the 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.370
 half and good will try to take out since 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.990
 this game to be my favorite as I already 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.280
 I said in several previous videos that it is 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.140
 my best favorite and I will try 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.020
 complete most things to the fullest 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.720
 while leaving points with m / m scanner 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.000
 I want 500 casualties that the 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.880
 things this challenge I do not think we put 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.110
 here but if you tried many times 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.550
 because he liked my statistics 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.080
 because they have not lengthened much the 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.820
 video since that before you teach 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.820
 statistics many times until
