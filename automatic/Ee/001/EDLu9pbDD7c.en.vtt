00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
slight of hand you know i'm using the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.530 
slight of hand you know i'm using the
marrow<00:03:18.549> 50<00:03:18.819> cal<00:03:18.970> i<00:03:19.090> should<00:03:19.239> have<00:03:19.329> said<00:03:19.419> earlier

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
marrow 50 cal i should have said earlier

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.149 
marrow 50 cal i should have said earlier
that<00:03:19.720> i<00:03:19.810> had<00:03:19.900> extended<00:03:20.290> mags<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:20.949> you

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
that i had extended mags on it so you

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.979 
that i had extended mags on it so you
might<00:03:21.549> not<00:03:21.699> be<00:03:21.819> reloading<00:03:22.299> too<00:03:22.419> quickly<00:03:22.689> but<00:03:22.930> i

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
might not be reloading too quickly but i

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.659 
might not be reloading too quickly but i
think<00:03:23.199> the<00:03:23.290> pro<00:03:23.530> variant<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.189> sleight<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.430> hand

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
think the pro variant of sleight of hand

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.429 
think the pro variant of sleight of hand
the<00:03:24.879> the<00:03:25.449> fact<00:03:25.689> that<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.900> actually<00:03:25.989> switch

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439 
the the fact that you actually switch

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.289 
the the fact that you actually switch
between<00:03:26.650> your<00:03:26.949> weapons<00:03:27.310> quicker<00:03:27.579> makes<00:03:28.180> this

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
between your weapons quicker makes this

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.719 
between your weapons quicker makes this
a<00:03:28.359> really<00:03:28.750> really<00:03:29.169> essential<00:03:29.829> pokes<00:03:30.459> i<00:03:30.579> have

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
a really really essential pokes i have

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.460 
a really really essential pokes i have
and<00:03:30.970> i<00:03:31.389> think<00:03:31.629> again<00:03:31.870> it's<00:03:32.019> because<00:03:32.199> that<00:03:32.349> you

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
and i think again it's because that you

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.929 
and i think again it's because that you
want<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.620> whip<00:03:32.769> out<00:03:32.919> your<00:03:32.949> secondary<00:03:33.579> as<00:03:33.729> quick

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
as possible if you miss that vile bullet

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.740 
as possible if you miss that vile bullet

the Rays time between quick joram

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.599 
the Rays time between quick joram
without<00:03:47.379> having<00:03:47.620> quick<00:03:47.799> draw<00:03:48.009> you'll<00:03:48.489> know

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
without having quick draw you'll know

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.099 
without having quick draw you'll know
exactly<00:03:48.729> why<00:03:49.120> I'm<00:03:49.359> using<00:03:49.509> quick-draw<00:03:49.989> you

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
exactly why I'm using quick-draw you

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.869 
exactly why I'm using quick-draw you
know<00:03:50.229> the<00:03:50.680> Rays<00:03:50.829> time<00:03:51.040> is<00:03:51.220> about<00:03:51.370> twice<00:03:51.669> as

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
know the Rays time is about twice as

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.280 
know the Rays time is about twice as
quick<00:03:52.060> when<00:03:52.449> you're<00:03:52.540> actually<00:03:52.659> running<00:03:53.049> with

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
quick when you're actually running with

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.719 
quick when you're actually running with
quick-draw<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:53.859> think<00:03:53.979> it's<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.310> really<00:03:54.340> a

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
quick-draw so I think it's a really a

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.819 
quick-draw so I think it's a really a
central<00:03:55.120> park<00:03:55.329> and<00:03:55.540> again<00:03:56.049> just<00:03:56.560> going<00:03:56.769> to

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
central park and again just going to

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.020 
central park and again just going to
help<00:03:56.949> you<00:03:57.099> out<00:03:57.129> when<00:03:57.459> you're<00:03:57.549> trying<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.879> go

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
help you out when you're trying to go

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.879 
help you out when you're trying to go
for<00:03:58.180> them<00:03:58.299> one-on-one<00:03:58.479> gunfights<00:03:59.229> when<00:03:59.379> to<00:03:59.799> be

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
for them one-on-one gunfights when to be

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:00.990 
for them one-on-one gunfights when to be
honest<00:04:00.159> when<00:04:00.370> you're<00:04:00.489> using<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.729> sniper

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
honest when you're using the sniper

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.520 
honest when you're using the sniper
rifle<00:04:01.359> you're<00:04:01.479> a<00:04:01.540> disadvantage<00:04:02.169> so<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.379> need

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
rifle you're a disadvantage so you need

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.990 
rifle you're a disadvantage so you need
all<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.829> advantages<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.609> can<00:04:03.699> get<00:04:03.849> and

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
all the advantages that you can get and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.550 
all the advantages that you can get and
I<00:04:04.030> think<00:04:04.209> quick<00:04:04.419> draw<00:04:04.659> is<00:04:04.810> definitely<00:04:05.259> a<00:04:05.290> big

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
I think quick draw is definitely a big

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.469 
I think quick draw is definitely a big
advantage<00:04:05.859> in<00:04:06.099> your<00:04:06.219> favor<00:04:06.489> finally<00:04:07.269> for<00:04:07.389> the

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479 
advantage in your favor finally for the

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.479 
advantage in your favor finally for the
third<00:04:07.629> tip<00:04:07.810> ugh<00:04:07.989> I<00:04:08.169> actually<00:04:08.439> ran<00:04:08.949> steady<00:04:09.310> aim

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
third tip ugh I actually ran steady aim

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.429 
third tip ugh I actually ran steady aim
the<00:04:10.060> reason<00:04:10.299> for<00:04:10.329> this<00:04:10.509> again<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:10.989> you<00:04:11.199> know<00:04:11.289> if

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
the reason for this again is you know if

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.749 
the reason for this again is you know if
you<00:04:11.530> turn<00:04:11.739> a<00:04:11.769> corner<00:04:11.859> if<00:04:12.219> you<00:04:12.340> actually<00:04:12.459> do

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:12.759 
you turn a corner if you actually do

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:14.640 
you turn a corner if you actually do
find<00:04:13.060> someone<00:04:13.389> in<00:04:13.569> close<00:04:13.810> proximity<00:04:14.199> to<00:04:14.530> you

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
find someone in close proximity to you

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.439 
find someone in close proximity to you
you<00:04:15.069> might<00:04:15.219> want<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.459> just<00:04:15.549> try<00:04:15.759> and<00:04:15.939> fire<00:04:16.239> from

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
you might want to just try and fire from

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.250 
you might want to just try and fire from
the<00:04:16.479> hip<00:04:16.539> and<00:04:16.840> hope

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
the hip and hope

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.230 
the hip and hope
yeah<00:04:17.440> no<00:04:17.860> scope<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.310> just<00:04:18.490> kind<00:04:18.640> of<00:04:18.730> and<00:04:19.030> just

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.240 
yeah no scope and just kind of and just

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.520 
yeah no scope and just kind of and just
get<00:04:19.330> them<00:04:19.420> out<00:04:19.510> your<00:04:19.630> way<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:19.750> know<00:04:19.930> my<00:04:20.170> gut

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
get them out your way you know my gut

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.650 
get them out your way you know my gut
instinct<00:04:20.950> isn't<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.310> panic<00:04:21.580> knife<00:04:21.730> so<00:04:22.060> maybe

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
instinct isn't a panic knife so maybe

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.090 
instinct isn't a panic knife so maybe
I'll<00:04:22.810> just<00:04:22.900> fire<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.410> hopefully<00:04:23.710> get<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.860> lucky

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
I'll just fire and hopefully get a lucky

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.070 
I'll just fire and hopefully get a lucky
shot<00:04:24.130> also<00:04:24.790> steady<00:04:25.120> aim<00:04:25.270> pro<00:04:25.300> means<00:04:25.690> us<00:04:25.960> you

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
shot also steady aim pro means us you

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.410 
shot also steady aim pro means us you
can<00:04:26.170> get<00:04:26.380> faster<00:04:27.100> ABS<00:04:27.580> from<00:04:27.790> sprinting<00:04:28.240> and

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
can get faster ABS from sprinting and

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.940 
can get faster ABS from sprinting and
you<00:04:28.810> know<00:04:28.900> sometimes<00:04:29.290> I<00:04:29.440> do<00:04:29.500> play<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.770> little

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
you know sometimes I do play a little

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.800 
you know sometimes I do play a little
bit<00:04:30.100> aggressively<00:04:30.580> with<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.760> sniper<00:04:30.940> sometimes

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
bit aggressively with a sniper sometimes

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.390 
bit aggressively with a sniper sometimes
I<00:04:31.900> do<00:04:31.960> sprint<00:04:32.350> and<00:04:32.530> running<00:04:33.040> steady<00:04:33.190> aim<00:04:33.370> pro

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
I do sprint and running steady aim pro

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.800 
I do sprint and running steady aim pro
just<00:04:33.730> means<00:04:33.940> you're<00:04:34.060> going<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.210> get<00:04:34.330> faster

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
just means you're going to get faster

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.590 
just means you're going to get faster
ABS<00:04:35.260> after<00:04:35.740> sprinting<00:04:35.980> so<00:04:36.340> so<00:04:37.330> that's<00:04:37.510> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
ABS after sprinting so so that's the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.700 
ABS after sprinting so so that's the
class<00:04:37.810> I'm<00:04:37.960> going<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.140> be<00:04:38.200> running<00:04:38.350> from<00:04:38.530> day
