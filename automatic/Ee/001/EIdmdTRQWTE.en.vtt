00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.370 

in<00:00:00.210> these<00:00:00.390> examples<00:00:00.539> we<00:00:01.020> want<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.199> identify

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
in these examples we want to identify

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.740 
in these examples we want to identify
the<00:00:01.680> fraction<00:00:02.429> plotted<00:00:03.210> on<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.419> number<00:00:03.720> line

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
the fraction plotted on the number line

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.660 
the fraction plotted on the number line
looking<00:00:04.500> at<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.710> first<00:00:04.890> number<00:00:05.190> line<00:00:05.370> notice

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
looking at the first number line notice

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.500 
looking at the first number line notice
we<00:00:05.819> have<00:00:05.940> 0<00:00:06.299> here<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:06.990> 1<00:00:07.049> here<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:08.220> from<00:00:09.030> 0<00:00:09.360> to

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
we have 0 here and 1 here and from 0 to

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.709 
we have 0 here and 1 here and from 0 to
1<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:10.050> divided<00:00:10.440> into<00:00:10.559> 1<00:00:11.340> 2<00:00:12.230> 3<00:00:13.250> 4<00:00:14.250> equal<00:00:14.490> pieces

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
1 is divided into 1 2 3 4 equal pieces

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.019 
1 is divided into 1 2 3 4 equal pieces
which<00:00:15.719> means<00:00:15.990> each<00:00:16.289> tick<00:00:16.560> mark<00:00:16.590> represents

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
which means each tick mark represents

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.080 
which means each tick mark represents
1/4<00:00:19.070> so<00:00:20.070> starting<00:00:20.430> at<00:00:20.550> 0<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.180> would<00:00:21.330> be<00:00:21.390> 1/4

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
1/4 so starting at 0 this would be 1/4

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.589 
1/4 so starting at 0 this would be 1/4
this<00:00:24.090> would<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.420> 2/4<00:00:25.820> which<00:00:26.820> does<00:00:27.029> simplify<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
this would be 2/4 which does simplify to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
this would be 2/4 which does simplify to
one<00:00:28.170> half<00:00:28.640> this<00:00:29.640> red<00:00:29.910> point<00:00:30.179> would<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.420> 3/4<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
one half this red point would be 3/4 the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.770 
one half this red point would be 3/4 the
fraction<00:00:32.040> we're<00:00:32.160> looking<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:33.600> here

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
fraction we're looking for then here

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.850 
fraction we're looking for then here
we'd<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:33.930> 4/4<00:00:34.710> which<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.130> equal<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:36.860> so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
we'd have 4/4 which is equal to one so

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.450 
we'd have 4/4 which is equal to one so
for<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.100> problem<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.090> red<00:00:39.360> point

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
for this problem this red point

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.619 
for this problem this red point
represents<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.520> 3/4<00:00:44.180> looking<00:00:45.180> at<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> second

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
represents the 3/4 looking at the second

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.600 
represents the 3/4 looking at the second
example<00:00:45.690> again<00:00:46.649> notice<00:00:46.890> how<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.160> zero

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
example again notice how we have zero

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.869 
example again notice how we have zero
here<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.520> zero<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
here and one here and then from zero to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.220 
here and one here and then from zero to
one<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.420> divided<00:00:52.379> into<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:53.100> two<00:00:53.850> three<00:00:54.690> four

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
one is divided into one two three four

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.889 
one is divided into one two three four
five<00:00:55.710> equal<00:00:56.039> pieces<00:00:56.190> which<00:00:57.090> means<00:00:57.390> each<00:00:57.660> tick

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
five equal pieces which means each tick

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.939 
five equal pieces which means each tick
mark<00:00:57.930> represents<00:00:58.399> one-fifth<00:01:00.649> so<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.800> would

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
mark represents one-fifth so this would

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.310 
mark represents one-fifth so this would
be<00:01:02.070> 1/5<00:01:03.920> 2/5<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.210> red<00:01:06.390> point<00:01:06.720> represents

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
be 1/5 2/5 so this red point represents

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.350 
be 1/5 2/5 so this red point represents
3/5<00:01:08.900> then<00:01:09.900> we'd<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.170> 4/5<00:01:11.060> then<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.210> would

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
3/5 then we'd have 4/5 then this would

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.249 
3/5 then we'd have 4/5 then this would
be<00:01:12.510> 5/5<00:01:13.409> which<00:01:13.939> is<00:01:14.939> equal<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.840> then

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
be 5/5 which is equal to one and then

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.429 
be 5/5 which is equal to one and then
we'd<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.580> 6/5<00:01:19.009> 7/5<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> two

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
we'd have 6/5 7/5 and so on so the two

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.780 
we'd have 6/5 7/5 and so on so the two
fractions<00:01:22.710> plotted<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.490> number<00:01:23.670> line

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
fractions plotted on this number line

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.179 
fractions plotted on this number line
are<00:01:24.240> three<00:01:25.110> fifths<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:28.009> seven<00:01:29.009> fifths<00:01:31.070> now<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
are three fifths and seven fifths now it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.830 
are three fifths and seven fifths now it
is<00:01:32.310> true<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.549> seven<00:01:32.939> fifths<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.420> an<00:01:33.540> improper

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
is true that seven fifths is an improper

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.710 
is true that seven fifths is an improper
fraction<00:01:34.700> we<00:01:35.700> could<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:35.970> written<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.360> as

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
fraction we could have written this as

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.440 
fraction we could have written this as
one<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:38.460> would<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.729> one-fifth<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
one and this would be one-fifth and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.130 
one and this would be one-fifth and
two-fifths<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.170> one<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:40.650> fifths<00:01:42.140> but

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
two-fifths so one and two fifths but

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.789 
two-fifths so one and two fifths but
normally<00:01:43.409> when<00:01:43.500> we're<00:01:43.649> identifying

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
normally when we're identifying

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.039 
normally when we're identifying
fractions<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> number<00:01:45.000> line<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.450> haven't

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
fractions on the number line we haven't

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.469 
fractions on the number line we haven't
learned<00:01:46.259> about<00:01:46.530> mixed<00:01:46.890> numbers<00:01:47.189> yet<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.119> seven

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
learned about mixed numbers yet so seven

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.630 
learned about mixed numbers yet so seven
fifths<00:01:48.720> would<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.320> fraction<00:01:49.649> plotted<00:01:50.579> on

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
fifths would be the fraction plotted on

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.340 
fifths would be the fraction plotted on
the<00:01:50.700> number<00:01:50.939> line<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.509> Blue<00:01:51.750> Point<00:01:52.020> and

one<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.009> two<00:01:53.130> fifths<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> mixed

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
one and two fifths would be the mixed

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.730 
one and two fifths would be the mixed
