00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:02.178
 Hello! Welcome to kitchen for all. 

00:00:02.278 --> 00:00:05.209
 Today we're going to make Foster's Hollywood style fries 

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:07.519
 or also called bacon cheese fries. 

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:11.905
 That I have based on the line of the page www.velocidadcuchara.com 

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.881
 To do it we are going to need the following ingredients. 

00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:18.485
 500 g of potatoes in my case are frozen. 

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:21.487
 Let's accompany the potatoes with a ranchera sauce. 

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:24.526
 I'm going to do it but if you do not want to do it you can buy it 

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:26.712
 or replace it with barbecue sauce. 

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.704
 To do it, we will need: 

00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:35.403
 2/5 of cup or 90 ml of cream to mount or cream to beat and if you do not have cream for normal cooking. 

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:37.821
 The juice of 1/2 lemon, 

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:40.426
 5 ml of milk, 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:42.935
 1/2 tablespoon mayonnaise, 

00:00:43.588 --> 00:00:45.826
 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:48.506
 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:50.917
 a little black pepper, 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.515
 the salt is to taste, I'm going to use 1/2 teaspoon, 

00:00:54.946 --> 00:00:56.942
 and a bit of chopped chives. 

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.652
 To complement the potatoes we will need: 

00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:03.613
 70 g of striped cheese, which in my case is type 4 cheeses, 

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:07.279
 and carries gouda, enmental, cheddar and semi-cured. 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.568
 And also 60 g of bacon in strips. 

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:15.285
 Let's start making salsa ranchera, so we put the cream in a bowl. 

00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:17.066
 We add the milk, 

00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:20.102
 and the juice of 1/2 lemon. 

00:01:22.302 --> 00:01:23.620
 Let's move it well. 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.219
 And let it rest 5 minutes. 

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:31.393
 Once 5 minutes have passed, we add the rest of the ingredients. 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.918
 The pepper, 

00:01:33.388 --> 00:01:34.302
 the salt, 

00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:36.042
 the garlic powder, 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.631
 the onion powder, 

00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:40.375
 the Mayo 

00:01:42.277 --> 00:01:43.434
 and the chives. 

00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:46.138
 And we mix everything well. 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:51.451
 We put a film and keep it in the fridge while we continue with the recipe. 

00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:55.870
 Now let's fry the bacon, so we put it in a pan over high heat. 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.236
 No need to add oil, but the bacon fat is worth it. 

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:03.382
 We move it from time to time so that it does not stick. 

00:02:03.743 --> 00:02:06.354
 After a few minutes the bacon is ready so 

00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:09.687
 We extinguish the fire, remove and continue with the recipe. 

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:15.242
 We are going to fry the potatoes and I am going to use a fryer at 175 ºC. 

00:02:15.242 --> 00:02:18.543
 If you do not have you can use a pan with oil too. 

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:23.421
 I'm going to fry them in 2 batches so they do not stick together, so let's fry the first batch. 

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:30.096
 Once a few minutes have passed, our potatoes are ready. 

00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:34.516
 So let's drain them a little and I'll move them to a plate with a napkin 

00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:36.574
 so that it absorbs the excess oil. 

00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:39.606
 And we will go to fry the second batch. 

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:42.422
 We already have all the chips I've put them in 

00:02:42.422 --> 00:02:44.719
 a clay capsule to put them in the oven 

00:02:44.746 --> 00:02:48.490
 Although you can also use any container that is suitable for oven. 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.571
 so now let's put the oven to preheat. 

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:53.645
 We put it at 250 ºC with heat above and below. 

00:02:54.146 --> 00:02:56.685
 We put the ranchera sauce on top. 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.006
 Next we put the bacon. 

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:06.571
 And finally the cheese. 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.914
 Once we have put all the cheese we pass it to the oven. 

00:03:12.014 --> 00:03:16.148
 We leave it at 250 ° C with heat only above and with air. 

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.897
 Once 10 minutes have passed or when the cheese 

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:24.417
 it has completely melted, we took it out of the oven. 

00:03:25.353 --> 00:03:29.709
 Once they are out of the oven we let them cool down a bit and they are ready. 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.685
 I'm going to move on to try them now. 

00:03:33.644 --> 00:03:35.696
 MMM. 

00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:38.102
 Delicious, I'm going for more. 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.115
