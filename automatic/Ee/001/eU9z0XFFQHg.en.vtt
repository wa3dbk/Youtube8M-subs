00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.739
 first 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.449
 who came to us 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.720
 while the machines they had 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.420
 asked 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.580
 we leave with a single price 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.910
 starting point 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.070
 I want it to be a product that has been deposited 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.670
 we are analyzing we have what to do after we need more research of 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.630
 retail 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.160
 so stupid identifying the segment of beto fans as much 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.450
 interesting 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.090
 for a simple reason 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.550
 90% of what is sold in Brazil 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.340
 until the 29th of this month 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.790
 this is it 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.120
 if I had a differentiated product 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.850
 we could get 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.380
 to compete 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.380
 in what way 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.150
 this equation is not where we want it 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 Paulo 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.890
 until March the manufacturing course 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.610
 there is little mystery to this crowd that has reduced the number of children in the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.910
 fan 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.490
 the injected plastic 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.710
 allowed the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.090
 had a geometry 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 specific 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.270
 this face 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.120
 the people 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.110
 what to do 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.430
 joÃ£o v
