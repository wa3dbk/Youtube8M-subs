00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.360 

so<00:00:07.430> I'm<00:00:07.550> trying<00:00:07.790> to<00:00:07.820> get<00:00:07.940> this<00:00:08.860> wax<00:00:09.860> to<00:00:10.160> come

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
so I'm trying to get this wax to come

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.410 
so I'm trying to get this wax to come
out<00:00:10.520> and<00:00:11.150> it's<00:00:11.600> not<00:00:11.780> working<00:00:11.990> too<00:00:12.350> well<00:00:13.420> this

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
out and it's not working too well this

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.730 
out and it's not working too well this
is<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:14.750> one<00:00:14.900> that<00:00:15.020> I<00:00:15.049> cut<00:00:15.350> earlier<00:00:16.270> and<00:00:17.710> when<00:00:18.710> I

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
is the one that I cut earlier and when I

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.870 
is the one that I cut earlier and when I
I<00:00:20.440> didn't<00:00:21.440> quite<00:00:21.680> put<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.070> right<00:00:22.220> taper<00:00:22.550> in

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
I didn't quite put the right taper in

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.849 
I didn't quite put the right taper in
the<00:00:23.119> plug<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:23.660> so<00:00:23.929> it's<00:00:24.080> very<00:00:24.230> difficult<00:00:24.500> to

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
the plug and so it's very difficult to

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.579 
the plug and so it's very difficult to
get<00:00:24.980> out<00:00:25.039> to<00:00:25.310> begin<00:00:25.460> with<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:26.000> as<00:00:26.929> I<00:00:27.170> pull<00:00:27.470> it

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:27.589 
get out to begin with and as I pull it

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.200 
get out to begin with and as I pull it
out<00:00:27.710> you<00:00:28.039> can<00:00:28.220> see<00:00:28.250> that<00:00:28.460> there's<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:31.000> piece<00:00:32.000> of

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
out you can see that there's a piece of

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.750 
out you can see that there's a piece of
spaghetti<00:00:32.450> inside<00:00:33.140> this<00:00:33.320> mold<00:00:33.680> that<00:00:34.160> unfolds

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
spaghetti inside this mold that unfolds

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.910 
spaghetti inside this mold that unfolds
as<00:00:34.880> I<00:00:35.000> pull<00:00:35.270> it<00:00:35.480> if<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:35.870> look<00:00:36.079> right<00:00:36.500> down<00:00:36.770> in

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
as I pull it if you look right down in

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.410 
as I pull it if you look right down in
there<00:00:38.050> that<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:39.350> rubber<00:00:39.890> that's<00:00:40.190> tearing<00:00:40.760> so

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
there that is rubber that's tearing so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.660 
there that is rubber that's tearing so
I'm<00:00:41.570> pushing<00:00:42.380> this<00:00:42.800> rubber<00:00:43.130> beyond<00:00:43.520> the

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
I'm pushing this rubber beyond the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.030 
I'm pushing this rubber beyond the
boundaries<00:00:44.060> that<00:00:44.390> I<00:00:44.420> should<00:00:44.720> go<00:00:44.980> so<00:00:45.980> I'm

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
boundaries that I should go so I'm

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.560 
boundaries that I should go so I'm
trying<00:00:46.310> to<00:00:46.340> keep<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:46.700> from<00:00:46.730> tearing<00:00:47.120> further

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
trying to keep it from tearing further

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.500 
trying to keep it from tearing further
but<00:00:48.700> clearly<00:00:49.700> this<00:00:49.850> is<00:00:50.030> not<00:00:50.060> going<00:00:50.330> to<00:00:50.390> be<00:00:50.480> a

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
but clearly this is not going to be a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.630 
but clearly this is not going to be a
production<00:00:50.720> mold<00:00:51.200> the<00:00:52.010> reason<00:00:52.400> that<00:00:52.490> it's

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
production mold the reason that it's

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.270 
production mold the reason that it's
causing<00:00:53.060> so<00:00:53.240> many<00:00:53.330> problems<00:00:53.450> is<00:00:54.350> because<00:00:55.040> I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
causing so many problems is because I

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.930 
causing so many problems is because I
didn't<00:00:58.280> cut<00:00:58.580> it<00:00:58.700> in<00:00:58.850> such<00:00:59.150> a<00:00:59.180> way<00:00:59.500> that<00:01:00.940> the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
didn't cut it in such a way that the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.770 
didn't cut it in such a way that the
plug<00:01:02.270> unravels<00:01:03.230> in<00:01:03.380> an<00:01:03.500> organized<00:01:04.010> fashion

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
plug unravels in an organized fashion

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.510 
plug unravels in an organized fashion
the<00:01:05.780> best<00:01:06.020> way<00:01:06.229> for<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.650> happen<00:01:08.320> on<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.770> mold

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
the best way for it to happen on a mold

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.700 
the best way for it to happen on a mold
like<00:01:10.790> this<00:01:11.150> is<00:01:12.850> when<00:01:13.850> I'm<00:01:14.290> pulling<00:01:15.290> this<00:01:15.440> out

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
like this is when I'm pulling this out

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.610 
like this is when I'm pulling this out
of<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:15.950> mold<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:17.240> spaghetti<00:01:17.840> should<00:01:18.290> peel

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
of the mold the spaghetti should peel

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.940 
of the mold the spaghetti should peel
the<00:01:18.890> bottom<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.550> plug<00:01:19.820> out<00:01:20.150> of<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.450> cavity

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
the bottom of the plug out of the cavity

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.020 
the bottom of the plug out of the cavity
this<00:01:21.950> part<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.640> this<00:01:23.300> part<00:01:23.420> comes<00:01:23.960> first<00:01:25.030> then

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
this part and this part comes first then

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.750 
this part and this part comes first then
the<00:01:26.840> piece<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.320> spaghetti<00:01:27.790> begins<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.940> unfold

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
the piece of spaghetti begins to unfold

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.880 
the piece of spaghetti begins to unfold
now<00:01:31.760> my<00:01:31.970> big<00:01:32.240> mistake<00:01:32.659> here<00:01:33.670> was<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.880> cut<00:01:35.890> too

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
now my big mistake here was to cut too

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.830 
now my big mistake here was to cut too
narrow<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.310> spot<00:01:37.700> here<00:01:37.970> I<00:01:38.000> should<00:01:38.120> have<00:01:38.330> only

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
narrow a spot here I should have only

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.010 
narrow a spot here I should have only
cut<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.380> far<00:01:39.710> but<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.460> biggest<00:01:40.670> mistake<00:01:41.270> was

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
cut that far but the biggest mistake was

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.300 
cut that far but the biggest mistake was
that<00:01:42.470> I<00:01:42.770> did<00:01:43.610> not<00:01:43.790> attach<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:45.500> spaghetti<00:01:45.979> to

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
that I did not attach the spaghetti to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.570 
that I did not attach the spaghetti to
the<00:01:46.430> bottom<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.290> this<00:01:49.479> inside<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.720> ring<00:01:51.049> so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
the bottom of this inside of the ring so

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.880 
the bottom of this inside of the ring so
this<00:01:52.580> right<00:01:53.270> here<00:01:53.740> should<00:01:54.740> have<00:01:54.770> been

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
this right here should have been

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.880 
this right here should have been
attached<00:01:55.460> right<00:01:56.299> there<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.590> what

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
attached right there so that what

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.100 
attached right there so that what
happens<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.549> when<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:58.909> pull<00:01:59.360> this<00:01:59.570> out<00:01:59.630> of<00:02:00.049> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
happens is when you pull this out of the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.870 
happens is when you pull this out of the
mold

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
mold

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.109 
mold
this<00:02:01.880> guy<00:02:02.240> gets<00:02:02.570> turned<00:02:02.960> inside<00:02:03.619> out<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:04.159> gets

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
this guy gets turned inside out and gets

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.169 
this guy gets turned inside out and gets
pulled<00:02:05.479> out<00:02:06.220> because<00:02:07.220> this<00:02:07.400> is<00:02:07.580> this<00:02:07.850> part

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
pulled out because this is this part

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.389 
pulled out because this is this part
right<00:02:08.360> here<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:08.869> quite<00:02:09.289> flexible<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.009> inside

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
right here is quite flexible the inside

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.450 
right here is quite flexible the inside
of<00:02:10.549> the<00:02:10.750> piece<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.989> quite<00:02:12.200> flexible

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
of the piece is quite flexible

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.900 
of the piece is quite flexible
so<00:02:15.460> if<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.700> can<00:02:15.880> get<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.180> guy<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.480> unfold

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
so if you can get this guy to unfold

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.740 
so if you can get this guy to unfold
inside<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.300> mold<00:02:20.490> then<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.940> leaves<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.570> really

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
inside the mold then it leaves a really

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.590 
inside the mold then it leaves a really
beautiful<00:02:23.470> wax<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.630> mold<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.770> wax

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
beautiful wax in the mold and that wax

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.250 
beautiful wax in the mold and that wax
pops<00:02:28.600> right<00:02:28.930> out<00:02:28.990> as<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.640> can<00:02:30.790> see<00:02:31.030> I'm<00:02:31.930> still

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
pops right out as you can see I'm still

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.830 
pops right out as you can see I'm still
having<00:02:32.440> trouble<00:02:32.890> with<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.190> mold<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:34.270> back<00:02:34.810> to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
having trouble with this mold so back to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.700 
having trouble with this mold so back to
the<00:02:35.110> drawing<00:02:35.140> board<00:02:35.580> now<00:02:36.720> if<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:38.470> have<00:02:38.680> a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
the drawing board now if you have a

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.220 
the drawing board now if you have a
drawing<00:02:39.100> board<00:02:39.340> good<00:02:39.580> if<00:02:40.210> you<00:02:40.600> don't<00:02:40.960> have<00:02:41.200> a
