Stamkos<00:00:37.559> who<00:00:37.680> probably<00:00:37.980> has<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> highest

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
Stamkos who probably has the highest

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.400 
Stamkos who probably has the highest
offensive<00:00:39.570> category<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.170> all<00:00:40.260> these

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
offensive category out of all these

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.290 
offensive category out of all these
centreman<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.550> number<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:41.940> Sidney

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300

Crosby<00:00:42.750> 96<00:00:43.230> overall<00:00:43.590> which<00:00:43.770> I'm<00:00:44.309> not<00:00:44.550> gonna

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
Crosby 96 overall which I'm not gonna

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
Crosby 96 overall which I'm not gonna
say<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.570> terrible<00:00:46.020> stat<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.219> he

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
say it's a terrible stat I think he

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.340 
say it's a terrible stat I think he
probably<00:00:47.309> should<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.820> 94<00:00:48.329> 95<00:00:48.930> because

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
probably should be like 94 95 because

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.100 
probably should be like 94 95 because

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
88 overall that's probably because he's

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.650

Zach Parise again the third the top the
bottom<00:01:38.369> three<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.790> mean<00:01:38.970> are<00:01:39.180> all<00:01:39.780> 90<00:01:40.200> overall

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
bottom three I mean are all 90 overall

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.410 
bottom three I mean are all 90 overall
so<00:01:40.890> he<00:01:41.130> could<00:01:41.310> argue<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:41.970> they're<00:01:42.299> all

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
so he could argue that they're all

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.359 
so he could argue that they're all
interchangeable<00:01:42.750> at<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> positions<00:01:44.159> then

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
interchangeable at the positions then

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.639 
interchangeable at the positions then
the<00:01:44.490> second<00:01:44.820> best<00:01:45.000> left<00:01:45.360> wing<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.720> zetterberg

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the second best left wing is zetterberg

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.109 
the second best left wing is zetterberg
whose<00:01:46.950> could<00:01:47.159> all<00:01:47.280> into<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> ice<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.000> then

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
whose could all into the ice and then

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.480 
whose could all into the ice and then
the<00:01:48.240> best<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.659> Ovechkin<00:01:49.320> who<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:50.189> probably

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the best is Ovechkin who it's probably

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.130 
the best is Ovechkin who it's probably
the<00:01:50.579> best<00:01:50.610> offensive<00:01:50.939> guy<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.899> whole

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the best offensive guy in this whole

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410 
the best offensive guy in this whole
game<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:53.100> defensively<00:01:53.640> he<00:01:53.939> lacks<00:01:54.210> with

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
game but defensively he lacks with

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.850 
game but defensively he lacks with
checking<00:01:54.630> he's<00:01:54.930> pretty<00:01:55.290> good<00:01:55.439> there<00:01:55.560> as<00:01:55.649> well

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
checking he's pretty good there as well

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.980 
checking he's pretty good there as well
that<00:01:56.430> moved<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.670> defense<00:01:57.060> char<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.630> finally

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that moved to defense char is finally

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.510 
that moved to defense char is finally
not<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> best<00:01:58.350> defense<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.860> game<00:01:58.920> he's<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
not the best defense in this game he's a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.550 
not the best defense in this game he's a
fifth<00:01:59.880> best<00:02:00.090> defenseman<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:00.659> 91<00:02:01.020> overall<00:02:01.259> so

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
fifth best defenseman at 91 overall so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.630 
fifth best defenseman at 91 overall so
he's<00:02:01.680> still<00:02:01.829> probably<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> be<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> beast

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
he's still probably going to be a beast

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.609 
he's still probably going to be a beast

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
think he should be 91 but hey it's the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.710 
think he should be 91 but hey it's the
stats<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:44.970> what's<00:02:45.150> going<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.359> be<00:02:45.510> the
