00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 yes I have been waiting for another in 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.069
 case one was so much time that not 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.360
 the fog came here but I think that 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.059
 it was very very difficult he waited 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.990
 a bit so maybe maybe that destiny 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.299
 so it went 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.120
 so we still have some time for 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.350
 think about preparing it 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.180
 in short, to replay it clearly 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.800
 in short, seven minutes is a bit disturbing 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.570
 obvious although it could not 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.970
 continue but ruin in quotation marks 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.710
 plans in short the program does not ruin i 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.080
 plans because I believe we went on 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.720
 disadvantage there are a lot that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.300
 there was no omen that could 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.730
 put yourself so though they are if out of 16 games 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.140
 of championship if it seems of advantage and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.059
 we have always granted the others by 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.350
 be able to reassemble something 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.330
 domandina we have to do it too 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.120
 here is why you think in short you are 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.949
 I'll show you tomorrow with never like ever 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.949
 but now we will see something 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.630
 we allow in situations that may not 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.520
 but it seems it was but right now 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.800
 others maybe even get 100 per 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.100
 hundred from situations maybe so that not 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.380
 they seem to be important and we are them 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.000
 we are paying everything will turn but 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.680
 above all we are of Lebanon will do 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.210
 shooting is something that comes to mind 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.369
 let's be more mental here I don't know if you are 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.430
 mental soccer agrees elementary 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.369
 physical and technical tactical and all the 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.280
 soccer a game you have to put 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.920
 all these aspects then 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.020
 you can't grant any fields 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.450
 difficult though we knew they are on the first 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.950
 good time ahead without risking 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.720
 never knew anything that we play 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.220
 this ball on the break 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.990
 dates a little light in the first in the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.479
 tie them and then they are also in the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.000
 second, however, I repeat at this time 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.820
 we are paying a little dear we all have to 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.740
 start paying a little less 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.040
 and collect a little more the two goals 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.870
 they obviously what happened 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.220
 things from the heat should not be reviewed 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.000
 all but I believe that something 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.260
 we have granted in general 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.650
 we were not in the defensive aspect 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.950
 certainly present as we should 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.440
 to be are still a long time and I repeat 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.119
 now gone was a situation of 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.640
 in short, emergency is not simple 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.340
 concede to the dream of granting martino 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.570
 Basin fighters among you liked it 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.970
 I think he did so many good things 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.160
 some things maybe missing because maybe 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.440
 which also lacks latitude la 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.069
 however, a player generally plays 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.799
 who knows 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.549
 the game dynamics, in short, we have 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.749
 preferred to keep it that way without changing 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.959
 however I believe that it is not there that the 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.219
 game has changed has changed 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.170
 you have thought so much even in the 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.639
 week I think of some change 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.099
 possible form has been talked about 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.989
 even a 4 2 4 you thought about it 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.599
 really can even start 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.400
 so one can change all that 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.689
 then we are always attitudes and of 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.060
 beyond the numbers that do what in the field 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.400
 the team has a way to play the way 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.639
 not being in the field is not there that you have 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.859
 lost the game he was not winning 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.180
 I ask revenge on bb having some 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.849
 situations in the middle of the field playing 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.330
 a certain way and I repeat it 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.830
 of the year many aspects 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.630
 and therefore something we may have 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.130
 prepared maybe later we will not 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.710
 I also know why to change one 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.300
 what you know but a little time 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.840
 a few days you feel like scolding 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.280
 something your nobody think I should 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.750
 and can reproach anything to all 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.820
 players all gave the maximum 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.629
 more, however, if we fail to lead to 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.120
 home something 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.540
 in general we leave a little something because it is 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.810
 a team that 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.670
 and so superior at certain times though 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.140
 it's not the first time we say maybe 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.450
 I hope it's the last one 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.920
 I do not know we see there is good news 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.109
 despite the fact the match was 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.549
 crystallized at the 36th 40 seconds 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.590
 so it means that shirt will be 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.810
 regularly in the field in brescia but at 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.799
 beyond maietta we are happy with 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.930
 party is not over 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.790
 it's not over I absolutely don't think about it 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.040
 not even then 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.530
 also to say that it could 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.849
 start again or not I thought about what 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.799
 could be the change in the last one 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.620
 quarter of an hour that must be it 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.870
 spirit now it's useless to think about it 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.689
 we must think about recovering energy 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.189
 think of palermo going there and for 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.650
 when it is time to think badly 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.000
 play these last two minutes 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.780
 minutes the match will be won a cup of 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.989
 sample if two minutes having us ne 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.380
 we have a little more then 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.819
 now it is prema believe us as much as but there 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.720
 we would miss anything else we must believe it 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.520
 why 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.010
 the team when playing plays however must 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.720
 playing there does not take much time 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.730
 so he will have to play faster more 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.650
 fast, however, now we have a bit 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.430
 time to think if we do well to 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.930
 palermo and play with it 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.610
 one hundred percent want to talk about it 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.990
 so we care about all the coaches is one 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.250
 society first of all because I believe that 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.630
 let's just get there we have 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.910
 struggled to pass the shifts for 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.040
 go to him and so we want to do one 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.140
 good game we play this team 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.910
 if there is a moment here today 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.830
 I don't know what derby will be 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.110
 we must recover go to 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.110
 play at 100 percent
