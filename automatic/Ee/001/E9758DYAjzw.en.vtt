00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.580
 A passage leads to delirium, to the detour 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.620
 Take the detour, enter where they do not find you 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.680
 Gaps in the heart 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.440
 Caves in the earth that keeps us 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:18.600
 Signs, brothers, ancestors, earth, love, desire, tribal, sign, grow 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.800
 We are not going to reveal our caverns 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.840
 We are going to reveal ourselves in the conscience 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.060
 We are not going to reveal our caverns 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.020
 We are going to reveal ourselves in the conscience 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.900
 And in the depth of his slow walk 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.420
 And in the deserts that do not explain 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.320
 What is the pretext? What is the concept? 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.700
 if there are so many sick minds that give me 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.100
 all the time lost 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.840
 in so many wars 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.500
 Gaps in the heart 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.540
 Caves in the earth that keeps us 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.320
 We are not going to reveal our caverns 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.120
 We are going to reveal ourselves in the conscience
