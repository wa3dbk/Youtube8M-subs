00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
okay the next going to be the governor

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.709 
okay the next going to be the governor
cutting<00:01:51.789> we're<00:01:52.789> looking<00:01:53.090> for<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.329> compressor

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
cutting we're looking for the compressor

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.870 
cutting we're looking for the compressor
to<00:01:53.869> turn<00:01:54.170> on<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.189> pressure<00:01:55.429> start

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
to turn on and the pressure start

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.300 
to turn on and the pressure start
building<00:01:56.119> up<00:01:56.240> again<00:01:56.590> this<00:01:57.590> happens<00:01:57.979> between

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
building up again this happens between

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.219 
building up again this happens between
90<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.670> 100<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.539> no<00:02:00.439> lower<00:02:00.710> than<00:02:00.829> 85<00:02:02.229> I'm

gonna lose air pressure by pressing on

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.459 
gonna lose air pressure by pressing on
the<00:02:05.060> service<00:02:05.390> brake<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:05.810> just<00:02:06.109> wait<00:02:06.259> some

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
the service brake and just wait some

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:30.620 
the service brake and just wait some
time

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.170
