shooting with joystick and the bottom

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.990 
shooting with joystick and the bottom
you<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:55.079> actually<00:00:55.469> draw<00:00:56.129> curved<00:00:56.699> lines

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you can now actually draw curved lines

okay exactly
and<00:01:27.530> when<00:01:28.130> you're<00:01:28.280> very<00:01:28.549> close<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:28.969> goal

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
and when you're very close to the goal

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.820 
and when you're very close to the goal
you<00:01:29.329> can<00:01:29.360> actually<00:01:30.020> do<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.009> trick<00:01:31.399> shots

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.210 

so<00:01:36.830> I<00:01:36.890> can<00:01:37.070> just<00:01:37.340> tap<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.810> if<00:01:39.080> joe<00:01:39.350> says<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.100> all

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
so I can just tap and if joe says it all

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.150 
so I can just tap and if joe says it all
yes<00:01:40.640> it's<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:41.630> nice<00:01:41.810> trick<00:01:42.050> shot<00:01:42.230> so<00:01:42.830> what's

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
yes it's a nice trick shot so what's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.760 
yes it's a nice trick shot so what's
with<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.460> 3d<00:01:43.970> models<00:01:44.300> of<00:01:44.420> players<00:01:44.780> them<00:01:45.230> where

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
with the 3d models of players them where

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.760 
with the 3d models of players them where
they<00:01:46.430> have<00:01:46.580> no<00:01:46.730> collisions<00:01:47.240> or<00:01:47.540> do<00:01:48.260> they<00:01:48.620> have

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
they have no collisions or do they have

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.820 
they have no collisions or do they have
new<00:01:48.920> skins<00:01:49.310> no<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.420> graphing<00:01:50.900> is<00:01:51.050> pretty

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
new skins no the graphing is pretty

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.720 
new skins no the graphing is pretty
similar<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.730> what<00:01:53.120> we<00:01:53.240> had<00:01:53.420> in<00:01:53.570> 13<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.800> the

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
similar to what we had in 13 so the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.150 
similar to what we had in 13 so the
reason<00:01:55.850> for<00:01:56.180> that<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:56.570> 13<00:01:57.350> was<00:01:57.620> a<00:01:57.650> huge

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
reason for that is that 13 was a huge

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.820 
reason for that is that 13 was a huge
leap<00:01:58.400> from<00:01:58.730> 12<00:01:59.060> yeah<00:01:59.390> terms<00:01:59.810> in<00:02:00.440> terms<00:02:00.500> of

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
leap from 12 yeah terms in terms of

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.730 
leap from 12 yeah terms in terms of
graphics<00:02:01.100> whatever<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:01.970> this<00:02:02.180> year

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010 

in<00:02:05.250> terms<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.579> their<00:02:05.820> interspace<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.780> we

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
in terms of their interspace what we

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.260 
in terms of their interspace what we
work<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.979> words<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.489> menus<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.119> were

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
work on words the menus that were

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.559 
work on words the menus that were
completely<00:02:09.599> needed<00:02:10.050> Simon<00:02:10.530> now<00:02:10.830> look<00:02:11.069> like

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
completely needed Simon now look like

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.710 
completely needed Simon now look like
the<00:02:12.569> ones<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:13.110> have<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:14.340> console<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.090> also<00:02:15.599> in

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
the ones we have on console and also in

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.960 
the ones we have on console and also in
Ultimate<00:02:16.170> Team<00:02:16.410> both<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.340> items<00:02:17.730> were

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
Ultimate Team both the items were

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.850 
Ultimate Team both the items were
redesigned<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.980> all<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.330> screen<00:02:21.330> citizen<00:02:21.989> so

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
redesigned and all the screen citizen so

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.050 
redesigned and all the screen citizen so
it<00:02:23.010> was<00:02:23.420> less<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.959> actual<00:02:25.920> players<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
it was less on the actual players and

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.050 
it was less on the actual players and
more<00:02:27.840> off<00:02:27.989> on<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.560> player<00:02:29.069> interface

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
more off on the player interface
