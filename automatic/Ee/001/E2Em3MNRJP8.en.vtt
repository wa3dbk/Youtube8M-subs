00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.310 
I'm whether I need more coverage less
coverage<00:00:14.760> but<00:00:15.180> in<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> winter<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.750> my<00:00:15.870> skin<00:00:16.139> is

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
like how this looks just a little bit

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:27.780 
like how this looks just a little bit

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.820

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
because this is virtually the exact same

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.030 
because this is virtually the exact same
color<00:01:31.100> as<00:01:31.370> my<00:01:31.550> skin<00:01:31.900> I<00:01:32.900> don't<00:01:33.650> really<00:01:33.800> have<00:01:33.950> to

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
color as my skin I don't really have to

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.490 
color as my skin I don't really have to
bring<00:01:34.160> it<00:01:34.280> down<00:01:34.400> my<00:01:34.520> neck<00:01:34.700> too<00:01:34.940> far<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:36.350> then

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
bring it down my neck too far and then

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.960 
bring it down my neck too far and then
I'm<00:01:36.590> just<00:01:36.620> gonna<00:01:36.890> work<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.250> up<00:01:37.460> into<00:01:37.760> my

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
I'm just gonna work it up into my

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.390 
I'm just gonna work it up into my
forehead<00:01:40.840> in<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.960> circular<00:01:42.200> motion<00:01:42.650> into<00:01:43.280> my

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
forehead in a circular motion into my

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.500 
forehead in a circular motion into my
hairline<00:01:43.610> blending<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:46.090> now<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.120> do<00:01:47.210> have<00:01:47.390> my

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
hairline blending it now I do have my

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.650 
hairline blending it now I do have my
forehead<00:01:47.900> lines<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.380> do<00:01:48.440> find<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:49.100> this

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
forehead lines and I do find that this

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.300 
forehead lines and I do find that this
settles<00:01:50.770> into<00:01:51.770> my<00:01:53.260> forehead<00:01:54.260> lines<00:01:54.860> forehead

settles into my forehead lines forehead

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.850 
settles into my forehead lines forehead
wrinkles<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.330> I<00:01:56.660> would<00:01:56.900> definitely<00:01:57.320> not<00:01:57.530> put
