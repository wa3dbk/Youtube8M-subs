00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.410 
works but works best when you already
have<00:03:32.750> an<00:03:33.320> existing<00:03:33.440> relationship<00:03:34.060> with<00:03:35.060> that

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
have an existing relationship with that

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.210 
have an existing relationship with that
client<00:03:35.870> meaning<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:36.800> you've<00:03:36.920> already

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
client meaning that you've already

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.120 
client meaning that you've already
worked<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:38.000> at<00:03:38.540> least<00:03:38.690> one<00:03:39.080> project<00:03:39.440> with<00:03:39.890> them

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
worked on at least one project with them

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.310 
worked on at least one project with them
so<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.700> they<00:03:40.850> really<00:03:41.450> feel<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.900> trusses

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
so that they really feel the trusses

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.320 
so that they really feel the trusses
there<00:03:42.560> you<00:03:42.920> both<00:03:43.520> know<00:03:43.820> that<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.060> enjoy

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
there you both know that you enjoy

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.199 
there you both know that you enjoy
working<00:03:44.600> together<00:03:45.070> and<00:03:46.070> that's<00:03:46.520> the<00:03:46.760> basis

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
working together and that's the basis

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.780 
working together and that's the basis
for<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.660> pay<00:03:48.290> for<00:03:48.560> access<00:03:48.890> is<00:03:48.980> very<00:03:49.190> uncommon

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
for the pay for access is very uncommon

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.449 
for the pay for access is very uncommon
and<00:03:50.209> really<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:50.989> wouldn't<00:03:51.410> recommend<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:52.040> get

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
and really I wouldn't recommend to get

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.280 
and really I wouldn't recommend to get
right<00:03:52.790> into<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.060> pay-for<00:03:53.540> access<00:03:53.870> type<00:03:54.110> of

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
right into a pay-for access type of

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.199 
right into a pay-for access type of
model<00:03:54.590> or<00:03:54.650> situation<00:03:55.220> with<00:03:55.640> someone<00:03:55.910> you've

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
model or situation with someone you've

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.729 
model or situation with someone you've
never<00:03:56.570> worked<00:03:56.810> with<00:03:57.020> before<00:03:57.170> it's<00:03:57.500> really

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
never worked with before it's really

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.100 
never worked with before it's really
hard<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.070> sell<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:58.970> client<00:03:59.300> but<00:03:59.870> it's<00:04:00.020> a

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
hard to sell it to a client but it's a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.860 
hard to sell it to a client but it's a
beautiful<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.830> natural<00:04:01.030> transition<00:04:02.030> after

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
beautiful and natural transition after

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.470 
beautiful and natural transition after
you've<00:04:03.290> done<00:04:03.830> some<00:04:04.130> initial<00:04:04.340> work<00:04:04.550> for<00:04:05.360> that

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
you've done some initial work for that

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.300 
you've done some initial work for that
client<00:04:05.750> they've<00:04:06.320> seen<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.770> results<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.190> you

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
can generate for them and the value that

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.210 
can generate for them and the value that
you<00:04:08.900> can<00:04:09.080> bring<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.500> they<00:04:09.769> want<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.040> be<00:04:10.160> able
