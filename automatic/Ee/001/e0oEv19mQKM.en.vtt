00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:09.190
 If you want to make your computer faster, give the correct amount of memory 

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:11.132
 you most value for money. 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.229
 How are you? I'm Chris. Welcome to HP Workbench! 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.210
 This is a video from our series about choosing and installing PC memory. 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.126
 Today I tell a few things about memory 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.104
 and let me show you how much memory you need. 

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:28.028
 Two things are needed to install memory. 

00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:32.008
 First you need to know how much memory you need to buy and then you have to install it. 

00:00:32.035 --> 00:00:34.179
 If you can handle a screwdriver 

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:36.121
 you can do it yourself. 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.016
 So today I will give you some basic information about memory. 

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:42.182
 Basic information 

00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:47.043
 such as the size, type, speed and how much you need. That is very easy. 

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:52.105
 In other videos I show how you can install memory in desktop PCs 

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:56.144
 and notebooks, how much memory is already in your PC 

00:00:56.242 --> 00:00:58.209
 and how much you can add. 

00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:05.108
 So watch this and the other videos first before you decide to upgrade yourself, 

00:01:05.118 --> 00:01:08.064
 then you understand the whole process. 

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:13.251
 Memory is also called RAM or Random Access Memory 

00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:17.248
 so if I say RAM that means memory too. 

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:21.052
 And this is what memory looks like. 

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:26.055
 These things are called modules, but fast guys like me call them "sticks." 

00:01:26.092 --> 00:01:33.154
 You place it in one of the slots on the motherboard - this way. 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.108
 Now there are usually 2 or 4 or 6 slots on the motherboard. 

00:01:40.163 --> 00:01:46.008
 You don't have to fill them all, but you can, so that's handy. 

00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:52.084
 You usually have 1 Gigabyte or 2 Gigabyte modules 

00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:56.162
 and if you want to know how much memory there is in total in the system, add it up. 

00:01:56.205 --> 00:02:00.160
 You add up the modules to find out how much memory you have: 

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:05.147
 for example, 1 Gigabyte plus 1 Gigabyte 

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:06.020
 what? 

00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:06.262
 2 gigabytes 

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:13.183
 and 1 plus 2 is 3 Gigabytes and so on, until you know how much memory there is in the PC. 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:19.807
 There are three types nowadays. 

00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:20.226
 The smallest are SO-DIMMs. 

00:02:20.254 --> 00:02:22.025
 You will find this in notebooks 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.177
 and HP Touchsmart PCs. 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.132
 There are also the DDR2s. 

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.125
 You can find it in desktop PCs. 

00:02:27.157 --> 00:02:30.014
 Finally, there are the new DDR3s 

00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:31.252
 which are also used in desktop PCs. 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.168
 Now I want to show you something. 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.272
 Do you see how the notches differ here? They are not in the same place! 

00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:40.175
 That is because these species are not interchangeable. 

00:02:40.224 --> 00:02:42.097
 So you always have to make sure you choose the right type. 

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:46.137
 Do not try to combine a DDR2 with a DDR3, because that does not work. 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.189
 You can combine different speeds, 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.060
 but then the memory is as fast as the slowest module, 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.181
 and it never gets faster than the speed of the motherboard. 

00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:57.183
 Anyway, speed is not the most important thing for me. 

00:02:57.228 --> 00:03:01.079
 I find more memory more important than the highest speed; 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.240
 Now there is one option that you must use and that is the two-channel mode, 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.267
 gives your computer processor more bandwidth when accessing the memory. 

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:13.282
 That makes it a bit faster and that's great 

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:17.151
 So let's say your PC has two 1 Gigabyte modules 

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:20.159
 contains access to the memory at 64-bit speed. 

00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:28.070
 In two-channel mode, the PC sees it together as one large 2-Gigabyte module with 128 bits. 

00:03:28.104 --> 00:03:31.158
 So it no longer goes from the processor to the memory 

00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:35.170
 let's say a roadway 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.265
 but on two, so twice as much. 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.285
 And that is completely crazy. 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.291
 So if your system supports this, and it probably is, 

00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:49.186
 it works automatically if you install modules in equal pairs. 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.002
 Now you ask "What are equal pairs?" I'll explain that. 

00:03:52.037 --> 00:03:54.175
 That is if the modules have the same size and speed 

00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:56.203
 and made by the same manufacturer. 

00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:59.163
 So if you want to upgrade your machine to 4 Gigabytes, 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.128
 are you best off with four 1 Gigabyte modules 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.263
 or 2 2 Gigabyte modules of the same type. 

00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:08.033
 These are usually packed together, so that is useful if you have to buy them. 

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:10.166
 Why should we not put in as much as possible? 

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:16.298
 But there are limitations. 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.275
 Remember that I said that there are only a few slots in the PC 

00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:23.143
 and that the modules are supplied in different sizes? 

00:04:23.198 --> 00:04:24.198
 That is the first limitation. 

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.219
 The next limitation is the motherboard itself. 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.229
 Some motherboards are only suitable 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.188
 for certain sticks and have a limited total capacity. 

00:04:33.234 --> 00:04:36.278
 So it makes no sense to install a 2 Gigabyte module 

00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:38.188
 if the motherboard does not support it. 

00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:40.102
 And it also has no use to install 8 Gigabytes 

00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:42.175
 if the motherboard uses no more than 4 Gigabytes. 

00:04:42.227 --> 00:04:43.165
 Gaped? 

00:04:43.222 --> 00:04:48.079
 You can easily find out what the capacity of the motherboard is. 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.050
 If you have an HP or Compaq PC, 

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:55.088
 watch our other videos about system capacity 

00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:57.093
 and otherwise you can check it in the documentation. 

00:04:57.132 --> 00:05:02.028
 The last limitation is the operating system. 

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:07.293
 For example, if you have a 32-bit version of Windows Vista, it supports a maximum of 4 Gigabytes. 

00:05:08.054 --> 00:05:09.007
 Fine! 

00:05:09.048 --> 00:05:15.150
 But if you have a 64-bit version of Vista, it can use much more memory. 

00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:20.024
 For example 8 Gigabyte for the Home Basic, 16 Gigabyte for the Home Premium 

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:28.036
 and 128 Gigabytes for the Vista Business, Ultimate and Enterprise editions. 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.241
 With more memory you can easily run more applications 

00:05:40.014 --> 00:05:40.290
 and your computer gets faster. 

00:05:41.087 --> 00:05:43.028
 but that too changes over time! 

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:46.268
 At the beginning of 2009 the answer was: 4Gigabyte is approximately the maximum. 

00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:50.226
 The minimum you need to use your computer is 1 Gigabyte, 

00:05:50.253 --> 00:05:54.016
 but in that case I recommend that you add some memory. 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.207
 With 1 Gigabyte you can only do simple things, 

00:05:56.283 --> 00:05:59.070
 such as web browsing and e-mail processing. 

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:06.154
 If you use multiple applications or edit photos, I recommend 2 Gigabytes or more. 

00:06:06.202 --> 00:06:09.225
 With 2 Gigabyte you can also perform simple video editing, 

00:06:09.297 --> 00:06:13.014
 but then you must first close a few other applications. 

00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:17.267
 If you edit many videos or continuously play intensive video games, 

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:23.048
 I recommend that you install 4 Gigabytes - and also get away from the PC. 

00:06:23.134 --> 00:06:25.003
 It's just an idea. 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.295
 It is best to look at the performance meter in the Windows sidebar. 

00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:34.261
 If you continue to use approximately 60% of your capacity or more, 

00:06:34.298 --> 00:06:36.174
 it's time to add memory. 

00:06:36.214 --> 00:06:40.051
 And with current prices I would say: 

00:06:40.106 --> 00:06:42.082
 if your computer can handle it, just install 4 Gigabyte. 

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:45.173
