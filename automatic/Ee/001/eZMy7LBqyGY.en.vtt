 we are like 50 and here we are in 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:32.210
 kraft robbery first we start as you know 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.559
 the points to get the skis and 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.449
 made good participation while 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.460
 be apart of recording a couple of accounts 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.540
 have today I bring you a video where 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.640
 I show this in play that has touched me 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.080
 against a box battle taken out spelling the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.930
 sniper that where we give them a good 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.640
 beating the boss and you'll see that with 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.589
 girls some little things and also you 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.180
 I bring a video where I show you a 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.340
 little bit the next DIY I've 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.680
 built to see if you like it if you like 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.840
 and you tell me in the comments then 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.789
 I will upload the DIY and if not 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.430
 now when I do what is the 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.989
 images of play then I will comment on a 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.780
 how are they like I did the 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.789
 DIY and that because what's done but in 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.110
 principle we are here in the bat that the 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.840
 small and you know is that I have got 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.509
 the 3 with tier 4 shield and expensive root 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.340
 he has 5 which is pretty troll is 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.050
 I get the points very easy 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.670
 catch anything you do a little bit of 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.320
 damage and that the separate game 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.640
 I stay here , we have it 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:32.000
 get me pulled on some 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.869
 the sleepers and we're going to fuck the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.200
 guns there is first one end and then the 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.200
 other 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.560
 and we already go to the next 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.170
 this is the DIY I have 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.969
 built and what I hope if you like it 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.590
 we will upload it in principle we develop 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.349
 the skis I tried to make a motorbike 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.649
 worth the impossible moment motorcycles 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.270
 do them because by doing these they fall 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.590
 they turn around everywhere is impossible 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.450
 handle the seats at the moment of 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.579
 currently still investigating to put 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.349
 keep investigating where I have built 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.980
 this sniper this sniper that carries the 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:16.360
 skis so you can go by land 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.640
 that is to say be still and it is also 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.830
 let's say a fighter can save us by 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.570
 course as you want but having some 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.550
 skis you have the landing with which 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.340
 can be moved on land and in 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.330
 air and quite trolling this happens so 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.770
 less here in training has not 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.750
 tested in games but pretty troll 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.370
 toe very very well you see 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.040
 let's get it to brake that I landed 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.140
 well you can by land also there what 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.400
 we have 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.150
 so if you like it then put a 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.220
 first name 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.080
 and I show you DIY the week that 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.120
 comes from Monday or Tuesday 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.740
 I will DIY how to do it 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.360
 I have built you worry but 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.850
 Nicholas is recorded simply is 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.920
 remove it and put it I put it here to 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.720
 see if you like I said I tried 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.150
 do the snowmobile you want is that 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.630
 you asked me a lot is but I can not do 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.370
 which is stable for which being 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.780
 a snowmobile clear if I make another 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.400
 wider vehicle type and it 's super is 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.020
 a snowmobile will continue to investigate 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.610
 been investigating enough time 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.440
 moment it occurred to me to do this 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.350
 vehicle is worth that I think that pretty 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.760
 useful guys ni but I've put the sniper 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.950
 by how to take the train landing by 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.170
 below it does not let me put the weapons in 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.030
 TomÃ¡s portico we know a sniper what 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.990
 sad that can be put on the floor 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.560
 That 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.260
 change the quick position that can be 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.890
 a vehicle of the 5 with rai expensive of tier 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.420
 6 ok I'm telling you if you like the 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.450
 vehicle you know it's pretty good it's 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.890
 very agile and I quite control 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.430
 moves very well changes very very very 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.440
 very fast I have put stops the 5 and 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.610
 although you load and that recovers 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.300
 fairly good 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.750
 control handling and you know it a 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.210
 little bit of things and nothing and I liked 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.890
 a lot how it works the same is not my best 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.780
 old diy construction but yeah 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.400
 I think you're going to like it 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.040
 giova likes how it works and we have like 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.110
 laughter hit nothing happens moves by 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.730
 land moves quite well with the 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.500
 skis as you can see you have to put 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.390
 reactors mice also backwards and 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.090
 to arrive and said to take the rays 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.830
 multiair 6 is a vehicle he has five 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.000
 whereupon who only has six 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.840
 even I think it's okay can you 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.750
 put the 2 2 between 6 and even put a 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.760
 17 if you want but good since already 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.150
 you already see how it moves is not bad 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.760
 I think it looks pretty good there 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.950
 recovering pretty well maneuvering ay 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.270
 watch us fix the dumps enjoy them 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.430
 how will you recover fast 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.930
 there we do it like that we make a turn and 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.910
 we are already in the air again 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.500
 nonetheless the agile tour pretty fast 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.770
 enough that is capable of changing the 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.770
 quick position and that we do not have for 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.880
 the map that yes to be a sniper 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.640
 someone can practice the shot of 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.340
 movement or if it does not land jce shoots 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.500
 jce and is able the psuv sniper that has 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.090
 a lot of maneuverability and quite 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.560
 firepower so you already know if 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.750
 you liked to say in the comments 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.860
 that I show you DIY if not not what 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.860
 I'll show you later
