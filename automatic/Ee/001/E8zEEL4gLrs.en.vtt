I mean we went on ahead without you but
here's<00:02:42.600> some<00:02:42.780> flares<00:02:43.400> great

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.960 

anyways<00:02:48.330> let's<00:02:48.510> stop<00:02:48.690> complaining<00:02:49.170> but<00:02:49.970> okay

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
anyways let's stop complaining but okay

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.660 
anyways let's stop complaining but okay
once<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.360> get<00:02:51.480> down<00:02:51.630> here<00:02:51.739> you're<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:53.400> think

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
once you get down here you're I think

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.120 
once you get down here you're I think
one<00:02:54.000> more<00:02:54.120> building<00:02:54.330> here<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:55.470> get<00:02:55.620> warm

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
one more building here to get warm

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.470 
one more building here to get warm
but<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.489> think<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> last<00:02:57.180> one<00:02:57.420> you

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
but I think this is the last one you

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.759 
but I think this is the last one you
don't<00:02:57.690> have<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.900> worry<00:02:58.080> about<00:02:58.200> from<00:02:58.500> here<00:02:58.650> on

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
don't have to worry about from here on

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.130 
don't have to worry about from here on
in<00:02:58.950> because<00:02:59.160> apparently<00:02:59.610> it<00:03:00.300> warms<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:01.019> a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
in because apparently it warms up a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.310 
in because apparently it warms up a
little<00:03:01.290> bit<00:03:01.470> on<00:03:01.709> its<00:03:01.950> own<00:03:03.200> weather's<00:03:04.200> getting

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
little bit on its own weather's getting

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.550 
little bit on its own weather's getting
nicer<00:03:04.799> spring<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.790> approaching<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:07.410> know<00:03:09.560> and
