using that money that charge is called
an<00:00:54.270> interest<00:00:54.750> rate<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> simple<00:00:57.239> example

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
an interest rate so in a simple example

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.770 
an interest rate so in a simple example
if<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.440> borrow<00:00:58.680> $100<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.210> interest<00:01:00.570> rate

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
if you borrow $100 and the interest rate

if you borrow $100 and the interest rate
is<00:01:00.899> 10%<00:01:01.230> per<00:01:01.710> year<00:01:02.059> then<00:01:03.059> you'll<00:01:03.300> pay<00:01:03.570> ten

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
is 10% per year then you'll pay ten

dollars to the lender for the privilege

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.920 
dollars to the lender for the privilege
of<00:01:05.850> using<00:01:06.060> their<00:01:06.510> money<00:01:06.890> make<00:01:07.890> sense<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.630> next

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
of using their money make sense the next

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.210 
of using their money make sense the next
thing<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.229> need<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.409> keep<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.740> mind<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.189> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
thing you need to keep in mind is that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.980 
thing you need to keep in mind is that
you'll<00:01:11.490> pay<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.119> money<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.479> your<00:01:12.840> auto

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
loan if your interest rate is high then

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.899 
loan if your interest rate is high then
you<00:01:15.420> will<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.049> low<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> case

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
you will if it's low so in this case

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.359 
you will if it's low so in this case
being<00:01:18.689> low<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.320> better<00:01:19.710> than<00:01:19.950> being<00:01:20.100> high

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
being low is better than being high

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.469 
being low is better than being high
which<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.330> clearly<00:01:21.780> counterintuitive<00:01:23.479> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
which is clearly counterintuitive the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
which is clearly counterintuitive the
next<00:01:24.750> question<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:25.979> figure<00:01:26.250> out

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
next question is how do they figure out

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.100 
next question is how do they figure out
what<00:01:26.790> interest<00:01:27.119> rates<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.360> charge<00:01:27.659> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
what interest rates you charge and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.490 
what interest rates you charge and
that's<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.220> bit<00:01:29.430> more<00:01:29.579> complicated

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
that's a bit more complicated

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.630 
that's a bit more complicated
essentially<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> has<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> car

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
essentially it has to do with the car

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.789 
essentially it has to do with the car
you're<00:01:32.820> buying<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.450> how<00:01:34.049> good<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.500> credit

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799

you're buying and how good of a credit
risk<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> best<00:01:37.740> thing<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:37.979> can

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
risk you are so the best thing you can

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.039 
risk you are so the best thing you can
do<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.729> improve<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.270> interest<00:01:39.570> rate<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.990> your
