00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.150
 bossing pizza doubt which means 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.089
 more people to launch a 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.330
 we have organized this 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.160
 event with 300 operators among operators 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.740
 of the agri-food sector of the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.280
 pizza of the restaurant and also of 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.350
 other people in three hundred this evening 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.390
 they overcome the Guinness Book of Records 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:35.210
 detained practically in california since 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.890
 28 of June 2014 there are a group of 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.440
 Neapolitans but there is a large group e 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.239
 the Abruzzo region of Puglia and Calabria 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.910
 of Lazio 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.920
 and then there are let's say delle 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.159
 representations from the united states since 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.409
 South America from Japan to the task today 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.819
 enforce and enforce the 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.850
 gene regulation are the things that 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:59.319
 provides for the attempt of the major 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.220
 number of people kneading a pizza 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:04.340
 at the same time 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.860
 because the latter must be done 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.400
 then the pizza of the minimum diameter of 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.310
 31 cm year at least one minute of time 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.990
 even to be able to mix it e 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.630
 make it become normal size 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.700
 on a traditional pizza 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.150
 this is an honor for me the honor of 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.640
 participate in this great event ed 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.440
 important and I'm also happy how 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.600
 one of the few 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.630
 women participating in this event by 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.970
 being able to take back what we are 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.159
 this is not the Americans though 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.649

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.869
 we are also good at making pizzas from 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.499
 our approach the kitchen and the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.929
 women 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:48.149
 let's say naples wants to represent 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.090

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.219

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:20.540
 cosentino we have 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:23.720
