I<00:00:30.920> first<00:00:31.920> learned<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.279> trick<00:00:32.489> because<00:00:32.850> I

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
I first learned a trick because I

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.970 
I first learned a trick because I
thought<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.360> cool<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.840> try<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.590> board

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
thought it was cool to try it on a board

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.819 
thought it was cool to try it on a board
on<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:36.300> ground<00:00:36.570> without<00:00:36.899> trucks<00:00:37.469> or<00:00:37.620> wills

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
on the ground without trucks or wills

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.830 
on the ground without trucks or wills
and<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.640> got<00:00:38.790> used<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.210> trying<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and I just got used to trying it and

what<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.800> want<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.190> first<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.090> want<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
what you want to do first is you want to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.330 
what you want to do first is you want to
learn<00:00:54.449> ollies<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:54.899> nollies<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.219> know

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
learn ollies and nollies like you know

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.130 
learn ollies and nollies like you know
you<00:00:56.399> lean<00:00:56.760> forward<00:00:57.449> when<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.750> do<00:00:57.870> an<00:00:57.989> ollie

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you lean forward when you do an ollie

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920 
you lean forward when you do an ollie
you<00:00:58.859> lean<00:00:59.039> forward<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.539> basically

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
you lean forward so you're basically

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.460 
you lean forward so you're basically
leaning<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.960> forward

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
leaning like that going in a forward

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.070 
leaning like that going in a forward
motion<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> learn<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:06.840> ease

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
motion so you want to learn now ease

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.929 
motion so you want to learn now ease
first<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:07.740> once<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.400> learn<00:01:08.580> Ollie's

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
first and then once you learn Ollie's

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.280 
first and then once you learn Ollie's
and<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.450> what<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> mean<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.110> want<00:01:10.260> to

what I'm comfortable to do it but you

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.280 
what I'm comfortable to do it but you
know<00:01:24.060> some<00:01:24.299> people<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.840> them<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.080> put

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
know some people I see them they put

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.590 
know some people I see them they put
their<00:01:25.409> foot<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:26.280> really<00:01:26.880> far<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
their foot like really far in there to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.410 
their foot like really far in there to
catch<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.930> good<00:01:28.140> flick<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:30.030> want<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> learn

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
catch a good flick so you want to learn

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.969 
catch a good flick so you want to learn
how<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.600> flip<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.650> where<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
how to flip it and that's where the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.819 
how to flip it and that's where the
basis<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> trick<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.680> when<00:01:34.680> you're

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
basis of the trick is and when you're

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:35.690 
basis of the trick is and when you're
nollie

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
nollie

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.550 
nollie
you<00:01:36.060> want<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> nollie<00:01:36.570> high<00:01:36.960> enough<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.470> you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you want to nollie high enough so you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.580 
you want to nollie high enough so you
can<00:01:37.770> flip<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.360> caught<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.659> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
can flip it and not get caught up you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
can flip it and not get caught up you
know<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.979> flick<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.880> Primo<00:01:42.420> or

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
know in the flick on the Primo or

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.090 
know in the flick on the Primo or
anything<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.530> flip<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> hard

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
anything like that so flip it hard

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.859 
anything like that so flip it hard
enough<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.670> too<00:01:44.729> hard<00:01:45.149> where<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.509> goes

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
enough but not too hard where it goes

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.499 
enough but not too hard where it goes
doubling<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.740> end<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.640> cream-oil<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
doubling you end up cream-oil like that

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.180 
doubling you end up cream-oil like that
so<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.619> pretty<00:01:49.740> much<00:01:50.009> it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.280 

so<00:01:55.190> basically<00:01:55.850> like<00:01:56.210> I<00:01:56.360> learned<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:57.140> know

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
so basically like I learned it you know

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.080 
so basically like I learned it you know
with<00:01:57.560> no<00:01:57.740> trucks<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.310> wheels<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:58.729> was<00:01:58.940> like

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
with no trucks and wheels so I was like

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.170 
with no trucks and wheels so I was like
stationary<00:01:59.860> carpet<00:02:00.860> skating<00:02:01.310> it's<00:02:01.549> what<00:02:01.700> you

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
stationary carpet skating it's what you

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.570 
stationary carpet skating it's what you
know<00:02:02.330> we<00:02:02.900> call<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.140> or<00:02:03.380> whatever<00:02:03.650> or<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.040> call<00:02:04.369> it

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
know we call it or whatever or I call it

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.940 
know we call it or whatever or I call it
carpet<00:02:05.000> skating<00:02:05.420> where<00:02:05.750> you're<00:02:05.960> skating<00:02:06.770> and

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
carpet skating where you're skating and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.070 
carpet skating where you're skating and
stationary<00:02:07.670> with<00:02:07.909> no<00:02:08.119> trucks<00:02:08.450> no<00:02:08.569> wheel<00:02:08.899> it's
