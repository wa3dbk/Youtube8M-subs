down<00:00:27.539> inside<00:00:28.019> there<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.380> notice<00:00:28.710> there's<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
down inside there we notice there's a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.529 
down inside there we notice there's a
couple<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.340> nuts<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.150> laying<00:00:30.359> around

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
couple of nuts can just laying around

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.820 
couple of nuts can just laying around
there<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:30.960> we're<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.230> pull<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> covers

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
there so we're going to pull the covers

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.370 
there so we're going to pull the covers
off<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.090> was<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.270> fix<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.690> there<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
off and see what was in fix in there and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:53.590 
off and see what was in fix in there and
get<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.250 

okay<00:00:54.260> we<00:00:54.500> pulled<00:00:54.769> it<00:00:54.890> apart<00:00:55.539> the<00:00:56.539> net<00:00:56.809> we<00:00:56.989> found

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
okay we pulled it apart the net we found

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.869 
okay we pulled it apart the net we found
was<00:00:57.530> just<00:00:57.820> backed<00:00:58.820> off<00:00:59.089> of<00:00:59.300> this<00:01:00.489> cable<00:01:01.489> ear<00:01:01.640> so

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
was just backed off of this cable ear so

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.740 
was just backed off of this cable ear so
that<00:01:01.909> was<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.149> quick<00:01:02.390> fix<00:01:03.759> I<00:01:04.759> got<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.269> belt<00:01:05.509> off

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
that was a quick fix I got the belt off

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.910 
that was a quick fix I got the belt off
their<00:01:06.049> we're<00:01:06.200> just<00:01:06.350> going<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.500> lube<00:01:06.680> up<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
their we're just going to lube up the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.280 
their we're just going to lube up the
the<00:01:07.549> tensioners<00:01:08.149> and<00:01:08.330> everything<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.780> then

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
the tensioners and everything and then

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.990 
the tensioners and everything and then
we'll<00:01:12.920> see<00:01:13.100> if<00:01:13.130> we<00:01:13.220> can<00:01:13.340> get<00:01:13.399> this<00:01:13.580> bitch

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
we'll see if we can get this bitch

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.359 
we'll see if we can get this bitch
running<00:01:14.390> I<00:01:14.720> don't<00:01:15.619> think<00:01:15.890> it's<00:01:16.009> gonna<00:01:16.100> take

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
running I don't think it's gonna take

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.480 
running I don't think it's gonna take
much<00:01:16.960> got<00:01:17.960> new<00:01:18.110> spark<00:01:18.409> plugs<00:01:18.710> will<00:01:19.009> gap<00:01:19.250> the

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
much got new spark plugs will gap the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.620 
much got new spark plugs will gap the
plug<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:21.580> see<00:01:22.580> if<00:01:22.640> we<00:01:22.759> get<00:01:22.850> some<00:01:23.030> gas<00:01:23.240> into

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
plug and see if we get some gas into

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.360 
plug and see if we get some gas into
this<00:01:23.750> bitch<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.320> make<00:01:24.470> your<00:01:24.680> run

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:39.340 

Harry<00:01:31.220> self-propelled

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.609 

pulled<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.159> air<00:01:40.310> filter<00:01:40.549> off<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:42.290> looks<00:01:42.470> like

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
pulled the air filter off it looks like

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.789 
pulled the air filter off it looks like
it's<00:01:42.770> pretty<00:01:42.890> much<00:01:43.330> plugged<00:01:44.500> which<00:01:45.500> would<00:01:45.680> be

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
it's pretty much plugged which would be

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.320 
it's pretty much plugged which would be
probably<00:01:46.100> part<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.759> problem<00:01:46.820> why<00:01:47.270> this

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
probably part of the problem why this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.660 
probably part of the problem why this
thing<00:01:47.420> wasn't<00:01:47.720> running<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:48.350> good<00:01:49.090> um

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
thing wasn't running so good um

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
thing wasn't running so good um
everything<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:52.820> there<00:01:53.030> looks<00:01:53.060> nice<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.659> clean

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
everything in there looks nice and clean

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.440 
everything in there looks nice and clean
though<00:01:54.940> so<00:01:55.940> it's<00:01:56.270> just<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.659> matter<00:01:56.690> now<00:01:57.200> of

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
though so it's just a matter now of

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.639 
though so it's just a matter now of
trying<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.600> get<00:01:59.720> gas<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.259> go<00:02:00.380> through

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
trying to get gas to go through

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:10.809 
trying to get gas to go through
everything<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:05.320> make<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.350> pop<00:02:09.459> I'm<00:02:10.459> gonna<00:02:10.580> pull

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
everything and make a pop I'm gonna pull

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.280 
everything and make a pop I'm gonna pull
a<00:02:10.850> spark<00:02:11.180> plug<00:02:11.239> out<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.720> see<00:02:11.870> what<00:02:12.019> it<00:02:12.140> looks

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
a spark plug out and see what it looks

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.840 
a spark plug out and see what it looks
like<00:02:17.500> okay<00:02:18.500> pulled<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.860> plug<00:02:19.069> out<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.519> wasn't

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
like okay pulled the plug out and wasn't

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.430 
like okay pulled the plug out and wasn't
very<00:02:20.000> much<00:02:20.239> spark<00:02:20.630> there<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.110> we<00:02:21.200> got<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:21.350> new

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
very much spark there so we got a new

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.100 
very much spark there so we got a new
plug<00:02:22.150> pulled<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.360> ball<00:02:23.510> wide<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.930> card

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
plug pulled the ball wide to the card

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.199 
plug pulled the ball wide to the card
reader<00:02:24.670> green<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.880> water<00:02:26.090> out<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.510> it

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
reader green the water out of it

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.300 
reader green the water out of it
lubricated<00:02:29.209> up<00:02:29.480> all<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:31.370> cable<00:02:33.160> we<00:02:34.160> got

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
lubricated up all the the cable we got

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.539 
lubricated up all the the cable we got
gas<00:02:34.549> going<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.269> now<00:02:35.299> she's<00:02:35.630> pretty<00:02:35.930> much

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
gas going to and now she's pretty much
