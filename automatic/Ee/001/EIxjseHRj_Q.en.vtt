00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
sword so I'm doing it without an armed

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.819 
sword so I'm doing it without an armed
because<00:03:52.419> apparently<00:03:52.810> all<00:03:53.049> unarmed<00:03:53.379> strikes

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
because apparently all unarmed strikes

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.339 
because apparently all unarmed strikes
count<00:03:54.340> as<00:03:54.519> pankration<00:03:55.000> damage<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.780> hope<00:03:56.230> you
