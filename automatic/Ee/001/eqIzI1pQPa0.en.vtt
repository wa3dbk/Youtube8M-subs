00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.790
 Tank - is not only a gun, engine, armor, 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.790
 but also the crew. 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.790
 From the crew skill dependent, 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.060
 how well the technique will work in combat. 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.140
 New crew machine has 50%. 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.400
 This figure can be increased 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400
 for loans in the regimental school 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.200
 or gold in the Tank Academy. 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.520
 The crew battles earns experience - 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.280
 it as much and fighting, 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.600
 and he goes on skill development. 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.820
 Once the indicator reaches 100%, 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.620
 experience used to the habit - 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.660
 thanks to them that the tank acquires special properties: 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.100
 rather it takes aim, 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.320
 Maneuver, 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.320
 often punches the opponent. 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.200
 Many habits, 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.040
 they are different - 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.830
 and all are equally useful. 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.320
 Habits are divided into four groups - 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.320
 class technology, 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.940
 you want to use, 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.360
 to get them. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.820
 For example, to study the habits of "surrounded by enemies" 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.480
 Only one will experience, 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.160
 that the crew receive for fighting in the light tanks. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.300
 To become a "Master of Melee" 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.880
 we must fight on heavy tanks. 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.940
 studied habits 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 acting on all classes of equipment. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.860
 Said habit "Melee Master" 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 will work not only on heavy tanks, 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.220
 but also in medium and light as well - 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.870
 and even the PT-ACS. 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.220
 Each habit has five levels, 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.040
 and its action increases with the level of: 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.840
 at the last level of the habit of acting up to five times stronger than the first. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.080
 To start the habit of acting, 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 need to score 100% skill, 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.620
 required for level. 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.300
 That is, if there is a third level of habit and a little skill, 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.300
 it will act as the third level. 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.000
 If the first level has not yet been scored, 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.200
 habit of not working at all. 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.500
 To start learning habit 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.240
 it is necessary to allocate. 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.240
 You can develop one habit at a time in each group. 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.140
 Once received the level of habit, 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.860
 experience can not be reset 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.580
 or somehow spread - 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.420
 but if the level is still under study, it can be done without loss. 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.520
 If you change your mind to learn "Branyaboyshchyka" 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.180
 you can transfer earned experience 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.560
 on any other skill from the group. 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.930
 But be careful! 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.930
 To explore the highest level habit 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.600
 We need much more experience, 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.400
 and if the transfer of experience from the "Branyaboyshchyka" fourth level 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.080
 in the habit of, say, the first level, 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.940
 it will develop at several full powers up - 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.380
 and return experience will be impossible. 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.950
 Next, it will be possible to transfer only that part of the experience, 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.380
 which remained. 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.060
 Habits can be developed not only for the crew experience, 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.140
 but also for the free experience. 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.000
 It can be obtained in the battles - 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.960
 it is 5 per cent of the combat experience. 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.220
 You can also exchange it for gold from luxury cars - 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.080
 such status machine receives, 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.500
 if she had opened all the modules 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.840
 and learned the following technique. 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.500
 Premiyumnyya tanks have elite status at once. 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.460
 Habits of the crew appeared to be updated 1.5. 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.860
 Experience that crews have earned to that date, going, 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.080
 and it can be distributed. 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.990
 This must be done in all four groups, 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.400
 otherwise habits would not work. 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.400
 Now when this message appears - 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.700
 habit is not distributed to the end. 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.700
 If before the 1.5 update 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.700
 you've never played in «World of Tanks Blitz», 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.000
 just choose the habits you want to get - 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 and go! 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.010
 Success in battle!
