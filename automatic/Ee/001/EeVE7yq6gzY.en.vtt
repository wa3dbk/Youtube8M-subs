00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520 
anything like it doesn't hold the curl
but<00:01:53.180> it<00:01:53.330> definitely<00:01:53.510> keeps<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.170> healthy<00:01:54.320> and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
but it definitely keeps it healthy and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.710 
but it definitely keeps it healthy and
it<00:01:54.710> definitely<00:01:54.920> keeps<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.760> moisturized<00:01:56.180> so

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
it definitely keeps it moisturized so

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.490 
it definitely keeps it moisturized so
coconut<00:01:57.650> oil<00:01:57.860> is<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.670> way<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:58.880> go

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500 

if<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.190> could<00:02:04.250> change<00:02:04.430> one<00:02:04.700> thing<00:02:04.910> about<00:02:05.120> my

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
if I could change one thing about my

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.900 
if I could change one thing about my
curls<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.200> would<00:02:06.380> probably<00:02:07.130> just<00:02:07.580> be<00:02:07.700> the

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
curls it would probably just be the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.639 
curls it would probably just be the
frizz<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.390> mean<00:02:08.539> obviously<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.200> think<00:02:09.470> that's

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
frizz I mean obviously I think that's

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.930 
frizz I mean obviously I think that's
what<00:02:09.800> anyone<00:02:10.100> would<00:02:10.250> say<00:02:10.900> frizz<00:02:11.900> our<00:02:12.080> length

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
what anyone would say frizz our length

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.130 
what anyone would say frizz our length
yeah<00:02:13.940> if<00:02:14.210> I<00:02:14.360> could<00:02:14.540> just<00:02:14.570> get<00:02:14.780> rid<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.020> the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
yeah if I could just get rid of the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.800 
yeah if I could just get rid of the
frizz<00:02:15.410> then<00:02:15.710> I<00:02:16.040> think<00:02:16.520> I'd<00:02:17.030> be<00:02:17.240> fine<00:02:17.450> because

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
frizz then I think I'd be fine because

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.750 
frizz then I think I'd be fine because
my<00:02:18.230> biggest<00:02:18.560> problem<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:18.980> trying<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.460> get<00:02:19.610> rid

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
my biggest problem is trying to get rid

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.699 
my biggest problem is trying to get rid
of<00:02:19.820> res<00:02:20.120> or<00:02:20.330> trying<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.810> compress<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.500> frizz

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
of res or trying to compress the frizz

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.890 
of res or trying to compress the frizz
on<00:02:21.920> my<00:02:22.070> head<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.700> definitely<00:02:23.180> be<00:02:23.600> friends

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.460
