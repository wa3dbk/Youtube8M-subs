00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
kill so quite like it by this point you

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.500 
kill so quite like it by this point you
showed<00:02:46.510> up<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> lot<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.460> costs<00:02:48.460> so<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.330> get<00:02:49.450> a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
showed up a lot of costs so just get a

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.730 
showed up a lot of costs so just get a
decent<00:02:49.810> gun<00:02:50.910> there<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.030> go<00:02:52.350> I'm<00:02:53.350> not<00:02:53.470> going<00:02:53.620> to

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
decent gun there we go I'm not going to

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.800 
decent gun there we go I'm not going to
keep<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.010> simplified<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:55.480> then<00:02:55.860> nope<00:02:57.810> I'm

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
keep the simplified and then nope I'm

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.740 
keep the simplified and then nope I'm
going<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.260> stick<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.620> in<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.890> pack<00:03:00.070> a<00:03:00.100> punch

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.810 

see<00:03:04.750> it's<00:03:05.260> easy<00:03:05.410> as<00:03:05.710> that<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:07.110> basically

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
see it's easy as that and I basically

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.370 
see it's easy as that and I basically
keep<00:03:09.820> on<00:03:10.060> doing<00:03:10.330> this<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.810> every<00:03:11.170> round

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
keep on doing this and every round

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.060 
keep on doing this and every round
showed<00:03:11.860> up<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.160> big<00:03:12.370> victory<00:03:13.260> well<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.830> can't

showed up a big victory well you can't
stay<00:03:15.250> there<00:03:15.580> but<00:03:15.820> it's<00:03:15.940> risky<00:03:16.150> as<00:03:16.900> i'll<00:03:17.260> show

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
stay there but it's risky as i'll show

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.690 
stay there but it's risky as i'll show
you<00:03:17.500> know

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.020

come on dude it wasn't even me where are
you<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:40.500> recommend<00:03:41.489> trying<00:03:41.909> to<00:03:42.060> get<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.360> I'll

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
you I recommend trying to get it I'll

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.929 
you I recommend trying to get it I'll
candy<00:03:42.959> or<00:03:43.140> something<00:03:43.379> like<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.709> because<00:03:44.519> the

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
candy or something like that because the

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.610 
candy or something like that because the
rebound<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.540> probably<00:03:45.840> going<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.110> be<00:03:46.170> no<00:03:46.379> good

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
rebound is probably going to be no good

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.059 
rebound is probably going to be no good
from<00:03:46.860> all<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.040> splash<00:03:47.430> back<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.799> yeah<00:03:49.799> I

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
from all the splash back so yeah I

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.399 
from all the splash back so yeah I

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
recommend hammer rpd something like that

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.490 
recommend hammer rpd something like that
stick<00:03:55.409> it<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.709> package<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:57.319> this<00:03:58.319> is<00:03:58.470> a
