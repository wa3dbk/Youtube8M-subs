00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello to all youtube friends 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.440
 welcome to another dncd tutorial 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.730
 tutorials in today's tutorial I'm going 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.320
 to teach something very easy and very necessary 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.480
 for those people who want 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.950
 change your ram memory card in the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.660
 good computer 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.920
 I will explain why I do this 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.620
 video I had done one before 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.500
 wants to know what megahertz we had in 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.300
 ram memory because that good video had 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.370
 many problems told me that 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.890
 I was wrong because that video I did 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.559
 five years ago more or less 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.180
 in our time and I did not know much about 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.210
 the topic and well then investigate 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.700
 and I learned and well I would say good I'm going to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.920
 teach how we can know what kind of 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.650
 died we have on the computer and if 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.060
 we can extend the voucher in this case 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.160
 we're going to have to go to the next 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:03.070
 page that is called www.crucial.com 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.830
 and this page is going to open for us 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.440
 let's do here is eternal system 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.840
 scanner please do not be afraid this 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.320
 page is totally safe will tighten us 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.090
 where it says is that my computer 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.090
 and you'll expect it 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.000
 here what we are going to do is press 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.000
 here where it says download of scanner 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.080
 accept hours terms obviously here 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.390
 terms and we're going to press here in 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.880
 download what will discriminate them is 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.130
 a good file an executable which 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.430
 is going to analyze your computer worth it does not have 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.040
 virus 100% sure we will execute it 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.720
 giving a click and you will press if you 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.570
 ask for permissions with account control 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.900
 user based on easy and we will 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.960
 open the next window this takes a 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.490
 little because because what does this 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.780
 program is to analyze your equipment 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.020
 completely profoundly 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.940
 referring to how it is inside that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.850
 motherboard you have 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.690
 ok I'll explain something this page 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.880
 crucial dotcom 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.460
 focuses only on the branch 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.260
 and that's good many people want 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.940
 for example expand your ram card already 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.080
 that has very few want to increase their 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:30.030
 team speed and well then I already 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.030
 has loaded here and I have here what is 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.980
 the page to appreciate and well then here 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.140
 We can see the following information 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.580
 it's here that I made an approach 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.099
 ok here we have two slots in this case 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.200
 I have one free slot left for 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.450
 install another ram 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.810
 good in the case that I want 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.870
 install another branch I must reiterate that 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.230
 you must buy rounds that are the same 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.720
 model of the same type if you put another one of 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.670
 another guy is not going to serve you then 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.950
 you have to do when you go to the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.550
 shop go to the store buy a 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.560
 RAM 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.640
 you must copy this what is here is worth 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.380
 All this 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.150
 this is here we are going to copy this 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.459
 the next 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.459
 we are going to copy this 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.040
 this is valid when you want 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.600
 buy in a way you are going to carry that 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.660
 information and you're going to copy the 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.780
 name of your motherboard which is the most 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.569
 important 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.260
 this is going to copy this you will notice 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.490
 on a paper 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.470
 I recommend you write down all this 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.420
 information because very important you the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.030
 you can ask and they will always be 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.380
 asking what is the motherboard and 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.090
 well let's go make this information good 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.810
 we're going to write everything is in sight 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.810
 what market 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.530
 and we can already know for example and how much 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.510
 is what we have empty and so on 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.160

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.950

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.040
 leave here 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.440
