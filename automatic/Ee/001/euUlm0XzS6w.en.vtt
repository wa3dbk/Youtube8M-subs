00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.409
 we should try to understand the technical data 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.000
 and I will talk about that today 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 essentially talking about the specifications and what the us 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.069
 really they say 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:13.659
 if we are interested in it 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.960
 For this we need physics knowledge Mathematics belongs to physics like me 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.649
 just said Projector engineering communications engineering mechanics of the kiss 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.480
 the two belong together anyway what is the one 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.560
 Transformers Speakers Microphones That's not a great cleric 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.570
 All this should be seen in the network 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.080
 Boss Black should definitely avoid what but the best stores 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.280
 be made 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.850
 that is mysticism that has always been so rich place with ladder 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.050
 very successful 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.220
 and the nice thing is that you can go on forever, there never is 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.340
 that the percentages are not true 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.500
 If you're looking for Mystic, you really do not need it too long 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.350
 search 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.190
 Whom do they treat their cases to the sayings of Parma sellers or even of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.170
 some Röhrenbeck acting 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.170
 you save is there a nuclear spin truth yours 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.270
 even what is made of it is in the majority of cases plain and 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.050
 just about pressure but a real business that we should always again 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.780
 see and 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.880
 Percent that 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.829
 comes this comment sounds in my present day before a couple of times 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.770
 I have to say again and again 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.320
 if we give this data so well and then the knowing one could 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.480
 End users to start something 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.870
 as marketing it has wanted differently it depends that the streets well 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.870
 appearance 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.050
 You should actually know the following subject areas - I have to do that now 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.940
 presuppose today and percent if I know that too, who only because 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.340
 I just announce that I can introduce myself to the titles 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.890
 this chapter 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.360
 another time maybe too 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.820
 But today's lecture does not say today I just have to assume 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.140
 that they already test much of it 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.620
 the communications technology is very important that Ben Hur jumps telecommunications 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.290
 Of course, later level has specialized in electroacoustics 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.920
 they do not necessarily have the function of microphones 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 Percent exactly understand they do not want to build one 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.290
 not different when I am in China 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.299
 they want to build some 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.359
 and there if I specifically interviewed in the direction too 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.809
 and sometimes I'm a bit embarrassed to be honest 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.009
 I would like that they also get a job 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:30.309
 and percent it is also useful to them as a user because they have 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.369
 an application in which just do not go everything 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.959
 Notions like the microphone Bauer would have liked to have 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.269
 when they know how the microphone works 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.309
 they are sometimes better off 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.439
 and, of course, we can talk about it for a long time 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.539
 Application of microphones all are only excerpts this title has not specified 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:53.419
 If you are looking for expertise then I can say that is side of 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.909
 Eberhard Lenk Piel 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.370
 Percent a high percentage percent recovering percent 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.689
 Tonmeister on retirement today, he is just as little as me 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.430
 Percent is still teaching at the College of the Arts he has on this 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.689
 Page summarized a lot I come in and out again 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.999
 he asks if he wants to inform him if something is wrong 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.609
 Of course that's really hard to do today 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.249
 the percent 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.349
 separating good from bad 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.329
 there is the saying 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.729
 we are looking for realizations but the spö embroidering in information that is 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:28.789
 unfortunately too true 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:32.209
 There is a lot of information that you have to question and as I said 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.509
 Private are required to say how it is if something is wrong 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.419
 I found grade again what is the place judges letter 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.849
 but that's not her that said but this one of the sources he 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:43.169
 received
