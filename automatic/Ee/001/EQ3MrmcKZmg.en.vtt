00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
overview today we're doing five and this

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.449 
overview today we're doing five and this
is<00:00:13.289> probably<00:00:13.619> a<00:00:13.680> lot<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.889> people's<00:00:14.160> least

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
is probably a lot of people's least

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.830 
is probably a lot of people's least
favorite<00:00:14.760> map<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.209> to<00:00:15.389> me<00:00:15.539> this<00:00:15.660> is

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
favorite map and to me this is

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.810 
favorite map and to me this is
technically<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.289> it's<00:00:17.160> not<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.760> in

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
technically a it's not really going in

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.100 
technically a it's not really going in
the<00:00:17.880> greatest<00:00:18.119> mass<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:18.720> definitely

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
the greatest mass but it's definitely

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.509 
the greatest mass but it's definitely
not<00:00:19.199> one<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.349> the<00:00:19.439> worst<00:00:19.529> map<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.070> map<00:00:20.250> does

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519 
not one of the worst map this map does

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.710 
not one of the worst map this map does
have<00:00:20.670> some<00:00:20.820> problems<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.359> but<00:00:21.509> it<00:00:21.599> also

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
have some problems with it but it also

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.419 
have some problems with it but it also
does<00:00:21.929> have<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> lot<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.320> good<00:00:22.470> side<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.980> so

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
does have a lot of good side with it so

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.589 
does have a lot of good side with it so
it's<00:00:23.580> getting<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> talking<00:00:24.119> about<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> bad

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
it's getting to talking about the bad

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.990 
it's getting to talking about the bad
sides<00:00:24.869> first<00:00:25.400> one<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.550> main<00:00:26.669> things<00:00:26.910> I

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
sides first one of the main things I

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.249 
sides first one of the main things I
wrote<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.300> about<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.630> map<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
wrote it all about this map is the

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.109 
wrote it all about this map is the
wonder<00:00:28.560> weapon<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:29.339> I<00:00:29.369> know<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.730> storyline

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
wonder weapon now I know the storyline

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.120 
wonder weapon now I know the storyline
for<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.390> map<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.839> that<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.619> u.s.<00:00:31.859> took<00:00:32.099> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
for this map is that the u.s. took a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.500 
for this map is that the u.s. took a
bunch<00:00:32.310> of<00:00:32.400> Nazi<00:00:32.759> stuff<00:00:32.970> from<00:00:33.120> World<00:00:33.329> War<00:00:33.420> two

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
bunch of Nazi stuff from World War two

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.120 
bunch of Nazi stuff from World War two
all<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.020> information<00:00:34.590> stuff<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.010> pretty

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
all this information stuff and pretty

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340 
all this information stuff and pretty
much<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.340> try<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.900> reverse-engineer<00:00:36.900> all

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
much just try to reverse-engineer all

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.570 
much just try to reverse-engineer all
that<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.920> build<00:00:38.070> their<00:00:38.130> own<00:00:38.220> weapons

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
that so they can build their own weapons

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.430 
that so they can build their own weapons
I<00:00:38.730> know<00:00:38.790> that's<00:00:39.030> why<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.420> lot<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.900> the<00:00:40.050> US<00:00:40.290> has

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
I know that's why a lot of the US has

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.630 
I know that's why a lot of the US has
stuff<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.830> five<00:00:41.010> isn't<00:00:41.220> really<00:00:41.460> worked

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
stuff and five isn't really worked

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940 
stuff and five isn't really worked
properly<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.240> still<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.530> game's<00:00:43.740> sake

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
properly but still for the game's sake

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.080 
properly but still for the game's sake
they<00:00:44.100> should<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.370> made<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.700> least<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
they should have made at least the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.430 
they should have made at least the
Wonder<00:00:45.360> weapon<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:45.810> bit<00:00:45.900> more<00:00:46.020> powerful

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
Wonder weapon a little bit more powerful

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.810 
Wonder weapon a little bit more powerful
I<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:46.710> reversed<00:00:47.160> engineered<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
I know they reversed engineered it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.460 
I know they reversed engineered it
that's<00:00:47.970> why<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.300> kind<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.570> sucky<00:00:48.900> they<00:00:49.410> were

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
that's why it's kind of sucky they were

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.840 
that's why it's kind of sucky they were
still<00:00:49.650> trying<00:00:49.830> to<00:00:49.920> perfectly<00:00:50.490> Wonder<00:00:50.760> weapon

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
still trying to perfectly Wonder weapon

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.040 
still trying to perfectly Wonder weapon
but<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.210> could've<00:00:51.390> at<00:00:51.450> least<00:00:51.510> made<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.870> one

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
but they could've at least made this one

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.530 
but they could've at least made this one
a<00:00:52.080> little<00:00:52.260> better<00:00:52.820> not<00:00:53.820> really<00:00:54.060> exactly<00:00:54.420> where

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
a little better not really exactly where

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.480 
a little better not really exactly where
it's<00:00:54.690> been<00:00:54.810> happy<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.650> how<00:00:55.890> strong<00:00:55.950> it<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
it's been happy with how strong it is

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.830 
it's been happy with how strong it is
and<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:56.760> exactly<00:00:57.150> does<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and what exactly does it's kind of a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.600 
and what exactly does it's kind of a
really<00:00:58.080> weak<00:00:58.230> Wonder<00:00:58.500> weapon<00:00:58.620> basically<00:00:59.460> just

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
really weak Wonder weapon basically just

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.490 
really weak Wonder weapon basically just
like<00:00:59.700> any<00:00:59.850> other<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.660> pretty<00:01:01.050> much<00:01:01.140> equal<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
like any other it's pretty much equal to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
like any other it's pretty much equal to
the<00:01:01.590> Raygun<00:01:01.950> yes<00:01:02.490> it's<00:01:02.670> good<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.940> early<00:01:03.210> rounds

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the Raygun yes it's good on early rounds

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.579 
the Raygun yes it's good on early rounds
when<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:03.870> stood<00:01:03.990> you<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.229> there<00:01:04.439> it's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
when we really stood you up there it's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.679 
when we really stood you up there it's
not<00:01:04.680> really<00:01:04.890> gonna<00:01:04.979> help<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.489> much

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
not really gonna help you that much

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.370 
not really gonna help you that much
another<00:01:06.689> thing<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.110> about<00:01:07.230> this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
another thing I really like about this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.870 
another thing I really like about this
map<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.770> these<00:01:07.950> sides<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.490> map<00:01:08.700> has

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
map is these sides and this map has

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.170 
map is these sides and this map has
three<00:01:09.600> different<00:01:09.780> floors<00:01:10.760> each<00:01:11.760> floor<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
three different floors each floor is

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.630 
three different floors each floor is
relatively<00:01:12.660> small<00:01:13.500> small<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> guess<00:01:14.430> from

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
relatively small small I guess from

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.730 
relatively small small I guess from
small<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> big<00:01:15.120> and<00:01:15.870> all<00:01:16.140> three<00:01:16.290> floors<00:01:16.500> are

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
small to big and all three floors are

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380 
small to big and all three floors are
still<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.190> really<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.640> does<00:01:17.760> not<00:01:17.880> all<00:01:18.090> make<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
still not really it does not all make a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.060 
still not really it does not all make a
huge<00:01:18.690> map<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> smaller

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
huge map is really one of the smaller

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.980 
huge map is really one of the smaller
maps<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.550> not<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> huge<00:01:21.060> fan<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.300> small<00:01:21.510> maps<00:01:21.780> I

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
maps I'm not a huge fan of small maps I

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.810 
maps I'm not a huge fan of small maps I
rather<00:01:22.470> map<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> big<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.250> cuz<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
rather map the big just cuz I like to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.340 
rather map the big just cuz I like to
explore<00:01:24.150> areas<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.690> stuff<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.200> move

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
explore areas and stuff like that move

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.590 
explore areas and stuff like that move
around<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> map<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.800> shit<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.730> not<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> size

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
around the map and shit so not the size

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.730 
around the map and shit so not the size
is<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.050> things<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.350> really<00:01:28.620> just

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
is one of the things that really just

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
is one of the things that really just
gives<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:28.980> down<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.310> me<00:01:29.400> there's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.550> lot<00:01:29.640> of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
gives it down for me there's a lot of

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.430 
gives it down for me there's a lot of
tight<00:01:30.240> corridors<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.930> stuff<00:01:31.080> like<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
tight corridors and stuff like that and

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.330 
tight corridors and stuff like that and
that's<00:01:31.500> not<00:01:31.620> that's<00:01:31.830> not<00:01:31.979> something<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that's not that's not something I'm a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.070 
that's not that's not something I'm a
huge<00:01:32.490> fan<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.330> biggest<00:01:33.630> area<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:34.050> the

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
huge fan of the biggest area was the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.560 
huge fan of the biggest area was the
Pentagon<00:01:34.530> room<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.210> believe<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.300> what<00:01:36.420> it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
Pentagon room I believe that's what it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.910 
Pentagon room I believe that's what it's
called<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.470> cycle<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.800> there

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
called and you can just cycle in there

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.530 
called and you can just cycle in there
for<00:01:38.130> days<00:01:38.250> which<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:38.760> gets<00:01:38.909> repetitive<00:01:39.150> but

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
for days which kind gets repetitive but

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.420 
for days which kind gets repetitive but
I<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:40.050> maps<00:01:40.260> with<00:01:40.470> big<00:01:40.650> open<00:01:40.830> areas<00:01:41.250> because

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
I like maps with big open areas because

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.530 
I like maps with big open areas because
I<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.580> like<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.820> free<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.330> run<00:01:42.420> around

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
I just like to be free and run around

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.540 
I just like to be free and run around
not<00:01:42.870> like<00:01:43.500> bumping<00:01:43.800> into<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.010> wall<00:01:44.190> every<00:01:44.400> ten

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
not like bumping into a wall every ten

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.480 
not like bumping into a wall every ten
seconds<00:01:45.799> all<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:46.890> another<00:01:47.130> thing<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:47.400> not

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
seconds all right another thing I do not

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
seconds all right another thing I do not
like<00:01:47.610> about<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.850> map<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.299> goes<00:01:48.479> with

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
like about this map and this goes with

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.760 
like about this map and this goes with
the<00:01:48.720> reverse<00:01:49.020> engineering<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the reverse engineering is the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.680 
the reverse engineering is the
teleporters<00:01:50.549> again<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.510> they<00:01:51.630> were

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
teleporters again I know that they were

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.149 
teleporters again I know that they were
vers<00:01:51.990> engineering<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.740> why<00:01:52.860> that's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
vers engineering that's not why that's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.110 
vers engineering that's not why that's
probably<00:01:53.460> why<00:01:53.580> I<00:01:53.610> didn't<00:01:53.790> had<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.940> tell

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
probably why I didn't had to tell

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.399 
probably why I didn't had to tell
upwards<00:01:54.479> correctly<00:01:54.870> and<00:01:55.080> everything<00:01:55.350> like

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
upwards correctly and everything like

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.930 
upwards correctly and everything like
that<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.799> still<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:56.610> could've<00:01:56.820> at<00:01:56.880> least

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
that but still they could've at least

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.350 
that but still they could've at least
you<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:58.130> for<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.220> game's<00:01:59.430> sake<00:01:59.640> maybe<00:02:00.210> like

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you know for the game's sake maybe like

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.960 
you know for the game's sake maybe like
a<00:02:00.420> certain<00:02:00.690> teleport<00:02:01.140> teleport<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:02.310> certain

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
a certain teleport teleport a certain

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.370 
a certain teleport teleport a certain
one<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.869> way<00:02:03.960> we're<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.140> running

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
one so that way we're not running

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.810 
one so that way we're not running
through<00:02:04.619> teleport<00:02:05.010> a<00:02:05.070> teleporter<00:02:05.549> trying<00:02:05.760> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
through teleport a teleporter trying to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.070 
through teleport a teleporter trying to
get<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.060> top<00:02:06.270> floor<00:02:06.479> something<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.930> that

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
get to the top floor something like that

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.600 
get to the top floor something like that
a<00:02:07.110> little<00:02:07.229> quicker<00:02:07.470> instead<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.340> having<00:02:08.489> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
a little quicker instead of having to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.100 
a little quicker instead of having to
take<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> elevator<00:02:09.060> when<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.509> doctor<00:02:09.869> comes

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
take the elevator when the doctor comes

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.940 
take the elevator when the doctor comes
you<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.739> having<00:02:10.979> away<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.249> him<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.609> get

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
you know having away on him to get

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.559 
you know having away on him to get
everything<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.459> go<00:02:12.520> through<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.760> teleport<00:02:13.180> you

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
everything and go through a teleport you

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.790 
everything and go through a teleport you
know<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.720> just<00:02:13.810> makes<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.080> lot<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.410> stuff<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.680> lot

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
know it just makes a lot of stuff a lot

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.350 
know it just makes a lot of stuff a lot
easier<00:02:15.129> if<00:02:15.190> every<00:02:15.489> teleporter<00:02:15.910> had<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> certain

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
easier if every teleporter had a certain

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.089 
easier if every teleporter had a certain
teleporter<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:16.989> would<00:02:17.110> go<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.319> you<00:02:17.980> know

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
teleporter that I would go to you know

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.770 
teleporter that I would go to you know
like<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.489> doesn't<00:02:18.700> just<00:02:18.819> go<00:02:18.940> up<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.420> only<00:02:19.599> one

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
like it doesn't just go up and only one

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.059 
like it doesn't just go up and only one
teleport<00:02:20.290> would<00:02:20.379> say<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.709> top<00:02:20.860> floor

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
teleport would say you to the top floor

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.860 
teleport would say you to the top floor
but<00:02:21.280> then<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.430> went<00:02:21.550> it's<00:02:21.670> like<00:02:21.849> recharge<00:02:22.599> for

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
but then I went it's like recharge for

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.940 
but then I went it's like recharge for
like<00:02:23.050> 10<00:02:23.260> seconds<00:02:23.590> or<00:02:23.650> something<00:02:23.830> like<00:02:23.890> that

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
like 10 seconds or something like that

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.199 
like 10 seconds or something like that
you<00:02:24.459> know<00:02:24.550> they<00:02:24.730> could<00:02:24.849> have<00:02:24.879> made<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.150> a

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
you know they could have made it a

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.640 
you know they could have made it a
little<00:02:25.330> bit<00:02:25.480> easier<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.810> teleport<00:02:26.230> but<00:02:26.440> they

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
little bit easier to teleport but they

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.839 
little bit easier to teleport but they
just<00:02:26.830> fell<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.069> making<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.400> random

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
just fell like making it random

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.780 
just fell like making it random
probably<00:02:28.300> best<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.599> fit<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.810> storyline<00:02:29.200> up

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
probably best to fit the storyline up

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.640 
probably best to fit the storyline up
and<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.940> last<00:02:31.060> thing<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:32.050> trap<00:02:32.349> so<00:02:32.530> there

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
and the last thing is the trap so there

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.290 
and the last thing is the trap so there
are<00:02:32.739> traps<00:02:32.950> on<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.790> this<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:33.970> actually

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
are traps on this and this is actually

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.610 
are traps on this and this is actually
what<00:02:34.450> introduced<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.080> buildable<00:02:35.380> if<00:02:35.530> you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
what introduced the buildable if you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.839 
what introduced the buildable if you
don't<00:02:35.800> know<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.099> five<00:02:36.310> was<00:02:36.519> actually<00:02:36.760> the

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
don't know that five was actually the

don't know that five was actually the
first<00:02:36.970> map<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.330> have<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> buildable<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.110> well

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
first map to have a buildable on it well

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.320 
first map to have a buildable on it well
sort<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:38.980> for<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.610> traps<00:02:39.849> all<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.120> got<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.269> do

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
sort of for the traps all you got to do

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.640 
sort of for the traps all you got to do
is<00:02:40.420> go<00:02:40.540> down<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.900> pending<00:02:41.110> out<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> room<00:02:41.379> find

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
is go down and pending out a room find

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.350 
is go down and pending out a room find
it<00:02:41.769> pick<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:41.920> up<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.340> actually<00:02:42.819> put<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.209> in<00:02:43.299> the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
it pick it up and actually put it in the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.460 
it pick it up and actually put it in the
trap<00:02:43.540> that's<00:02:43.690> how<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.840> would<00:02:43.959> activate<00:02:44.319> it

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
trap that's how you would activate it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.620 
trap that's how you would activate it
and<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.160> traps<00:02:45.400> were<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.940> mean<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.269> thought<00:02:46.510> that

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
and the traps were I mean I thought that

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.120 
and the traps were I mean I thought that
was<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.750> pretty<00:02:46.930> neat<00:02:47.410> idea<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.769> don't<00:02:47.980> really

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
was a pretty neat idea I don't really

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.069 
was a pretty neat idea I don't really
give<00:02:48.370> two<00:02:48.400> shits<00:02:48.790> about<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.150> though<00:02:49.299> but<00:02:49.900> the

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
give two shits about it though but the

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.539 
give two shits about it though but the
chapter<00:02:50.230> just<00:02:50.560> placed<00:02:50.799> in<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.220> worst

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
chapter just placed in the worst

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.640 
chapter just placed in the worst
location<00:02:52.360> ever<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.690> have<00:02:52.900> never<00:02:53.079> once<00:02:53.410> had<00:02:53.590> to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
location ever I have never once had to

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.589 
location ever I have never once had to
use<00:02:53.860> those<00:02:54.370> traps<00:02:54.670> successfully<00:02:55.329> because

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
use those traps successfully because

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.970 
use those traps successfully because
there's<00:02:55.840> just<00:02:56.019> two<00:02:56.170> doors<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.590> zombies<00:02:56.860> don't

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
there's just two doors the zombies don't

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.050 
there's just two doors the zombies don't
have<00:02:57.099> to<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.340> come<00:02:57.549> through<00:02:57.760> one<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:57.940> those

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
have to just come through one of those

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.880 
have to just come through one of those
doors<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.480> go<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> trap<00:02:58.930> they<00:02:59.560> can<00:02:59.680> just<00:02:59.799> go

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
doors and go to a trap they can just go

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.259 
doors and go to a trap they can just go
through<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.160> other<00:03:00.250> door<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.489> completely<00:03:01.120> go

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
through the other door and completely go

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.430 
through the other door and completely go
around<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.540> trap<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.019> straps<00:03:02.260> are

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
around the trap so the straps are

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.770 
around the trap so the straps are
basically<00:03:02.980> useless<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.640> wish<00:03:04.480> they<00:03:04.599> would<00:03:04.690> have

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
basically useless I wish they would have

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.120 
basically useless I wish they would have
put<00:03:04.870> him<00:03:04.989> in<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.110> better<00:03:05.290> location<00:03:05.440> maybe<00:03:06.010> I've

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
put him in a better location maybe I've

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.039 
put him in a better location maybe I've
been<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.579> lot<00:03:06.790> better<00:03:06.819> maybe<00:03:07.269> they<00:03:07.810> could<00:03:07.959> have

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
been a lot better maybe they could have

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.360 
been a lot better maybe they could have
put<00:03:08.200> him<00:03:08.290> down<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.560> hall<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.799> little<00:03:09.069> more<00:03:09.250> so

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
put him down the hall a little more so

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.680 
put him down the hall a little more so
that<00:03:09.489> way<00:03:09.579> for<00:03:09.760> zombies<00:03:10.030> coming<00:03:10.299> at<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.540> they

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
that way for zombies coming at you they

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.509 
that way for zombies coming at you they
could<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.440> fry<00:03:11.680> them<00:03:11.709> but<00:03:11.950> yeah<00:03:12.099> those<00:03:12.220> traps

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
could just fry them but yeah those traps

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.830 
could just fry them but yeah those traps
were<00:03:12.730> put<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.239> completely<00:03:13.690> useless

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
were put in a completely useless

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.690 
were put in a completely useless
location<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.069> I<00:03:15.220> just<00:03:15.340> want<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.519> know<00:03:15.579> what

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
location and I just want to know what

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
location and I just want to know what
the<00:03:15.760> fuck<00:03:15.910> charge<00:03:16.180> was<00:03:16.359> thinking<00:03:16.569> when<00:03:16.660> they

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
the fuck charge was thinking when they

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.140 
the fuck charge was thinking when they
put<00:03:16.870> them<00:03:16.959> there<00:03:17.370> all<00:03:18.370> right<00:03:18.489> now<00:03:18.880> let's<00:03:19.000> go<00:03:19.090> to

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
the elevators right on this map unlike

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.390 
the elevators right on this map unlike
die<00:03:25.540> rise<00:03:25.900> on<00:03:26.319> this<00:03:26.769> map<00:03:26.980> all<00:03:27.100> you<00:03:27.160> got<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.340> do

die rise on this map all you got to do

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.770 
die rise on this map all you got to do
is<00:03:27.489> call<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.760> elevator<00:03:28.090> then<00:03:28.239> paint<00:03:28.450> then<00:03:28.660> go

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780

really good I like how five did it you

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.590 
really good I like how five did it you
know<00:03:38.859> it<00:03:39.040> cost<00:03:39.220> some<00:03:39.370> money<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.639> take<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.510> if

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
know it cost some money to take it so if

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.819 
know it cost some money to take it so if
you<00:03:40.690> keep<00:03:41.049> going<00:03:41.170> up<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.470> down<00:03:41.560> up<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:41.739> down

you keep going up and down up and down

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:42.870 
you keep going up and down up and down
you're<00:03:42.040> virtually<00:03:42.280> gonna<00:03:42.400> lose<00:03:42.609> a<00:03:42.639> lot<00:03:42.819> of

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
you're virtually gonna lose a lot of

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.460 
you're virtually gonna lose a lot of
money<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.359> you<00:03:43.780> could<00:03:43.900> call<00:03:44.079> it<00:03:44.200> whenever<00:03:44.350> you

elevators another thing I like about
this<00:03:49.389> map<00:03:49.569> is<00:03:49.810> these<00:03:50.290> spawns<00:03:50.560> we're<00:03:51.190> not

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
this map is these spawns we're not

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.520 
this map is these spawns we're not
really<00:03:51.459> smart<00:03:51.730> as<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.880> Nova<00:03:52.180> spawns<00:03:52.420> now<00:03:52.690> my

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
really smart as the Nova spawns now my

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.020 
really smart as the Nova spawns now my
huge<00:03:53.799> fan<00:03:53.980> of<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.190> is<00:03:54.340> having<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.700> Nova's

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
huge fan of this is having the Nova's

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.089 
huge fan of this is having the Nova's
only<00:03:55.239> spawn<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.599> a<00:03:55.660> certain<00:03:55.930> area<00:03:56.019> v<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:56.950> moon

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
only spawn in a certain area v and moon

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.860 
only spawn in a certain area v and moon
so<00:03:57.280> we<00:03:57.400> really<00:03:57.849> do<00:03:57.940> this<00:03:58.030> with<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.239> really<00:03:58.720> good

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
so we really do this with a really good

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.660 
so we really do this with a really good
job<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.139> this<00:03:59.230> unlike<00:03:59.500> Kino<00:03:59.829> Kino<00:04:00.010> just<00:04:00.579> had

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
job of this unlike Kino Kino just had

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.460 
job of this unlike Kino Kino just had
the<00:04:00.760> Novo<00:04:01.030> zombies<00:04:01.420> spawning<00:04:01.690> everywhere<00:04:02.260> but

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
v and moon had them spawn only a certain

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.569 
v and moon had them spawn only a certain
area<00:04:05.260> which<00:04:05.500> doesn't<00:04:06.130> make<00:04:06.220> them<00:04:06.400> my

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
area which doesn't make them my

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
like about snuff is the peck punch I

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.710 
like about snuff is the peck punch I
like<00:04:14.650> how<00:04:14.769> there's<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.609> it<00:04:15.880> doesn't<00:04:16.120> take<00:04:16.389> a<00:04:16.419> lot

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
like how there's a it doesn't take a lot

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.210 
like how there's a it doesn't take a lot
to<00:04:16.780> get<00:04:17.079> to<00:04:17.139> pack<00:04:17.349> punch<00:04:17.620> but<00:04:17.889> you<00:04:18.010> don't<00:04:18.130> have

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
to get to pack punch but you don't have

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.920 
to get to pack punch but you don't have
once<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.030> all<00:04:19.180> leave<00:04:19.359> Haggar<00:04:19.570> punch<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:19.840> have

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
once you all leave Haggar punch you have

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.210 
once you all leave Haggar punch you have
to<00:04:20.019> go<00:04:20.140> dude<00:04:20.440> yeah<00:04:20.739> it's<00:04:20.890> pretty<00:04:20.979> much<00:04:21.130> like

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
to go dude yeah it's pretty much like

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.279 
to go dude yeah it's pretty much like
teleporting<00:04:22.000> sort<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:22.360> has<00:04:22.780> its<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:23.080> same

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
teleporting sort of has its the same

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.750 
teleporting sort of has its the same
basic<00:04:23.620> concept<00:04:23.740> once<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:24.280> guys<00:04:24.400> all<00:04:24.580> leave

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
basic concept once you guys all leave

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.659 
basic concept once you guys all leave
you<00:04:24.940> have<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.120> go<00:04:25.210> do<00:04:25.360> ever

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
you have to go do ever

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.939 
you have to go do ever
but<00:04:26.389> it's<00:04:26.479> not<00:04:26.599> and<00:04:26.840> really<00:04:27.080> impossible<00:04:27.740> even

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
but it's not and really impossible even

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.589 
but it's not and really impossible even
for<00:04:28.099> solo<00:04:28.520> players<00:04:28.789> to<00:04:28.999> go<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.180> pack<00:04:29.389> punch

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
for solo players to go to pack punch

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.239 
for solo players to go to pack punch
it's<00:04:29.780> relatively<00:04:30.110> easy<00:04:30.229> that's<00:04:31.009> what<00:04:31.189> I

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:31.249 
it's relatively easy that's what I

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:33.999 
it's relatively easy that's what I
really<00:04:31.460> like<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:31.759> like<00:04:31.789> how<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:33.680> know<00:04:33.800> pack
