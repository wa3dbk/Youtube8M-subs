00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.480 
still doesn't focus who said it works
with<00:02:22.640> an<00:02:22.730> white<00:02:22.940> background<00:02:24.280> anyway<00:02:25.280> that

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
with an white background anyway that

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.470 
with an white background anyway that
okay<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:25.820> let's<00:02:26.120> just<00:02:26.360> focus<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:28.360> come<00:02:29.360> on

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
okay so let's just focus on this come on

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.150 
okay so let's just focus on this come on
camera<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.200> can<00:02:30.260> do<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.590> there<00:02:30.740> we<00:02:30.800> go<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.130> that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
camera you can do it there we go so that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.820 
camera you can do it there we go so that
we've<00:02:31.370> base<00:02:31.580> coach<00:02:31.850> them<00:02:32.290> that's<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.470> basic

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
we've base coach them that's the basic

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.240 
we've base coach them that's the basic
color<00:02:34.040> scheme<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.430> we're<00:02:34.580> going<00:02:34.730> for<00:02:34.850> now

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
color scheme that we're going for now

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.310 
color scheme that we're going for now
the<00:02:37.250> next<00:02:37.280> step<00:02:37.550> with<00:02:37.820> these<00:02:37.940> as<00:02:38.209> usual<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.989> to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
the next step with these as usual is to

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.580 
the next step with these as usual is to
here<00:02:39.560> with<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:40.360> 50<00:02:41.360> cent<00:02:41.630> batter<00:02:41.959> black<00:02:42.260> and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
here with a 50 cent batter black and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.100 
here with a 50 cent batter black and
fifty<00:02:43.220> percent<00:02:43.610> Devlin<00:02:44.540> mud<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.050> then

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
fifty percent Devlin mud and then

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.800 
fifty percent Devlin mud and then
payload<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:46.040> war<00:02:46.220> Shogun<00:02:46.550> sob<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:47.540> all<00:02:47.690> the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
payload of a war Shogun sob of all the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.660 
payload of a war Shogun sob of all the
figures<00:02:47.989> take<00:02:48.770> away<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.160> accessories<00:02:49.640> you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
figures take away the accessories you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.820 
figures take away the accessories you
don't<00:02:49.940> need<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.450> then<00:02:51.230> what<00:02:51.380> we<00:02:51.470> can<00:02:51.620> do<00:02:51.739> is

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
don't need and then what we can do is

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.010 
don't need and then what we can do is
we'll<00:02:51.980> come<00:02:52.190> back<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.670> we'll<00:02:52.780> focus<00:02:53.780> on<00:02:53.989> how

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
we'll come back and we'll focus on how

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.199 
we'll come back and we'll focus on how
we<00:02:54.320> can<00:02:56.020> color<00:02:57.040> highlight<00:02:58.040> them<00:02:58.310> change<00:02:58.880> them

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
we can color highlight them change them

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.490 
we can color highlight them change them
and<00:02:59.239> stuff<00:02:59.600> like<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.780> just<00:03:00.050> to<00:03:00.140> clean<00:03:00.380> them

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
and stuff like that just to clean them

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.650 
and stuff like that just to clean them
up<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.830> hopefully<00:03:01.400> obviously<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.300> still<00:03:02.510> was

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
up I hopefully obviously the still was

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.090 
up I hopefully obviously the still was
going<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.840> take<00:03:02.989> on<00:03:03.200> all<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.470> bulk<00:03:03.739> on<00:03:03.890> mels

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
going to take on all the bulk on mels

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.670 
going to take on all the bulk on mels
gonna<00:03:04.310> take<00:03:04.459> on<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.610> dark<00:03:04.910> curtain<00:03:05.500> with<00:03:06.500> the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
gonna take on a dark curtain with the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.530 
gonna take on a dark curtain with the
obviously<00:03:07.640> with<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.790> banner<00:03:07.970> black<00:03:08.209> in<00:03:08.390> there

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
obviously with a banner black in there

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.190 
obviously with a banner black in there
and<00:03:09.220> we're<00:03:10.220> going<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.459> have<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.870> do<00:03:12.019> some

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
and we're going to have to do some

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.750 
and we're going to have to do some
highlighting<00:03:12.560> here<00:03:12.709> in<00:03:12.860> there<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.190> as<00:03:13.430> we<00:03:13.580> said

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
highlighting here in there so as we said

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.440 
highlighting here in there so as we said
earlier<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.830> that'll<00:03:15.830> be<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.070> next<00:03:16.340> step<00:03:16.450> so

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
earlier so that'll be the next step so

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.050 
earlier so that'll be the next step so
I'm<00:03:17.720> going<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:17.959> go<00:03:18.080> away<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.790> then<00:03:19.790> I'm<00:03:19.880> so

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
I'm going to go away to that then I'm so

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.340 
I'm going to go away to that then I'm so
we<00:03:20.150> leave<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.600> dry<00:03:20.720> for<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.989> bit<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.230> then

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
we leave it to dry for a bit and then

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.289 
we leave it to dry for a bit and then
we'll<00:03:21.440> come<00:03:21.650> back<00:03:21.850> see<00:03:22.850> what<00:03:22.880> they<00:03:23.060> look<00:03:23.090> like

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
we'll come back see what they look like

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.670 
we'll come back see what they look like
when<00:03:23.450> they're<00:03:23.720> when<00:03:24.290> they're<00:03:24.320> hit<00:03:24.620> with

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
when they're when they're hit with

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.080 
when they're when they're hit with
Devlin<00:03:25.370> mud<00:03:25.840> because<00:03:26.840> as<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:27.140> can<00:03:27.170> see<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.470> mean

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
Devlin mud because as you can see I mean

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.900 
Devlin mud because as you can see I mean
all<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.269> detail<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:29.930> we've<00:03:30.049> got<00:03:30.230> in<00:03:30.380> there

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
all the detail that we've got in there

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.190 
all the detail that we've got in there
let's<00:03:31.910> just<00:03:32.090> focus<00:03:32.209> on<00:03:32.480> that<00:03:32.540> we're<00:03:32.989> going<00:03:33.110> to

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
let's just focus on that we're going to

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.740 
let's just focus on that we're going to
pick<00:03:33.350> up<00:03:33.470> later<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.730> buttons<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.510> we<00:03:35.600> can

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
pick up later so the buttons that we can

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.690 
pick up later so the buttons that we can
put<00:03:35.989> in<00:03:36.140> other<00:03:36.560> bits<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.010> pieces<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.370> we<00:03:37.549> can

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
put in other bits and pieces that we can

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.400 
put in other bits and pieces that we can
add<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.120> as<00:03:38.209> well<00:03:38.239> we're<00:03:38.570> going<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.750> we're
