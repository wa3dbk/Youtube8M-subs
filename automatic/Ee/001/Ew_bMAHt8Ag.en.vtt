little bit of an overview of how the
controls<00:04:49.490> work<00:04:49.699> but<00:04:49.939> it's<00:04:50.360> pretty<00:04:50.509> simple<00:04:50.900> to

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
controls work but it's pretty simple to

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.689 
controls work but it's pretty simple to
select<00:04:51.469> a<00:04:51.590> cell<00:04:51.830> we<00:04:51.979> just<00:04:52.159> click<00:04:52.280> on<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.520> once

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
select a cell we just click on it once

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.850 
select a cell we just click on it once
if<00:04:52.969> we<00:04:53.689> want<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:53.930> copy<00:04:54.169> and<00:04:54.349> paste<00:04:54.530> we<00:04:54.740> could

if we want to copy and paste we could

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.469 
if we want to copy and paste we could
click<00:04:55.039> on<00:04:55.159> it<00:04:55.250> again<00:04:55.340> and<00:04:55.759> we<00:04:55.939> get<00:04:56.060> our<00:04:56.210> copy

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
click on it again and we get our copy

just<00:05:01.490> double<00:05:01.759> tap<00:05:01.909> it's<00:05:02.150> very<00:05:02.300> similar<00:05:02.509> to<00:05:02.719> on

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
just double tap it's very similar to on

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.480 
just double tap it's very similar to on
a<00:05:02.840> computer<00:05:03.259> and<00:05:03.680> we'll<00:05:03.860> just<00:05:04.039> say<00:05:04.189> that<00:05:04.370> this

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
a computer and we'll just say that this

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.749 
a computer and we'll just say that this
is<00:05:04.569> text<00:05:05.979> so<00:05:06.979> I<00:05:07.039> can<00:05:07.219> go<00:05:07.310> ahead<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:07.580> I<00:05:07.729> can

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
is text so I can go ahead and I can

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.309 
is text so I can go ahead and I can
enter<00:05:08.030> some<00:05:08.300> text<00:05:08.360> right<00:05:08.750> there

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
enter some text right there

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.980 
enter some text right there
if<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:10.189> want<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.430> go<00:05:10.550> ahead<00:05:10.699> and<00:05:11.090> do<00:05:11.270> formulas

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
if I want to go ahead and do formulas

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.320 
if I want to go ahead and do formulas
here<00:05:12.469> in<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:13.189> iOS<00:05:13.580> version<00:05:13.639> of<00:05:13.969> Google<00:05:14.210> Drive

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
here in the iOS version of Google Drive

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.300 
here in the iOS version of Google Drive
I<00:05:14.539> actually<00:05:14.810> have<00:05:15.409> to<00:05:15.529> enter<00:05:15.770> those<00:05:15.919> formulas

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
I actually have to enter those formulas

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.469 
I actually have to enter those formulas
manually<00:05:16.759> so<00:05:16.849> let's<00:05:17.000> go<00:05:17.090> ahead<00:05:17.150> and<00:05:17.330> put<00:05:17.449> a

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
manually so let's go ahead and put a

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:18.640 
manually so let's go ahead and put a
couple<00:05:17.539> numbers<00:05:17.870> in<00:05:18.050> here<00:05:18.199> I'm<00:05:18.289> going<00:05:18.409> to<00:05:18.469> put

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
couple numbers in here I'm going to put

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.320 
couple numbers in here I'm going to put
five<00:05:18.889> in<00:05:19.159> this<00:05:19.279> cell<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:19.550> five<00:05:19.819> in<00:05:20.000> this<00:05:20.120> cell

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
five in this cell and five in this cell

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.050 
five in this cell and five in this cell
so<00:05:20.810> if<00:05:20.960> I<00:05:21.050> want<00:05:21.349> this<00:05:21.560> cell<00:05:21.830> f10<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.490> equal<00:05:22.939> the

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
so if I want this cell f10 to equal the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.839 
so if I want this cell f10 to equal the
sum<00:05:23.270> of<00:05:23.330> f8<00:05:23.930> +<00:05:24.110> f9<00:05:24.590> I'm<00:05:25.279> just<00:05:25.490> going<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.759> make

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
sum of f8 + f9 I'm just going to make

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.610 
sum of f8 + f9 I'm just going to make
sure<00:05:25.879> I<00:05:26.000> double<00:05:26.300> tap<00:05:26.479> in<00:05:26.629> the<00:05:26.719> cell<00:05:26.990> I'm<00:05:27.439> going

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
sure I double tap in the cell I'm going

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.929 
sure I double tap in the cell I'm going
to<00:05:27.800> go<00:05:27.889> down<00:05:28.069> here<00:05:28.279> and<00:05:28.310> I'm<00:05:28.490> going<00:05:28.699> to<00:05:28.729> say

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:28.939 
to go down here and I'm going to say

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.059 
to go down here and I'm going to say
equals<00:05:29.389> and<00:05:29.779> then<00:05:30.289> actually<00:05:30.680> main<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:30.949> have

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
equals and then actually main you have

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.869 
equals and then actually main you have
to<00:05:31.159> type<00:05:31.840> f8<00:05:32.840> and<00:05:33.259> then<00:05:33.889> go<00:05:34.039> find<00:05:34.219> the<00:05:34.370> plus<00:05:34.610> key

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:34.879 
to type f8 and then go find the plus key

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:39.850 
to type f8 and then go find the plus key
will<00:05:35.599> do<00:05:35.750> plus<00:05:37.029> f9<00:05:38.029> and<00:05:38.389> then<00:05:38.689> hit<00:05:38.870> return<00:05:39.020> and

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
will do plus f9 and then hit return and

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.469 
will do plus f9 and then hit return and
we'll<00:05:39.979> see<00:05:40.159> we<00:05:40.279> get<00:05:40.400> our<00:05:40.460> sum<00:05:40.819> of<00:05:40.849> 10<00:05:41.270> but<00:05:41.449> you

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
we'll see we get our sum of 10 but you

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.269 
we'll see we get our sum of 10 but you
can't<00:05:41.779> just<00:05:41.990> do<00:05:42.139> the<00:05:42.289> click<00:05:42.500> and<00:05:42.680> select<00:05:42.830> cells

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
can't just do the click and select cells

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.469 
can't just do the click and select cells
at<00:05:43.430> least<00:05:43.580> I<00:05:43.669> haven't<00:05:43.940> been<00:05:44.029> able<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.270> figure

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
at least I haven't been able to figure

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.329 
at least I haven't been able to figure
that<00:05:44.569> out<00:05:44.719> yet<00:05:45.050> what<00:05:45.650> you<00:05:45.770> can<00:05:45.949> enter<00:05:46.250> them

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:46.339 
that out yet what you can enter them

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:48.189 
that out yet what you can enter them
manually<00:05:46.699> and<00:05:47.270> then<00:05:47.389> when<00:05:47.539> we're<00:05:47.659> done<00:05:47.690> we<00:05:48.169> can

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
manually and then when we're done we can

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.439 
manually and then when we're done we can
hit<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.589> check<00:05:48.800> mark<00:05:48.830> and<00:05:49.190> then<00:05:49.849> go<00:05:50.029> ahead<00:05:50.270> and

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
hit the check mark and then go ahead and

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.659 
hit the check mark and then go ahead and
hit<00:05:50.569> the<00:05:50.659> X<00:05:50.810> it<00:05:51.469> will<00:05:51.560> take<00:05:51.770> us<00:05:51.949> back<00:05:52.190> to<00:05:52.400> Google
