00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
hooked up to the trike through this

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.880 
hooked up to the trike through this
manner<00:00:15.900> which<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.199> explained<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.770> last

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
manner which I explained in the last

manner which I explained in the last
video<00:00:17.369> now<00:00:18.359> I've<00:00:18.510> actually<00:00:18.660> removed<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
video now I've actually removed the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.509 
video now I've actually removed the
caster<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.170> had<00:00:22.410> under<00:00:22.980> here<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
caster that I had under here and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.290 
caster that I had under here and
replaced<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:25.730> that<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.060> see<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
replaced it with that you can see a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.810 
replaced it with that you can see a
simply<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> stainless<00:00:31.320> steel<00:00:31.349> bolt<00:00:31.890> which<00:00:32.730> is

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
simply a stainless steel bolt which is

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.060 
simply a stainless steel bolt which is
actually<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> drop<00:00:33.690> down<00:00:34.020> onto<00:00:34.410> the

trailer that the motor is mounted on
which<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.820> had<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.300> place<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:43.040> all

now<00:01:10.580> I'll<00:01:11.270> turn<00:01:11.479> it<00:01:11.630> around<00:01:11.750> please

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
now I'll turn it around please

now I'll turn it around please
underneath<00:01:13.970> here<00:01:14.710> Aleksey<00:01:15.710> pastors<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.780> the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
underneath here Aleksey pastors and the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.469 
underneath here Aleksey pastors and the
front<00:01:19.810> flip<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.320> whites<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.400> big<00:01:22.610> Saints

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
front flip the whites of the big Saints

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.440 
front flip the whites of the big Saints
are<00:01:23.600> lighter<00:01:23.780> than<00:01:23.990> I'm<00:01:24.140> using<00:01:24.970> it's<00:01:25.970> here<00:01:26.270> on

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
are lighter than I'm using it's here on

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.740 
are lighter than I'm using it's here on
the<00:01:26.600> side<00:01:27.400> it's<00:01:28.400> actually<00:01:28.520> got<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.030> third

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
the side it's actually got a third

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.070 
the side it's actually got a third
caster<00:01:30.640> larger<00:01:31.640> one<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.390> you'll<00:01:32.570> notice<00:01:32.780> that

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
caster larger one and you'll notice that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.640 
caster larger one and you'll notice that
it<00:01:33.229> tips<00:01:34.330> okay<00:01:35.330> it's<00:01:35.750> sitting<00:01:36.050> on<00:01:36.140> an<00:01:36.259> angle

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
it tips okay it's sitting on an angle

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.040 
it tips okay it's sitting on an angle
and<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.670> reason<00:01:38.030> for<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.240> is<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.570> if<00:01:38.900> it

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
and the reason for that is that if it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.070 
and the reason for that is that if it
just<00:01:39.290> drives<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.890> face<00:01:40.640> down<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.570> once<00:01:41.810> these

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
just drives it face down and once these

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.430 
just drives it face down and once these
pushing<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:42.740> by<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.979> hopefully<00:01:47.289> around<00:01:48.289> the

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
pushing this by and hopefully around the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.040 
pushing this by and hopefully around the
edges<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.890> way<00:01:50.740> I've<00:01:51.740> got<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.479> actually<00:01:53.479> held

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
edges the way I've got it actually held

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.590 
edges the way I've got it actually held
up<00:01:54.259> we<00:01:54.619> just<00:01:55.070> say<00:01:55.310> every<00:01:55.970> measure<00:01:56.240> at<00:01:56.479> the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
up we just say every measure at the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.249 
up we just say every measure at the
moment

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
moment

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.359 
moment
beneath<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.899> yeah<00:01:59.899> that<00:01:59.960> one<00:02:00.320> hinge<00:02:00.530> hinge

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
beneath that yeah that one hinge hinge

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.620 
beneath that yeah that one hinge hinge
then<00:02:02.229> we<00:02:03.229> turn<00:02:03.440> it<00:02:03.590> around<00:02:03.710> again<00:02:03.950> here<00:02:04.630> will

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
then we turn it around again here will

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.110 
then we turn it around again here will
now<00:02:05.780> see<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:07.660> flywheel<00:02:08.660> on<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.200> clutch

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
now see that the flywheel on the clutch

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.250 
now see that the flywheel on the clutch
directly<00:02:11.120> family<00:02:11.660> bond<00:02:13.570> on<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.750> main<00:02:14.959> drive

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
directly family bond on the main drive

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.670 
directly family bond on the main drive
with<00:02:15.530> along<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:15.829> real<00:02:16.100> bad<00:02:16.310> idea<00:02:17.470> as<00:02:18.470> you'll

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
with along a real bad idea as you'll

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.360 
with along a real bad idea as you'll
notice<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.150> chainsaw<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.209> facing<00:02:20.630> backwards

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
notice the chainsaw is facing backwards

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.800 
notice the chainsaw is facing backwards
the<00:02:22.370> reason<00:02:22.700> for<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.540> clutch

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
the reason for that is that the clutch

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.150 
the reason for that is that the clutch
spins<00:02:24.320> this<00:02:24.920> place<00:02:25.570> okay<00:02:26.600> which<00:02:27.440> actually

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
spins this place okay which actually

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.900 
spins this place okay which actually
pushes<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.510> wheel<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:30.709> way<00:02:31.010> line<00:02:31.670> drive

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
pushes this wheel this way line drive

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.890 
pushes this wheel this way line drive
will<00:02:32.390> hold<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.799> that's<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.370> direction<00:02:34.900> when

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
will hold and that's the direction when

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.440 
will hold and that's the direction when
we're<00:02:36.049> going<00:02:36.579> agency<00:02:37.579> they'll<00:02:37.790> drop<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.209> down

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
we're going agency they'll drop it down

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.630 
we're going agency they'll drop it down
and<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.900> real<00:02:39.470> way<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.709> not<00:02:39.980> spinning<00:02:40.340> I

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
and that real way of not spinning I

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.180 
and that real way of not spinning I
think<00:02:41.510> we<00:02:41.630> go<00:02:41.780> around<00:02:42.019> back<00:02:42.320> here<00:02:43.630> Ramona

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.740 

once<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.310> put<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.579> up<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.030> off<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.450> street

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
once I put it up and off the street

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.010 
once I put it up and off the street
front<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:53.440> that

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.120
