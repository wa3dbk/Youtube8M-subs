00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.819
 and hello to all and welcome for a 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.370
 new video a video for how 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.750
 create his village so I do it because 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.969
 that there are many people who have me 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.969
 request 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.650
 especially these three people nicolas 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 zoric it's antoine asked me to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.160
 do this little video so then 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.210
 it's gone then so if you close 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.150
 you are not on the right video to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.080
 go see the video on farming that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.130
 I have done so on farming 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.750
 he knows very well detailed for those 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.320
 which does not close that is to say they 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.239
 protect their hotel which protects when 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 even their resources because when 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.329
 even at low level ie below 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.079
 of 40 even same me if I even at the level 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.809
 60 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.430
 you have to protect your resources 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.090
 then lodgings times m the city hall 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 in the middle so this is the first 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.359
 trick to do wanting trick and these 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.680
 so we'll do as if a black 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.380
 it was the town hall so you have to 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.689
 surround it with arc mortar x it's already 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.220
 set the strongest weapons what's needed 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.220
 put them all around you have to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.140
 bring the wizard's trick closer to you 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.720
 put a little further resources 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.070
 that is to say and I will change all 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.670
 wizards with resources 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.770
 that is to say lorelei the wizards there to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.299
 every time and so in fact it's okay 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.200
 that you have the strongest late my 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.659
 middle after he has to be well disposed these 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.710
 its anti - aircraft defenses like you 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:48.149
 see the circle the sesat 1 at the end 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.090
 it's the same here and here too 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.030
 my whole village is protected by the steps 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.250
 the anti - aircraft defenses so when you 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.140
 there have dragon who pass it will not long 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.750
 fire 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.899
 after the tests there you have it 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.790
 Well you have to remove them must 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.879
 really they do not know who is 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.929
 there because the people around them 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:15.060
 good 2 2 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.129
 he suspects that there is a tesla so by 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.790
 example I'm doing a trick either one of 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.609
 villages for example antoine i'm going 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.760
 look at a plot his village so there 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.500
 this one he is in mode by ming who 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.639
 protects these resources well he put 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.090
 all his defenses on the turn 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:36.060
 perfect for his level for another 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.939
 level if it's okay after we'll see at 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.280
 michael like that i can give a little 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:45.090
 several tips what I was the 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.879
 high level so is it then I the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.459
 finds it pretty well the only problem it's 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:56.790
 he does not have there I advise you michael 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:00.750
 it's risky in fact there is cumulated 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.510
 in market and the wizard's tower you go 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.700
 a little played for example put it there he 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.169
 marty you'll put there because there he 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.629
 all on one side is it's all 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.760
 strong weapons and they are all in a 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.790
 corner so it's nice too useful 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.370
 alas they get there and they take 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.379
 all resources very easily 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.590
 so here it is a little advice 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.510
 so put your mortar here and there 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.449
 around the eyebrows like satan tower 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:36.959
 soon in autumn of town after for 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:42.209
 Azure x on time abba agree 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:46.259
 isolux not a good two tips then 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.750
 I think that will be enough to create 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:50.250
 so progress its use so the most 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.470
 important fact one must put stalls of 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.709
 our circles put the most weapons 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.519
 strong next door all around to put 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.780
 resources a little further 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.620
 well arranged air votewatch and 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.750
 bring closer the strong weapons that is to say 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.139
 the wizards' towers the mortars the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.329
 archaic this is the only strong weapon 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:14.250
 them hide well that was it they get 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.370
 do not doubt that they are actually what 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.419
 united bat for example they break something 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.620
 there it will be a matter of fact besides 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.910
 must approach a little 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.090
 like that as soon as they come back are 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.210
 disassembled on two devices each other 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.210
 side 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.970
 so here I think it's good for 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.420
 this video in the next video I 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.400
 am going to attack with these 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.950
 so sorry for my voice I just come 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.840
 to get up a game of dominoes and that makes 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:52.630
 an hour so well here I think that 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.660
 it's all right yeah 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.660
 go it's a cash mister cash ciao
