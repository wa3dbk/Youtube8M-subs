 nothing will be proud of the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.809
 we really have a winner 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.420
 today is the puppet prize with the rag 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.120
 in the first as I get stuck but the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.790
 better prize than liter 32 can 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.050
 sacrifice the camera a little walk 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.050
 I'm not with the house 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.869
 where mechanical a little bit 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.259
 many of those that because it does not stay the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.880
 car on the street and lifts the capon and 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.799
 he looks but does nothing at all 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.780
 clairvoyant who raises the last one is that 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.360
 try to open the hood of abriel trunk and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.009
 I saw bags 50 I said I'm not 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.509
 mistaking the Argentine mechanic is a 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.930
 little this woman or is a little bit of a liar 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.759
 the Chilean mechanic 7 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:57.770
 I think that in general no no no is that the 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:02:01.720
 Chilean lies because he is waiting 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.720
 Lara is much better than me 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.869
 he is not sure 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.610
 notice the speed that comes that car 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.489
 so bad I see you up there the truth 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.360
 how nice but I'm looking at a place from 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.360
 here the pass 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.200
 pass and meteor 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.040
 I am not first that in love I am lara for 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.840
 before it's late adjustments and drones 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.050
 because to live a bigger experience 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.050
 day 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.460
 to me 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.830
 and how good a driver is considered 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.600
 Mr. Gonzoalo Valenzuela varied his and me 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.850
 he raised esteban towers and the steering wheel 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.890
 calm as a terrible stick makes 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.390
 many years but now I drive well I do not 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.280
 they made such a good driver but it's a 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.290
 very respectful of the transit a man 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.280
 that puts the boy a man who is 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:34.640
 neat and excellent in everything so 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:36.200
 we are at speed when I handle 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.390
 I'm not afraid of speed I'll 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.910
 I count these cars accelerating from 0 to 100 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.110
 in 35 seconds thanks for the 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.110
 news i went to miami 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.480
 so it was worth that I hope now 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.020
 then the maximum speed allowed in 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.030

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.830
 very well as you should indicate to a vehicle 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.330
 that pretends to surpass yours that does not 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.100
 you have to spend lighting the lights 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.660
 called beacons operating the light 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.850
 indicator to the left or the 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.739
 from the right under the window of the event 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.739
 a republic with the left 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.960
 between the effects produced by alcohol 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.909
 in the driver is the 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.710
 incorrect appreciation of distances and 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.500
 velocities widening the visual field 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.930
 or decrease in braking distance 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.550
 right where we can drive the lord 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.200
 esteban is the effects of producing 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.530
 alcohol and decreasing the distance of 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.530
 correct and correct braking 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.930
 although there is a song by rubén blades 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.790
 who says he is convinced that the 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.470
 alcohol does not alter the senses is more 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.300
 has much more control that's why it sinks 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.880
 foot of loneliness stench to feel 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:03.330
