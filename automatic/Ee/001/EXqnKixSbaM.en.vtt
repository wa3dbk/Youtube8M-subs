from<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> savage<00:01:04.890> blocks<00:01:06.080> as<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.439> see

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
from the savage blocks as you can see

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.690 
from the savage blocks as you can see
I've<00:01:07.770> got<00:01:08.659> motor<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.530> I've<00:01:11.189> started<00:01:11.520> on

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
I've got motor out and I've started on

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
I've got motor out and I've started on
the<00:01:11.790> electronics<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> clear<00:01:12.900> Xbox<00:01:13.560> yeah

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the electronics to clear Xbox yeah

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.740 
the electronics to clear Xbox yeah
that's<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> motor<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.119> there<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> fuel

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that's the motor in there with the fuel

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.700 
that's the motor in there with the fuel
tank<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.350> other<00:01:16.500> stuff<00:01:16.820> um<00:01:18.710> just

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
tank and all the other stuff um just

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.730 
tank and all the other stuff um just
trying<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.220> though<00:01:20.869> if<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.259> any<00:01:22.500> way

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
trying to see though if there is any way

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.210 
trying to see though if there is any way
that<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.280> still<00:01:23.610> use<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.630> disc<00:01:24.900> brake

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
that you can still use the disc brake

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.690 
that you can still use the disc brake
mechanism<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.270> not<00:01:27.479> 100%<00:01:27.930> sure

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
mechanism in there but I'm not 100% sure

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.700 
mechanism in there but I'm not 100% sure
um<00:01:29.700> otherwise<00:01:30.600> I'll<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:30.900> disconnect<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.560> all

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
um otherwise I'll just disconnect it all

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.890 
um otherwise I'll just disconnect it all
and<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.130> use<00:01:32.310> electric<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:33.600> where<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and just use electric I'm where are you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.749 
and just use electric I'm where are you
putting<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.970> that's<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.360> minute<00:01:37.759> from

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
putting the that's just a minute from

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.330 
putting the that's just a minute from
the<00:01:38.820> Erie<00:01:39.270> ver<00:01:39.470> I'll<00:01:40.470> stop<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.920> yet<00:01:41.189> between

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the Erie ver I'll stop it in yet between

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.539 
the Erie ver I'll stop it in yet between
the<00:01:41.549> tool<00:01:42.380> go<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.649> go<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:43.799> trucks<00:01:44.220> there's

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the tool go just go just trucks there's

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.910 
the tool go just go just trucks there's
so<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:44.850> more<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.240> bass

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
so much more of a bass

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.289 
so much more of a bass
um<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> yeah<00:01:48.390> I'll<00:01:49.110> keep<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> guys<00:01:49.500> posted

um yeah give it um after after having a
look<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.549> make<00:01:56.670> doing<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> bit<00:01:57.270> of

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
look and make doing a bit of

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.609 
look and make doing a bit of
experimenting

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.060 

um<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.310> Burnett

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
um this is Burnett

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.160 
um this is Burnett
so<00:02:05.719> Motors<00:02:06.719> gone

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:20.110 

software<00:02:15.760> receivers<00:02:16.760> gone<00:02:18.130> um<00:02:19.130> pass<00:02:19.760> which<00:02:20.090> is

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
software receivers gone um pass which is

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.059 
software receivers gone um pass which is
gone

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
gone

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.140 
gone
I<00:02:23.500> thought<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.650> linkages<00:02:25.099> are<00:02:25.250> gone<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.970> fit

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
I thought the linkages are gone so I fit

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.840 
I thought the linkages are gone so I fit
a<00:02:26.209> lot<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.890> throw<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.130> linkage<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.580> gone

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
a lot so you throw the linkage is gone

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.020 
a lot so you throw the linkage is gone
um<00:02:29.890> cleaned<00:02:30.890> up<00:02:31.040> all<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.250> chests<00:02:31.580> it's<00:02:31.819> very

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
um cleaned up all the chests it's very

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.290 
um cleaned up all the chests it's very
clean<00:02:32.420> now<00:02:33.190> I've<00:02:34.190> taught<00:02:34.459> some<00:02:34.730> screws<00:02:35.120> that

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
clean now I've taught some screws that

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.660 
clean now I've taught some screws that
were<00:02:35.420> founded<00:02:35.840> loose<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.160> figured<00:02:37.489> out<00:02:37.610> that

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
were founded loose so I figured out that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.290 
were founded loose so I figured out that
the<00:02:38.060> way<00:02:38.180> I'm<00:02:38.300> going<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:38.750> do<00:02:39.130> my<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.940> use<00:02:41.120> my

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
the way I'm going to do my to use my

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.860 
the way I'm going to do my to use my
break<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.230> use<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.739> wire<00:02:43.160> harness<00:02:43.870> so

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
break is to use a wire harness so

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.180 
break is to use a wire harness so
they'll<00:02:45.080> be<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:45.560> an<00:02:45.709> electronic<00:02:46.069> ear<00:02:46.370> see<00:02:47.049> to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
they'll be like an electronic ear see to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.789 
they'll be like an electronic ear see to
the<00:02:49.190> one<00:02:49.400> end<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.819> then<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:51.080> break<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.709> the

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
the one end and then the break to the

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.180 
the one end and then the break to the
other<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.370> that'll<00:02:52.730> go<00:02:52.880> into<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.360> receiver

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
other and that'll go into the receiver

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.840 
other and that'll go into the receiver
so<00:02:55.190> when<00:02:55.549> my<00:02:56.739> know<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:57.769> have<00:02:58.130> this<00:02:58.280> canal<00:02:58.610> ever

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
so when my know I have this canal ever

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.600 
so when my know I have this canal ever
connected<00:02:59.239> after<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.709> I'll<00:03:00.830> program<00:03:01.220> it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
connected after that and I'll program it

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.110 
connected after that and I'll program it
so<00:03:01.790> it's<00:03:02.000> can<00:03:02.690> only<00:03:02.840> go<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.260> one<00:03:03.470> direction

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
so it's can only go in one direction

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.059 
so it's can only go in one direction
which<00:03:05.120> will<00:03:05.269> be<00:03:05.390> forward<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.290> reverse<00:03:06.860> or

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
which will be forward and reverse or

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.289 
which will be forward and reverse or
just<00:03:07.220> being<00:03:07.400> neutral<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.060> I'll<00:03:08.269> have

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
just being neutral so that I'll have

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.220 
just being neutral so that I'll have
breaks<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.890> have<00:03:10.100> zero<00:03:10.370> verse<00:03:12.160> 100%<00:03:13.160> forward

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
breaks so have zero verse 100% forward

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.110 
breaks so have zero verse 100% forward
and<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.859> said<00:03:16.100> punch<00:03:16.280> controller<00:03:16.730> stuff<00:03:16.970> like

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
and I said punch controller stuff like

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.009 
and I said punch controller stuff like
that<00:03:17.560> so<00:03:18.560> yeah<00:03:19.120> that's<00:03:20.120> what<00:03:20.299> I'm<00:03:20.359> up<00:03:20.600> to

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
that so yeah that's what I'm up to

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.979 
that so yeah that's what I'm up to

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
conversion comes in I'll be able to put

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.699 
conversion comes in I'll be able to put
that<00:03:30.459> into<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.600> I'll<00:03:32.870> put<00:03:33.140> them<00:03:33.260> on<00:03:33.380> once
