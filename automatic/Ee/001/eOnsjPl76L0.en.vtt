00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
5.5 million consoles and so that's just

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.539 
5.5 million consoles and so that's just
really<00:03:35.810> really<00:03:36.019> sad<00:03:36.319> and<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.769> not<00:03:37.160> just<00:03:37.370> the

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
really really sad and and not just the

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.129 
really really sad and and not just the
console<00:03:37.940> side<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.209> things<00:03:38.299> but<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.690> ratio<00:03:39.079> of

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
console side of things but the ratio of

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.470 
console side of things but the ratio of

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
that ratio is 1 in 20 and that's also

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.729 
that ratio is 1 in 20 and that's also
really<00:03:44.269> bad<00:03:44.569> so<00:03:44.780> it's<00:03:44.930> not<00:03:45.019> even<00:03:45.260> Nintendo's
