00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
and then the copper scraps and this is a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
and then the copper scraps and this is a
3/32<00:00:39.170> rj45<00:00:40.190> -<00:00:41.190> see<00:00:41.460> I've<00:00:41.790> kind<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.480> made<00:00:43.290> these

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
3/32 rj45 - see I've kind of made these

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.689 
3/32 rj45 - see I've kind of made these
into<00:00:44.309> little<00:00:44.749> spirals<00:00:45.749> and<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.219> using

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
into little spirals and I do that using

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.090 
into little spirals and I do that using
the<00:00:47.789> needle<00:00:47.940> nose<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.769> kind<00:00:50.039> of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the needle nose you just kind of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.669 
the needle nose you just kind of
twisting<00:00:50.640> them<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.999> my<00:00:51.359> hands

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:03.270 

working<00:00:57.679> with<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:59.019> scrap<00:01:00.019> pieces<00:01:00.320> of<00:01:00.620> copper

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.039 

using<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.399> torch<00:01:06.369> heating<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.460> piece<00:01:07.700> up

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
using the torch heating the piece up

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.649 
using the torch heating the piece up
then<00:01:09.049> just<00:01:09.350> melting<00:01:10.189> around<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.909> edges<00:01:13.659> these

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
then just melting around the edges these

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.139 
then just melting around the edges these
are<00:01:14.899> very<00:01:15.409> abstract<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.340> there's<00:01:16.580> no<00:01:16.880> right

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
are very abstract and there's no right

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.070 
are very abstract and there's no right
or<00:01:17.420> wrong<00:01:17.450> way<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:17.960> do<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:18.440> I<00:01:19.899> noticed<00:01:20.899> that

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
or wrong way to do this I noticed that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.600 
or wrong way to do this I noticed that
most<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.619> my<00:01:21.799> come<00:01:22.729> off<00:01:23.090> in<00:01:24.189> somewhat<00:01:25.189> of<00:01:25.460> an

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
most of my come off in somewhat of an

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.590 
most of my come off in somewhat of an
oval<00:01:26.030> shape<00:01:29.710> now<00:01:30.710> once<00:01:30.950> I've<00:01:31.159> melted<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.210> I'll

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
oval shape now once I've melted it I'll

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.040 
oval shape now once I've melted it I'll
go<00:01:32.810> in<00:01:33.940> cut<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:34.970> few<00:01:35.270> holes<00:01:35.509> that<00:01:35.750> are<00:01:35.810> there

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
go in cut a few holes that are there

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.999 
go in cut a few holes that are there
with<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.380> torch<00:01:38.470> doing<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.560> same<00:01:39.800> thing

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
with the torch doing the same thing

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:48.910 
with the torch doing the same thing
again<00:01:42.759> melting<00:01:43.759> around<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.210> edges<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:47.590> do<00:01:48.590> want

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
again melting around the edges I do want

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.249 
again melting around the edges I do want
to<00:01:48.950> kind<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:49.250> round<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.880> corner<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.630> I

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
to kind of round the corner so that I

00:01:51.259 --> 00:02:00.609 
to kind of round the corner so that I
get<00:01:52.039> rid<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:53.000> square<00:01:53.630> shape<00:01:59.229> since<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.410> have

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
get rid of the square shape since I have

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.150 
get rid of the square shape since I have
any<00:02:01.060> big<00:02:02.060> pieces<00:02:02.330> coming<00:02:02.750> out<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.890> know<00:02:03.979> like

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
for this tree trunk to look like it is

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.860 
for this tree trunk to look like it is
gnarly<00:03:57.000> old<00:03:58.160> it's<00:03:59.160> been<00:03:59.370> wind<00:03:59.790> blowing<00:04:00.500> abused

to<00:04:06.870> be<00:04:06.989> sure<00:04:07.230> this<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.519> quite<00:04:08.849> time-consuming

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
to be sure this is quite time-consuming

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:18.750 
to be sure this is quite time-consuming
but<00:04:10.889> I'm<00:04:11.069> doing<00:04:11.459> this<00:04:11.730> for<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:13.139> effect

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.020 

to<00:04:18.970> achieve<00:04:20.130> building<00:04:21.130> up<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.460> wealth<00:04:21.700> so

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
to achieve building up the wealth so

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.080 
to achieve building up the wealth so
that<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:23.620> tree<00:04:23.980> trunk<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.490> going<00:04:24.730> to<00:04:24.850> look

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
that the tree trunk is going to look

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.660 
that the tree trunk is going to look
somewhat<00:04:25.780> like<00:04:26.140> this

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.550 

then<00:04:29.210> I'll<00:04:29.360> do<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.630> same<00:04:29.660> thing<00:04:29.900> with<00:04:30.380> the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.689 

excusing<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.330> three<00:05:19.080> sixteenths<00:05:19.650> inch<00:05:19.830> on<00:05:20.129> to

cooled<00:06:49.080> I<00:06:49.550> checked<00:06:50.550> all<00:06:50.759> the<00:06:50.819> branches<00:06:51.419> and<00:06:52.259> I

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
cooled I checked all the branches and I

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:53.629 
cooled I checked all the branches and I
found<00:06:52.620> three<00:06:52.979> of<00:06:53.009> them<00:06:53.280> that<00:06:53.490> were

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
found three of them that were

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.990 
found three of them that were
questionable<00:06:54.379> so<00:06:55.379> I<00:06:55.409> went<00:06:55.710> in<00:06:55.830> and<00:06:56.069> refused

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
questionable so I went in and refused

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.800 
questionable so I went in and refused
them<00:06:57.360> once<00:06:58.169> more<00:06:58.939> so<00:06:59.939> this<00:07:00.090> has<00:07:00.240> been<00:07:00.389> pretty

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
them once more so this has been pretty

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.279 
them once more so this has been pretty
typical<00:07:01.110> in<00:07:01.590> doing<00:07:01.919> these<00:07:02.099> pine<00:07:02.400> trees<00:07:03.289> not

typical in doing these pine trees not

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:05.749 
typical in doing these pine trees not
all<00:07:04.530> of<00:07:04.680> them<00:07:04.919> are<00:07:05.099> going<00:07:05.310> to<00:07:05.370> be<00:07:05.460> seized

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
all of them are going to be seized

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:14.750 
all of them are going to be seized
welded<00:07:06.240> as<00:07:06.389> well<00:07:06.659> as<00:07:06.900> others
