for the teachers are constantly working
hard<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.309> they<00:00:39.149> should<00:00:39.329> definitely<00:00:39.750> be

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
hard and they should definitely be

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
hard and they should definitely be
getting<00:00:39.960> credit<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:40.879> it<00:00:41.879> may<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.239> be

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
getting credit for it but it may not be

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000 
getting credit for it but it may not be
giving<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.110> much<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.530> difference<00:00:43.890> if

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
giving them so much of a difference if

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.940
