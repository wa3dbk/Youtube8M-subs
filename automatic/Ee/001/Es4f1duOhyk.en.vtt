00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.320
 in a new chapter of the war between 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.730
 samsung to apple 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.170
 the most commented companies of the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.440
 bring to the Brazilian market 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.029
 the galaxy note 8 and the ipad mini models that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.250
 although they are different in many respects 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 back on screens of similar sizes in 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.119
 3g and wifi versions 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.980
 beyond these similarities for the first time 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.130
 time they also bring exactly the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.019
 same suggested price of 1,299 reais 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.940
 When they make up for more, they will 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.960
 though bring the same price are 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.960
 direct competitors 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.579
 first of all it is good to make it clear that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.620
 we are talking about platforms 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.239
 different and we will not discuss what it is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.920
 best and west android 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.469
 At this point it is the preference of the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.309
 the subject here is the comparison of 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.800
 wrong 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.629
 galaxy note 8 brings version 4.1 of the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 android jelly bean and all that the system 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.170
 from google offers 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.609
 but the mini ipad does not stay behind it 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.190
 comes with the current version of the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.710
 apple and s6 and much of the news 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.210
 this version what we are talking about 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.189
 but at two different platforms 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.650
 put the specifications of both sides 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.049
 next to we see the superiority of hardware 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.340
 of the galaxy note 8 it brings nothing less than 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.840
 that a quad-core processor 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.040
 running at 1.6 ghz and 2 gb of ram 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.630
 these characteristics make the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 ipad mini settings pass 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.830
 shame after all it brings the same 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.060
 ipad 2 hardware that was released yet 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.340
 in 2011 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.310
 the a5 chip has two cores running the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.560
 1 ghz Tanager only 512 megabytes of 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.329
 memory as long as the sii is a 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.220
 little lighter than android 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.619
 galaxy note 8 is noticeably more 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.329
 powerful than ipad mini being able 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.460
 to run two applications at once 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.460
 without bottlenecks and games of last generation 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.189
 although the screen size is 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.590
 practically the same in the two devices 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.409
 mini ipad bigger by having a look 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.240
 4 for 3 while the galaxy note 8 more 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.030
 fulfilled for working with aspect 16 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.979
 for 9 the same used in films 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.570
 we were quite surprised to know that 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.729
 neither of them brings any kind of 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.440
 screen protection technologies used 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.360
 only on larger models 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.459
 ipad mini screen does not bring protection 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.349
 the risks that the new iPad and 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.400
 galaxy note 8 does not use any version 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.080
 of gorilla glass 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.819
 so it's best to be careful when it comes to 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.920
 take any of them out there 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.569
 in the mini version of the ipad apple chose 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.980
 wear thinner boots 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.750
 which makes the device ideal for 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.000
 ensure with only one hand 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.450
 but here nothing of canvas retina to 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.430
 resolution of 1024 by 768 is the same as 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.319
 iPad 2 which is not even bad but 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.040
 still lose to the resolution of 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.350
 1280 by 800 of the galaxy note 8 it shows 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.360
 better results in movies without 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.510
 bring the super- amoled technology of 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.100
 top-of-the-line smartphones like 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.470
 All models in the series note 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.810
 products of samsung galaxy note 8 brings 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.700
 rs has an integrated pen that gives you new 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.440
 ways to interact with the tablet one 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.090
 device also supports micro sd cards 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.120
 up to 64 gigabyte mhle gps with gps and 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.989
 GLONASS the mini cases none of these 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.640
 resources 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.890
 in the case of the camera both have models 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.450
 similar to 5 megapixels but the ipad 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.190
 mini leaves at the front for being able to 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.079
 record videos in full hd 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.880
 while galaxy note 8 only records in 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.890
 720p 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.569
 despite this it brings stabilization of 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.140
 important point when taking pictures 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.140
 Photos 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.920
 placing the two side by side the galaxy 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.780
 note 8 presents a set of hardware 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.850
 offering superior features 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.170
 interesting and powerful configuration 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.750
 capable of servicing the user during 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.310
 long time the mini ipad by another 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.440
 side offers an option for those who have found 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.420
 ask original a little too heavy 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.010
 but talks about bringing outdated hardware 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.420
 to support applications that 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.520
 more complex 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.260
 it is the only option for those who like s 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.490
 look for a smaller model 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.950
 it is difficult to reach a conclusion 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.050
 comparing two more platforms 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.300
 in this comparative especially we here 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.230
 of the tech channel we declare the galaxy note 8 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.060
 winner 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.770
 it brings a much higher cost benefit 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.420
 than the mini ipad so much compared to 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.380
 resource specifications 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.360
 extras 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.070
 if you liked this comparative short

 video here below and so our channel 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.120
 from youtube we always publish analysis 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.180
 comparison of the hottest products in
