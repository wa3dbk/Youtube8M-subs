chapter<00:00:01.920> 3<00:00:02.159> dash<00:00:02.340> for<00:00:03.290> estimating<00:00:04.290> sums<00:00:04.620> and

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
chapter 3 dash for estimating sums and

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.560 
chapter 3 dash for estimating sums and
differences<00:00:07.460> there<00:00:08.460> are<00:00:08.490> three<00:00:09.000> ways<00:00:09.510> in

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
differences there are three ways in

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.330 
differences there are three ways in
which<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.290> estimate<00:00:10.559> sums<00:00:11.130> and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
which we can estimate sums and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.770 
which we can estimate sums and
differences<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.059> we're<00:00:12.540> going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> learn

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
differences and we're going to learn

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.870 
differences and we're going to learn
about<00:00:12.840> all<00:00:13.230> three<00:00:13.500> today<00:00:13.799> we're<00:00:14.670> going<00:00:14.759> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
about all three today we're going to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.369 
about all three today we're going to
start<00:00:15.120> with<00:00:15.330> one<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.750> we've<00:00:15.900> used<00:00:16.139> before

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
start with one that we've used before

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.340 
start with one that we've used before
which<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:16.949> rounding<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:18.750> problem<00:00:19.109> says

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
which is rounding the problem says

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.410 
which is rounding the problem says
estimate<00:00:19.949> using<00:00:20.189> rounding<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> problem

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
estimate using rounding and the problem

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.710 
estimate using rounding and the problem
is<00:00:21.830> $45<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.010> twenty-seven<00:00:23.550> cents<00:00:23.789> take<00:00:24.539> away

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
is $45 and twenty-seven cents take away

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.220 
is $45 and twenty-seven cents take away
four<00:00:25.019> dollars<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.590> eighty-seven<00:00:26.220> cents<00:00:27.230> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
four dollars and eighty-seven cents the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.750 
four dollars and eighty-seven cents the
first<00:00:28.500> step<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.039> doing<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.310> problem<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.699> this

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
first step in doing a problem like this

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.479 
first step in doing a problem like this
with<00:00:30.060> rounding<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.750> simply<00:00:31.710> put<00:00:31.859> rounding<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
with rounding is simply put rounding and

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.840 
with rounding is simply put rounding and
I'm<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.270> round<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.630> nearest<00:00:33.750> ones<00:00:34.350> i

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
I'm going to round to the nearest ones i

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.010 
I'm going to round to the nearest ones i
end<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.210> 45<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.649> five<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.090> i<00:00:39.660> replace

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
end up with 45 and five and i replace

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.959 
end up with 45 and five and i replace
the<00:00:40.230> two<00:00:40.440> original<00:00:40.590> numbers<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:41.760> new

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.369 
the two original numbers with my new
rounded<00:00:42.660> numbers<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:44.550> second<00:00:44.940> step<00:00:45.230> do<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
rounded numbers the second step do the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.459 
rounded numbers the second step do the
problem<00:00:47.090> 45<00:00:48.090> take<00:00:48.329> away<00:00:48.510> 5<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.020> 40<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:51.469> second

estimation<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:57.059> case<00:00:57.449> we're<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.710> going

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
estimation in this case we're just going

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.340 
estimation in this case we're just going
to<00:00:58.920> use<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.190> front<00:00:59.640> numbers<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.960> let's<00:01:01.170> give

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
to use the front numbers but let's give

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.050 
to use the front numbers but let's give
it<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.500> try<00:01:03.049> 26.4<00:01:04.049> +<00:01:04.830> 13.5<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:08.369> only<00:01:08.580> numbers<00:01:08.909> i

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it a try 26.4 + 13.5 the only numbers i

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.140 
it a try 26.4 + 13.5 the only numbers i
want<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> pull<00:01:09.540> are<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.049> 26<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.150> 13

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
want to pull are going to be 26 and 13

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
want to pull are going to be 26 and 13
i'm<00:01:12.360> not<00:01:12.930> even<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> worry<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
i'm not even going to worry about the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.560 
i'm not even going to worry about the
decimals<00:01:16.759> now<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.030> I've<00:01:18.119> pulled<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
decimals now that I've pulled the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.160 
decimals now that I've pulled the
numbers<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.130> simply<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.280> math<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.960> 26<00:01:21.960> plus

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
numbers I simply do the math and 26 plus

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
numbers I simply do the math and 26 plus
13<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.920> 39<00:01:25.070> finally<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.490> third<00:01:26.759> method<00:01:27.090> of

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
13 is 39 finally the third method of

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.270 
13 is 39 finally the third method of
estimation<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.930> called<00:01:28.140> clustering<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> we

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
estimation is called clustering and we

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.080 
estimation is called clustering and we
use<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.700> when<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.240> several<00:01:30.930> numbers<00:01:30.960> in

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
use this when we have several numbers in

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.830 
use this when we have several numbers in
this<00:01:33.090> case<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.630> problem<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.340> point<00:01:35.340> 8<00:01:35.579> 6<00:01:35.939> plus

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
this case the problem is point 8 6 plus

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.230 
this case the problem is point 8 6 plus
OH<00:01:36.990> point<00:01:37.110> nine<00:01:37.700> plus<00:01:38.700> point<00:01:39.479> nine<00:01:39.659> three<00:01:41.240> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
OH point nine plus point nine three the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.700 
OH point nine plus point nine three the
first<00:01:42.509> thing<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.899> I'm<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.590> I

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
first thing that I'm going to do is I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.039 
first thing that I'm going to do is I
want<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> choose<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> number<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.720> three

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
want to choose a number that all three

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.810 
want to choose a number that all three
of<00:01:46.079> those<00:01:46.229> numbers<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.680> pretty<00:01:46.920> close<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
of those numbers are pretty close to and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.359 
of those numbers are pretty close to and
in<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.570> case<00:01:48.750> they're<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.200> very<00:01:49.770> very<00:01:50.100> close

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
in this case they're all very very close

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.730 
in this case they're all very very close
to<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.869> I'm<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> change<00:01:52.530> each

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
to one so I'm just going to change each

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.810 
to one so I'm just going to change each
of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> numbers<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:56.159> next<00:01:56.460> step<00:01:56.610> is

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
of the numbers to one the next step is

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.149 
of the numbers to one the next step is
to<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.600> math<00:01:57.780> problem<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:58.829> there's<00:01:59.009> two

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
to do the math problem now there's two

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.459 
to do the math problem now there's two
ways<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.570> straight<00:02:01.140> forward

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
ways I can do it I can straight forward

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.370 
ways I can do it I can straight forward
a<00:02:01.649> bit<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.040> get<00:02:02.340> 1<00:02:02.610> plus<00:02:02.850> 1<00:02:03.149> plus<00:02:03.210> 1<00:02:03.689> which<00:02:04.350> is

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
a bit and get 1 plus 1 plus 1 which is

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.889 
a bit and get 1 plus 1 plus 1 which is
equal<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.829> 3<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.210> some<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.600> who<00:02:06.630> want

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
equal to 3 but for some of you who want

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.260 
equal to 3 but for some of you who want
to<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.200> quicker<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:08.670> three<00:02:09.060> numbers

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
to do it quicker I have three numbers

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.350 
to do it quicker I have three numbers
and<00:02:09.750> if<00:02:10.140> each<00:02:10.289> one<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.590> worth<00:02:10.619> one<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.180> 1

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and if each one is worth one I can do 1

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.680 
and if each one is worth one I can do 1
times<00:02:12.629> 3<00:02:12.959> I'm

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
times 3 I'm
