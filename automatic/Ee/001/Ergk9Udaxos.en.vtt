00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
the TTA one is our bicyclist BMC's since

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.800 
the TTA one is our bicyclist BMC's since
2004<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.800> was<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.370> only<00:00:11.760> one<00:00:12.090> producer<00:00:12.690> to

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:12.810 
2004 it was the the only one producer to

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.530 
2004 it was the the only one producer to
100%<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.620> Rankin<00:00:14.040> till<00:00:14.580> now<00:00:14.760> now<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.420> a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
100% in Rankin till now now we have a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.859 
100% in Rankin till now now we have a
road<00:00:15.840> bike<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.699> time<00:00:17.699> trial<00:00:17.970> bike<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.449> Rankin

road bike and time trial bike in Rankin
difference<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.970> here<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:20.999> can<00:00:21.150> work<00:00:21.749> in<00:00:22.019> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
difference is here we can work in a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.569 
difference is here we can work in a
custom<00:00:22.560> bike<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.759> we<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:25.339> triangles<00:00:26.339> that

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
custom bike but we have triangles that

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.779 
custom bike but we have triangles that
it's<00:00:27.029> same<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.329> every<00:00:27.749> every<00:00:28.220> bikes<00:00:29.220> colors

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
it's same for every every bikes colors

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.930 
it's same for every every bikes colors
we<00:00:29.999> have<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:30.509> the<00:00:30.960> bags<00:00:31.109> they<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.499> one

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
we have all the bags they have one

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.000 
we have all the bags they have one
triangles<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.810> we<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.200> work<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> seat

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
triangles but we can work on the seat

without to cut and we have a custom fork
the<00:00:41.640> way<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:42.090> decide<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.810> a<00:00:42.930> position<00:00:43.620> we

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
the way we decide we have a position we

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.790 
the way we decide we have a position we
fit<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> riders<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.080> seat

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
fit there for the riders we have a seat

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.250 
fit there for the riders we have a seat
I'd<00:00:47.010> seat<00:00:47.370> back<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.540> position<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
I'd seat back and the position of the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
I'd seat back and the position of the
staff<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.740> we<00:00:49.890> decide<00:00:50.280> which<00:00:50.970> kind<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.480> fork

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
staff and we decide which kind of fork

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.370 
staff and we decide which kind of fork
to<00:00:52.140> use<00:00:52.400> for<00:00:53.400> cuddle<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.240> was<00:00:54.540> necessary<00:00:55.080> to<00:00:55.230> do

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
to use for cuddle it was necessary to do

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.400 
to use for cuddle it was necessary to do
something<00:00:55.590> special<00:00:56.510> because<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.990> position

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
something special because the position

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
something special because the position
of<00:00:58.530> Colonels<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.250> drop<00:00:59.490> between<00:01:00.150> saddle<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
of Colonels the drop between saddle and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.399 
of Colonels the drop between saddle and
bar<00:01:01.470> is<00:01:01.680> extreme<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.210> necessary<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
bar is extreme so it was necessary to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.399 
bar is extreme so it was necessary to
make<00:01:04.619> ourselves<00:01:04.799> an<00:01:05.339> integrated<00:01:06.329> fork<00:01:06.960> with

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
make ourselves an integrated fork with

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.370 
make ourselves an integrated fork with
bars<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.670> are<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:09.080> positioned<00:01:10.080> for

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
bars here we are just positioned for

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.399 
bars here we are just positioned for
corral<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.430> close<00:01:11.670> corral<00:01:12.060> want<00:01:13.050> to<00:01:13.260> be

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
corral and close corral want to be

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.490 
corral and close corral want to be
straight<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.180> over<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:16.020> flat

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
straight going to be over have a flat

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.830 
straight going to be over have a flat
bars<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.780> lang<00:01:19.100> directly<00:01:20.570> extensions<00:01:21.570> bars

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
bars and lang directly extensions bars

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.160 
bars and lang directly extensions bars
so<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.920> was<00:01:23.100> necessary<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.880> meet<00:01:24.030> 100%<00:01:24.540> Gaston

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
so it was necessary to meet 100% Gaston

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.770 
so it was necessary to meet 100% Gaston
for<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> corral<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.120> customer<00:01:27.120> decada<00:01:27.600> came

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
for a corral for customer decada came

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.899 
for a corral for customer decada came
they<00:01:27.990> came<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.950> course<00:01:30.140> by<00:01:31.140> TT<00:01:31.920> o1<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:32.490> decide

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
they came of course by TT o1 they decide

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.539 
they came of course by TT o1 they decide
we<00:01:33.120> have<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.299> fitting<00:01:33.780> position<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.950> decided

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
we have a fitting position we decided

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.149 
we have a fitting position we decided
which<00:01:36.090> frames<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.260> high<00:01:37.500> position<00:01:37.799> low

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
which frames for a high position low

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.899 
which frames for a high position low
position<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.940> here<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.659> are<00:01:39.690> just<00:01:40.080> ok<00:01:40.500> one

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909

it<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:53.549> necessary<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.510> make<00:01:54.840> something<00:01:55.110> that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
it was necessary to make something that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.800 
it was necessary to make something that
for<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> sales<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> customer<00:01:57.659> normal
