00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
much just become vegetarian I think I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.700

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.420 
that kind of reduces it you know it
makes<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.390> much<00:01:33.509> more<00:01:34.100> limited<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.250> how

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
makes it much more limited as to how
