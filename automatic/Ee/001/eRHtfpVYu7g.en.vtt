00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.809 
well if you stick a pole through a pig's
body<00:02:46.019> after<00:02:46.440> you've<00:02:46.560> gutted<00:02:46.829> it<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.160> expect

body after you've gutted it and expect
it<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.000> spin<00:02:48.359> it<00:02:48.660> won't<00:02:49.019> even<00:02:49.410> though<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.650> pole

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
it to spin it won't even though the pole

spinning<00:02:50.250> there's<00:02:50.519> no<00:02:50.670> friction<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:52.140> what<00:02:52.319> I

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
spinning there's no friction so what I

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.819 
spinning there's no friction so what I
do<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:54.209> drill<00:02:54.510> some<00:02:54.540> holes<00:02:54.780> through<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.650> pig

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
do is I drill some holes through the pig

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.550 
do is I drill some holes through the pig

on the you know the machine that I have
to<00:03:25.560> rotate<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.040> with<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.239> knit<00:03:27.510> them<00:03:27.720> off<00:03:27.870> at

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
to rotate it with so I knit them off at

the knees with the chain saw and I also

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.879 
the knees with the chain saw and I also
take<00:03:30.000> their<00:03:30.180> heads<00:03:30.329> off<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.810> way<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.709> don't

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
take their heads off that way so I don't

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.699 
take their heads off that way so I don't
eat<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.160> heads<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.900> quite<00:03:34.139> frankly<00:03:34.349> my

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
eat the heads and quite frankly my

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.530 
eat the heads and quite frankly my
machine<00:03:35.040> isn't<00:03:35.220> long<00:03:35.459> enough<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.760> put<00:03:36.510> a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540

with<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.370> head<00:03:38.609> on<00:03:38.639> so<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.180> makes<00:03:39.359> it<00:03:39.480> quite

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
with a head on so it makes it quite

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.729 
with a head on so it makes it quite
simple<00:03:40.700> now<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:41.730> was<00:03:42.090> trained<00:03:42.449> how<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.750> kill<00:03:43.530> and

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739
