00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 of queens the truth is that it is very 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.270
 I had not seen either 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.830
 the technique is in no other artist and 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 it seems incredible to me above all 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.910
 details that the bird has seems to be 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.470
 a phoenix we could call her lady queens 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.820
 of the night for example but good of 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.530

 twitter as per the email and 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.610
 the truth is that I decided to put it 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.649
 because I like it a lot if it's 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 true is not a unique skin are five 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.380
 from the omg team that has participated so much 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.710
 at 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.670
 being in the World Cup and has been 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.289
 semifinalist has finished second in the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.780
 two occasions and the truth is that it is 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.700
 very currado this is squares decide me 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.259
 you what do you think so that not 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.929
 we have confusion in the voting 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.299
 will come out as omg team skins for 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.429
 that do not put either alone like this enter through 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.720
 example to pantheon in this case the truth 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.399
 is that there are of my favorites to be 3 and 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 twitch I like it a lot we also have 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.880
 some indra part of silvana and pantheon and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.979
 the truth is that the shield of pantheon 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.720
 he is very handsome the ar splash is a 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.520
 last so congratulations to the artist 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.920
 and you know if you like it you can vote the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.689
 in the description let's move on to the next 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.849
 the following is a single skin what 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.799
 happens that the artist has reflected the 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.479
 different stations in this mode that 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.159
 there is seasonal to call it from some 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.509
 way I think it would be amazing 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.220
 inside the game but a magician out there 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.899
 this style which depending on the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.360
 date of the year in which we are and in the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.979
 station would modify its appearance would be 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.810
 something new inside the lol and the truth is 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.549
 that the idea has enchanted me 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.410
 I decide to put this skin that also gives me the 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.599
 you've spent enough so good 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.920
 another skin more of this magician that you already know 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.630
 if you like you have a link in the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.090
 description to vote it let's go to the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.800
 next corner good here we are with 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.240
 ari basketball player 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.890
 or what would be incredible inside the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.110
 game apart the splash are has a 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.610
 impressive quality within the game 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.280
 for example you could go bouncing the ball 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.990
 when not attacking in this case also 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.400
 when I use xelajú I could go and 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.470
 come the ball I think it would be 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.720
 awesome so good you know 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.660
 another skin that I propose for the top 10 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.700
 let's move on to the next the next skin 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.680
 that I bring you is this cillian back to 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.260
 future the truth is that it gives me a lot 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.730
 see how it changes especially in the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.290
 cillian clothing I think it's going to 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.970
 Something of this style is missing 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.860
 first of all he also needs a 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.450
 re work and visual improvement but good I think 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.030
 that could be one of the skins that 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.320
 they would beat this champion enough 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.630
 that also the details of the splash to 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.790
 appear the delorean behind along with a 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.260
 little person that seems to be the real I think 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.790
 that would be awesome too 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.620
 inside the game and tell you that this has 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.600
 been designed by jet a person who 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.520
 makes a lot of skins and that also in 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.590
 this video I will show you another later 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.990
 so good let's go straight to 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.760
 the next and good the lovers of cesc 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.680
 here you are seeing a corner makes 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.000
 time that showed us some of this 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.370
 champion yes it is true that the last 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.010
 set skins of fans are more 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.510
 oriented to the theme cyborg or to the subject 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.120
 I think one of this style would not be 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.470
 nothing wrong to notice the shadow appears 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.480
 fresh out of the shadow islands 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.610
 of three and karim of that style 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.989
 I think there would be nothing wrong and the 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.430
 it's true that good tell me you a 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.829
 name too and if you like this style 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.810
 of skin for the cez champion so 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.340
 good move on to the next the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.230
 next skin as I told you before 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.030
 also from jet stage yorick of the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.040
 depths or yorick of the abyss 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.599
 we could call it imagine what inside 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.310
 of the game instead of dropping ghosts 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.540
 releasing dead fish you have to go 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.579
 swimming in the air and I think it would be 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.109
 very handsome and I think a skin of this 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.849
 Eric style would hit you pretty much yes 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.500
 it is true that changes are also needed 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.540
 in skills et cetera etcetera but 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.310
 well those are separate topics here we are 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.900
 focused on the visual theme and the 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.180
 skins so good other kim that you 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.400
 I propose for the top 10 of fans let's go 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.709
 to the next this skin that I show you 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.079
 de soracá pirata has been designed by 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.489
 I return a user who sent me this 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.410
 skin by email the truth 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.750
 that my congratulations for this work 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.580
 it seems impressive to see all the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.770
 details both the boat and Soracá this 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.330
 very well designed so good to see you 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.979
 what you think of firm has also been 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.380
 some name other than the pirate that is 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.639
 obvious it would look pretty good and good 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.259
 what I said if you like it already you know 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.240
 you can vote it in the link of the 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.580
 description we passed already to the penultimate 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.229
 corner and this skin that I bring you is the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.219
 halloween ise according to the person that i 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.930
 He sent via email 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.610
 electronic I think she is very pretty 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.810
 especially the displacement is very currado 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.279
 yes it is true that there is not much 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.749
 difference from the main skin except 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.969
 those veils and those most striking colors 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:55.590
 but hey, I do not think they're too bad 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.210
 inside the game the truth I think that 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.610
 could fit pretty well maybe with 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.930
 the touch of riot would improve a little bit and 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.680
 the truth is that it is not bad at all 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.749
 elisa 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.060
 I especially like to see how 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:08.550
 the spider a color a little more purple more 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.800
 striking so already after seeing this 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.020
 halloween ellipse let's go to the last 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.669
 corner could not miss in the series 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.289
 our favorite designer I think it's 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.330
 incredible work he does and here 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.129
 we have a double skin of tran del ya 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.349
 you know this designer I think he has 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.240
 more than 40 skins and I'm thinking tell me 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.919
 you what do you think is to say perform 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.479
 a video in tribute to this person 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.939
 reviewing each and every one of the 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.069
 corners along with their former squares this 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:34.889
 designer so amazing moment ago 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:36.089
 these tests in these sketches then the 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.139
 What are you most enjoying doing? 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:38.849
 move as I have shown 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.610
 previously as 3 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.919
 silvana atrox etc. etc. so 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.469
 good we have a gentleman tran 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.240
 imagine yourself helping paraguazos to everything 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:50.189
 the world and I think it would be very handsome 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.319
 above all and putting the pillar well 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:54.419
 I know what it would be like for this skin 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.699
 gentleman but good the one of war it is my 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.580
 favorite he warlord lofton as he says there 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.619
 in the impressive image especially the 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.389
 I arm the cane and yes it carries the 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:04.830
 garrote so to speak I think that 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.330
 It would be awesome in the game 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.149
 see a skin of this style for tram 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.339
 of the I think it would be legendary so 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:13.589
 less so well you know these 50 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.360
