is<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.410> accelerates<00:02:52.410> as<00:02:52.620> you're

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
is that it accelerates as you're

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.380 
is that it accelerates as you're
scrolling<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.459> then<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.640> stops<00:02:53.970> when<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.269> gets

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
scrolling and then it stops when it gets

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.330 
scrolling and then it stops when it gets
to<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.569> end<00:02:54.599> so<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.859> got<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
to the end so we got it

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
thingies here that's what I would well

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.080 
thingies here that's what I would well
make<00:03:27.450> some<00:03:27.660> room<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.829> even<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:30.919> book<00:03:31.919> did<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
make some room and even the book did the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.750 
make some room and even the book did the
bands<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.650> middle<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.459> was<00:03:35.609> just

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
bands in the middle that I was just

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.240 
bands in the middle that I was just
pointing<00:03:36.060> out<00:03:36.150> those<00:03:37.079> are<00:03:37.260> down<00:03:37.470> here<00:03:37.829> now<00:03:38.010> I

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
pointing out those are down here now I

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.370 
pointing out those are down here now I
basically<00:03:38.970> what<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.120> did<00:03:39.239> was<00:03:39.359> zoom<00:03:39.780> out<00:03:40.049> and

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
basically what I did was zoom out and

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.890 
basically what I did was zoom out and
show<00:03:40.709> more<00:03:41.630> points<00:03:42.630> if<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:43.680> had<00:03:44.480> left<00:03:45.480> all<00:03:45.690> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
show more points if I had left all the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.270 
show more points if I had left all the
other<00:03:46.139> ones<00:03:46.380> in<00:03:46.590> there<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.919> would<00:03:47.040> have<00:03:47.069> been

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
other ones in there it would have been

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.770 
other ones in there it would have been
too<00:03:47.549> clustered<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.359> they<00:03:48.450> wouldn't<00:03:48.660> be<00:03:48.720> able

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
too clustered and they wouldn't be able

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.030 
too clustered and they wouldn't be able
to<00:03:48.870> tell<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.139> difference<00:03:49.440> but<00:03:49.530> all<00:03:49.769> the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
to tell the difference but all the

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.879 
to tell the difference but all the
non-prime<00:03:50.940> indices<00:03:51.630> have<00:03:51.930> been<00:03:52.109> removed<00:03:52.530> and

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
non-prime indices have been removed and

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.129 
non-prime indices have been removed and
all<00:03:53.579> that's<00:03:53.819> left<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.239> this<00:03:54.450> really<00:03:54.870> neat

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
all that's left is this really neat

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.039 
all that's left is this really neat
pattern<00:03:56.129> and<00:03:56.340> when<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.180> discovered<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.930> was

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
pattern and when I discovered this I was

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.379 
pattern and when I discovered this I was
like<00:03:58.200> oh<00:03:58.379> dang<00:03:58.709> that's<00:03:58.980> really<00:03:59.879> freaking<00:04:00.359> cool

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
like oh dang that's really freaking cool

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.059 
like oh dang that's really freaking cool
because<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:00.930> always<00:04:01.319> thought<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.620> there<00:04:01.950> was

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
because I always thought that there was

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.420 
because I always thought that there was
absolutely<00:04:02.579> no<00:04:03.530> pattern<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.919> way<00:04:05.069> prime

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
absolutely no pattern in the way prime

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.000 
absolutely no pattern in the way prime
numbers<00:04:05.849> are<00:04:06.980> arranged<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:09.139> from<00:04:10.139> arranging

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
numbers are arranged and from arranging

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.909 
numbers are arranged and from arranging
the<00:04:11.099> prime<00:04:11.340> numbers<00:04:12.319> superimposed<00:04:13.319> on<00:04:13.650> the

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
the prime numbers superimposed on the

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:19.479 
the prime numbers superimposed on the
golden<00:04:14.459> ratio<00:04:14.910> sunflower<00:04:15.750> seed<00:04:17.570> pattern<00:04:18.570> I

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
golden ratio sunflower seed pattern I

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.800 
golden ratio sunflower seed pattern I
discovered<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.609> there<00:04:20.910> is<00:04:20.940> some<00:04:21.479> semblance

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
discovered that there is some semblance

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.270 
discovered that there is some semblance
of<00:04:22.320> order<00:04:22.849> in<00:04:23.849> the<00:04:24.479> prime<00:04:24.810> number<00:04:25.169> chaos<00:04:25.620> there

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
of order in the prime number chaos there

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.400 
of order in the prime number chaos there
tight<00:04:26.790> bands<00:04:27.060> here<00:04:27.860> larger<00:04:28.860> ones<00:04:29.070> here<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.880> I

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
tight bands here larger ones here and I

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.250 
tight bands here larger ones here and I
haven't<00:04:31.410> bothered<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.920> go<00:04:32.430> beyond<00:04:33.260> ten

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
haven't bothered to go beyond ten

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.040 
haven't bothered to go beyond ten
thousand<00:04:34.740> prime<00:04:34.980> numbers<00:04:35.400> but<00:04:36.090> if<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.360> went

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
thousand prime numbers but if you went

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.560 
thousand prime numbers but if you went
further<00:04:37.470> out<00:04:37.740> here<00:04:37.940> there<00:04:38.940> be<00:04:39.120> another

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
further out here there be another

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.850 
further out here there be another
section<00:04:40.320> of<00:04:41.930> tight<00:04:42.930> little<00:04:43.110> bands<00:04:43.380> like<00:04:43.650> this

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
section of tight little bands like this

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.510 
section of tight little bands like this
if<00:04:44.160> you<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.650> fullscreen<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.680> video<00:04:47.040> and<00:04:47.310> turn

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
if you you fullscreen the video and turn

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.310 
if you you fullscreen the video and turn
it<00:04:47.639> on<00:04:47.700> HD<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.330> you<00:04:48.450> can<00:04:48.570> see<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.960> more<00:04:49.260> clearly

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
it on HD so you can see it more clearly

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.379 
it on HD so you can see it more clearly
because<00:04:49.950> I<00:04:50.100> don't<00:04:50.280> know<00:04:50.400> if<00:04:50.550> these<00:04:50.700> pick<00:04:51.180> these

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
because I don't know if these pick these

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.940 
because I don't know if these pick these
points<00:04:51.780> are<00:04:51.900> small<00:04:52.169> enough<00:04:52.880> but<00:04:54.650> yeah<00:04:55.650> I

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
points are small enough but yeah I

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.680 
points are small enough but yeah I
thought<00:04:56.460> this<00:04:56.580> is<00:04:56.700> really<00:04:56.850> cool<00:04:57.120> I've<00:04:57.389> never<00:04:57.419> I

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
thought this is really cool I've never I

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.110 
thought this is really cool I've never I
had<00:04:57.960> never<00:04:58.200> seen<00:04:58.440> this<00:04:58.560> before<00:04:58.710> if<00:04:59.520> anyone<00:04:59.940> has

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
had never seen this before if anyone has

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.830 
had never seen this before if anyone has
ever<00:05:00.270> seen<00:05:00.570> this<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.130> can<00:05:02.130> point<00:05:03.000> me<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.540> a
