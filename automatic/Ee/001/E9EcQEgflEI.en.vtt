okay today I'm going to touch on the

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.239 
okay today I'm going to touch on the
function<00:00:05.360> run<00:00:07.719> 5450<00:00:08.719> 4.6<00:00:09.559> mm<00:00:10.480> the<00:00:11.480> six<00:00:11.900> color

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:12.249 
function run 5450 4.6 mm the six color

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:17.019 
function run 5450 4.6 mm the six color
combination<00:00:13.249> that<00:00:13.459> is<00:00:13.639> available<00:00:14.089> and<00:00:15.550> as<00:00:16.550> you

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
combination that is available and as you

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.089 
combination that is available and as you
can<00:00:17.150> see<00:00:19.150> over<00:00:20.150> here<00:00:20.800> dissidence<00:00:21.800> the

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
can see over here dissidence the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.519 
can see over here dissidence the
conversion<00:00:22.789> so<00:00:23.539> we<00:00:23.570> have<00:00:23.929> over<00:00:24.109> here<00:00:24.380> the

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
combination so one by one I'll go

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.890 
combination so one by one I'll go
through<00:01:33.290> basically<00:01:34.010> this<00:01:34.820> is<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.060> black<00:01:35.420> cap<00:01:35.690> on

actually smaller than a body the edge

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.390 
actually smaller than a body the edge
piece<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.510> Z<00:01:47.780> over<00:01:47.930> here<00:01:48.140> such<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.800> many<00:01:49.070> caps

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400

in in this case you can really see

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.670 
in in this case you can really see
because<00:01:52.640> black<00:01:53.150> on<00:01:53.300> black<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.650> a

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
because black on black so this is a
