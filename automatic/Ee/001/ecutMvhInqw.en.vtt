00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.980
 place the shed and the last step and 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.380
 of 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.170
 here ready for this warehouse is 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.260
 developing 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.940
 and here to measure for already they work everything 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.310
 growing bigger and bigger 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.860
 and lamination the termination this coal 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.310
 is development and termination and here because 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.310
 come here 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:31.980
 analysis and just established and almost 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:39.629
 here in the fat refrigerator 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:41.220
 and so big the 2,387 older or 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.329
 less out there able to a week it 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.420
 they leave 115 or there a week of 102 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.400
 and 100 kilos but most of the time 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.670
 we are loading ascends between 105 and 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.670
 110 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.530
 if we can get out of 115 better because 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.019
 it costs you a week and a half and makes 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.680
 it's a little bit more, the difference is little 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.780
 that you have in spending expenses of a 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.090
 week of autonomy or because it's all 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.130
 for the same reason because the same people 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.200
 same spent a little more food 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:23.030
 nothing else is not that you have to walk 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.030
 moving something is all the same better 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.899
 how much delay 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.829
 as I said today about five 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.829
 months five years 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.190
 out there some lot out there layer that 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.700
 five months and three weeks 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.760
 and because of the price or session of 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.760
 time we tell you but this week but 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.540
 if not by logical bandana and these five 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.369
 months 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.069
 five and a half months but more than that 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.880
 but now we come out and I'm telling you 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:19.990
 They are coming out on 301 105 110 112 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.990
 and also the law 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.660
 with this good determination in 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.670
 completion is automated has there 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.060
 a silo in the door that goes 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.640
 you will see the pipes and at the tip of the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.790
 another door has a sensor that 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.290
 they enable as they eat 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.220
 pigs is learning the engine when 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.860
 eating the pigs here is the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.250
 food 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.980
 he runs 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.590
 If you anticipate the sensor and start the engine 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.010
 the engine begins to suck with the strips 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.430
 from the sign imagining bony trough 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.870
 that is jumping new filling when 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.270
 fill that feeder you start to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.080
 load the pipe when it reaches the top 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.780
 serial where it realizes that the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.900
 dragging happens for the but always 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.090
 start from back to front always 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.950
 the one that has us we have in the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.170
 last corral the one that consumes the most time 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.470
 then it is the one that activates the engine to 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.620
 every time and that does not leave the food 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.620
 do not 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.939
 and a half 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.319
 system of work and if he because all 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.750
 we call them food once per 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.550
 week 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.840
 this giganton the only thing we have to 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.430
 make good look logical everything but what 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.660
 only in seeds of coal is water and 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.300
 that there is no feeder work 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.300
 for example that is to say we miss you all 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.340
 Saturday in your pocket 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.740
 of finished food and the 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.260
 Saturdays and you know that until the other 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.750
 Saturday you have to replace what you have 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.610
 report 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.640
 later also logical to the amount of 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.610
 animals that are there what by logic 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.609
 now we are coming the best 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.609
 in terms of water the Portuguese and everything 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.820
 Of course here they do not have pools 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.750
 it was pacifier 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:36.660
 in this field in terms of termination 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:41.130
 there is a development there are 280 and 220 years 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.140
 in completion is dividing the stage 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:50.420
 that is, the first half of the development 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:50.420
 there are 280 and little coins are the fat ones 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.420
 we are changing after this 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.370
 they go to the other shed and they come denounce 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.860
 behind the rearing comes for this 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.860
 because they leave you with burning repairs 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:16.040
 if we lower the curtains a little bit to 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:19.730
 let the air run a little cold 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:23.120
 it's practically closed but because 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.670
 not for the cold issue for the 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.600
 animals suffer much cold like 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.600
 suffer the alarms 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.780
 quite 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.670
 for the same theme that we have been doing 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.400
 all every month boost 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.070
 antibiotic and all preventative preventive 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.810
 because we're not going to wait for him to grab us 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:53.790
 a plague and here and here you have many 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.040
 advantages in internet also disadvantages 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.290
 our has no advantage because it is 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.690
 It's cold, it's all here 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:05.100
 nothing happens but without paying a 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:07.830
 plague here of the place either because the 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:13.040
 losses thanks to how to have the advantage 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.040
 that the good the bad if it grabs you 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:22.520
 400 and peak 500 you catch a plague you do not 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.520
 will grab in one 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:31.550
 to this day as it is all already 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.550
 that he would lose animals more 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:41.230
 you can not lose it you can not lose 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.450
 but if I can not avoid better the 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.510
 pocket because there are things that you can 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.430
 avoid not waiting for you, this happened to me 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:52.050
 we go to the antibiotic that happened to me this 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.050
 frame if you can not prevent 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:05.540
 rodrÃ­guez worked with Luis Oliver in 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.540
 swine 2
