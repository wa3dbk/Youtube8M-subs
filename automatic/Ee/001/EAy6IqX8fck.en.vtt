00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
house drive very easy to do okay there's

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.029 
house drive very easy to do okay there's
only<00:00:15.509> two<00:00:15.809> connectors<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.470> these<00:00:16.619> things<00:00:16.830> it's

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
only two connectors on these things it's

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.200 
only two connectors on these things it's
going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.220> be<00:00:17.279> harder<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.789> mount<00:00:18.060> the

going to be harder for you to mount the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.359 
going to be harder for you to mount the
thing<00:00:18.449> into<00:00:18.660> your<00:00:18.779> actual<00:00:19.170> case<00:00:19.619> then<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.250> is

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
thing into your actual case then it is

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.710 
thing into your actual case then it is
going<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.580> be<00:00:20.670> for<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.880> actually<00:00:20.970> connect<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
going to be for you actually connect the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.960 
going to be for you actually connect the
thing<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.710> serial<00:00:23.189> ata<00:00:23.460> data

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
thing this is a serial ata data

thing this is a serial ata data
connector<00:00:24.510> we've<00:00:24.720> talked<00:00:24.930> about<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.439> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
connector we've talked about that in a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.740 
connector we've talked about that in a
previous<00:00:25.529> video<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.369> here's<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> serial<00:00:27.510> ata

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
previous video and here's a serial ata

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.779 
previous video and here's a serial ata
power<00:00:28.019> connector<00:00:28.590> okay<00:00:28.949> that's<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> cd-rom

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
power connector okay that's all a cd-rom

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.569 
power connector okay that's all a cd-rom
needs<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.720> give<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.109> power<00:00:31.260> and

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
needs you just give it power and

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.000 
needs you just give it power and
communications<00:00:32.579> cable<00:00:32.910> if<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.200> look<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.739> your

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
communications cable if you look at your

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.440 
communications cable if you look at your
case<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.820> where<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.059> usually<00:00:36.360> gets

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
case this is where it usually gets

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.910 
case this is where it usually gets
tricky<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.079> depends<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.530> your<00:00:37.649> case

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
tricky because it depends on your case

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.150 
tricky because it depends on your case
in<00:00:38.219> my<00:00:38.809> instance<00:00:39.809> if<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.469> said<00:00:40.649> case<00:00:40.890> would<00:00:41.070> be

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
in my instance if I said case would be

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.420 
in my instance if I said case would be
too<00:00:41.280> much<00:00:41.399> saying<00:00:41.820> case<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.950> can't<00:00:43.950> really<00:00:44.219> get

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
too much saying case I can't really get

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.250 
too much saying case I can't really get
this<00:00:44.670> front<00:00:44.940> panel<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.450> without<00:00:45.660> taking<00:00:45.989> off

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
this front panel out without taking off

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.040 
this front panel out without taking off
this<00:00:46.469> full<00:00:46.800> faceplate<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.600> inside<00:00:49.020> of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
this full faceplate now on the inside of

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.010 
this full faceplate now on the inside of
this<00:00:49.230> case<00:00:49.469> you'll<00:00:49.770> see<00:00:49.829> these<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.160> divots

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
this case you'll see these little divots

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
this case you'll see these little divots
maybe<00:00:52.020> showing<00:00:52.379> those<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.160> cameraman<00:00:53.760> there

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
maybe showing those the cameraman there

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
maybe showing those the cameraman there
on<00:00:54.390> my<00:00:54.930> case<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> push<00:00:55.770> these<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.010> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
on my case I have to push these in and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.130 
on my case I have to push these in and
then<00:00:57.149> push<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.420> back<00:00:57.570> push<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> forward<00:00:59.039> and

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
then push it back push it forward and

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.719 
then push it back push it forward and
the<00:01:01.140> door<00:01:01.730> opens<00:01:02.899> like<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.170> okay<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.189> lot<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the door opens like so okay a lot of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.429 
the door opens like so okay a lot of
times<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.150> front<00:01:06.390> faceplate<00:01:06.630> does<00:01:07.049> come<00:01:07.260> off

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
times the front faceplate does come off

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.410 
times the front faceplate does come off
of<00:01:07.590> these<00:01:07.680> relatively<00:01:08.520> easily<00:01:08.729> sometimes

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
of these relatively easily sometimes

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.510 
of these relatively easily sometimes
it's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> huge<00:01:09.869> pain<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> lot<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.250> times<00:01:11.369> is

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
it's a huge pain but a lot of times is

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640 
it's a huge pain but a lot of times is
what<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.409> need<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
actually pop out this section because

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.300 
actually pop out this section because

so now I've got an open hole for my

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.310 
so now I've got an open hole for my
cd-rom<00:01:31.799> drive<00:01:32.189> oh<00:01:32.570> man<00:01:34.159> ok<00:01:35.750> ok<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.200> I'll

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
cd-rom drive oh man ok ok so then I'll

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.620 
cd-rom drive oh man ok ok so then I'll
just<00:01:37.500> go<00:01:37.650> ahead<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.070> reattach<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:41.630> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
believe it or not a lot of people go in

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.950 
believe it or not a lot of people go in
through<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.880> actual<00:01:45.329> back<00:01:45.630> side<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.930> this

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
through the actual back side of this

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.210 
through the actual back side of this
once<00:01:48.960> you've<00:01:49.079> got<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> front<00:01:49.439> faceplate<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.950> a

once you've got the front faceplate on a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.679 
once you've got the front faceplate on a
lot<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.700> times<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.210> go<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.450> through<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
lot of times you can go in through the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
lot of times you can go in through the
front<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:52.290> always<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:53.040> depends<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
front not always just depends on the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.209 
front not always just depends on the
case<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:55.920> move

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
case but as you can see I can just move

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.399 
case but as you can see I can just move
it<00:01:56.369> back<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> forth<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.600> find<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:58.020> exactly

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
it back and forth so I find out exactly

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.200 
it back and forth so I find out exactly
where<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> want<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.890> make<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.100> flush<00:01:59.490> for<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
where I want it make it flush for the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.240 
where I want it make it flush for the
front<00:02:00.420> part<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.659> your<00:02:00.719> case<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.380> you'll

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
front part of your case and you'll

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.950 
front part of your case and you'll
notice<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:02.969> are<00:02:03.149> your<00:02:03.360> screw<00:02:03.719> holes

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
notice that there are your screw holes

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.900 
notice that there are your screw holes
right<00:02:04.229> there<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> side<00:02:06.799> very<00:02:07.799> very<00:02:07.979> easy

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
right there on the side very very easy

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.080 
right there on the side very very easy
to<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.300> once<00:02:09.599> you've<00:02:09.720> done<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.050> once<00:02:11.090> so

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
to do once you've done it once so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.649 
to do once you've done it once so
basically<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.780> putting<00:02:13.050> myself<00:02:13.200> out<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.650> this

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
basically I'm putting myself out of this

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.580 
basically I'm putting myself out of this
hopefully<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:15.750> got<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.900> right<00:02:16.170> screws

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
hopefully you got the right screws

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.640 
hopefully you got the right screws
sometimes<00:02:17.360> but<00:02:18.360> screws<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.409> actual

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
sometimes but screws for the actual

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.380 
sometimes but screws for the actual
cd-rom<00:02:20.159> drives<00:02:20.430> are<00:02:20.579> a<00:02:20.610> little<00:02:20.730> smaller<00:02:21.150> than

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
cd-rom drives are a little smaller than

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.020 
cd-rom drives are a little smaller than
the<00:02:21.450> ones<00:02:21.689> that<00:02:21.870> come<00:02:22.019> with<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.200> normal<00:02:22.620> case

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
the ones that come with your normal case

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.690 
the ones that come with your normal case
if<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.180> want<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:25.159> you<00:02:26.159> know<00:02:26.189> make<00:02:26.489> sure

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
if you want to be you know make sure

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.869 
if you want to be you know make sure
that<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:27.000> has<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.739> best<00:02:28.739> fit<00:02:29.069> there<00:02:29.760> are

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
that it has the best fit there are

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.940 
that it has the best fit there are
screws<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.390> both<00:02:30.420> sides<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.140> these<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.890> you

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
screws on both sides of these so you

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.319 
screws on both sides of these so you
might<00:02:32.489> want<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.700> screw<00:02:32.849> it<00:02:32.879> in<00:02:33.000> on<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.269> side

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
might want to screw it in on this side

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.259 
might want to screw it in on this side
and<00:02:33.780> then<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.079> your<00:02:34.260> actual<00:02:34.500> case<00:02:35.030> you'll<00:02:36.030> flip

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
and then on your actual case you'll flip

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.759 
and then on your actual case you'll flip
it<00:02:36.420> over<00:02:36.540> I'll<00:02:36.780> show<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:36.989> in<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.200> second<00:02:37.590> hang

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
it over I'll show you in a second hang

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.210 
it over I'll show you in a second hang
on<00:02:38.690> you'll<00:02:39.690> flip<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.170> around<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.739> you'll<00:02:41.010> have

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
on you'll flip it around and you'll have

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.580 
on you'll flip it around and you'll have
more<00:02:41.940> screw<00:02:42.209> holes<00:02:42.420> here<00:02:42.659> on<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.870> back<00:02:43.019> so

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
more screw holes here on the back so

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.080 
more screw holes here on the back so
then<00:02:43.709> I'll<00:02:43.799> actually<00:02:44.069> make<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.340> more<00:02:44.370> snug<00:02:44.849> and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
then I'll actually make it more snug and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.119 
then I'll actually make it more snug and
less<00:02:45.269> less<00:02:46.260> chance<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.799> to<00:02:46.859> move<00:02:47.010> around

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
less less chance for it to move around

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.550 
less less chance for it to move around
in<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.459> front<00:02:47.959> now<00:02:48.959> after<00:02:49.200> you've<00:02:49.319> done<00:02:49.500> that

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
in the front now after you've done that

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.649 
in the front now after you've done that
we're<00:02:50.280> at<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.640> part<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.299> actually<00:02:51.420> just

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
we're at the part of actually just

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.589 
we're at the part of actually just
plugging<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.079> your<00:02:52.230> power<00:02:52.379> connectors<00:02:52.889> I<00:02:53.599> have

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
plugging in your power connectors I have

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.500 
plugging in your power connectors I have
a<00:02:54.629> serial<00:02:55.260> ata<00:02:55.560> power<00:02:55.889> connector<00:02:56.400> here<00:02:56.609> only

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
a serial ata power connector here only

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.500 
a serial ata power connector here only
plugs<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.109> really<00:02:58.409> one<00:02:58.590> way<00:02:59.180> let<00:03:00.180> me<00:03:00.299> make<00:03:00.480> sure

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
plugs in really one way let me make sure

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.580 
plugs in really one way let me make sure
I<00:03:00.720> run<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.109> up<00:03:01.230> through<00:03:01.260> here<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.900> plug<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.049> in

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.539 

good<00:03:09.170> ok<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.440> fits<00:03:10.680> nice<00:03:10.859> and<00:03:10.889> snug<00:03:11.069> in<00:03:11.400> there

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
good ok it fits nice and snug in there

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.920 
good ok it fits nice and snug in there
actually<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.909> prefer<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.569> don't<00:03:12.810> know<00:03:12.870> if

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
actually I prefer that I don't know if

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.050 
actually I prefer that I don't know if
you<00:03:12.989> can<00:03:13.139> even<00:03:13.170> see<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:13.889> there<00:03:14.069> see<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:14.849> got

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
you can even see that in there see I got

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.490 
you can even see that in there see I got
the<00:03:15.150> power<00:03:15.299> connector<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:15.930> there<00:03:16.049> now<00:03:16.200> and

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
the power connector in there now and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.089 
the power connector in there now and
then<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.639> need<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.819> get<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.030> serial<00:03:18.510> ata<00:03:19.099> data

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
then you need to get a serial ata data

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.400 
then you need to get a serial ata data
cable<00:03:20.609> this<00:03:21.269> one<00:03:21.540> came<00:03:21.750> with<00:03:21.780> my<00:03:22.109> motherboard

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
cable this one came with my motherboard

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.089 
cable this one came with my motherboard
so<00:03:22.980> thankfully<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> had<00:03:24.510> one<00:03:24.720> already<00:03:25.099> unless

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
so thankfully I had one already unless

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.789 
so thankfully I had one already unless
you<00:03:26.280> buy<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.549> cd-rom<00:03:27.000> drive<00:03:27.480> retail<00:03:28.049> you'll

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
you buy the cd-rom drive retail you'll

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.770 
you buy the cd-rom drive retail you'll
have<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.160> buy<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.340> separate<00:03:29.970> because<00:03:30.660> I

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
have to buy this separate because I

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.509 
have to buy this separate because I
bought<00:03:30.959> mine<00:03:31.139> OEM<00:03:31.620> which<00:03:31.829> means<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.099> just<00:03:32.129> got

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
bought mine OEM which means I just got

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.000 
bought mine OEM which means I just got
the<00:03:32.639> drive<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:33.030> didn't<00:03:33.180> get<00:03:33.269> any<00:03:33.389> cables<00:03:34.010> so

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
the drive I didn't get any cables so

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.449 
the drive I didn't get any cables so
then<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.190> go<00:03:35.370> ahead<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.579> plug<00:03:35.879> this<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.329> here<00:03:37.459> to

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
then I go ahead and plug this in here to

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.170 
then I go ahead and plug this in here to
the<00:03:38.549> other<00:03:38.790> section<00:03:39.329> of<00:03:39.389> it<00:03:39.629> and<00:03:41.150> see<00:03:42.150> that

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
the other section of it and see that

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.930 
the other section of it and see that
right<00:03:42.540> there

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
right there
