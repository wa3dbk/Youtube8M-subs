artist my work lies in the digital realm
I<00:00:05.720> create<00:00:06.720> 2d<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.620> 3d<00:00:07.649> prints<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.820> express<00:00:09.210> my

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
I create 2d and 3d prints to express my

I create 2d and 3d prints to express my
concepts<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:15.680> have<00:00:16.680> 15<00:00:17.430> years<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.760> experience

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
concepts I have 15 years of experience

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.150 
concepts I have 15 years of experience
in<00:00:18.630> three<00:00:18.900> dimensions<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.470> worked<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.920> video

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
in three dimensions I worked as a video

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.939 
in three dimensions I worked as a video
game<00:00:20.460> designer<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.869> experience<00:00:22.350> really

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
game designer and that experience really

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.040 
game designer and that experience really
added<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.340> lot<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.550> value<00:00:23.699> when<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> adopted<00:00:24.779> 3d

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
added a lot of value when I adopted 3d

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.920 
added a lot of value when I adopted 3d
printing<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.590> as<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> part<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.789> my<00:00:26.939> process<00:00:27.119> it

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
printing as as a part of my process it

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.759 
printing as as a part of my process it
just<00:00:28.199> gave<00:00:29.010> me<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.550> advantage<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.960> tools<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
just gave me the advantage in tools and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.190 
just gave me the advantage in tools and
technology<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.550> also<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> spatial

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
technology and also in the spatial

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.810 
technology and also in the spatial
thinking<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.219> as<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> father<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.030> me

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.030 

so<00:00:41.820> 3d<00:00:42.149> printing<00:00:42.570> especially<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> sls

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
so 3d printing especially with the sls

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.459 
so 3d printing especially with the sls
process<00:00:44.579> allows<00:00:44.910> me<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.750> unlimited

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
process allows me to have unlimited

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.500 
process allows me to have unlimited
possibilities<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.280> my<00:00:47.399> creative<00:00:47.820> process<00:00:47.940> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
possibilities in my creative process I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
possibilities in my creative process I
can<00:00:48.930> create<00:00:49.350> anything<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.980> want<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.460> can

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
can create anything I want and I can

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
can create anything I want and I can
throw<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> printer<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.230> will<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
throw it in the printer and I will get a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.380 
throw it in the printer and I will get a
result<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.760> learn<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.210> grow<00:00:54.329> from

ink on paper lines this was my first
experiment<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.340> realize<00:01:14.670> how<00:01:15.030> her<00:01:15.990> work<00:01:16.320> can

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
experiment to realize how her work can

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
experiment to realize how her work can
be<00:01:17.280> translated<00:01:18.030> into<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> third<00:01:18.659> dimension

be translated into the third dimension
and<00:01:19.320> 3d<00:01:20.310> printing<00:01:20.640> allowed<00:01:20.880> me<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:22.530> make

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and 3d printing allowed me to to make

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.210 
and 3d printing allowed me to to make
that<00:01:22.860> possible<00:01:24.080> but<00:01:25.080> these<00:01:25.290> these<00:01:25.770> two<00:01:26.009> pieces

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that possible but these these two pieces

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.280 
that possible but these these two pieces
right<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:26.670> are<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> three<00:01:27.750> dimensional

that<00:01:30.840> i<00:01:30.869> did<00:01:31.079> earlier<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> same<00:01:31.890> show<00:01:32.159> I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
that i did earlier for the same show I

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.819 
that i did earlier for the same show I
wanted<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.930> three<00:01:34.170> dimensional<00:01:34.850> pieces<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
wanted the three dimensional pieces to

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.080 
wanted the three dimensional pieces to
find<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> deeper<00:01:38.280> connection<00:01:38.790> with<00:01:38.820> the

find a deeper connection with the
audience<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.780> why<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.049> went<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.890> three

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
audience that's why it went for three

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.469 
years now and I've experimented
aggressively<00:02:08.680> with<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.890> lot<00:02:09.070> of<00:02:09.100> other<00:02:09.479> service

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
aggressively with a lot of other service

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.810 
aggressively with a lot of other service
providers<00:02:10.990> working<00:02:11.740> with<00:02:11.860> solid<00:02:12.160> concepts<00:02:12.670> is

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
providers working with solid concepts is

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.850 
providers working with solid concepts is
a<00:02:12.910> whole<00:02:13.060> different<00:02:13.240> experience<00:02:13.450> because<00:02:14.230> I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
a whole different experience because I

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.210 
a whole different experience because I
feel<00:02:15.730> I'm<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> part<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.390> team<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:17.220> create

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
feel I'm a part of a team I create

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.640 
feel I'm a part of a team I create
something<00:02:18.580> very<00:02:18.850> very<00:02:19.060> complex<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.380> upload

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
something very very complex and I upload

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.430 
something very very complex and I upload
my<00:02:20.920> files<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.870> using<00:02:22.870> some<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.290> other

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
my files and using some of the other

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.830 
my files and using some of the other
services<00:02:23.650> all<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.160> get<00:02:24.460> is<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.700> yes<00:02:24.910> or<00:02:25.090> no<00:02:25.240> will

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
services all I get is a yes or no will

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.200 
services all I get is a yes or no will
it<00:02:25.960> 3d<00:02:26.260> print<00:02:26.500> or<00:02:26.680> no<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.070> that's<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.850> then

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
it 3d print or no and that's it and then

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.000 
it 3d print or no and that's it and then
I<00:02:28.240> have<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.450> figure<00:02:28.690> out<00:02:28.720> why<00:02:29.020> with<00:02:29.650> solid

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
I have to figure out why with solid

I have to figure out why with solid
