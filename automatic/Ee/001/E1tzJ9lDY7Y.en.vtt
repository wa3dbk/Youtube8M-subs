00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:24.516
 A powerful believer of the gods came to the time and space hub from the temple of Ai Gerod, he is Karashim 

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:29.380
 Like other monks, Karashim dedicated his life to one thousand and one gods. 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.413
 And their messenger in the mortal world, the sage 

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:37.415
 Karashim came from the land of refuge in accordance with the wishes of His Holiness 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.411
 The battlefield of the time and space hub, where he will bring sacred order and balance to chaos 

00:00:47.502 --> 00:00:50.989
 Karashim is an aggressive, highly mobile hero 

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:55.749
 Rely on traits and talent to support the team or cause damage to enemies 

00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:03.931
 Karasham can choose traits at the beginning of the game 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.804
 The third normal attack for each trait triggers different effects: 

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.687
 Every third attack of Tekken can be crit 

00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:16.534
 Ascend can treat nearby allies 

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:22.514
 And savvy can restore the mana, so that he can continue to fight in battle. 

00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:29.357
 Karashim’s first skill is the Ling Feng strike, which can be used against enemies or allies. 

00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:34.188
 When used against an enemy, the monk can jump to the enemy. 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.069
 Let him get a better position and carry out a series of attacks 

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:43.542
 This skill can be stored multiple times, allowing the monk to use continuously. 

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:48.758
 His next skill is to return to the sky, to treat and speed up the movement 

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:51.510
 Karashim and nearby ally heroes 

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:56.151
 Will restore a certain amount of health and accelerate in the next few seconds 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.887
 Karashim’s third skill is punching 

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:02.781
 This is a self-enhancing skill 

00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:06.054
 After use, it will trigger when the next melee attack of the monk 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.982
 In a few seconds, greatly speed up the attack speed and attack range of the monk 

00:02:10.692 --> 00:02:15.302
 Faster attack speed means that Karashim's traits can be triggered more frequently 

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:20.094
 Karashim’s first ultimate skill is the seven-phase boxing 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.478
 Continuously attacking nearby enemies 

00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:25.494
 Wu Hao himself will become invincible 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.758
 Each attack deals damage equal to 7 percent of the enemy's maximum health. 

00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:34.576
 Each attack can hit different heroes, Karashim will 

00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:37.663
 Enemies with the highest health in the range of automatic attacks 

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:42.102
 Karashim’s second ultimate skill is the Holy Spirit 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.335
 After casting to yourself or your allies, you can continue for 3 seconds. 

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:50.245
 But if the target is dealt lethal within 3 seconds 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.894
 The target will recover a lot of health after a short delay. 

00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:56.062
 Make it quick to return to battle 

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.733
 When controlling Karashim, here are some tactical tips: 

00:03:04.554 --> 00:03:08.338
 Ling Feng is not only an attack skill but also a comprehensive skill. 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.414
 Can rush into the battle to complete the final blow 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.039
 You can also avoid yourself from attacking enemies as teammates attack enemies. 

00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:17.775
 Don't hesitate to use Ling Feng to evacuate 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.793
 Because this skill can be used against creeps and allies 

00:03:21.594 --> 00:03:24.059
 Punch and heart can be used to help 

00:03:24.084 --> 00:03:26.158
 Fragile assassination hero catches up with the enemy 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.447
 Extra movement speed and melee range let you 

00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:31.614
 Can be close to enemies and teammates when making output 

00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:35.807
 And timely return to the world can treat multiple injured allies 

00:03:36.948 --> 00:03:39.910
 Karashim’s ultimate skills have many strategic values 

00:03:40.246 --> 00:03:41.874
 Does your team need more output? 

00:03:42.114 --> 00:03:46.406
 Then choose the seven-phase boxing to weaken the enemy before the start of the large-scale group battle. 

00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:51.101
 This skill is especially useful when dealing with multiple combat heroes. 

00:03:51.714 --> 00:03:54.790
 Because the damage of this skill is calculated based on the total health. 

00:03:55.894 --> 00:04:00.390
 When the enemy has a strong ability to break out and break through, you can choose the Holy Spirit 

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:02.822
 Use for a vulnerable teammate 

00:04:02.847 --> 00:04:05.687
 Can be dealt fatal damage to enemies 

00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:09.765
 Let teammates escape and recover enough health 

00:04:10.426 --> 00:04:12.206
 But be aware that this skill range is small 

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.886
 You need to use Ling Feng to hit the ally 

00:04:17.447 --> 00:04:20.991
 Karasham is relatively low in health and after using skills 

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:23.159
 Can't cause a lot of damage 

00:04:24.505 --> 00:04:30.278
 After he enters the battle, a quick set fire can quickly destroy it. 

00:04:36.114 --> 00:04:39.757
