00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.650
 I would like 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.270
 at such a big front 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.800
 from the beginning one 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.790
 Achieve quality 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.790
 the one spiritual 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 for later generations or even sooner 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.750
 SN APA 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.490
 and the special up here is a flute 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.660
 the one here SID 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.260
 the Dr 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.160
 was already known as Sprit Orioles about which has both reported 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.390
 has the love 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.390
 lovely flutes of Almaty Paul 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.550
 called the basis are described these grasp 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.570
 meant 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.570
 if not a disgrace 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.220
 a quick test through the whole church 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.830
 The inside of them normal are lifeless lead 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 of the player hammered 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.520
 and they have a wide range that you think you could too 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.160
 an octave lower 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.830
 because with a nice goal if they 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 could take now 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.179
 Who here we are in Dalton's right knee 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:20.279
 you have to stand here born 24 foot strips 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.539
 inasmuch as they are the only ones known as the fine kind 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.709
 still exist 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.609
 if you look at that like 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.629
 put these signs 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.409
 are hung up 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.969
 then you can imagine that it was necessary because of the big one 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.859
 Vitali weight so if you are here 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.519
 Look and see these huge forged nails 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:50.979
 likewise the factory sets or forges from a blacksmith's workshop 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.539
 Per cent then you get an impression 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:58.009
 what's needed to whistle this 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:01.459
 to keep in good condition in here 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.379
 So these are very special driving experience 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.199
 because they are 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.069
 the times
