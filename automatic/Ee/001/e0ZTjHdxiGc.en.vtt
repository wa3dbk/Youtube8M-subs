the key theme is really to demonstrate

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.300 
the key theme is really to demonstrate
how<00:00:30.970> kinetic<00:00:31.660> design<00:00:31.810> can<00:00:32.320> be<00:00:32.349> applied<00:00:32.650> to<00:00:33.280> a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
how kinetic design can be applied to a

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.090 
how kinetic design can be applied to a
completely<00:00:33.670> different<00:00:33.760> type<00:00:34.300> of<00:00:34.330> vehicle<00:00:35.100> the

dramatic form of the whole car the
profile<00:00:38.260> how<00:00:38.920> we've<00:00:39.190> got<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:40.260> people<00:00:41.260> mover

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800

profile how we've got the people mover
to<00:00:41.920> look<00:00:42.070> so<00:00:42.309> exciting<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:43.059> think<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.330> whole

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
to look so exciting I think the whole

to look so exciting I think the whole
presence<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.110> car<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.470> what<00:00:44.650> really<00:00:44.950> is

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
presence of the car is what really is

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.890 
presence of the car is what really is
what<00:00:45.340> really<00:00:45.580> excites<00:00:45.850> me<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.720> key

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
what really excites me one of the key

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.660 
what really excites me one of the key
design<00:00:53.110> elements<00:00:53.769> of<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.190> product<00:00:54.580> is

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
design elements of the product is

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.820 
design elements of the product is
definitely<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.180> front<00:00:55.420> end<00:00:55.659> and<00:00:55.839> the<00:00:55.930> front

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
definitely the front end and the front

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.200 
definitely the front end and the front
is<00:00:56.920> really<00:00:57.280> bold<00:00:57.580> because<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.120> the

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
is really bold because of the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.360 
is really bold because of the
trapezoidal<00:00:58.809> grille<00:00:58.900> it's<00:00:59.350> really<00:01:00.040> easy<00:01:00.220> to

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
trapezoidal grille it's really easy to

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.360 
trapezoidal grille it's really easy to
identify<00:01:00.670> this<00:01:01.030> as<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.360> fort<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:03.070> fits

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
identify this as a fort it fits

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.160 
identify this as a fort it fits
perfectly<00:01:03.460> into<00:01:04.030> our<00:01:04.239> mixed<00:01:04.510> family<00:01:04.870> when<00:01:05.050> you

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
perfectly into our mixed family when you

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.290 
perfectly into our mixed family when you
compare<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.590> with<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.490> SMX<00:01:06.940> which<00:01:07.150> is<00:01:07.270> a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
compare it with the SMX which is a

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.080 
compare it with the SMX which is a
really<00:01:07.570> sporty<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:08.229> desirable<00:01:08.830> product<00:01:09.340> so

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
really sporty and desirable product so

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.800 
really sporty and desirable product so
the<00:01:10.690> new<00:01:10.930> iosis<00:01:11.830> max<00:01:12.100> is<00:01:12.340> even<00:01:13.120> more<00:01:13.270> sporty<00:01:13.690> or

object energy on a small car like this

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.600 
object energy on a small car like this
you<00:01:59.970> need<00:02:00.210> enough<00:02:01.050> room<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.470> this<00:02:01.560> feeling<00:02:01.979> so

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you need enough room in this feeling so

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.230 
you need enough room in this feeling so
all<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.390> components<00:02:04.070> we<00:02:05.070> tried<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.880> reduce

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
all the components we tried to reduce

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.900 
all the components we tried to reduce
them<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.750> volume<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.380> much<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.710> possible<00:02:07.920> we

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
them in volume as much as possible we

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.520 
them in volume as much as possible we
have<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.270> slim<00:02:09.780> muscular<00:02:10.790> interior<00:02:11.790> panel

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
have a slim muscular interior panel

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.949 
have a slim muscular interior panel
innovative<00:02:13.530> center<00:02:14.310> console<00:02:14.790> we<00:02:15.570> have<00:02:15.750> a

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
innovative center console we have a

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.470 
innovative center console we have a
spine<00:02:16.440> like<00:02:16.800> bridge<00:02:17.220> running<00:02:18.090> through<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
spine like bridge running through the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.740 
spine like bridge running through the
car<00:02:18.720> holding<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.740> seeds<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.850> think<00:02:21.420> we<00:02:21.600> can

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
car holding the seeds and I think we can

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.220 
car holding the seeds and I think we can
really<00:02:21.900> be<00:02:22.080> proud<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.590> what<00:02:23.180> in<00:02:24.180> detail<00:02:24.690> they

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
really be proud of what in detail they

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.220 
really be proud of what in detail they
are<00:02:25.350> looking<00:02:25.590> like

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.230 

we<00:02:33.230> focused<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.830> three<00:02:34.010> dimensionality<00:02:34.790> in

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
we focused on three dimensionality in

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.060 
we focused on three dimensionality in
every<00:02:35.540> aspect<00:02:35.570> so<00:02:36.350> we<00:02:37.010> selected<00:02:39.070> textures

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
every aspect so we selected textures

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.850 
every aspect so we selected textures
which<00:02:40.310> really<00:02:40.700> have<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.940> three<00:02:41.270> dimensional

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
which really have a three dimensional

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.160 
which really have a three dimensional
appearance<00:02:42.860> in<00:02:43.640> combination<00:02:44.570> with<00:02:44.600> aunt<00:02:44.930> we

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
appearance in combination with aunt we

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.650 
appearance in combination with aunt we
selected<00:02:45.710> colors<00:02:46.130> which<00:02:46.490> have<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.970> natural

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
selected colors which have a natural

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.390 
selected colors which have a natural
appearance<00:02:47.990> by<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.380> technical<00:02:49.040> appearance

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
appearance by the technical appearance

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.110 
appearance by the technical appearance
so<00:02:49.580> soft<00:02:49.910> gray<00:02:50.420> tones<00:02:51.040> highlighted<00:02:52.040> with<00:02:52.280> acid

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
so soft gray tones highlighted with acid

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.500 
so soft gray tones highlighted with acid
yellow<00:02:53.990> tones<00:02:54.340> which<00:02:55.340> reflect<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.120> exterior

color to the interior it's really

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:08.650
