00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.440
 that personally other authors like more 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.810
 of white I do not bring another video more 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.070
 since I realized that if they like a 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.830
 shit white videos 2 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.470
 obviously I already knew that but I did not know 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.590
 that they liked too much for flying 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.660
 go see them to this I said no to the best 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.280
 this guy is ninth sometimes some already 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.260
 they do not connect or sometimes they do not see 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.930
 videos but no more with its white light of 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.820
 flown those who see them and for 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.640
 that I bring you this since you asked me 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.350
 vice sticks file system is a tutorial 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.500
 how to kill enemies faster 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.739
 this how I thought a lot this mother 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.730
 I can say with killing a faster 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.829
 egg or how to kill more faster this one 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.229
 there are a thousand ways to understand this 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.240
 mother saw he understood that he wants to kill 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.180
 to faster as when you fight one 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.850
 against one or how will you win the fights 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.369
 to this one if you want to kill as fast 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.130
 obviously if you kill them faster you go to 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.890
 kill more but he will do some things if 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.190
 you want to kill faster, look at these 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.010
 are the three things that are wrong 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.370
 I recommend having good internet have 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.730
 good aim and have a good weapon if 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.310
 31 will link and you have internet of the 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.190
 mother was already worth mother or nothing because 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.740
 obviously the internet is the rule 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.680
 number one have the internet network 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.290
 if you have good aim of the second and 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.840
 it is good weapon of the third and the rest 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.790
 is intelligence or how do you play because 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.440
 if you're good to kill and good for 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.630
 aim no matter how you play 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.200
 obviously he's going to be killing footprints 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.020
 but if you have mother's internet it 's 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.560
 something like life in real life 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.350
 they say they tell you that money is not everything 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.510
 but so assholes who say no 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.850
 money if it's all to be able to play for 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.620
 be able to buy a game to be able to have 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.200
 good internet to be able to eat for 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.720
 be able to live for light for any 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.940
 chinga of the need is money if you already 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.310
 it's up to with the money you grab 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.530
 love and that is blowjob have to not then 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.209
 you spend it in a ferrari everything starts 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.940
 to speak you grab friends having everything 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.530
 with money they have no but to whom 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.750
 then since it's an online game that 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.520
 post but it 's an online I do not know 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.040
 why are you watching this video but 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.960
 the internet everything in the game because with 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.760
 the internet will use perfect internet 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.750
 will let us know exactly where they are 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.700
 the enemies 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.880
 the bullets are always going to hit where you 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.160
 you are pointing yes yes to say nothing but 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.110
 that does not matter what it is if what happened 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.300
 to an enemy if you have two bars of 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.970
 internet an enemy you shoot can 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.250
 wishing back or wishing the feet 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.440
 or something because your internet will be 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.930
 half drawn and you're going to see it 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.210
 little you will see it in one place but 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.100
 they are actually in another this 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.690
 the lantern will be a little bad like that 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.280
 they can not see them, not really 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.980
 you are but if you have the internet 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.470
 perfect you're betting one hundred percent 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.760
 sure that guy is there for that 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.350
 sometimes when you have without having more 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.970
 you have to amputate them a little 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.030
 later that happened to me in the future 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.890
 that has medium internet but before it hurts 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.110
 that point a little bit forward so that 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.270
 the bullets arrived they looked like little pinch more 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.160
 mother actions that had almost is the 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.410
 fired the couple who bounce her 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.250
 bullets but then that is one thing that if 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.560
 I tell them the second one would be 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.900
 to point out how it can be is to improve your 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.030
 aim this already uploaded a video about 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.850
 of that and if you liked it very much you can take 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.070
 like 60 thousand but anyway this 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.800
 here I say another advice as well 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.140
 we aim for the number one rule 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.660
 of playing sees us and there are many people who 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.209
 he gets to watch videos this I do not tell him 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.950
 it's the bad one but they want to watch videos and 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.810
 they want that when they connect they kill 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.820
 I know it does not give us more because you 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.340
 inspire your tv or watch a video and you 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.260
 you're excited this does not mean you're going to 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.380
 get there and you're going to have the aim of the 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.780
 perfect the aim is something that 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.609
 have to get is playing alone 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.220
 you're going to get like that one day 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.380
 for another to grip the hell is 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.720
 only if you're a skewer stolen 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.310
 you enter hack if it leaves you I do not know nor for 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.470
 that you are watching the video is that no 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.810
 you need to aim or improve in nothing 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.750
 because the hack does everything for you 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.220
 semi state adaptation you say to 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.010
 where does it point you do not even have to 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.720
 point you just shoot and I do not kill you not 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.090
 I know what this other mother is, I'm 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.610
 speaking if you play normal if you play as 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.620
 I do cac without cheating without tricks 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.069
 the aim is something you have to go 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.620
 improving if you want to kill them faster 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.930
 also arms weapons are something 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.330
 well chingÃ³n a sniper as you know a is 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.569
 cards the aim or the bullets are a 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.069
 difficult not to kill them in 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.460
 those who kill them the first bullet 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:06.229
 credits will be to kill 90% of the 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.050
 Sometimes you kill him with a bullet with a snack 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.939
 but obviously speaking of quality 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.620
 because they say goodbye to rap always in 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.479
 wake is something to your mom 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.460
 we are talking about that you are almost 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.930
 he's always going to kill them with a bullet and 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.610
 you have a shotgun like the one that makes 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.680
 most times going to kill a 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.840
 bullet that is as fast as 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.550
 the busers can kill with a bullet what 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.800
 faster than you can kill if you always 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.960
 use the same weapon as a submachine gun 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.689
 you can put rapid fire and you're going to 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.879
 kill faster if you want to win fights 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.069
 from one to one what I would recommend 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:39.590
 is that you shoot him in the head you 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:42.639
 agaches shrouds is one thing yes yes 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.469
 you do not know how to crouch or locate that 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.629
 try it the most lapacho of the circle or 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.430
 X, but I hope you have them 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:50.390
