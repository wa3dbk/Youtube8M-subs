create the vanish out of that these
engines<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.420> because<00:00:36.690> they<00:00:37.320> run<00:00:37.469> quite

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
engines do that because they run quite

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.160 
engines do that because they run quite
hot<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.149> rocket<00:00:39.480> covers<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:41.960> varnish<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
listeners the oil sort of goes a bit bad

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.720 
listeners the oil sort of goes a bit bad
to<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> heat<00:00:48.680> they<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.920> fuse<00:00:50.160> mr.<00:00:50.550> strain

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
to the heat they just fuse mr. strain

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.970 
to the heat they just fuse mr. strain
that<00:00:50.969> claims<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> varnish<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:52.860> they

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that claims up the varnish and then they

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:03.910 
that claims up the varnish and then they
stop<00:00:53.190> tapping

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.649 

that<00:01:04.920> would<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> good<00:01:05.549> torture<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.450> make

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
that would make a good torture just make

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.980 
that would make a good torture just make
someone<00:01:06.960> listen<00:01:07.259> to<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.710> hours<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.340> end

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990

let's start this thing up I go to adjust
the<00:01:14.009> idle<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.670> sort<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.939> revving

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the idle because it's sort of revving

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.590 
the idle because it's sort of revving
the<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.810> itself<00:01:16.229> lately<00:01:20.330> we<00:01:21.330> wants

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the out of itself lately we wants

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.529 
the out of itself lately we wants
to<00:01:21.689> idle<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.200> down<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.890> gear<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.520> that's<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
to idle it down and in gear and that's a

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:38.060 
to idle it down and in gear and that's a
little<00:01:24.750> fast

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.399
