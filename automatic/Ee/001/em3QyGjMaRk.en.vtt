 here and there is the little kids 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.570
 but well worth this opportunity and the week to make room 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.070
 so here and there for years 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.160
 Most eater stays that you have something 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.360
 here he will be the home of one of the characters and also here in the file 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.179
 becomes partly 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.109
 I'll be able to get out of it for a moment and you can see that everything is really just one 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.310
 name has such as in real life is the see you with a disability and their month 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.739

 drenth and very best back but well here they are also downtown los centers like 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.610
 You see it is of course not really buildings that also in seven years time 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.660
 maybe that's what you think the most in the steamworks I know 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.190
 not himself, but he did place tall buildings in the right place here 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.769
 of course you also have this real the side net 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.749
 Nijmegen Arnhem are so with those toddlers and such 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.819

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.810
 artistic horn 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.310
 I do not know if you are also green or red I think this is normal 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.360
 but van bruges at the place where bruges must there he has as business 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.820
 where the agreements must be 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.879

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.620
 plan gatehouse I know a lot 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.230
 here of course you also have the entire band scaffolding that law is also normal this is from 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.010
 that drained the river with all those tons of things on the side and I know 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.340
 a lot what opens this is also nice here is the pier but you stand as a beautiful 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.940
 ferris wheel to the roller coaster 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.090
 yeah you know then you just aren't in those swatches there are limitations i 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.240
 just do not know where that purple beautiful place comes from here is the oldest 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.610
 Army base that also looks like a second skin that just sits where it is 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.890
 have to put yes that is quite logical on this piece this year five men but like 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.460
 you see here should then be a tunnel of course the were in the 1st 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.110
 cindy heavy press heavy because no tunnels safety that is a tunnel can 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.830
 you can do well here this also here would probably all be 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.250
 agree with the engine had just driven by or we all agree with one 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.380
 plane on this turn four field of keywords land i only miss i have 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.380
 of sardinia to deliver four drivers 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.639
 I don't seem so fat but the week is all not here you see 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.549
 by the way 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.199
 the interest den uylpark together with all the beautiful windmills next to each other 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.069
 I don't know what kind of bank this is in the real game 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.140
 so yes yaan and then learn from here at the foot of you 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.370
 and of course a few meters at he just told me in clinics on the spot z 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.209
 wherever it is in this game z 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.939
 and then a freight train station at the place where the real democrat and then 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.489
 Of course industry on the spot where the road to put also puts here is also one 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.349
 water tower I do not know if they are also in the real deneyer but we 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.650
 all know who is taking Kramer 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.760
 here is also the golf course from me is super was made 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.890
 Later phases look at how the traffic and rampant to put up because that is 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.279
 also pretty good own work 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:32.020
 who is here is a bit of a congestion this i was at industry 

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:33.960
 in this very heavy game 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.550
 you can just do nothing about it there but generally recognized year 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.599
 35 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:42.210
 and let the traffic also work well and you have the same as I think 

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:45.529
 had already made the metro 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.529
 the metro lines also run exactly where they once ap ap ap 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:53.099
 you can see the look yourself as a step-up spot because you can immediately stop the step-up spot 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:53.530
 trend 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.530
 norder is not in all the bad cup size on 9 April 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:01.680
 If Wesley see this city are in serious trouble with income 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.870
 so it is that the employee limit but the city are generally here 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.780
 also all problems of looy len many young that there are no parties in gt5 op 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.009
 that place you have 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.409
 so yes then of course you can do nothing further to the bottom 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.840
 top of mount sinai there is the cable car 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.850
 as you see it will really look like that you have more in it and the law 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.300
 wind farms it is just incredible and i will touch but this 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.870
 you show what i let bart aben stay there 9 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.479
 I actually also have a bid on Wall Street down for the 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.820
 uncluttered video as it was one that I did not fail local residents 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.260
 It was therefore difficult to take a hurdle so I am quite surprised 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.680
 that someone and inside and count on six days that the game was out that someone this 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.150
 has been able to make that is used soon you can probably also you 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.060
 der pond where I picked a number if you want it in any case 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.659
 you must not want that 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.259
 sorry 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.719
 7 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:58.019
 carnival car ports must be factories nba factories must be 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.729
 oil factory in the audi factory that must be 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.370
 larissa became this game is l would be like 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.069
 also can't believe this is incredible 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:09.990
 by being there they may also vent 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.270
 Almere also seems something strange and we will see you once and hopefully and not 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.290
 like knowing that your video paul the long way
