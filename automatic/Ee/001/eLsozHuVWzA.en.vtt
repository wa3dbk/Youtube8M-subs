00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
but we'll have to wait to see how it

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.199 
but we'll have to wait to see how it
pans<00:03:32.070> out<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.370> already<00:03:32.580> looks<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:33.030> it's

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
pans out it already looks like it's

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.230
