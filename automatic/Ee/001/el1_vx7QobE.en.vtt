00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
you've got to figure out spacing these

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.820 
you've got to figure out spacing these
things<00:01:40.119> drop<00:01:40.330> very<00:01:40.599> fast

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.290 

these<00:01:44.220> cars<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.790> mind<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.150> their<00:01:45.210> own

they'll<00:01:46.740> go<00:01:46.980> really<00:01:47.340> fast<00:01:47.580> they'll<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:48.150> really

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
they'll go really fast they'll go really

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.120 
they'll go really fast they'll go really
slow<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:49.200> might<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.440> going<00:01:49.650> left<00:01:49.830> then<00:01:50.040> they

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
slow they might be going left then they

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.440 
slow they might be going left then they
gonna<00:01:50.250> turn<00:01:50.460> around<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.850> go<00:01:50.910> right<00:01:51.150> they'll

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
car around over the hood to give them

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.050 
car around over the hood to give them
that<00:01:56.640> shot<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> they're<00:01:57.150> looking<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:59.060> we

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that shot that they're looking for we

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.030 
that shot that they're looking for we
have<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.450> very<00:02:00.810> precise<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.500> our<00:02:01.650> headings

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
have to be very precise on our headings

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.340 
have to be very precise on our headings
and<00:02:02.160> our<00:02:02.280> altitudes

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
and our altitudes

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.620 
and our altitudes
we<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.980> calculate<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.760> specific<00:02:06.390> drop

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
we have to calculate a specific drop

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.420 
we have to calculate a specific drop
point<00:02:06.900> so<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.230> the<00:02:07.410> vehicles<00:02:08.100> are<00:02:08.250> not

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
point so that the vehicles are not

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.950 
point so that the vehicles are not
hitting<00:02:08.610> people<00:02:09.180> on<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> ground<00:02:09.630> down<00:02:09.869> there

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
hitting people on the ground down there

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.510 
hitting people on the ground down there
my<00:02:12.960> divers<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.590> helicopter<00:02:14.250> and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
my divers in the helicopter and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.240
