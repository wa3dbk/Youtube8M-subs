00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.889 
and right now I'll just show you how
these<00:00:31.590> work<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.489> there<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:33.090> some<00:00:33.390> hooks<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
these work so there are some hooks and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.870 
these work so there are some hooks and
they<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.440> go<00:00:34.649> into<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.040> wiggly<00:00:35.340> wire<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
they just go into the wiggly wire on the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.860 
they just go into the wiggly wire on the
back<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> net

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
back of the net

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.990 
back of the net
so<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.200> hook<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.469> there<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.100> then<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.730> come

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
so they hook in there and then they come

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.150 
so they hook in there and then they come
with<00:00:39.239> these<00:00:39.420> strings<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.260> string

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
with these strings so you can string

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.250 
with these strings so you can string
them<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.520> well<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.910> then<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.780> tighten<00:00:43.140> them

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
them up as well and then to tighten them

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.690

some shots with all the easy targets and

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.280 
some shots with all the easy targets and
I<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:29.700> using<00:01:29.880> wrist<00:01:30.270> shots<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.720> slap<00:01:30.990> shots

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
I was using wrist shots and slap shots

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.140 
I was using wrist shots and slap shots
and<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.950> targets<00:01:32.280> are<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.520> good<00:01:32.700> nice<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and the targets are really good nice and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
and the targets are really good nice and
deep<00:01:33.329> pockets<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.229> hold<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> pucks<00:01:34.770> in

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
deep pockets there to hold the pucks in

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
deep pockets there to hold the pucks in
so<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.759> fire<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> bunch<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.329> pucks<00:01:36.540> in

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
so you can fire a bunch of pucks in

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.880 
so you can fire a bunch of pucks in
there<00:01:36.900> before<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.170> gotta<00:01:37.380> go<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.650> them<00:01:37.799> off

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
there before you gotta go get them off

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.149 
there before you gotta go get them off
and<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.670> bottom<00:01:38.880> ones<00:01:39.180> work<00:01:39.390> fine<00:01:39.659> as<00:01:39.869> well

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
and the bottom ones work fine as well

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.260 
and the bottom ones work fine as well
they<00:01:41.159> seem<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.490> they're<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.759> bit<00:01:41.909> smaller<00:01:42.180> I

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
they seem like they're a bit smaller I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.969

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
think just because how they hey the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.190 
think just because how they hey the
bottom<00:01:44.310> ones<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.880> yeah<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.990> like

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200
