 Open the window as usual 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:41.980
 It would have been awfully cold in the morning 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:46.860
 Lowest temperature lowest temperature 19.7 doors Yokohama 19.7 degrees and Tokyo 20.2 degrees 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.860
 It's cold , so it's a story 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 It is point is yesterday's how to relocate It was possible in the super-highest 20 highest class Kobe 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.280
 I told you that you need something to put on at 25 degrees and you need a person to put on . 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.910
 Also 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:15.340
 I thought for a while that it would be haori in about 20 minutes, but I'm sure 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:19.790
 Would not Haora it went up to 15 degrees, but it is a bit during the day long 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:25.570
 The girls from Aso are just about the right 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:29.620
 There were a lot of people wearing a little coat 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:34.240
 Well then you said you went to the highest grade 25 degrees 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.950
 Yokohama 13.9 degrees Tokyo 23.4 degrees 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.130
 Moreover 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:44.219
 I so round I'm out in the middle of the night or this name at the time 30 minutes 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.539
 About 24 hours ago 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:54.780
 Come out in the daytime and it is getting higher and lower and it is about the same 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:02:01.880
 It is in the state of saying that it is leveling at the temperature of around 20 degrees 21 degrees 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.880
 I think I'm cold'm cold world specific skit I is cold 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.690
 Well I just never thought I wanted to wear a jacket 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.980
 During the day 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.319
 Let's go after all from thinking it 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.769
 I need a coat 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.769
 What 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:31.540
 Pretty magistrate main hall by people 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:34.620
 It is probably because the way you feel the temperature is different even at the same temperature 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.620
 I thought 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.930
 So for example 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.390
 Is it necessary to write that general condition? 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:52.040
 What to wear 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:58.990
 I have grinded is better thought as incorporating the over, for example, Overview as incorporating it 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:02.260
 Jacket that Tteyuu those in need at that temperature or rather meet it 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:08.500
 How long have you been ? 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.850
 Maybe some of you are thinking that you are looking for big care 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.569
 Pass through 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:20.090

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.960
 Even those who saw that did not see another person who saw Well 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:33.580

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:37.880

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:52.370
 It seems that Kyoto is going to change greatly as the situation so much 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:54.120
 Also annoying with the way of the You're gsf like msm is see you at all rain where there is a difference 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.299
 I will 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:05.390
 If you compare it then you can see it by all means 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:05.390
 It's good, but I have an eye on the East Asia when nsn is over 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.920
 It will be adopted if it is adopted It is rainy all day No, in a fabric that is about Mio 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:20.180
 It feels like it rains all the time 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.790
 Jeffrey Hey what about you or Namanka above, for example, 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.970
 Flight 500 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.600
 You can see the situation of hpa and such 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.330
 Suddenly 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:40.120
 There is a lot of rainfall 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:41.560
 There isn't so much like a reason, but the mouse passes, but I'm passing through 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.310
 lm 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.370
 Say, I wonder if 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.540
 It seems like it does not affect it 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.370
 I already little do you say that the north 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:05:04.860
 I though I think such wonder if 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:08.240
 It will be Abe that does not take care of msn 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:14.380
 Well there is Yamamomo properly 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.380
 I made it feel like, but what will happen 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.750
 it's difficult 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:26.840
 Under such a low pressure with sharp light comes and it will rain 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:32.660
 Toka dry air is going to sunny rear and Tsu word came in Te bc 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:39.100
 It is difficult to imagine that expression such as the weather when there is no such sharp 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.100
 It is quite difficult to think of a dislike 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.069
