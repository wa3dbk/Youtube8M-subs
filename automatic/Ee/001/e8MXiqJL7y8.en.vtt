00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.760
 Today, it is easy to make the Italian plum flavored minestrone with tomato juice 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.570
 I would like to 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.570
 Since I use a little at a time and what is left in the refrigerator is handy of ok 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.910
 Let's keep the pot warm over medium heat 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:27.830
 It is an onion that uses a little bit more soil 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:33.590
 Please cut all vegetables into 1 cm square today and put onions first 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.020
 I pull the reward well as I burn it a little as it is when I tangle it well 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.410
 To go 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:43.610
 I will burn a little bit more with a little more oil 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:48.920
 The onions gradually became sober that the sweet smell of the onions 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:54.350
 Please put not expose to you Yes cut the potatoes is 1 cm square Once And water 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.570
 If you do not expose to water, the whole text will remain, so this potato starch soup is thickened 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.290
 You go 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:05.100
 I'll give up until the potato corner is a bit transparent 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:10.500
 Following When you have a little clear running of the potatoes will put a celery 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:16.630
 Please firmly lick celery here too Corde lick well and celery-specific blue odor 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:22.439
 I also think that it is better to save one's well especially for those who are not good because this is also missed 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.439
 Let's put a cabbage here too if celery gold is colored a little bit brightly 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:30.100
 Of course you could use cabbage, but of course you can add Chinese cabbage and 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.760
 Please put in more and more mushrooms and things that remain in the house 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.390
 When various vegetables enter, sweetness doubles rapidly 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:42.190
 As soon as you put cabbage in, please put this in salt 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.860
 This also has the meaning of seasoning, but here extra salt is added to the cabbage. 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.920
 Is missing 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.770
 It will be easier If you put in the leaf vegetables First put in the salt 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.990
 This is the point 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.100
 It's about this time when I put the cabbage and give it up and it's too much- if there is a loss of thinness here 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 Granule consomme 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.730
 Add 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.730
 It is water 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:11.550
 Please boil for about 5 minutes in the low heat boils in this 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.760
 Yes I've been there for about 5 minutes and almost all vegetables are on fire 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.690
 Then it 's here tomato juice 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:24.180
 Usually I think that I can do with tomato cans, but it is faster to go with art originally 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.380
 It can be made with tomato juice today because it can be made with tomato juice without added salt today 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.440
 I made 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.200
 tomato juice 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.200
 Put and boil once for 10 minutes on low heat once boiling 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.950
 I tried to put tomato juice here 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:46.500
 Please last a lifetime and the taste changes depending on the amount of moisture 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.850
 I adjust the taste here If a child feels thin, I get some salt and it is a breakdown 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.800
 Let's get down a little 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.910
 Yes It is finished by this We have you serve and eat powdered cheese with your choice 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.590
 Please give me 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.370
 6 minutes 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.370
