00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.539
 Down the stairs hold us something

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.380
 in front of the little tree 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.360
 a few meters away are already 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.739
 the next 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.739

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.710
 race finds the second few mushrooms here 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:53.090
 in this tree on the map is the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.090
 Here are the first ones there we go 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.309
 the next few mushrooms are just one 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.449
 a few meters further and here are 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.539
 Let us now at this place 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.129
 here we run along the path over the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.790
 small clear those that one 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.250
 bit of fire is brightly lit. 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:16.290
 and find yourself at the direction exit 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.090
 on the left side after you're in 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.369
 large forest area down in the valley 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.960
 so arrived at this point 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.740
 Becomes Her lies to the left runs as 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.409
 moved to the back of this small row of trees 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.970
 There you will find the next mushrooms 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.140
 unfortunately I have this tree trunk god 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.670
 already taken without it 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.520
 but it's just where right now 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.600
 Here are the other little mushrooms 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.820
 return from there reindeer 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:49.420
 in the direction of the killed here stand here 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:54.070
 light then turns left and finds the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.750
 next mushrooms here in front of the water 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.170
 this spot on the map is this 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:08.770
 near the relic from here 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:13.000
 it goes on eastwards to this direction 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.500
 small rock outcrop to jump there 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.660
 the up and hold you a bit 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.430
 right here is at this point 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.760
 it was basically already over 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.760
 is 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.050
 but you see the next one up there 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.690
 mushroom since I could just to the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:32.140
 Rock ledge jumping in the mushroom 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.130
 take up the next mushroom you leave 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.370
 just from the platform 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.080
 falling down and running in the ground 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.590
 always taken here on the cards edge 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.650
 along the ruined building here 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.799
 past the second deer eaten and 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.320
 then find the mushroom here on the floor 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.329
 as I said on the cards edge to see 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.250
 inspect 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.250
 there is the mushroom number 7 for you 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.540
 after that crossed this little river 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:06.280
 and comes out at this point 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.829
 from there it goes straight on here 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.859
 past the tree in the small narrow 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:16.060
 walk here and there you will find the mushrooms 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:18.150
 right at the end right in front of you 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.889
 the card is here 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.840
 There if you get out of the gang name again 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.739
 out runs and runs right around the corner 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.760
 Do you come from there ? 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.169
 let you pull yourself up here on the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.000
 slightly higher platforms then run 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:41.790
 always right on the edge along the stairs 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.409
 high then it is a tip of the stairs 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.409
 and the last ones just jump over 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:52.090
 the railing down that way down there 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:53.919
 on the bridge under are the last 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.989
 mushrooms in front of the bridge on the right 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:59.019
 yes you could also say next to the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.760
 bridge actually has in place and 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.349
 then I see everything from there I hope 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.699
 could wish you a little help 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.060
 have a nice day x good until the 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.060
 next showdown
