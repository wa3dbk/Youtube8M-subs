where<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.269> standing<00:00:15.680> we<00:00:16.680> make<00:00:16.890> them<00:00:17.039> out<00:00:17.160> of

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
where I'm standing we make them out of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.680 
where I'm standing we make them out of
stainless<00:00:17.670> steel<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> couple<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.539> reasons

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
stainless steel for a couple of reasons

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.470 
stainless steel for a couple of reasons
firstly<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.859> corrosion<00:00:20.220> obviously<00:00:20.910> but

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
firstly for the corrosion obviously but

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.929 
firstly for the corrosion obviously but
also<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.990> help<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> accuracy<00:00:23.369> side<00:00:23.789> of

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
also to help with the accuracy side of

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.910 
also to help with the accuracy side of
things<00:00:24.119> because<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.930> means<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.289> don't<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.560> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
things because it means we don't have to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.460 
things because it means we don't have to
allow<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> coating<00:00:26.990> they<00:00:27.990> also<00:00:28.170> come

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
allow for a coating they also come

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.290 
allow for a coating they also come
supplied<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> safety<00:00:29.550> jaw<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.119> nice

this section here

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.110 
this section here
they've<00:03:11.650> got<00:03:11.770> three<00:03:12.040> sizes<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.670> dovetail

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
they've got three sizes of dovetail

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.470 
they've got three sizes of dovetail
there<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:14.530> then<00:03:14.680> move<00:03:14.920> on<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.880> G<00:03:16.180> jaw

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
there we then move on to the the G jaw

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.040 
there we then move on to the the G jaw
now<00:03:17.050> this<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.440> half<00:03:17.950> dovetail<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.870> got

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
now this is half dovetail and you got

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.050 
now this is half dovetail and you got
half<00:03:20.290> gripper<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.280> if<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.489> imagining

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
half gripper so if you imagining

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.759 
half gripper so if you imagining
yourself<00:03:22.150> doing<00:03:22.600> a<00:03:22.750> very<00:03:22.900> large<00:03:23.080> hollow<00:03:23.440> form

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
yourself doing a very large hollow form

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.280 
yourself doing a very large hollow form
you<00:03:23.920> need<00:03:24.070> maximum<00:03:24.670> grip<00:03:25.120> but<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.870> don't<00:03:26.019> mind

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
you need maximum grip but you don't mind

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.220 
you need maximum grip but you don't mind
about<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.769> teeth<00:03:27.730> marks<00:03:28.209> then<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.019> your

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
about the teeth marks then this is your

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.810 
about the teeth marks then this is your
year<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:29.620> surface<00:03:30.130> here<00:03:30.340> you'll<00:03:30.459> be<00:03:30.489> gripping

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
year of surface here you'll be gripping

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.560

got our three gripper sections of the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.540 
got our three gripper sections of the
very<00:04:02.410> inside<00:04:02.830> one<00:04:03.070> then<00:04:03.250> we've<00:04:03.370> got<00:04:03.459> an

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
very inside one then we've got an

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.490
