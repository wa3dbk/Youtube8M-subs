00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
felt like it tried me training all the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.220 
felt like it tried me training all the
players<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.039> wasn't<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.340> Colts<00:00:20.580> anymore<00:00:21.230> now

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
players it wasn't the Colts anymore now

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.830 
players it wasn't the Colts anymore now
here's<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> only<00:00:22.800> problem<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.840> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
here's the only problem with that the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.900 
here's the only problem with that the
only<00:00:25.080> way<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> codes<00:00:25.560> will<00:00:25.769> be<00:00:25.890> successful<00:00:26.250> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
only way the codes will be successful is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.620 
only way the codes will be successful is
if<00:00:26.970> they<00:00:27.449> start<00:00:27.779> rebuilding<00:00:28.080> their<00:00:28.380> team

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
if they start rebuilding their team

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.260 
if they start rebuilding their team
because<00:00:30.800> you<00:00:31.800> can't<00:00:32.040> rely<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.369> Peyton<00:00:33.000> Manning

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
because you can't rely on Peyton Manning

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.069 
because you can't rely on Peyton Manning
to<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.480> your<00:00:33.630> only<00:00:33.870> thing<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.309> entire

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
to be your only thing in the entire

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.619 
to be your only thing in the entire
season<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.710> realistic<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.180> you

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
season it's just not realistic so if you

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.780 
season it's just not realistic so if you
have<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> bunch<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.500> different<00:00:40.730> options<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
have a bunch of different options a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.910 
have a bunch of different options a
bunch<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.059> different<00:00:42.710> abilities<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.800> do

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
bunch of different abilities to do

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.190 
bunch of different abilities to do
things<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.550> you're<00:00:45.329> most<00:00:45.539> likely<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
things then you're most likely going to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.290 
things then you're most likely going to
be<00:00:46.320> able<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.739> rebuild<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.670> become<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> stronger

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
be able to rebuild and become a stronger

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.540 
be able to rebuild and become a stronger
team<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.870> makes<00:00:49.079> sense<00:00:49.219> like<00:00:50.219> Devin

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
team if that makes sense like Devin

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.330 
team if that makes sense like Devin
