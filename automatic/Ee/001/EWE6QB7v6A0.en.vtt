00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 in this cooking class I will show you how 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.170
 you make baked trout with almonds 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.480
 well-baked fish has a crispy 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.260
 crust on the outside and is tasty 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.260
 juicy on the inside 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.260
 before I start the trout 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.900
 first all other ingredients 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.150
 prepare so that I can later 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.670
 focus on frying the fish 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.960
 I start cutting parsley 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.960
 use 15 grams 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:40.470
 then I cut a lemon in half and 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.470
 extort half of it 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.570
 then I will roast mandele 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.280
 it's delicious under almonds 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.820
 comfort in advance because it gets 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.420
 so much more taste is also important to 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.580
 keep them moving because they 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.440
 they burned very nicely very quickly 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.130
 be golden brown 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.130
 well then we are almost there 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.149
 then I put them on a plate 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.319
 do not leave it in the pan because it will burn 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.580
 like some pan that is naturally hot 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:24.080
 and remains still a while we called 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.420
 we start with a trout 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.539
 you first have to pat it dry thoroughly with 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.539
 paper towel 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.060
 that is important because of the water 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.490
 the boats does grease and it also takes care of it 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.280
 for that the butter temperature in the pan 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.789
 immediately lowers then sprinkle them with 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.789
 pepper and salt 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.689
 do you know my taste 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.689
 you can always add low ones too 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.439
 for an extra crispy crust 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.810
 you can bread the fish that's it 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:13.370
 easiest with a little flour i do 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:15.819
 50 grams of flour on a plate and I put the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.819
 fisherman in 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.290
 so just worry that he completely with 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.739
 flour with a thin layer of flour 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.739
 is tact 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.319
 Shake excess flour as you wonder 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.550
 now we will mainly bake that we do 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.660
 in parts 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.660
 then 25 grams of butter 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.470
 preferably in a fish pan with 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.140
 non-stick coating he can also be one 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.780
 just use frying pan but fish pan 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.459
 has just what they are a nice size 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.380
 the butter is finished with bubbling then knows 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.600
 you know he's hot enough 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.720
 and then the fish can then also start 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.910
 to color a little light brown 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.270
 because now for good in it 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.410
 what do you two than they have four 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.410
 bake for up to five minutes 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.900
 to organize 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.680
 if no moisture becomes accessible then is 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.040
 the each other goes on carefully on and on 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.040
 bowls 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.760
 the cover them nicoline 5 through with sauce 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.049
 it is from what is 80 live pan you can 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:59.060
 very tasty sauce make some 25 grams 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:59.060
 butter in the pan and lemon juice 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.299
 also go well over the bottom with a spatula 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.299
 from the pan 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.690
 a lot of questions and then pour the sauce 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.690
 about this for all 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.460
 anna sprinkle the parsley on top 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.710
 and to complete this delicious dish 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.879
 to make 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.879
