 Hi, this is Sara, welcome back. 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.860
 Today, I'm going to show you guys an art using the flower by honeypot mixing nude gel. 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.680
 Let's see how the mixing nude gel gets used on the color. 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.860
 First we are going to put the honeypot base. 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.420
 You might cause lifting, so make sure the gel gets to the edge too and cure it 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.220
 After curing, we will use the flower by honeypot YE 01 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:21.560
 Use the flower by honeypot mixing nude gel spatula and mix it with the color on the pallet by 1: 1 ratio 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.320
 Use the square brush to scoop the mixed color and put it all on the nail. 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:38.760
 Do not stand up at this time and just do one coat / if you are running out of the color, scoop some more and do the rest of the coloring 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:46.940
 Make sure you slant the brush to smoothly put the color on and cover the free edge. Then cure it. 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:59.380
 Once you've finished curing, use the spatula to mix the color BL04 and the mixing nude gel to 1: 1 ratio on the pallet 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.300
 If you want more clear color, you can increase the amount of the color 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:18.260
 Use the square brush and coat about ¾ of the nail then cure it 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:29.380
 Use the brush after curing and coat about 2/4 of the nail 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.880
 If you need to fix the border color, put some cleanser on the brush, get rid of the moisture 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.560
 And then clear the border. Then cure it 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.980
 Use the square brush and coat ¼ of the nail and then cure it 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:54.900
 If you want more clear color, you can do two coats and then you can see the gradation of the colors 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:05.140
 Then put the flower by honeypot top. This will allow you to draw a smooth line! Then let's cure it 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:16.580
 Pour some flower by honeypot WHITE color on the pallet and draw two lines on your desired place by using the long line brush 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:33.280
 I am going to draw from the right side / use the long line brush to make the line drawing easier and finish the left side as well. 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.080
 Then cure it. 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:52.000
 As you are waiting for curing, pour the flower by honeypot RO 02 and the mixing nude gel in 1: 1 ratio on the pallet and mix once again. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:06.880
 With the square brush, put the color on in space between. Since the base color is more like a syrup color, the pink area will turn into purple 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:18.880
 Now we are going to draw another line with the WHITE color 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.120
 Finally put the flower by honeypot top gel and cure 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.280
 Now we are going to use the gel cleanser to clean the uncured gel and put the ribbon parts on 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.640
 Clean off the uncured gel well and put the parts glue on 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:50.320
 Then put the laced cutie ribbon parts (pink). Use the tweezer to adjust the parts and dry the glue 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.160
 Ta too! The syrup is a mixture of check and art. What do you think? Pretty? 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.920
 You can make different colors to syrup colors just by mixing nude gel 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.440
 Mixing nude gel is pretty cool! 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.220
 Now try to apply this to other different arts 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.400
 I'll see you guys next time! Bye!
