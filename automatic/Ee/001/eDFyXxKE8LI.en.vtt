00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
improve the circulation to his lower leg

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.080 
improve the circulation to his lower leg
in<00:02:02.509> this<00:02:02.630> foot<00:02:02.869> we<00:02:03.679> took<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.009> vein<00:02:04.310> from<00:02:04.820> this

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
in this foot we took a vein from this

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.959 
in this foot we took a vein from this
side<00:02:05.359> and<00:02:05.799> plugged<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:06.950> in<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.579> artery

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
side and plugged it in to the artery

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.389 
side and plugged it in to the artery
right<00:02:08.240> here<00:02:08.570> in<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.750> groin<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.350> then<00:02:10.100> plugged

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
right here in the groin and then plugged

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.550 
right here in the groin and then plugged
it<00:02:10.550> into<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.850> artery<00:02:11.330> down<00:02:11.780> here<00:02:12.110> below<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
it into the artery down here below the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.880 
it into the artery down here below the
knee

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
knee

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.640

so<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.730> blood<00:02:13.970> could<00:02:14.240> now<00:02:14.420> travel<00:02:14.990> through

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
so the blood could now travel through

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.699 
so the blood could now travel through
our<00:02:15.800> new<00:02:16.010> conduit<00:02:16.520> in<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.030> end<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.330> foot
