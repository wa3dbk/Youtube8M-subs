00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
any of my previous videos the reason we

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.920 
any of my previous videos the reason we
call<00:06:22.550> this<00:06:22.700> the<00:06:22.910> cell<00:06:23.120> is<00:06:23.300> because<00:06:23.600> there<00:06:23.780> are

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
call this the cell is because there are

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.900 
call this the cell is because there are
so<00:06:24.260> many<00:06:24.320> different<00:06:24.950> compartments<00:06:25.550> which

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
so many different compartments which

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.430 
so many different compartments which
will<00:06:26.090> make<00:06:26.210> it<00:06:26.330> extremely<00:06:26.810> hard<00:06:27.020> for<00:06:27.230> any

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
will make it extremely hard for any

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.080 
will make it extremely hard for any
attacking<00:06:28.010> force<00:06:28.220> to<00:06:28.370> get<00:06:28.490> right<00:06:28.790> in<00:06:28.940> there

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
attacking force to get right in there

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.940 
attacking force to get right in there
towards<00:06:29.450> a<00:06:29.540> tunnel<00:06:29.900> now<00:06:30.260> obviously<00:06:30.620> if<00:06:30.830> they
