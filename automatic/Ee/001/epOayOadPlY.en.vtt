00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.350
 continuous attention because now came the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.740
 time to present them area of ​​asia 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.740
 linear 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:24.640
 or not 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.970
 I dont know 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.550
 I think we have many reasons 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.589
 why celebrate today 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.510
 it only went very well on the island but 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.519
 we are also sharing the stage 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.059
 unimaginable for maya mam here of 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.890
 anthill 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.229
 apart from everything to others that we should 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.570
 call the customer in addition with his 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.530
 birthday when on August 14 a 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.530
 applause for ricky 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.510
 and now 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 yes 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 I'm not fried between you and Angol 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.250
 how he delivered the one that was going to be the little ball 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.970
 and a half for that reason never 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.480
 what would this do if I am 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.480
 hungry 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.370
 all this starts to come out exactly because 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.440
 we cut the cake into triangles someone 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.450
 you know that they taught us that way but why 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.670
 It is a millenary tradition of 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.160
 grandmothers who are we for 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.630
 change but it does not work I'm going to 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.400
 explain why why if we can 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.590
 eat our house easy and it's very 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.990
 cute everything you want but if not 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.119
 you finish the cake today at the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.630
 you keep in the gift and what happens the day 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.730
 next to blacks exactly this is 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.689
 as if it's your dream to reopen, they do not 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.870
 also 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:23.670
 one has the exact religiosity 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.280
 so if you want to eat the second 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.290
 you dance what if you go for it you go to 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.030
 eat be happy this side is going to 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.249
 be rich but this side be dry and 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.889
 of course then I'm going to show you a 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:38.760
 new way to cut the cake that is 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:42.000
 much more efficient to see to avoid it 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.459
 burned again I have to admit that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.450
 this is not a new technique with the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:52.049
 cake I called a real cake between 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.389
 the British scientist that we are 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:03:02.969
 francis galton in 1906 so it's not 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:04.430
 way that 60 was invented the way 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.950
 of cut 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.330
 we'll see 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.330
 a slice 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.280
 How are you going to do 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.860
 we make a slice let's suppose of 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:30.110
 this year 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.110
 I ask from the middle I too 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.579
 I prefer a lie 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:44.700
 then we are going to separate the cake and 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.640
 look delicious because we are here another 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.290
 stone I say this 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:56.150
 Now it goes to slice 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.150
 we almost do not like sugar 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.260
 we take out the slice 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.770
 let's put here there are many guests 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.350
 we all cut these pieces of pantel 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.180
 as we want but not on this long 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.090
 how are we going to save the only thing that 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:25.370
 we have to do in the colossus to look at it 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:25.370
 balerma audition for people who do not 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:35.530
 and bigger there is no mathematician who 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.840
 help me then what to do what 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.370
 we have to do is put the halves together 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.370
 that remain of the cake 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.680
 with a hoop league because if not the 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.449
 we can keep really catchy for 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.060
 that does not dry out as we get together with 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.659
 a league to add like that and it's going to cut 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.659
 to the half 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.130
 and then you have to eat it again 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.300
 and you are going to make a cut perpendicular to 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.300
 that you had done the day before 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.880
 let's go here exactly is going to break the 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.880
 league 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:31.300
 who takes things and we cut another 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.090
 slice of the cake and we're always going to 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.870
 to save the pie without 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.870
 I want to join 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.719
 Now that tells us a remedy 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.699
 practical to finish the cake 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.699
 reserve legal medicine 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.389
 so
