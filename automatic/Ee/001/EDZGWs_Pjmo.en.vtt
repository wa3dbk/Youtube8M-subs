for<00:01:15.270> hardcore<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.440> nice<00:01:16.680> snug<00:01:17.040> fit<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.700> nice

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
for hardcore as a nice snug fit is nice

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.140 
for hardcore as a nice snug fit is nice
and<00:01:18.479> light<00:01:19.310> it's<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.550> think<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.820> made<00:01:21.000> from

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and light it's I think it's made from

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.840 
and light it's I think it's made from
PVC<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.890> seems<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.190> have<00:01:23.460> some<00:01:23.700> sort

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
PVC here but it seems to have some sort

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.150 
PVC here but it seems to have some sort
of<00:01:23.910> breathability<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.290> think<00:01:25.440> even<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
of breathability so I think even if you

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.969 
of breathability so I think even if you
wear<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.610> longer<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.420> should<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.660> a<00:01:27.979> nice

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
wear it for longer it should be a nice

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.100 
wear it for longer it should be a nice
shoe<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.400> terms<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.119> air<00:01:30.420> circulation

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
shoe in terms of the air circulation
