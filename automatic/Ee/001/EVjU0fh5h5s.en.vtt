there's<00:03:02.019> three<00:03:02.200> little<00:03:02.409> pins<00:03:04.530> inside<00:03:05.530> of

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
there's three little pins inside of

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.379 
there's three little pins inside of
there<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:07.090> here's<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.870> connector<00:03:08.319> itself

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.149 

the<00:03:13.389> first<00:03:13.569> thing<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.930> saw<00:03:14.169> it<00:03:14.409> was<00:03:14.560> corroded

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
the first thing you saw it was corroded

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.899 
the first thing you saw it was corroded
I<00:03:15.310> had<00:03:15.669> green<00:03:16.060> film<00:03:16.419> over<00:03:16.719> it<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.650> so<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.370> looked

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
I had green film over it and so I looked

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.500 
I had green film over it and so I looked
at<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.180> honesty<00:03:19.959> no<00:03:20.019> green<00:03:20.349> film<00:03:20.709> however<00:03:21.510> in

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
at this honesty no green film however in

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.270 
at this honesty no green film however in
the<00:03:22.629> second<00:03:23.049> part<00:03:23.260> he<00:03:23.349> did<00:03:23.530> mention<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:24.099> when

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
the second part he did mention that when

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.229 
the second part he did mention that when
he<00:03:24.689> noticed<00:03:25.689> they<00:03:25.870> did<00:03:26.169> the<00:03:26.290> inspection<00:03:26.439> on<00:03:26.889> it

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
he noticed they did the inspection on it

the wires are mean the connecting is

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:34.289 
the wires are mean the connecting is
very<00:03:30.459> loose<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:32.099> any<00:03:33.099> kind<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.489> condensation

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299

Texas<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:43.090> know<00:03:43.209> this<00:03:43.389> look<00:03:43.510> how<00:03:43.629> jumpy<00:03:43.959> that

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
Texas you know this look how jumpy that

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.199 
Texas you know this look how jumpy that
is<00:03:44.469> I<00:03:44.769> mean<00:03:45.189> that<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:47.620> this<00:03:48.219> seems<00:03:48.730> pretty

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
is I mean that is this seems pretty

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.619 
is I mean that is this seems pretty
loose<00:03:49.540> not<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> tight<00:03:50.590> fit<00:03:50.889> what<00:03:51.549> he<00:03:51.699> did<00:03:51.970> was<00:03:52.269> he

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
loose not a tight fit what he did was he

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.530 
loose not a tight fit what he did was he
took<00:03:53.109> this<00:03:53.409> connector<00:03:54.400> apart<00:03:54.759> and<00:03:55.060> he<00:03:55.359> took

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
took this connector apart and he took

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.020 
took this connector apart and he took
these<00:03:55.780> wires<00:03:58.139> supposed<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.229> have<00:03:59.349> a<00:03:59.379> black

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
these wires supposed to have a black

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.969 
these wires supposed to have a black
yellow<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.479> white<00:04:01.750> wire<00:04:02.019> but<00:04:02.319> obviously

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
yellow and white wire but obviously

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.559 
yellow and white wire but obviously
these<00:04:03.189> are<00:04:03.370> not<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.639> colors<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.090> have<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.269> red

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
these are not the colors I have a red

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.990 
these are not the colors I have a red
light<00:04:05.849> orange<00:04:06.849> black<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.509> a<00:04:07.689> solid<00:04:08.319> yellow<00:04:09.000> so

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
light orange black and a solid yellow so

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.849 
light orange black and a solid yellow so
that's<00:04:10.900> pretty<00:04:11.109> much<00:04:11.199> the<00:04:11.379> same<00:04:11.650> concept

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
that's pretty much the same concept

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.199 
that's pretty much the same concept
they're<00:04:12.340> in<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.489> same<00:04:12.639> location<00:04:13.239> but<00:04:13.269> um<00:04:13.859> he

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
they're in the same location but um he

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.240 
they're in the same location but um he
he<00:04:16.209> took<00:04:16.389> these<00:04:16.630> connector<00:04:17.620> apart<00:04:17.949> and<00:04:18.159> he

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
he took these connector apart and he

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.580 
he took these connector apart and he
soldered<00:04:18.699> it<00:04:18.849> straight<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.599> three<00:04:20.320> little

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
soldered it straight to the three little

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.439 
soldered it straight to the three little
pins<00:04:20.799> in<00:04:20.949> there<00:04:21.099> and<00:04:21.310> he<00:04:21.970> hasn't<00:04:22.120> had<00:04:22.419> a

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
pins in there and he hasn't had a

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.650 
pins in there and he hasn't had a
problem<00:04:22.509> since

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
problem since

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.600 
problem since
I<00:04:24.690> don't<00:04:25.110> see<00:04:25.259> no<00:04:25.410> corrosion<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.009> don't<00:04:26.250> see<00:04:26.430> any

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
I don't see no corrosion I don't see any

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.100 
I don't see no corrosion I don't see any
loose<00:04:26.790> wires<00:04:26.910> other<00:04:27.360> than<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.660> connector

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
loose wires other than the connector

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.620 
loose wires other than the connector
itself<00:04:28.560> being<00:04:29.550> loose<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:30.060> what<00:04:30.240> I'm<00:04:30.419> going<00:04:30.600> to

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
itself being loose so what I'm going to

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.340 
itself being loose so what I'm going to
do<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.080> I'm<00:04:31.410> going<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.620> try<00:04:32.840> wedging<00:04:33.840> something

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
do is I'm going to try wedging something

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.659 
do is I'm going to try wedging something
in<00:04:34.470> there<00:04:34.740> that<00:04:35.669> way<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:36.030> appends<00:04:36.479> to<00:04:36.630> be<00:04:36.810> solid

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
in there that way it appends to be solid

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.890 
in there that way it appends to be solid
because<00:04:38.669> sometimes<00:04:39.180> when<00:04:39.360> I'm<00:04:39.449> driving<00:04:39.690> down

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
because sometimes when I'm driving down

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.969 
because sometimes when I'm driving down
the<00:04:40.050> road<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.259> security<00:04:40.979> light<00:04:41.160> comes<00:04:41.850> on<00:04:42.120> and

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
the road the security light comes on and

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.460 
the road the security light comes on and
some<00:04:43.979> more<00:04:44.190> research<00:04:44.660> indicated<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:46.910> the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
some more research indicated that the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.600 
some more research indicated that the
one<00:04:49.470> of<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.650> wires<00:04:49.889> I<00:04:50.039> believe<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.490> this

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
one of the wires I believe is this

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.110 
one of the wires I believe is this
yellow<00:04:50.880> one<00:04:51.410> it's<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.680> constant<00:04:53.430> 5<00:04:53.639> volts<00:04:54.090> going

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
yellow one it's a constant 5 volts going

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.620 
yellow one it's a constant 5 volts going
to<00:04:54.539> it<00:04:54.660> cause<00:04:54.810> that's<00:04:54.930> when<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.910> PCM<00:04:57.360> takes

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
to it cause that's when the PCM takes

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.710 
to it cause that's when the PCM takes
over<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:59.100> controls<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.030> ignition<00:05:00.479> and<00:05:00.600> all

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
over and controls the ignition and all

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.360 
over and controls the ignition and all
that<00:05:00.900> good<00:05:01.110> jazz<00:05:01.139> but<00:05:03.530> I'm<00:05:04.530> assuming<00:05:05.070> that

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
that good jazz but I'm assuming that

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.279 
that good jazz but I'm assuming that
when<00:05:05.490> this<00:05:05.639> wire<00:05:05.820> comes<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.870> know<00:05:06.960> start

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
when this wire comes you know start

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.110 
when this wire comes you know start
shaking<00:05:07.680> around<00:05:07.979> as<00:05:08.190> much<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.639> mean<00:05:08.789> look<00:05:09.030> at

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
shaking around as much I mean look at

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.810 
shaking around as much I mean look at
the<00:05:09.240> pre-play<00:05:09.690> in<00:05:09.750> there<00:05:09.990> good<00:05:10.169> lord<00:05:10.669> but<00:05:11.669> when

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
the pre-play in there good lord but when

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.260 
the pre-play in there good lord but when
you<00:05:13.280> wiggling<00:05:14.280> around<00:05:14.430> like<00:05:14.789> that<00:05:14.940> I'm<00:05:15.060> pretty

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
you wiggling around like that I'm pretty

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.060 
you wiggling around like that I'm pretty
sure<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.630> voltage<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.169> air<00:05:16.289> will<00:05:16.410> drop<00:05:16.770> or

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
sure the voltage and air will drop or

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.750 
sure the voltage and air will drop or
increase<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:18.210> they'll<00:05:18.750> throw<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.760> indicator

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
increase and they'll throw the indicator

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.020 
increase and they'll throw the indicator
light<00:05:21.000> on<00:05:21.180> here<00:05:21.539> seeing<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.020> hey<00:05:22.880> we<00:05:23.880> have<00:05:23.970> a

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
light on here seeing that hey we have a

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.420 
light on here seeing that hey we have a
problem<00:05:24.120> here<00:05:24.599> so<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:25.229> don't<00:05:26.009> think<00:05:26.220> nothing's

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
problem here so I don't think nothing's

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.670 
problem here so I don't think nothing's
wrong<00:05:26.699> the<00:05:26.849> sensor<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.720> don't<00:05:28.380> think<00:05:28.530> nothing's

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
wrong the sensor I don't think nothing's

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.890 
wrong the sensor I don't think nothing's
wrong<00:05:29.000> as<00:05:30.000> far<00:05:30.060> as<00:05:30.419> the<00:05:31.130> PCL<00:05:32.130> or<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.400> DCM<00:05:32.940> but

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
wrong as far as the PCL or the DCM but

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.450 
wrong as far as the PCL or the DCM but
this<00:05:34.050> bad<00:05:34.470> boys<00:05:34.680> got<00:05:36.800> two<00:05:37.800> hundred<00:05:38.070> forty<00:05:38.310> four

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
this bad boys got two hundred forty four

thousand seven hundred sixty miles on it

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.860 
thousand seven hundred sixty miles on it
I<00:05:41.370> bought<00:05:41.760> it<00:05:41.880> when<00:05:41.970> they<00:05:42.090> only<00:05:42.210> had<00:05:42.449> sixty

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
I bought it when they only had sixty

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.149 
I bought it when they only had sixty
thousand<00:05:43.260> miles<00:05:43.409> so<00:05:43.650> I<00:05:43.680> did<00:05:43.949> a<00:05:43.979> lot<00:05:44.099> of

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
thousand miles so I did a lot of

traveling it's all highway miles by the

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.860 
traveling it's all highway miles by the
way<00:05:48.199> as<00:05:49.199> you<00:05:49.349> can<00:05:49.470> see<00:05:49.650> it's<00:05:49.800> kind<00:05:49.979> of<00:05:50.039> dirty

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
way as you can see it's kind of dirty

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
problem there's and fix itself so I'm

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.980 
problem there's and fix itself so I'm
gonna<00:06:01.650> try<00:06:01.860> wedging<00:06:02.370> something<00:06:02.760> in<00:06:02.880> here<00:06:03.240> and

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
gonna try wedging something in here and

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.260 
gonna try wedging something in here and
see<00:06:04.710> if<00:06:04.830> that'll<00:06:05.039> fix<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.520> problem<00:06:05.940> if<00:06:06.030> not

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
see if that'll fix the problem if not

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.129 
see if that'll fix the problem if not
then<00:06:06.690> I<00:06:06.960> will<00:06:07.139> go<00:06:07.320> ahead<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:08.930> separate<00:06:09.930> this

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
then I will go ahead and separate this

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.800 
then I will go ahead and separate this
housing<00:06:10.710> expose<00:06:11.639> these<00:06:11.880> three<00:06:12.150> wires<00:06:12.360> and

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
housing expose these three wires and

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:19.700 
housing expose these three wires and
actually<00:06:13.380> solder<00:06:13.710> it<00:06:16.699> it's<00:06:17.699> my<00:06:17.820> phone<00:06:18.470> but<00:06:19.470> um

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
actually solder it it's my phone but um

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.620 
actually solder it it's my phone but um
I'm<00:06:20.099> gonna<00:06:20.250> go<00:06:20.370> ahead<00:06:20.490> and<00:06:20.909> try<00:06:21.240> that<00:06:21.419> first

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
I'm gonna go ahead and try that first

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.060 
I'm gonna go ahead and try that first
and<00:06:21.870> if<00:06:21.990> that<00:06:22.110> doesn't<00:06:22.409> fix<00:06:22.530> the<00:06:22.650> problem<00:06:22.710> I'm

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
and if that doesn't fix the problem I'm

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.469 
and if that doesn't fix the problem I'm
gonna<00:06:23.159> go<00:06:23.430> ahead<00:06:23.550> and<00:06:23.760> remove<00:06:24.030> these<00:06:24.210> three

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
gonna go ahead and remove these three

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.430 
gonna go ahead and remove these three
wires<00:06:24.690> and<00:06:26.419> stick<00:06:27.419> them<00:06:27.599> inside<00:06:27.780> the<00:06:28.169> pins

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
wires and stick them inside the pins

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.260 
wires and stick them inside the pins
themselves<00:06:29.220> and<00:06:29.400> actually<00:06:29.849> throw<00:06:30.060> some

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
themselves and actually throw some

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.659 
themselves and actually throw some
solder<00:06:30.539> in<00:06:30.780> there<00:06:30.960> which<00:06:31.770> will<00:06:31.800> be<00:06:31.949> looks<00:06:32.520> like

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
solder in there which will be looks like

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.149 
solder in there which will be looks like
it's<00:06:32.789> gonna<00:06:32.880> be<00:06:33.029> a<00:06:33.060> tedious<00:06:33.479> job<00:06:33.599> I<00:06:34.289> will<00:06:35.039> have

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 
it's gonna be a tedious job I will have

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:40.279 
it's gonna be a tedious job I will have
to<00:06:35.250> take<00:06:35.460> the<00:06:35.639> entire<00:06:37.550> ignition<00:06:39.139> housing<00:06:40.139> off

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
to take the entire ignition housing off

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.200 
to take the entire ignition housing off
because<00:06:40.740> it's<00:06:40.889> one<00:06:41.099> unit<00:06:41.340> this<00:06:41.669> whole<00:06:41.940> great

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
because it's one unit this whole great

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.990 
because it's one unit this whole great
unit<00:06:42.570> goes<00:06:42.750> down<00:06:43.020> there<00:06:43.409> and<00:06:44.279> I<00:06:44.760> don't<00:06:44.820> believe

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
unit goes down there and I don't believe

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.310 
unit goes down there and I don't believe
you<00:06:45.240> have<00:06:45.300> to<00:06:45.360> remove<00:06:45.630> the<00:06:45.779> steering<00:06:46.080> wheel<00:06:46.200> to

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
you have to remove the steering wheel to

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.629 
you have to remove the steering wheel to
get<00:06:46.440> to<00:06:46.650> it<00:06:46.800> but<00:06:49.039> I'm<00:06:50.039> not<00:06:50.159> going<00:06:50.279> to<00:06:50.340> go<00:06:50.490> that

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
get to it but I'm not going to go that

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:55.370 
get to it but I'm not going to go that
far<00:06:50.820> yet<00:06:51.150> so<00:06:51.630> I<00:06:52.139> will<00:06:52.469> keep<00:06:52.680> you<00:06:52.740> posted<00:06:53.400> on<00:06:54.380> you

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
know the progress after I finished

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.189 
know the progress after I finished
wetting<00:06:57.389> something<00:06:57.750> in<00:06:57.870> there

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.839 

so<00:07:01.830> hopefully<00:07:02.279> that<00:07:02.639> will<00:07:02.759> fix<00:07:03.029> my<00:07:03.650> vats

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:04.849 
so hopefully that will fix my vats

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.890 
so hopefully that will fix my vats
acting<00:07:05.849> a<00:07:05.969> darn<00:07:06.479> fool<00:07:07.279> also<00:07:08.279> I<00:07:08.310> had<00:07:08.520> a

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
acting a darn fool also I had a

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.279 
acting a darn fool also I had a
aftermarket<00:07:10.789> auto<00:07:11.789> start<00:07:12.240> arm<00:07:12.569> pit<00:07:12.990> in<00:07:13.139> there

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289 
aftermarket auto start arm pit in there

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:14.050 
aftermarket auto start arm pit in there
and

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
and

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.710 
and
it<00:07:14.540> went<00:07:14.810> to<00:07:14.990> a<00:07:15.380> so<00:07:15.890> I<00:07:16.630> checked<00:07:17.630> the

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 
it went to a so I checked the
