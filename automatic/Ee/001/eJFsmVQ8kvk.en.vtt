00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello friends themselves pasha trailer and here 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.150
 I already have this part installed 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.920
 about 11 pasture depth of 5 millimeters and this 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.289
 not the end now will still continue on 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.420
 processing here I want to say that this 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:26.640
 titanium part here is titanium titanium 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.710
 processed this has specific 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.649
 properties and processed a little by 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.020
 other than steel being processed 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.590
 Generally there is still a good idea of the processed 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.300
 my own experience I can say that 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.050
 in fact the problem per se is not 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.879
 exists with titanium the only thing he 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.610
 slices slowly processed this yes 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:57.780
 because you have to slow down 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:00.149
 cutting here and at the same time it is possible 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.980
 deep enough guys now i will 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.619
 cut 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:11.249
 5 millimeters deep groove that's well out there on the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:18.289
 the manual course I will keep the momentum 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:21.029
 it means I have 315 turns for the diameter 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.569
 12 millimeters but it looks like he 

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:23.569
 really 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 but 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.840
 something 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.060
 but 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.549
 Here's pierced 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:52.079
 what can i say titan loves sharp 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.010
 tool freeze it should be like 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.599
 it's sharp 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.790
 what if a little bit stupid or stupid 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.689
 the tool that read will not cut 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.329
 quite simply 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:10.680
 here it is such a whim titan and yes 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.840
 Basically, if a sharp instrument is 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.659
 stand and cut pretty all 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.180
 ok what problem might be with 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:23.900
 titanium there is such a thing as 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.849
 titanium crust it is formed after 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.959
 cutting and after oxygen cutting after 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.290
 plasma cutting 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.150
 Here I have a thermal so 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.620
 say processing and 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.950
 and titanium was in contact with air in this 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.979
 place formed titanium crust which 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.629
 very badly handled it better here 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:48.930
 take off abrasive somehow 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.370
 my tool emery there more than anything 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.449
 anything but not 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.840
 not by cutting not by Ryazan but by 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:59.400
 the rest of the titanium works just 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.290
 Wonderful, look at me 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.949
 put 315 turns on the manual course 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:13.430
 so I did it and the diameter of the cutter 12 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:16.729
 millimeters high speed steel r6 m5 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.190
 less often for a sweet soul thanks for your attention with 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.389
 you was pashkin fraser continued 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.389
 It is goodbye
