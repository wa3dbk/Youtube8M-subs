be a different sit and it's free to the
children<00:00:32.270> to<00:00:33.200> build<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:33.770> this<00:00:34.730> one<00:00:35.000> is<00:00:35.860> the

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
children to build and this one is the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.170 
children to build and this one is the
micro<00:00:39.520> manager<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:41.230> set<00:00:42.230> for<00:00:42.579> 0095<00:00:43.579> comes<00:00:44.030> in

micro manager and set for 0095 comes in
a<00:00:44.240> polybag<00:00:44.600> with<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.200> instruction<00:00:46.329> this<00:00:47.329> is

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
a polybag with the instruction this is

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.360 
a polybag with the instruction this is
what<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.810> poly<00:00:47.989> bag<00:00:48.230> looks<00:00:48.530> like<00:00:48.710> it's<00:00:49.100> plain

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
what the poly bag looks like it's plain

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.490 
what the poly bag looks like it's plain
jane<00:00:49.760> because<00:00:50.060> it's<00:00:50.210> not<00:00:50.360> for<00:00:50.600> resale<00:00:50.960> usually

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
jane because it's not for resale usually

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.940 
jane because it's not for resale usually
and<00:00:52.060> so<00:00:53.060> is<00:00:54.050> they're<00:00:54.230> able<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.470> make<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.860> the

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
and so is they're able to make it to the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.950 
and so is they're able to make it to the
store<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.489> you're<00:00:55.850> one<00:00:56.000> of<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.180> first<00:00:56.360> thing

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
store and you're one of the first thing

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.229 
store and you're one of the first thing
I<00:00:57.050> think<00:00:57.110> it's<00:00:57.350> 250<00:00:57.980> people<00:00:58.310> you<00:00:58.460> can<00:00:58.610> you<00:00:59.090> can

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
I think it's 250 people you can you can

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.270 
I think it's 250 people you can you can
get<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.540> but<00:00:59.660> I<00:00:59.690> can<00:00:59.780> never<00:01:00.020> go<00:01:00.290> on<00:01:00.320> Tuesday

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
get it but I can never go on Tuesday

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.520 
get it but I can never go on Tuesday
anyway<00:01:02.210> I<00:01:02.239> was<00:01:02.390> able<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.660> acquire<00:01:02.780> one<00:01:03.050> on<00:01:03.290> ebay

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
anyway I was able to acquire one on ebay

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.709 
anyway I was able to acquire one on ebay
in<00:01:04.040> case<00:01:04.250> you're<00:01:04.430> asking<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.089> now<00:01:05.600> we're

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
in case you're asking and now we're

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:11.649 
in case you're asking and now we're
going<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:05.899> build<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:10.299> something<00:01:11.299> like<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:11.479> is

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
going to build it something like this is

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.859 
going to build it something like this is
probably<00:01:12.109> worth<00:01:12.560> more<00:01:12.590> sealed<00:01:13.630> than<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.749> is

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
probably worth more sealed than it is

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.129 
probably worth more sealed than it is
out<00:01:15.079> of<00:01:15.109> the<00:01:15.289> bag<00:01:15.469> because<00:01:16.749> it's<00:01:17.749> usually<00:01:17.899> just
