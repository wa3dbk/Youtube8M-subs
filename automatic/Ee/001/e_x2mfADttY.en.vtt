00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.280
 but you need hot warm its principle 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.100

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.610
 sprinkle with cheese 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:06.170
 if I advise without cheese too 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.170
 not necessarily that i just 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:16.370
 his grandfather's syrup will pritrushu for beauty 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.780
 The day the property of the tree was aggression from me 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.060
 frozen parsley 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.000
 You can add garlic but I don't 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.030
 add garlic mince there see how 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.220
 we like to become and now we wrap up 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.220
 as usual take nothing complicated 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.870
 so here so principle who does not sit on 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.630
 Dyukana's diet here when you roll bake 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:49.040
 you can add flour a little bit and you can 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:58.310
 add your ral mayonnaise so now 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:03:06.319
 we take the park here it is all from candy 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:08.930
 and again I think about 20 30 minutes like 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.370
 see you in your oven before the roll 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.010
 deliver out of the oven 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.390
 it is better to not deploy at all 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.920
 preferably that night put 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.069
 the refrigerator here in olga 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.560
 so that all the juice absorbed the ball certainly not 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.560
 very cold but can not wait to cut 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.500
 It is cut very well, that is, it keeps 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.310
 form 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.310

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.970
