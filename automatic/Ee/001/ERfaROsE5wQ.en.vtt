using the hair tie this tutorial is so
simple<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.340> very<00:00:35.610> similar<00:00:36.270> actually<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:37.500> my

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
simple it's very similar actually to my

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.240 
simple it's very similar actually to my
twisted<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:38.940> elegant<00:00:39.469> bun<00:00:40.469> tutorial<00:00:41.070> which

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
twisted my elegant bun tutorial which

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.380 
twisted my elegant bun tutorial which
I'll<00:00:41.430> link<00:00:41.610> below<00:00:41.730> oh<00:00:43.250> it's<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> same<00:00:44.610> concept

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
I'll link below oh it's the same concept

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.930 
I'll link below oh it's the same concept
as<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:49.010> as<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.280> see<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
as that and as you can see this is a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.549 
as that and as you can see this is a
hairstyle<00:00:51.449> all<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.750> itself<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.410> looks

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
hairstyle all in itself I think it looks

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.889 
hairstyle all in itself I think it looks
funky<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.100> kind<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.340> cool<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.390> I'm<00:00:54.690> just

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
funky and kind of cool so I'm just

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
funky and kind of cool so I'm just
taking<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> section<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.949> instead<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.219> two

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
taking a section and instead of two

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549 
taking a section and instead of two
strand<00:00:56.969> twisting<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.809> taking<00:00:58.379> them

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
strand twisting it I'm just taking them

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.099 
strand twisting it I'm just taking them
and<00:00:58.800> twisting<00:00:59.430> them<00:00:59.640> kind<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.629> rolling<00:01:00.870> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and twisting them kind of rolling it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.779 
and twisting them kind of rolling it
onto<00:01:01.410> itself<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.920> way<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.309> pinning<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
onto itself in a way and pinning it

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.060 
onto itself in a way and pinning it
backwards<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.809> then<00:01:04.409> you'll<00:01:04.619> start<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> see

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
backwards and then you'll start to see

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.359 
backwards and then you'll start to see
the<00:01:05.250> pattern<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.510> go<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.590> start<00:01:07.860> off<00:01:08.100> with

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the pattern as I go and I start off with

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.890 
the pattern as I go and I start off with
bobby<00:01:08.610> pins<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.450> feel<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.659> they're

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
bobby pins because I feel like they're

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.810 
bobby pins because I feel like they're
more<00:01:10.110> secure<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.650> know<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.920> say<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.430> lot<00:01:11.790> but

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
more secure I know I say that a lot but

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.270 
more secure I know I say that a lot but
my<00:01:12.090> hair<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.420> very<00:01:12.450> thick<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.260> bobby<00:01:13.920> pins

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
my hair is very thick and bobby pins

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.130 
my hair is very thick and bobby pins
just<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.030> give<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.299> hold<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.110> I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
just kind of give that hold that I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
just kind of give that hold that I
really<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> always<00:01:17.640> start<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:17.970> bobby

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
really like so I always start with bobby

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
really like so I always start with bobby
pins<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.049> later<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.500> I'll<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:20.070> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
pins and then later on I'll kind of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.749 
pins and then later on I'll kind of
finish<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:21.119> free<00:01:21.780> pins<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.400> as<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.610> can

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
finish up with free pins and as you can

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.609 
finish up with free pins and as you can
see<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:25.439> bun<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.070> turning<00:01:26.520> out<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:27.619> exactly

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
see the bun is turning out not exactly

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.359 
see the bun is turning out not exactly
as<00:01:28.950> neat<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:29.640> I'd<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.740> but<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.100> kind<00:01:32.310> of

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
as neat as I'd like but this is kind of

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
as neat as I'd like but this is kind of
the<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.970> basics<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:34.229> hair<00:01:34.409> might<00:01:34.590> be

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the the basics of it your hair might be

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.300 
the the basics of it your hair might be
fine

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
fine

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.039 
fine
this<00:01:35.520> way<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> had<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:36.509> fixing

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
this way but I had to do a little fixing

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.170 
this way but I had to do a little fixing
so<00:01:37.619> any<00:01:37.979> pieces<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.549> are<00:01:38.670> still<00:01:38.850> sticking

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
so any pieces that are still sticking

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.200 
so any pieces that are still sticking
out<00:01:39.710> you'll<00:01:40.710> take<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> straight<00:01:41.610> pins<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
out you'll take the straight pins and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.690 
out you'll take the straight pins and
you'll<00:01:42.600> pin<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.409> I'm<00:01:43.740> doing<00:01:44.130> here

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you'll pin it like I'm doing here

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.880 
you'll pin it like I'm doing here
umm<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.149> kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.450> want<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.899> take<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> pin<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
umm you kind of want to take the pin and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.130 
umm you kind of want to take the pin and
do<00:01:47.340> kind<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.700> backwards<00:01:48.240> pin<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:48.810> flip

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
do kind of a backwards pin and then flip

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.120 
do kind of a backwards pin and then flip
it<00:01:49.259> around<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:51.290> kind<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.350> pin<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.979> way

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it around and kind of pin it in that way

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.830 
it around and kind of pin it in that way
it's<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.549> hard<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.939> explain<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.659> can

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
it's really hard to explain but you can

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.260 
it's really hard to explain but you can
see<00:01:55.110> I'm<00:01:55.290> kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.619> going<00:01:56.549> down<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> pin

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
see I'm kind of going down with the pin
