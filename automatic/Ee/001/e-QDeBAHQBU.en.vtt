you will be very impressed by this

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.150 
you will be very impressed by this
because<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.369> our<00:00:17.699> brand<00:00:18.000> new<00:00:18.230> p51<00:00:19.230> 3d<00:00:19.650> EPP

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
because this is our brand new p51 3d EPP

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.590 
because this is our brand new p51 3d EPP
model<00:00:21.800> and<00:00:22.800> now<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.920> say<00:00:23.160> scale<00:00:23.519> fans<00:00:23.820> it's

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
model and now I say scale fans it's

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.089 
model and now I say scale fans it's
those<00:00:24.750> people<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.260> want<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.830> guess<00:00:25.980> it

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
those people if you want and I guess it

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.460 
those people if you want and I guess it
does<00:00:26.250> look<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> p-51<00:00:26.930> in<00:00:27.930> profile<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
does look like a p-51 in profile and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.620 
does look like a p-51 in profile and
that<00:00:28.710> makes<00:00:29.580> sense<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> profile

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
that makes sense because it is a profile

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.900 
that makes sense because it is a profile
model<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.560> really<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.279> not<00:00:32.340> about<00:00:32.579> Scouts

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
model but really it's not about Scouts

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.729 
model but really it's not about Scouts
about<00:00:33.059> fun<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.540> these<00:00:33.870> aren't<00:00:34.079> great<00:00:34.320> fun<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
about fun and these aren't great fun to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
about fun and these aren't great fun to
fly<00:00:34.920> these<00:00:34.980> models<00:00:35.550> now<00:00:36.030> as<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> name

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
fly these models now as the name

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.170 
fly these models now as the name
suggests<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.410> EPP<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.309> construction<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
suggests it is EPP in construction so

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.790 
suggests it is EPP in construction so
that<00:00:39.239> means<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:39.780> very<00:00:39.989> lightweight<00:00:40.290> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that means it's very lightweight and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.930 
that means it's very lightweight and
very<00:00:41.370> durable<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:43.110> yeah

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
very durable as you can see here yeah

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.639 
very durable as you can see here yeah
which<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:44.969> exactly<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.809> want<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.260> 3d

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
which is exactly what you want for a 3d

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.700 
which is exactly what you want for a 3d
type<00:00:46.980> model<00:00:47.309> such<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> kit<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
type model such as this it is a kit it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.319 
type model such as this it is a kit it
will<00:00:49.980> take<00:00:50.250> them<00:00:50.460> probably<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> few<00:00:51.180> evenings

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
will take them probably a few evenings

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.990 
will take them probably a few evenings
to<00:00:51.629> put<00:00:51.780> together<00:00:52.579> but<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.730> worthwhile

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
to put together but it's worthwhile

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.450 
to put together but it's worthwhile
because<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> treat<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.260> fly<00:00:55.559> as<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:56.370> have

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
because it is a treat to fly as we have

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.869 
because it is a treat to fly as we have
all<00:00:56.640> models<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.329> EPP<00:00:58.079> type<00:00:58.350> construction

all models of this EPP type construction

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.060 
all models of this EPP type construction

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
or maybe even a 22 if you wish but I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.980 
or maybe even a 22 if you wish but I
think<00:02:12.000> really<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> 13

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
think really the 13

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.110 
think really the 13
is<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.350> ideal<00:02:14.070> combination<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:14.880> type

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
is the ideal combination for this type

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.570 
is the ideal combination for this type
of<00:02:15.300> model<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.200> undercarriage<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:17.010> it's

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
of model the undercarriage here it's

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.580 
of model the undercarriage here it's
provided<00:02:18.150> pretty<00:02:18.450> bent<00:02:18.810> you'll<00:02:19.110> just<00:02:19.380> need<00:02:19.530> to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
provided pretty bent you'll just need to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.310 
provided pretty bent you'll just need to
slot<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.610> into<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.150> plywood<00:02:21.720> slot<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.290> you

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
slot it into the plywood slot that you

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.190 
slot it into the plywood slot that you
see<00:02:22.620> here<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.360> wing<00:02:24.540> will<00:02:24.780> need<00:02:24.900> gluing

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
see here and the wing will need gluing

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.870 
see here and the wing will need gluing
on<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.470> fuselage<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.250> tail<00:02:26.550> plane

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
on to the fuselage and the tail plane

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.310 
on to the fuselage and the tail plane
will<00:02:27.150> need<00:02:27.300> gluing<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.990> phone<00:02:28.140> as<00:02:28.290> well

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
will need gluing on the phone as well

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.950 
will need gluing on the phone as well
and<00:02:28.770> but<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.220> course<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.550> can<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:29.940> use<00:02:30.060> fake

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
and but of course you can just use fake

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.800 
and but of course you can just use fake
glue<00:02:31.170> for<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.470> works<00:02:31.710> very<00:02:32.010> well<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.660> a

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
glue for that works very well and it's a

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.630 
glue for that works very well and it's a
good<00:02:33.990> looking<00:02:34.320> model<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.160> think<00:02:35.460> you'll

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
good looking model and I think you'll

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.250 
good looking model and I think you'll
agree<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.570> will<00:02:36.780> make<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.960> worthwhile

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
agree that this will make a worthwhile

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.010 
agree that this will make a worthwhile
