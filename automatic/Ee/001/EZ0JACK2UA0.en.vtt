00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.570
 hello hello 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.790
 to gain square meters we have a room 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.890
 insult to do entirely to renovate who 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.080
 much needed that serves as the office of 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.960
 office and storage area a little 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.099
 dressing so we will change it because 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.140
 that currently it is not very 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.500
 ergonomic and very aesthetic with its 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.250
 old cupboard whose wardrobe and a little 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.710
 friendly but we're still going to 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.230
 change and we will make a dressing 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.710
 house a wall closet so first 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.040
 step 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.180
 Well, we will close the holes even if 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.090
 it's a son right will see go 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.739
 behind the underground racing will still 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:01:01.030
 fill in the holes for it to be 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:01:03.640
 own next step we will repaint this 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.630
 wall that was propped up some patterns 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.860
 blue then we chose a painting 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.200
 fully ecological and a stage is 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.540
 required and bare bones is bad and then 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.010
 we will quietly attack the 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:22.930
 Paint a layer I think the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.920
 good roll so we continue so our 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 achievement of the target 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.640
 so here for example then everything 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.960
 that I give for first racing well 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.780
 obviously it's up to you 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.890
 appropriate what you want to do us 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.660
 to do so we bought efforts 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.570
 Christmas is like on board but 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.840
 wooden doors that we do not have with 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.190
 Slate color paint slightly 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.430
 Metallic water-based organic paints 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.290
 palau pistol and it turns out that these 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.240
 offenses already sliding doors with 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.890
 wheel systems but we will change 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.860
 since it's not it's not salt 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.570
 wants and then then we learned also the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.630
 party more something pretty 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.940
 industrial so buy some rails 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.759
 industrial from a hardware store 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.030
 professionals and we'll see how we 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.209
 can assemble all this so on the video 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.379
 there I present you a little 3d plan 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.800
 to show you a little what we have 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.970
 planned 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.970
 and then we continue after 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.470
 so my dressingroom so he's going to have a 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.230
 closed side here beside closed there 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.380
 first side is closed I close 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.200
 recovering ribs and cupboards that 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.240
 will speak after to take the finish 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.220
 we want but the wooden structure of 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.570
 priests trumps so I'm going to break 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.440
 and levels to fix on the wall 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.840
 this piece there so who will come on 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.500
 who goes without limping it will be fixed and who 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.750
 will be fixed on the beam 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.700
 there up to have a solid support 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.430
 both pieces have to be 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.770
 assembled I'm going to the fixed hero in 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.660
 melting the publie on the beam and then 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.910
 Then I will fix in the wall what 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.070
 will allow me to straighten a little 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:22.290
 nor do we have a little game after 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.820
 have it assembled to set my amount 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.150
 in the wall so I'm going to prepare a 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.770
 ready hole with the wood wick next 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.980
 pierced puts my ankle is screwed their 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.980
 walls 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.170
 I will attack now so 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.390
 the horizontal framework we saw everything to 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.190
 the time we had laid the side then 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.590
 to make my horizontal skeleton 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.950
 what am I going to need so 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.090
 chevron that will serve me horizontally 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.090
 to fix town hall on 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.770
 this is our horizontal part that will be 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.410
 then dressed and who will do the 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.000
 support then we will hand over others 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.370
 intermediate supports to reinforce 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:25.440
 but we will put our rails under and 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:27.030
 our sliding doors underneath 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.370
 the system that allows you to slide 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.110
 the doors so we'll see how it is 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:40.200
 stall the first step take the 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:42.870
 rai path put the support then 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:48.330
 we will go backstage and until the 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:52.230
 necessary distance and then the 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:56.100
 wheel system that returns to 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:00.930
 so inside the rails path and 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.970
 which allows you to slide if you 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.360
 are alone to ask your bar you 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.770
 so can you tap it on your 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.290
 chevron is spotted before drilling there 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.500
 so I have to spot my hole and I 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.050
 so go in the threaded rods 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.600
 in order to etvis and from above it me 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:28.260
 then remains more than to put the 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:30.600
 washer and the clamping nut was laid 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.550
 so our mirail we will ask the second 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.290
 similarly and on the next video 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.419
 we'll see how it's dressing and 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.770
 the integration of the elements inside 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.820
 dancing 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.820
 see you soon
