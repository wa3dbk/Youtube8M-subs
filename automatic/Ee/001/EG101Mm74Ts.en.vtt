 shave a little recap then yona who 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.030
 was already maybe 100% edible 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.550

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.070
 really changed a lot had a recap on 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.539
 knowledge 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.149

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.969
 low funds will not list you all the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.039
 matches because anyway there is the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.109
 site the door lily but for that you have 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.000
 everything and 18h ​​sends heavy what to 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.320

 covenants for those who would not know and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.680

 the best competitive season there 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.210

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.130
