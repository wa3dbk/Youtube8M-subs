tent he only brought tangos to the lane

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.169 
tent he only brought tangos to the lane
so<00:00:21.130> it's<00:00:21.249> gonna<00:00:21.339> take<00:00:21.429> a<00:00:21.519> long<00:00:21.730> time<00:00:21.939> for<00:00:21.999> him

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
to build that back up nether blast could

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.230 
to build that back up nether blast could
actually<00:00:23.890> kill<00:00:24.160> off<00:00:24.279> my<00:00:24.429> line<00:00:24.699> here<00:00:24.970> at<00:00:25.060> lion

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240

blood<00:00:27.369> it<00:00:27.609> will<00:00:27.759> trade<00:00:28.060> it<00:00:28.179> for<00:00:28.329> super<00:00:28.720> but<00:00:28.990> i

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
blood it will trade it for super but i

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.929 
blood it will trade it for super but i
still<00:00:29.560> think<00:00:29.740> super<00:00:30.099> is<00:00:30.159> pretty<00:00:30.400> happy<00:00:30.730> for

that he be five lessons for himself
maybe<00:00:33.670> a<00:00:33.760> little<00:00:33.820> bit<00:00:34.090> from<00:00:34.150> nature<00:00:34.450> skull<00:00:34.660> but

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
maybe a little bit from nature skull but

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.139 
maybe a little bit from nature skull but
a<00:00:34.900> lot<00:00:35.050> from<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.320> jungle<00:00:35.650> and<00:00:35.950> that<00:00:36.790> puts<00:00:37.000> uh

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
a lot from the jungle and that puts uh

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.139 
a lot from the jungle and that puts uh
net<00:00:37.390> worth<00:00:37.539> a<00:00:37.719> pretty<00:00:38.170> predictable<00:00:38.500> position

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
net worth a pretty predictable position

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.610 
net worth a pretty predictable position
so<00:00:40.149> looking<00:00:40.390> over<00:00:40.570> at<00:00:40.660> net<00:00:40.840> worth<00:00:41.199> before<00:00:41.379> we

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
so looking over at net worth before we

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.900 
so looking over at net worth before we
see<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.829> next<00:00:41.920> fight<00:00:42.160> break<00:00:42.399> out<00:00:42.550> or<00:00:42.760> that

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
see the next fight break out or that

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.029 
see the next fight break out or that
might<00:00:43.090> not<00:00:43.269> take<00:00:43.960> too<00:00:44.109> long<00:00:44.289> fishers<00:00:44.769> going<00:00:44.980> to

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
might not take too long fishers going to

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.950 
might not take too long fishers going to
set<00:00:45.219> up<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.489> lot<00:00:45.760> of<00:00:45.879> damage<00:00:46.030> here<00:00:46.300> on<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.840> the

saved his ally there but now we see him
getting<00:01:10.509> nuked<00:01:10.780> down<00:01:10.900> instead<00:01:11.290> he<00:01:12.130> will<00:01:12.729> go

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
getting nuked down instead he will go

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.960 
getting nuked down instead he will go
down<00:01:13.329> to<00:01:13.630> lena's<00:01:14.170> lice<00:01:14.590> are<00:01:14.799> correct<00:01:15.070> town<00:01:15.520> is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
down to lena's lice are correct town is

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.410 
down to lena's lice are correct town is
under<00:01:16.119> attack

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.480 

so<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.140> Enron's<00:01:22.470> kind<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.740> cornered<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.130> under

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
so if Enron's kind of cornered in under

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
so if Enron's kind of cornered in under
his<00:01:23.610> tower<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.330> Lee<00:01:24.570> only<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.960> pushing

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
his tower here Lee only is pushing

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.820 
his tower here Lee only is pushing
pretty<00:01:25.409> hard<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:27.229> he<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
pretty hard on to it and he is going to

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.960 
pretty hard on to it and he is going to
be<00:01:28.890> able<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.159> another<00:01:29.310> Lance<00:01:29.549> out<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> bed

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
be able to get another Lance out of bed

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.760 
be able to get another Lance out of bed
ready<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.210> set<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> tornado<00:01:30.899> EMP<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.649> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
ready to set up the tornado EMP that's a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.320 
ready to set up the tornado EMP that's a
debtor<00:01:31.950> shaker<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> should<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.210> the

debtor shaker and that should be the
tier<00:01:33.509> 1<00:01:33.540> tower<00:01:33.840> super<00:01:34.409> should<00:01:35.220> look<00:01:35.580> to<00:01:35.610> fall

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
tier 1 tower super should look to fall

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.859 
tier 1 tower super should look to fall
back<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.240> they've<00:01:36.330> got<00:01:36.360> how<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.780> the
