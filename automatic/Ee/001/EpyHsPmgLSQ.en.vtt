00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
shield slot which is kind of weird but

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.170 
shield slot which is kind of weird but
it's<00:02:50.290> still<00:02:50.500> okay<00:02:50.799> but<00:02:51.549> that's<00:02:51.819> all<00:02:51.939> for<00:02:51.969> this

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
it's still okay but that's all for this
