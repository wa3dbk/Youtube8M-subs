we're going to be installing a rear

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.049 
we're going to be installing a rear
track<00:00:09.059> bar<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.570> ford<00:00:09.900> f53<00:00:10.309> chassis<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.490> the

track bar on a ford f53 chassis and the
part<00:00:12.269> number<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.750> SS<00:00:13.110> 401<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.610> kit<00:00:14.880> we

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
part number is the SS 401 in this kit we

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.060 
part number is the SS 401 in this kit we
provide<00:00:15.570> two<00:00:15.839> different<00:00:15.870> brackets<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.859> for

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
provide two different brackets one for

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.560 
provide two different brackets one for
the<00:00:17.190> American<00:00:17.640> rear<00:00:17.789> end<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.180> one<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the American rear end and one for the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.090 
the American rear end and one for the
metric<00:00:18.930> rear<00:00:19.140> end<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> first<00:00:19.800> thing<00:00:20.010> we

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
metric rear end so the first thing we

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.099 
metric rear end so the first thing we
need<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.820> determine<00:00:21.029> which<00:00:21.570> rear<00:00:21.840> and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
need to do is determine which rear and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.859 
need to do is determine which rear and
we<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.980> vehicle<00:00:23.430> okay<00:00:24.420> if<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.660> look

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
we have in this vehicle okay if we look

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.259 
we have in this vehicle okay if we look
at<00:00:24.990> these<00:00:25.170> bolts<00:00:25.710> we'll<00:00:26.490> see<00:00:26.789> either<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
at these bolts we'll see either a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.570 
at these bolts we'll see either a
pattern<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.050> lines<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.710> there<00:00:28.949> which<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
pattern of lines on there which is the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.310 
pattern of lines on there which is the
American<00:00:30.150> size<00:00:30.390> they're<00:00:30.900> going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.289> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
American size they're going to be a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.020 
American size they're going to be a
three<00:00:31.560> quarter<00:00:31.920> head<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.279> them<00:00:32.430> or<00:00:32.610> you'll<00:00:32.790> see

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
three quarter head on them or you'll see

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.049 
three quarter head on them or you'll see
a<00:00:33.059> 10-point<00:00:33.750> nine<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.440> there<00:00:35.280> which<00:00:35.910> would

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
a 10-point nine on there which would

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.090 
a 10-point nine on there which would
indicate<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.540> metric<00:00:36.989> another<00:00:37.620> easy<00:00:37.829> way<00:00:38.070> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
indicate a metric another easy way to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400 
indicate a metric another easy way to
tell<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> hold<00:00:39.420> your<00:00:39.570> bracket<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.260> in

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
tell is if you hold your bracket up in

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.650 
tell is if you hold your bracket up in
place<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.700> how<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.239> doesn't

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
place you can see how this one doesn't

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.490 
place you can see how this one doesn't
line<00:00:42.840> up<00:00:44.270> this<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.510> matches<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.320> our

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
line up this one matches up with our

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.010 
line up this one matches up with our
three<00:00:46.770> holes<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> differential<00:00:48.020> we're

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
three holes on the differential we're

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.389 
three holes on the differential we're
also<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.770> tie<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.160> brake

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
also going to need to tie this brake

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.889 
also going to need to tie this brake
line<00:00:50.640> over<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:51.059> bit<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.719> plenty

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
line over a little bit so we have plenty

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
line over a little bit so we have plenty
of<00:00:52.050> clearance<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.890> any<00:00:53.070> rub

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
of clearance we don't have any rub

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.979 
of clearance we don't have any rub
issues<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.059> go<00:00:54.149> ahead<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
issues so we can go ahead and do that to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.840 
issues so we can go ahead and do that to
start<00:00:55.230> out<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.559> okay<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> kit<00:00:56.610> we

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
start out with okay in the kit we

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.599 
start out with okay in the kit we
provide<00:00:57.210> some<00:00:57.449> nylon<00:00:57.809> tie<00:00:58.079> straps<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.800> some
