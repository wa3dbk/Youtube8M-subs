00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.530
 where we put his sales off this morning on 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.730
 which one hello to all 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.870
 started the day with a time 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.250
 which is variable a temperature 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.550
 outside at 16 degrees a temperature 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.530
 from water to a small 18.2 a tide that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.260
 lie the planois is at 10:25 with 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.880
 quizzes 600 and 52 on this amount the wind 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.739
 off shoring visit times he is at 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.840
 southeast and sometimes it's north-east then 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.430
 we will say that it is a chasm 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.420
 in the water is slightly and as soon 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.250
 rucks phases vying 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.540
 and then we have this crowd that is long 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.980
 with 10 seconds two periods the 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.450
 last day of their 8th claudette 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.649
 is upset by the tropical where we 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.899
 want nothing but west and north west 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.299
 west which is multi stitched which is in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.000
 attenuation on the series 1 m 80 because it 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.409
 are not the series at 80 cm good there are some 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 waves to catch at the edge because with 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.010
 the tide that is missing is almost 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.690
 off the waves at the edge by delivering 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.409
 make them waves in the round lice 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.060
 sometimes sometimes hollow normal time they 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.350
 open who closes who because they 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.820
 do not pass on the best in y'a 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.770
 anyway some nice waves 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.000
 who happens to pass but you see him 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.130
 it's not hyper regular anyway 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.240
 it's not easy to catch but hey he 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.619
 are some characters whose evolution 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 for the rest of the day by train 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.890
 from which one speaks the mitigation before which 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.290
