of the of the DVD player what it does is
it<00:01:37.860> splits<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.460> color<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.200> brightness

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it splits the color and the brightness

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
it splits the color and the brightness
signal<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> video<00:01:41.250> allowing<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.090> get<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
signal of the video allowing you get a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.990 
signal of the video allowing you get a
clearer<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> sharper<00:01:43.680> picture<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.520> caveat

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
clearer in a sharper picture the caveat

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.370 
clearer in a sharper picture the caveat
is<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> teat<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
is that you have a teat have to have a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.069 
is that you have a teat have to have a
TV<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.860> an<00:01:47.040> s<00:01:47.189> video<00:01:47.750> connection<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> in

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
TV with an s video connection in it in

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.389 
TV with an s video connection in it in
order<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> take<00:01:49.470> advantage<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.310> you

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
order to take advantage of it if you

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
order to take advantage of it if you
don't<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.670> one<00:01:50.880> doesn't<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.720> anything<00:01:51.990> for

you same thing goes with what they call
color<00:01:54.509> component<00:01:55.200> connectors<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:56.430> here

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
color component connectors right here

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.280 
color component connectors right here
are<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> ones<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.000> kind<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.390> look<00:01:57.540> green<00:01:57.840> red

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
are the ones that kind of look green red

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.649 
are the ones that kind of look green red
and<00:01:58.469> blue<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.670> basic<00:02:00.090> separates<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and blue and this basic separates the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.749 
and blue and this basic separates the
color<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.229> light<00:02:01.409> even<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:01.950> into<00:02:02.490> three

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
color and light even more into three

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.490 
color and light even more into three
channels<00:02:03.119> instead<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.540> two<00:02:03.810> giving<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.320> even

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
channels instead of two giving you even

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.039 
channels instead of two giving you even
a<00:02:04.710> sharper<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.219> higher<00:02:05.399> fidelity<00:02:05.630> color<00:02:06.630> ok

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
a sharper and higher fidelity color ok

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.809 
a sharper and higher fidelity color ok
so<00:02:07.110> say<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.469> only<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.950> RCA<00:02:08.310> jacks<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
so say I only have the RCA jacks in the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.210 
so say I only have the RCA jacks in the
back<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.149> my<00:02:09.179> TV<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.560> s-video<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
color component do I mean should I know

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.790 
color component do I mean should I know

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
use what they call the digital optical

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.260 
use what they call the digital optical
connection<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.430> one<00:02:48.580> actually<00:02:48.700> has<00:02:48.910> both

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
connection this one actually has both

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.320 
connection this one actually has both
types<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.050> spit<00:02:50.620> if<00:02:50.770> rapid<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:52.030> round

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
types this is a spit if rapid this round

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.420 
types this is a spit if rapid this round
connection<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:52.990> this<00:02:53.350> toslink<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.190> little

square<00:02:54.640> canal<00:02:54.910> digital<00:02:55.510> those<00:02:55.990> are<00:02:56.050> both

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
square canal digital those are both

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.750 
square canal digital those are both
digital<00:02:56.890> audio<00:02:57.190> they're<00:02:57.370> just<00:02:57.580> different

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
digital audio they're just different

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.790 
digital audio they're just different
form<00:02:58.270> factors<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.900> course<00:02:59.170> again<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.590> need<00:02:59.740> a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
form factors of course again you need a

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.640 
form factors of course again you need a
stereo<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.400> can<00:03:00.790> can<00:03:01.480> accommodate<00:03:02.230> both<00:03:02.440> of

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
stereo that can can accommodate both of

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.680 
stereo that can can accommodate both of
those<00:03:02.740> signals<00:03:03.130> there's<00:03:04.060> people<00:03:04.570> have<00:03:04.660> a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
those signals there's people have a

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.780 
those signals there's people have a
confusion<00:03:05.080> about<00:03:05.380> Dolby<00:03:05.740> Digital<00:03:05.770> DTS<00:03:06.550> and
