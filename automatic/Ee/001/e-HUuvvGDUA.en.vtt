00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:53.889 
the things that I do every single day I

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:56.819 
the things that I do every single day I
wouldn't<00:00:54.190> have<00:00:54.339> to<00:00:54.489> rewrite<00:00:54.850> them<00:00:55.089> all<00:00:55.319> and<00:00:56.319> I

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
wouldn't have to rewrite them all and I

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:57.689 
wouldn't have to rewrite them all and I
thought<00:00:56.979> that<00:00:57.039> was<00:00:57.219> a<00:00:57.249> really<00:00:57.309> great<00:00:57.639> idea

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
thought that was a really great idea

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.889 
thought that was a really great idea
until<00:00:58.359> yesterday<00:00:58.719> when<00:00:58.989> I<00:00:59.170> realized<00:00:59.649> that<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
until yesterday when I realized that I

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.779 
until yesterday when I realized that I
can't<00:01:02.379> remember<00:01:02.710> if<00:01:02.979> I<00:01:03.100> did<00:01:03.129> them<00:01:03.519> because<00:01:03.760> I

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
can't remember if I did them because I

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.550 
can't remember if I did them because I
can't<00:01:04.120> physically<00:01:04.540> check<00:01:04.840> them<00:01:05.050> off<00:01:05.200> like<00:01:05.440> I

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
can't physically check them off like I

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.850 
can't physically check them off like I
can<00:01:05.800> over<00:01:06.610> here<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.120> I<00:01:07.810> would<00:01:08.410> still<00:01:08.710> have<00:01:08.830> to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
can over here and I would still have to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.910 
can over here and I would still have to
rewrite<00:01:09.190> it<00:01:09.340> even<00:01:09.580> if<00:01:09.670> i<00:01:09.760> put<00:01:09.940> here<00:01:10.180> so<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.920> don't

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
better at it but what I decided to do

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.270 
better at it but what I decided to do
was<00:01:47.920> put<00:01:48.880> some<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.300> pink<00:01:49.570> washi<00:01:49.810> tape

was put some of this pink washi tape
which<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.520> by<00:01:51.850> recollections<00:01:52.420> and<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:53.170> came<00:01:53.320> in

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
which is by recollections and it came in

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.260 
which is by recollections and it came in
a<00:01:53.530> three<00:01:53.710> pack<00:01:53.920> like<00:01:54.130> this<00:01:54.370> one<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:55.150> the

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
a three pack like this one is the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.420 
a three pack like this one is the
cupcake<00:01:55.660> one<00:01:55.870> is<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.530> polka<00:01:56.740> dots<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.100> one<00:01:57.310> is

cupcake one is the polka dots and one is

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.399 
cupcake one is the polka dots and one is
plain<00:01:57.670> pink<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.570> I<00:01:58.600> decided<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.140> use<00:01:59.380> the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
plain pink so I decided to use the

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.610 
plain pink so I decided to use the
thinnest<00:01:59.920> pink<00:02:00.700> washi<00:02:00.940> tape<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:01.900> use<00:02:02.140> down

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
each day to mark the days and I thought

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.470 
each day to mark the days and I thought
that<00:02:05.500> was<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.800> really<00:02:05.890> cute<00:02:06.370> idea<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.940> then

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
I'm having a really hard time with this

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.000 
I'm having a really hard time with this
pin<00:03:32.230> um<00:03:32.670> if<00:03:33.930> anybody<00:03:34.930> has<00:03:35.109> used<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.500> friction

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
pin um if anybody has used the friction

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.560 
pin um if anybody has used the friction
pins<00:03:36.310> can<00:03:36.579> you<00:03:36.730> go<00:03:36.910> ahead<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.180> leave<00:03:37.390> me<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
pins can you go ahead and leave me a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.390 
pins can you go ahead and leave me a
comment<00:03:37.780> below<00:03:37.959> if<00:03:38.200> they<00:03:38.560> do<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.920> same<00:03:39.130> thing

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
comment below if they do the same thing

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.819 
comment below if they do the same thing
but<00:03:39.579> I<00:03:40.510> was<00:03:41.019> looking<00:03:41.290> into<00:03:41.440> getting<00:03:41.590> one<00:03:41.739> of

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
but I was looking into getting one of

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.229 
but I was looking into getting one of
those<00:03:41.980> but<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.220> don't<00:03:42.430> know<00:03:42.549> if<00:03:42.579> I'm<00:03:42.760> going<00:03:43.000> to

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
those but I don't know if I'm going to

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.060 
those but I don't know if I'm going to
anymore<00:03:43.450> because<00:03:43.600> I<00:03:43.930> have<00:03:44.140> this<00:03:44.470> paper<00:03:44.799> mate

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
anymore because I have this paper mate

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.509 
anymore because I have this paper mate
erasable<00:03:45.549> pen<00:03:45.850> and<00:03:46.799> when<00:03:47.799> I<00:03:47.829> write<00:03:48.190> with<00:03:48.370> it

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
erasable pen and when I write with it

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.699 
erasable pen and when I write with it
it's<00:03:48.700> fine<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.359> then<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.630> started<00:03:49.959> noticing<00:03:50.019> if

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
it's fine and then I started noticing if

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.150 
it's fine and then I started noticing if
I<00:03:50.859> barely<00:03:51.250> put<00:03:51.670> my<00:03:51.700> finger<00:03:52.269> over<00:03:52.299> it<00:03:52.630> it

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
I barely put my finger over it it

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.759 
I barely put my finger over it it
completely<00:03:54.160> just<00:03:54.609> disappears<00:03:55.390> so<00:03:56.260> I've<00:03:56.560> been

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
completely just disappears so I've been

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.420 
completely just disappears so I've been
having<00:03:57.069> to<00:03:57.160> be<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:57.700> so<00:03:58.390> careful<00:03:59.100> when<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.130> write

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
having to be so so careful when I write

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.370 
having to be so so careful when I write
on<00:04:00.549> my<00:04:00.670> days<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:01.090> can't<00:04:01.390> even<00:04:01.540> like<00:04:01.780> go<00:04:02.019> over

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
on my days I can't even like go over

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.809 
on my days I can't even like go over
this<00:04:02.500> or<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.859> would<00:04:02.980> just<00:04:03.160> like<00:04:03.370> completely

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
this or it would just like completely

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.360 
this or it would just like completely
erase<00:04:04.329> this<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.230> i<00:04:05.500> think<00:04:05.799> i'm<00:04:06.040> just<00:04:06.069> going<00:04:06.340> to

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
erase this so i think i'm just going to

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.140 
erase this so i think i'm just going to
switch<00:04:06.640> over<00:04:06.819> to<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.120> plane<00:04:07.450> pin<00:04:08.489> for<00:04:09.489> now<00:04:09.670> so

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
switch over to a plane pin for now so

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.449 
switch over to a plane pin for now so
that<00:04:10.359> i<00:04:10.660> won't<00:04:11.410> have<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.650> problem<00:04:11.769> until<00:04:12.400> i

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
that i won't have that problem until i

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.729 
that i won't have that problem until i
can<00:04:12.579> get<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:12.940> better<00:04:13.180> erasable<00:04:13.660> pen<00:04:13.930> but<00:04:14.590> can

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
can get a better erasable pen but can

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.199 
can get a better erasable pen but can
somebody<00:04:14.920> please<00:04:15.190> tell<00:04:15.310> me<00:04:15.549> in<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.760> comments

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
somebody please tell me in the comments

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.849 
somebody please tell me in the comments
if<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.570> friction<00:04:16.780> pins<00:04:17.229> do<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.620> or<00:04:17.799> if

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
if the friction pins do that or if

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.009 
if the friction pins do that or if
that's<00:04:18.280> just<00:04:18.519> all<00:04:18.700> erasable<00:04:19.120> pens<00:04:19.450> because

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
that's just all erasable pens because

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.100 
that's just all erasable pens because
right<00:04:20.380> now<00:04:20.410> um<00:04:20.829> I<00:04:21.330> really<00:04:22.330> can't<00:04:22.750> have<00:04:22.930> that

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
right now um I really can't have that

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.620 
right now um I really can't have that
happen<00:04:23.440> because<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.950> had<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.520> happen<00:04:24.729> on

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
do is here that I absolutely had to get

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.630 
do is here that I absolutely had to get
done<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.680> went<00:04:32.920> like<00:04:33.040> this<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.550> was

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
done and I went like this and it was

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.790 
done and I went like this and it was
completely<00:04:33.790> erased<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.320> didn't<00:04:35.650> even

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
completely erased and I didn't even

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.140 
completely erased and I didn't even
remember<00:04:36.100> part<00:04:36.490> of<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.670> things<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.030> there

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
remember part of the things and there

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.290 
remember part of the things and there
was<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.510> faint<00:04:37.810> like<00:04:38.110> um<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:39.150> faint<00:04:40.320> um<00:04:41.320> a

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
was just a faint like um a faint um a

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.240 
was just a faint like um a faint um a
faint<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.390> little<00:04:43.630> bit<00:04:43.750> left<00:04:43.960> over<00:04:44.170> so<00:04:44.620> that<00:04:44.920> was

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
faint a little bit left over so that was

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.360 
faint a little bit left over so that was
really<00:04:45.490> hard<00:04:46.000> so<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:46.840> had<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.080> go<00:04:47.290> back<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:48.010> my

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
really hard so I had to go back to my

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.550 
really hard so I had to go back to my
today<00:04:48.970> tab<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.510> I<00:04:49.600> had<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.870> go<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.200> look<00:04:50.380> and

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
today tab and I had to go and look and

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.100 
today tab and I had to go and look and
see<00:04:51.160> what<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:51.490> was<00:04:51.670> that<00:04:51.970> I<00:04:52.240> would<00:04:52.540> have<00:04:52.840> put<00:04:52.990> on

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
see what it was that I would have put on

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.880 
see what it was that I would have put on
there<00:04:53.320> and<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.740> was<00:04:53.890> just<00:04:54.040> a<00:04:54.130> mess<00:04:54.310> so<00:04:54.790> um

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
there and it was just a mess so um

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.970 
there and it was just a mess so um
somebody<00:04:56.890> leave<00:04:57.190> me<00:04:57.280> comments<00:04:57.520> for<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.980> good

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
somebody leave me comments for a good

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.460 
somebody leave me comments for a good
pen<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.340> use<00:05:00.550> with<00:05:01.480> this<00:05:01.660> I<00:05:01.840> have<00:05:01.990> some<00:05:02.200> of<00:05:02.350> the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
pen to use with this I have some of the

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.940 
pen to use with this I have some of the
loop<00:05:02.680> ends<00:05:03.270> from<00:05:04.270> earlier<00:05:04.900> years<00:05:05.200> of<00:05:05.380> crafting

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
loop ends from earlier years of crafting

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.200 
loop ends from earlier years of crafting
and<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:08.460> don't<00:05:09.460> really<00:05:09.580> want<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.030> right<00:05:10.150> now

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
and I don't really want to right now

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.790 
and I don't really want to right now
because<00:05:10.570> I<00:05:10.660> think<00:05:10.720> that<00:05:11.020> it<00:05:11.140> might<00:05:11.440> bleed

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
because I think that it might bleed
