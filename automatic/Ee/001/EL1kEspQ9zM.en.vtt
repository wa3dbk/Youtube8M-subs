00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
we will proceed to the foot wide

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.060 
we will proceed to the foot wide
movement<00:01:34.340> first<00:01:35.120> have<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.810> taste<00:01:36.170> of<00:01:36.380> foot<00:01:36.740> wide

when<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.310> feet<00:01:40.580> do<00:01:40.910> a<00:01:41.120> reverse<00:01:41.510> cyclic<00:01:42.200> motion

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.150 

now<00:01:59.210> place<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.780> rubber<00:02:00.170> band<00:02:00.560> on<00:02:00.770> your<00:02:00.800> feet

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
now place the rubber band on your feet

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.850 
now place the rubber band on your feet
where<00:02:01.790> her<00:02:01.910> hands<00:02:02.210> continue<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.260> hunt<00:02:03.500> right

kick your feet scoop backward ask this
paper

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.360 

again<00:02:22.150> our<00:02:22.450> aim<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.110> see<00:02:23.470> more<00:02:23.770> by<00:02:24.010> gliding

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
again our aim is to see more by gliding

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.090 
again our aim is to see more by gliding
than<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.270> pushing<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.900> arms<00:02:26.440> for<00:02:27.070> the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
than the pushing of the arms for the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.210 
than the pushing of the arms for the
pebble<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:28.150> similar<00:02:28.720> weight<00:02:28.990> on<00:02:29.530> each<00:02:29.830> hand

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
pebble of similar weight on each hand

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:47.610 
pebble of similar weight on each hand
just<00:02:30.840> keep<00:02:31.840> them<00:02:32.140> close<00:02:45.540> push<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.780> weight<00:02:47.020> to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
just keep them close push the weight to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.400 
just keep them close push the weight to
one<00:02:47.980> for<00:02:48.340> children<00:02:49.000> then<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.740> 1/2<00:02:51.310> kilo<00:02:51.730> gram

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
one for children then the 1/2 kilo gram

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.720 
one for children then the 1/2 kilo gram
then<00:02:53.410> about<00:02:54.280> 1<00:02:55.090> kilogram<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:56.550> must<00:02:57.550> really

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
then about 1 kilogram you must really

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.120 
then about 1 kilogram you must really
have<00:02:57.910> learned<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.390> fly<00:02:58.450> backwards<00:02:58.990> as<00:02:59.890> your

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
have learned to fly backwards as your

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:11.600 
have learned to fly backwards as your
hands

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.510 

now<00:03:12.610> try<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.420> keep<00:03:13.600> pumps<00:03:14.140> together<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.890> tuck

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
now try to keep pumps together and tuck

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.450 
now try to keep pumps together and tuck
your<00:03:15.730> arms<00:03:15.940> from<00:03:16.480> overhead<00:03:17.250> downwards<00:03:18.250> as

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
your arms from overhead downwards as

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:43.280 
your arms from overhead downwards as
doing<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:18.940> apps

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:04:17.140 

now<00:03:44.250> tie<00:03:45.120> your<00:03:45.299> hands<00:03:45.599> with<00:03:45.930> other<00:03:46.200> guys
