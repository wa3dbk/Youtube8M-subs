see it there are pieces that look like

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.790 
see it there are pieces that look like
screws<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:38.180> push<00:01:38.540> into<00:01:41.200> little<00:01:42.200> retainers

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
screws that push into little retainers

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.410 
screws that push into little retainers
in<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:44.240> body<00:01:44.450> right<00:01:44.690> there<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.470> that's<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:46.420> so

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
in the body right there so that's it so

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.780 
in the body right there so that's it so
now<00:01:47.659> we<00:01:48.380> can<00:01:48.560> take<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.840> bulb<00:01:50.840> out<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.610> this<00:01:52.610> is

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
now we can take a bulb out and this is

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.899 
now we can take a bulb out and this is
the<00:01:52.909> bulb<00:01:53.120> right<00:01:53.390> here

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
the bulb right here

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.660 
the bulb right here
and<00:01:56.409> I<00:01:58.090> can<00:01:59.090> see<00:01:59.570> I<00:01:59.990> can<00:02:00.590> see<00:02:00.860> one<00:02:01.040> thing<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.460> can

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
and I can see I can see one thing I can

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.740 
and I can see I can see one thing I can
see<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.970> bulb<00:02:02.180> is<00:02:02.330> made<00:02:02.510> in<00:02:02.659> China<00:02:04.659> look<00:02:05.659> at

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
see the bulb is made in China look at

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.249 
see the bulb is made in China look at
that<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.200> it's<00:02:06.979> black

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.040 

and<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.039> filament<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.580> shot<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:12.989> that's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and the filament is shot so that's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.530 
and the filament is shot so that's
pretty<00:02:13.290> easy<00:02:13.470> job<00:02:13.819> replace<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.000> bulb<00:02:15.299> will

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
pretty easy job replace that bulb will

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.899 
pretty easy job replace that bulb will
probably<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.080> set<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:16.709> that's<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.069> that's<00:02:17.549> all

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
probably all set so that's it that's all

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.559 
probably all set so that's it that's all
there<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.690> removing<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.739> rear<00:02:20.580> light
