00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 we will see today how to knit 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.760
 the point of sion so that's a point of 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.139
 coast that resembles a little the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.170
 fake english ribs but instead of 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.560
 knitting on a number of miles 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.410
 multiple of 4 laon knits on a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.050
 number of miles multiple of 3 so like 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.830
 you can see so here I already 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.800
 started knitting we're going to knit it in 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.610
 circular another oven will see 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.410
 how it is done invading comes but 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 there we will knit it in circular 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.180
 which is very convenient to make a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.780
 snood for example because we see that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.340
 it's a point that is reversible 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.100
 completely identical on the place and 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.199
 on the reverse we go we will use 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.640
 only stitches place and 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.969
 glass enamel on the front row and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:09.990
 especially the ranks a father we'll say on 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:12.950
 will knit two stitches place a 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.950
 mesh upside down 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.390
 two stitches place a lapel knit 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:43.899
 of mesh place a mesh prevents the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.549
 valiant in a way that you 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.789
 can see that the first mallet 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:52.840
 place game knit on a series of 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:56.140
 mesh place so we have like her a 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.329
 a series of loops the second my 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.390
 place game knits on a mesh in 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.819
 glass is our third stitch that is 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:10.060
 upside down knit on a way 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:18.730
 so place safe place safe place in 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:23.049
 glass glass on antwerp so here we have 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.900
 a quote here we will have a 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:32.560
 side upside down then a stepping stone 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.060
 and here we say a foam point a 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.430
 alternating mesh jersey locations 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.040
 green 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:48.700
 so I continue I go and until the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:55.890
 end of the tour andres at the place 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.890
 so do what 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:14.260
 a bit lambert I hope it's not 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.860
 very far 20 of the turn otherwise we will 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.840
 to be bored 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.090
 I did not put a marker we see very 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.390
 well what we do in law right in 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.390
 glass 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.220
 schedule 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.150
 here I am on a mesh 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.870
 place so it's that I'm at the moment 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:48.610
 of change of all so there we 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.550
 let's come on a lap loses we will change 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.610
 the sequence of points we will not do 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:04:02.379
 in law in glass right but we're going 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:08.290
 do in glass glass right i 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:13.100
 three good people do not forget place in 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:21.739
 green to the mayor 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:23.230
 right in the air in the green here is the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.850
 first stitch at the place 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.710
 it does not change this one I knit 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.270
 she is in the place so I'm knitting a 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.810
 better green that's why I 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.760
 no need but then I do not need 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:43.930
 necessarily put a marker at 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:47.440
 moment of change of turns except sign 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.870
 I watch a police series 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.310
 exciting on TV that lead 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:58.910
 in my momentum I forget to change the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:06.070
 sequence of points I can put a 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:11.930
 little colored marker if I want it here 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:14.420
 we'll stop there I show them a little 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.550

 even makes a little poo on the leg 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.460
 in general they do not like too much that I 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.540
 knit but here he is impressed by 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.540
