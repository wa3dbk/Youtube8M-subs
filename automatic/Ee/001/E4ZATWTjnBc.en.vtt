00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
action with a mixture of my ingame

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.479 
action with a mixture of my ingame
gameplay<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:51.390> at<00:00:52.199> times<00:00:52.620> hard<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> tell

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
gameplay so it was at times hard to tell

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.150 
gameplay so it was at times hard to tell
what<00:00:53.699> God<00:00:53.969> calls<00:00:54.420> me<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.770> am<00:00:55.860> always

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
what God calls me not actually am always

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.630 
what God calls me not actually am always
actual<00:00:56.809> gameplay<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.500> thought<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.370> did<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
actual gameplay so I thought they did a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.979 
actual gameplay so I thought they did a
pretty<00:00:59.670> good<00:00:59.969> job<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.239> mixing<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.840> two

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
pretty good job of mixing the two

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.630 
pretty good job of mixing the two
together<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.829> thought<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> pretty<00:01:02.460> good

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
together so I thought was a pretty good

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.630 
together so I thought was a pretty good

guess I'll just talk about the gameplay
I'm<00:04:59.770> here<00:05:00.070> on<00:05:00.160> a<00:05:00.310> strong<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.840> right<00:05:02.200> now<00:05:02.730> why

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
I'm here on a strong and right now why

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.190 
I'm here on a strong and right now why
they<00:05:03.910> took<00:05:04.060> me<00:05:04.270> already<00:05:04.480> so<00:05:04.750> I<00:05:04.780> guess<00:05:05.050> they

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
they took me already so I guess they

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.700 
they took me already so I guess they
didn't<00:05:05.680> take<00:05:05.770> one<00:05:05.980> of<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.220> objective<00:05:06.700> srl<00:05:07.060> but

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.080 
didn't take one of the objective srl but
i<00:05:08.710> think<00:05:09.040> i<00:05:09.100> lock<00:05:09.280> down<00:05:09.460> this<00:05:09.550> area<00:05:09.850> pretty

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
i think i lock down this area pretty

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.970 
i think i lock down this area pretty
well<00:05:10.510> i'm<00:05:11.110> not<00:05:11.230> sure<00:05:11.410> if<00:05:11.470> i<00:05:11.530> did<00:05:11.650> about<00:05:11.740> myself

some great look for it but i thought
that<00:05:22.150> i<00:05:22.270> did<00:05:22.450> I<00:05:22.570> didn't<00:05:22.900> do<00:05:23.710> enough<00:05:23.860> with<00:05:24.280> the

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
that i did I didn't do enough with the

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.670 
that i did I didn't do enough with the
PDW<00:05:25.000> so<00:05:25.180> that's<00:05:25.360> why<00:05:25.510> I<00:05:25.540> went<00:05:25.810> back<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.290> used

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.430 
PDW so that's why I went back and used
it<00:05:26.920> in<00:05:27.190> this<00:05:27.490> game<00:05:27.760> so<00:05:28.140> that's<00:05:29.140> why<00:05:29.260> I'm<00:05:29.350> using

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
it in this game so that's why I'm using

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.330 
it in this game so that's why I'm using
it<00:05:29.620> right<00:05:29.770> now<00:05:30.000> and<00:05:31.740> right<00:05:32.740> here<00:05:32.800> we'll<00:05:33.190> how
