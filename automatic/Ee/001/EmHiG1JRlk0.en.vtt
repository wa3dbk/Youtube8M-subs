really nice CA a really comfy grip on it
and<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:22.080> stock<00:01:22.410> is<00:01:22.710> actually<00:01:23.039> a<00:01:23.070> Phoenix

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and this stock is actually a Phoenix

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.660 
and this stock is actually a Phoenix
it's<00:01:24.750> called<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.649> lot<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.009> remember<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> exact

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it's called a lot of remember the exact

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.460 
it's called a lot of remember the exact
name<00:01:26.940> of<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.840> basically<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.320> an

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
name of it but it's basically got an

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.130 
name of it but it's basically got an
extra<00:01:28.830> spring<00:01:29.250> inside<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.850> stock<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
extra spring inside the stock here that

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380 
extra spring inside the stock here that
absorbs<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> recoil<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.580> if<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.789> wife<00:01:33.060> needs

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
absorbs the recoil so if my wife needs

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.990 
absorbs the recoil so if my wife needs
to<00:01:33.570> shoot<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> Kay<00:01:34.289> you<00:01:34.950> know<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.430> doesn't

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
to shoot the a Kay you know it doesn't

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.999 
to shoot the a Kay you know it doesn't
hurt<00:01:36.539> her<00:01:36.720> shoulder<00:01:37.170> she<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.500> handle<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
hurt her shoulder she can handle it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.889 
hurt her shoulder she can handle it
because<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.640> stock<00:01:38.970> absorbs<00:01:39.450> almost<00:01:39.630> all

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
because that stock absorbs almost all

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.460 
because that stock absorbs almost all
the<00:01:40.020> recoil<00:01:40.410> so<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.740> real<00:01:40.979> nice<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the recoil so it's real nice and then I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.840 
the recoil so it's real nice and then I
also<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.060> gun<00:01:45.210> standard<00:01:46.369> comes<00:01:47.369> only

maybe<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.570> just<00:03:09.780> squeeze<00:03:09.960> into<00:03:10.140> tight<00:03:10.440> but<00:03:10.740> what

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
maybe I just squeeze into tight but what

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.340 
maybe I just squeeze into tight but what
I<00:03:11.640> found<00:03:11.850> isn't<00:03:12.270> when<00:03:12.360> i<00:03:12.390> after<00:03:12.720> i<00:03:12.750> put<00:03:12.990> this<00:03:13.140> on

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350

i bought it from Scheels and i my aim

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.450 
i bought it from Scheels and i my aim
improved<00:03:18.360> quite<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.660> bit<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.860> it's<00:03:20.040> much

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
improved quite a bit and it's much

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.820 
improved quite a bit and it's much
easier<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:20.970> keep<00:03:21.690> steady<00:03:22.080> when<00:03:22.350> you're<00:03:22.500> when

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
easier to keep steady when you're when

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.170 
easier to keep steady when you're when
you're<00:03:22.860> trying<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.160> put<00:03:23.370> rounds<00:03:23.940> down

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
you're trying to put rounds down

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.470 
you're trying to put rounds down
downrange<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:26.160> mean<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:26.880> did<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.090> few<00:03:27.300> other

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
downrange so I mean I did a few other

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.150 
downrange so I mean I did a few other
little<00:03:27.660> things<00:03:27.960> too<00:03:28.080> I<00:03:28.110> think<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.380> painted<00:03:29.010> it

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
little things too I think I painted it

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.710 
little things too I think I painted it
with<00:03:29.250> some<00:03:29.430> high<00:03:29.580> heat<00:03:29.880> paint<00:03:30.180> just<00:03:30.390> because<00:03:30.690> I

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
with some high heat paint just because I

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.510 
with some high heat paint just because I
scratched<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.350> up<00:03:31.470> as<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.770> was<00:03:31.890> working<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.310> it

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
scratched it up as I was working on it

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.820 
scratched it up as I was working on it
but<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.570> then<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.960> know<00:03:34.080> did<00:03:34.440> all<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.800> the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
but and then you know did all the the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.470 
but and then you know did all the the
cooking<00:03:35.460> to<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.700> gun<00:03:35.850> where<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.180> put<00:03:36.360> it<00:03:36.420> in

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
cooking to the gun where you put it in

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.080 
cooking to the gun where you put it in
the<00:03:36.630> oven<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.320> bake<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:38.430> paint<00:03:38.730> on<00:03:38.880> there

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
the oven and bake that paint on there

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.700 
the oven and bake that paint on there
and<00:03:39.150> everything<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.720> really<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:40.680> not

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
and everything but really it's not

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.670 
and everything but really it's not
anything<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.430> do<00:03:42.140> but<00:03:43.140> after<00:03:43.290> all

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
anything you have to do but after all

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.850 
anything you have to do but after all
sudden<00:03:44.190> done<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.700> think<00:03:44.820> I<00:03:45.270> have<00:03:45.540> maybe<00:03:45.840> $900<00:03:46.800> in

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
sudden done I think I have maybe $900 in

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.060 
sudden done I think I have maybe $900 in
