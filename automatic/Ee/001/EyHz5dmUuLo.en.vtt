in<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.500> particular<00:00:25.680> video<00:00:26.160> we're<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
in this particular video we're going to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.250 
in this particular video we're going to
be<00:00:26.760> focusing<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.420> some<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> front

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
be focusing on some of the front

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.290 
be focusing on some of the front
shifting<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.890> how<00:00:29.699> that's<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.210> work

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
shifting and how that's going to work

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.359 
shifting and how that's going to work
we're<00:00:31.050> also<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> touch<00:00:31.590> briefly<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
we're also going to touch briefly on the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.630 
we're also going to touch briefly on the
set<00:00:32.940> screws<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.960> limit<00:00:34.350> screws<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.070> those

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
set screws or the limit screws and those

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.459 
set screws or the limit screws and those
on<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> rear<00:00:36.149> derailleur<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> great

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
on the rear derailleur you have a great

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
on the rear derailleur you have a great
shot<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.770> these<00:00:38.040> two<00:00:38.280> screws<00:00:38.640> right<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
shot of these two screws right here a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
shot of these two screws right here a
lot<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.379> people<00:00:40.649> think<00:00:40.980> these<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.399> something

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
lot of people think these have something

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340 
lot of people think these have something
to<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.000> how<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.270> bike<00:00:42.540> actually<00:00:42.960> shifts

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
to do with how the bike actually shifts

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.920 
to do with how the bike actually shifts
between<00:00:43.469> gears<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.930> completely

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
between gears and that is completely

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.479 
between gears and that is completely
false<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.559> couldn't<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.860> further<00:00:47.070> from<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
false it couldn't be further from the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.180 
false it couldn't be further from the
truth<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:48.420> these<00:00:48.840> are<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.920> thought<00:00:50.160> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
truth all these are is to be thought of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.610 
truth all these are is to be thought of
as<00:00:50.489> bookends<00:00:51.050> they're<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
as bookends they're just going to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.130 
as bookends they're just going to
bookend<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.399> shelf<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> shifting

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
bookend the shelf that is the shifting

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.810 
bookend the shelf that is the shifting
so<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.620> seven<00:00:55.980> gears<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.460> seven

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
so if we have seven gears there seven

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.750 
so if we have seven gears there seven
books<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:58.199> bookshelf<00:00:58.559> goes<00:00:58.829> too<00:00:59.070> far<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
books if that bookshelf goes too far it

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
books if that bookshelf goes too far it
can<00:01:00.329> fall<00:01:00.600> off<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.050> edge<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.350> shelf

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
can fall off the edge of the shelf

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.579 
can fall off the edge of the shelf
that's<00:01:02.640> all<00:01:02.910> these<00:01:03.120> screws<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.840> they<00:01:04.140> limit

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that's all these screws do they limit

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.560 
that's all these screws do they limit
how<00:01:05.010> far<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> derailleur<00:01:05.850> will<00:01:06.090> go<00:01:06.240> from<00:01:06.420> this

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
how far the derailleur will go from this

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.020 
how far the derailleur will go from this
point<00:01:06.840> into<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.380> wheel<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> how<00:01:08.670> far<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
point into the wheel and how far the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.670 
point into the wheel and how far the
derailleur<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.510> go<00:01:09.600> from<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.930> point<00:01:10.200> into

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
derailleur will go from this point into

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
derailleur will go from this point into
the<00:01:10.799> frame<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.270> shifting<00:01:12.750> issues

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the frame so if you have shifting issues

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810 
the frame so if you have shifting issues
in<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> middle<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.010> should<00:01:14.220> never<00:01:14.490> touch

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
in the middle you should never touch

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940 
in the middle you should never touch
these<00:01:15.060> screws<00:01:15.450> most<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.380> time<00:01:16.560> they<00:01:16.710> screw

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
these screws most of the time they screw

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.499 
these screws most of the time they screw
should<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.250> set<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.640> out<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> box<00:01:18.299> without

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
should be set up out of the box without

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.570 
should be set up out of the box without
much<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.960> an<00:01:19.049> issue<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.159> able<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> talk<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
much of an issue to be able to talk a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.920 
much of an issue to be able to talk a
little<00:01:20.729> bit<00:01:20.909> more<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.119> depth<00:01:21.299> about<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.689> set

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
little bit more in depth about the set

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.510 
little bit more in depth about the set
screws<00:01:22.259> we're<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> turn<00:01:22.979> our<00:01:23.040> attention

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
screws we're going to turn our attention

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.090 
screws we're going to turn our attention
to<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> front<00:01:23.939> shifting<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:25.470> front<00:01:25.740> shifting

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
to the front shifting the front shifting

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
to the front shifting the front shifting
will<00:01:26.220> again<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.729> two<00:01:27.030> set<00:01:27.270> screws<00:01:27.299> on

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
will again have the two set screws on

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.170 
will again have the two set screws on
the<00:01:27.689> top<00:01:27.979> which<00:01:28.979> again<00:01:29.220> we're<00:01:29.430> only<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the top which again we're only going to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.200 
the top which again we're only going to
adjust<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.869> necessary<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.820> pedal<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
adjust if necessary so as I pedal the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.340 
adjust if necessary so as I pedal the
bike<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> check<00:01:33.930> our<00:01:34.110> front

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
bike I'm going to check our front

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.710 
bike I'm going to check our front
shifting<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.939> couple<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.390> things<00:01:39.450> we

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
shifting and a couple of the things we

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.210 
shifting and a couple of the things we
want<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.960> check<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> front<00:01:40.680> shifting<00:01:41.070> is

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
want to check on the front shifting is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
want to check on the front shifting is
when<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:41.880> shift<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.390> into<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> middle<00:01:42.869> ring

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
when we shift it up into the middle ring

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.679 
when we shift it up into the middle ring
using<00:01:43.320> our<00:01:43.560> shifter<00:01:44.180> it<00:01:45.180> should<00:01:45.420> shift

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
using our shifter it should shift

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.350 
using our shifter it should shift
cleanly<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.369> little<00:01:47.670> bit<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> noise<00:01:48.060> is

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
cleanly now that little bit of noise is

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.499 
cleanly now that little bit of noise is
common<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.990> will<00:01:49.259> hear<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.829> gear<00:01:50.220> noise

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
common you will hear that gear noise

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.490 
common you will hear that gear noise
depending<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.750> gear<00:01:52.020> you're<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
depending on what gear you're on in the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.499 
depending on what gear you're on in the
back<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.950> don't<00:01:52.979> let<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.610> deter<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.329> from

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
back so don't let that deter you from

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.300 
back so don't let that deter you from
thinking<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.259> derailleur<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> adjusted

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
thinking that the derailleur is adjusted

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.980 
thinking that the derailleur is adjusted
correctly<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.299> want<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> make<00:01:57.630> sure<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
correctly so you want to make sure that

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.149 
correctly so you want to make sure that
if<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> hear<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> little<00:01:58.590> bit<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.950> noise

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
if you hear a little bit of that noise

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
if you hear a little bit of that noise

particular bike this thing is shifting
pretty<00:02:15.670> well<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:16.239> would<00:02:16.959> like<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:18.030> talk<00:02:19.030> about

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
pretty well I would like to talk about

wheel this derailleur has the option if

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.339 
wheel this derailleur has the option if
I<00:02:25.090> hit<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.300> with<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.420> shifter<00:02:25.810> see<00:02:25.989> how<00:02:26.080> far

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
I hit it with the shifter see how far

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.940 
I hit it with the shifter see how far
over<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:27.340> derailleur<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.940> come<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.330> way<00:02:28.540> I

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
over this derailleur can come this way I

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.059 
over this derailleur can come this way I
want<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.130> limit<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:31.300> want<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.989> stop<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.769> so

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
want to limit that I want to stop it so

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.280 
want to limit that I want to stop it so
it<00:02:33.220> can't<00:02:33.459> go<00:02:33.640> much<00:02:33.790> further<00:02:34.060> than<00:02:34.450> their<00:02:35.050> it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
it can't go much further than their it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.199 
it can't go much further than their it
just<00:02:35.500> doesn't<00:02:35.860> need<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.069> I'm<00:02:36.790> going<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.090> use

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
just doesn't need to I'm going to use

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.280 
just doesn't need to I'm going to use
this<00:02:37.330> for<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.569> intensive<00:02:37.900> purpose<00:02:38.170> of

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
this for the intensive purpose of

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.070 
this for the intensive purpose of
showing<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.709> guys<00:02:38.739> how<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:40.299> limits<00:02:40.720> crews

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
showing you guys how the limits crews

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.949 
showing you guys how the limits crews
work<00:02:41.590> now<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.610> limit<00:02:43.030> screws<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.569> most<00:02:43.840> of

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
work now the limit screws on most of

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.660 
work now the limit screws on most of
these<00:02:44.110> will<00:02:44.319> also<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.739> labeled<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.400> doubt

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
these will also be labeled and I doubt

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.520 
these will also be labeled and I doubt
you'll<00:02:45.880> be<00:02:45.940> able<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.180> get<00:02:46.330> this<00:02:46.420> on<00:02:46.600> camera<00:02:46.630> but

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
you'll be able to get this on camera but

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.830 
you'll be able to get this on camera but
there<00:02:47.709> is<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.860> low<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.700> high<00:02:48.730> limit<00:02:49.510> screw

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
there is a low and a high limit screw

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.420 
there is a low and a high limit screw
and<00:02:50.019> it's<00:02:50.140> labeled<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.650> plastic<00:02:51.190> in<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
and it's labeled on the plastic in the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.430 
and it's labeled on the plastic in the
front<00:02:51.700> here<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.690> best<00:02:52.870> way<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.080> think<00:02:53.170> about

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
front here the best way to think about

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.160 
front here the best way to think about
this<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.970> low<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.299> the<00:02:55.330> high<00:02:55.540> gear<00:02:55.930> in<00:02:56.110> a

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
this is the low in the high gear in a

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.100 
this is the low in the high gear in a
car<00:02:56.530> or<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.950> light<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.000> hard<00:02:58.510> gear<00:02:58.989> in

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
car or the light and the hard gear in

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.479 
car or the light and the hard gear in
the<00:02:59.230> car<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.650> probably<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.099> better<00:03:00.220> way<00:03:00.340> to

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
the car is probably the better way to

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.670 
the car is probably the better way to
think<00:03:00.700> about<00:03:00.849> it<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.540> H<00:03:01.810> screw<00:03:02.260> cuz<00:03:02.500> sometimes

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
think about it the H screw cuz sometimes

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.309 
think about it the H screw cuz sometimes
they'll<00:03:03.010> just<00:03:03.130> be<00:03:03.220> labeled<00:03:03.580> lnh<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.780> H<00:03:04.989> screw

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
they'll just be labeled lnh the H screw

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.400 
they'll just be labeled lnh the H screw
is<00:03:05.470> your<00:03:05.590> hardest<00:03:05.950> gear<00:03:06.299> so<00:03:07.299> in<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.690> rear<00:03:07.959> this

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
is your hardest gear so in the rear this

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.720 
is your hardest gear so in the rear this
is<00:03:08.560> where<00:03:08.709> it's<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.890> little<00:03:09.099> bit<00:03:09.220> different<00:03:09.610> in

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
is where it's a little bit different in

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.940 
is where it's a little bit different in
the<00:03:09.880> rear<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.599> H<00:03:10.780> screw<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.410> actually<00:03:11.829> the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
the rear the H screw is actually the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.460 
the rear the H screw is actually the
smallest<00:03:12.130> cog<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.930> sometimes<00:03:14.350> people

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
smallest cog so sometimes people

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.380 
smallest cog so sometimes people
actually<00:03:15.040> think<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.310> h<00:03:15.459> is<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.670> highest<00:03:16.239> and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
actually think the h is the highest and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.360 
actually think the h is the highest and
that's<00:03:16.510> not<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.900> case<00:03:17.109> so<00:03:17.380> I'm<00:03:17.980> going<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.190> come

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
that's not the case so I'm going to come

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.940 
that's not the case so I'm going to come
back<00:03:18.400> here<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.880> front<00:03:18.989> I'm<00:03:19.989> going<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.890> find

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
back here to the front I'm going to find

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.400 
back here to the front I'm going to find
my<00:03:21.310> high<00:03:22.030> limit<00:03:22.540> screw<00:03:22.810> which<00:03:22.989> is<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.260> one

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
my high limit screw which is this one

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
my high limit screw which is this one
right<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:25.440> as<00:03:26.440> I<00:03:26.590> push<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:27.010> shifter

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
right here and as I push that shifter

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.949 
right here and as I push that shifter
all<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.670> way<00:03:27.760> over<00:03:28.060> I'm<00:03:28.269> going<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.569> turn<00:03:28.750> that

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
all the way over I'm going to turn that

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.979 
all the way over I'm going to turn that
limit<00:03:29.290> screw<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:31.269> can<00:03:31.390> see<00:03:31.600> I<00:03:31.630> actually

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
limit screw and you can see I actually

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.400 
limit screw and you can see I actually
can't<00:03:32.290> go<00:03:32.380> any<00:03:32.560> further<00:03:32.709> than<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.040> now<00:03:34.410> it's

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
can't go any further than that now it's

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.620 
can't go any further than that now it's
limiting<00:03:36.040> how<00:03:36.280> far<00:03:36.639> that<00:03:36.790> derailleur<00:03:37.269> can<00:03:37.450> go

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
limiting how far that derailleur can go

so<00:03:38.440> if<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.650> loosen<00:03:39.040> this<00:03:39.190> screw<00:03:41.430> now<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.459> can<00:03:42.730> push

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
so if I loosen this screw now I can push

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.059 
so if I loosen this screw now I can push
the<00:03:43.000> derailleur<00:03:43.269> over<00:03:43.540> further<00:03:43.780> if<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.709> tighten

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
that screw I can't it's limiting how far

that screw I can't it's limiting how far
that<00:03:49.750> derailleur<00:03:50.049> can<00:03:50.319> go<00:03:50.440> again<00:03:51.130> having

that derailleur can go again having
nothing<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.730> do<00:03:51.910> with<00:03:52.060> shifting<00:03:52.359> in<00:03:52.480> between

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
nothing to do with shifting in between

I'm<00:03:53.590> going<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:53.980> bring<00:03:54.100> it<00:03:54.220> back<00:03:54.310> down<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.700> the

I'm going to bring it back down to the

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.970 
I'm going to bring it back down to the

middle ring back up to the big ring it's

the big on this particular bike I would

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.589 
the big on this particular bike I would

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
consider the shifting good be able to go

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.390 
consider the shifting good be able to go
straight<00:04:10.230> out<00:04:10.260> on<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.560> little<00:04:10.799> floor<00:04:11.040> once

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
limits cruise again is something that

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.159 
limits cruise again is something that
you<00:04:14.700> shouldn't<00:04:14.939> have<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.329> adjust<00:04:15.599> that<00:04:15.810> often

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
you shouldn't have to adjust that often

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.689 
you shouldn't have to adjust that often
we<00:04:16.680> want<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:16.979> make<00:04:17.070> sure<00:04:17.099> we're<00:04:17.310> able<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.579> go

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
we want to make sure we're able to go

we want to make sure we're able to go
over<00:04:17.970> on<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.239> video<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.810> know<00:04:18.930> how<00:04:19.049> to

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
over on this video so you know how to

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.889 
over on this video so you know how to
adjust<00:04:19.289> them<00:04:19.500> correctly
