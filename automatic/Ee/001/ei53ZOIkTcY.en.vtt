00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I think it's down to the fact that Napoli have nine points after three games whereas we only have 4 at the moment. We dropped those points against Verona

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Napoli are playing good football at the moment that have good individuals and a good collective as well

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Benitez has done well in very little time as it’s not easy to change at team, passing from one formation to one that’s completely different

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Napoli played with 3 at the back for so long and now they're playing a 4-4-2 or a 4-2-3-1

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It'll be a tough game for us tomorrow but it'll be a tough game for them too. It'll be a balanced game and we'll have to very careful and very compact

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:23.000
They have a formidable attack. Higuain is a player that seems to be completely out of the game until he scores, Hamsik is getting better every year and is taking his place as one of the best players in Europe

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Insigne is now getting his place on the starting line-up. Callejon is an international level player. It'll be a good game

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We'll go up against them tomorrow as we have against the other teams we've played against, We have players coming back from injury as well so that'll be useful

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Abate is back and so is Niang. Poli is back 100% fit, he was available on Wednesday as well but he was just back for that game. We'll see tomorrow what we can do

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I believe that the players will play a good game tomorrow and after that as far as the result goes, there are many variables and many thing can happen but I think it'll be a balanced game
