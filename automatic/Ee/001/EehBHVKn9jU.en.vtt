that<00:00:52.500> fear<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> first<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> all<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that fear out of it first of all is the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.630 
that fear out of it first of all is the
anesthesia<00:00:54.539> uh-huh<00:00:54.989> getting<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.100> injection

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
anesthesia uh-huh getting the injection

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.510 
anesthesia uh-huh getting the injection
okay<00:00:57.079> how<00:00:58.079> does<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> work<00:00:58.469> typically<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.399> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
okay how does it work typically it's a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.729 
okay how does it work typically it's a
computer-controlled<00:00:59.940> system<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
computer-controlled system this is and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.260 
computer-controlled system this is and
with<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.010> computer<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> way<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.879> does<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
with this computer the way it does if it

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
with this computer the way it does if it
senses<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.750> pressure<00:01:04.140> uh-huh<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.220> it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
senses the pressure uh-huh so it

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.859 
senses the pressure uh-huh so it
regulates<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> flow<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.510> much<00:01:06.659> more

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
regulates the flow so it's a much more

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.469 
regulates the flow so it's a much more
comfortable<00:01:07.500> way<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.610> give<00:01:08.760> an<00:01:08.880> injection<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
comfortable way to give an injection the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.240 
comfortable way to give an injection the
computer<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.110> slows<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.740> down<00:01:10.770> speeds

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
computer actually slows it down speeds

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.820 
computer actually slows it down speeds
it<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.490> serial<00:01:11.970> s<00:01:12.210> anesthesia<00:01:12.780> make<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.650> more

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
it up serial s anesthesia make it more

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.580 
it up serial s anesthesia make it more
comfortable<00:01:14.130> Wow<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.900> um<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.350> the
