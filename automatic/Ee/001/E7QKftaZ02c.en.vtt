00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.919 

I<00:00:09.950> think<00:00:10.950> it's<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.340> part<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.120> wider<00:00:12.360> vision

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
I think it's a part of a wider vision

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.079 
I think it's a part of a wider vision
for<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.830> college<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.340> terms<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.759> where<00:00:14.910> we're

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
for the college in terms of where we're

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.330 
for the college in terms of where we're
going<00:00:15.330> as<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> school<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.109> whole<00:00:16.410> technology

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
going as a school as a whole technology

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.970 
going as a school as a whole technology
fits<00:00:17.880> into<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.270> vision<00:00:18.660> but<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> reality<00:00:19.800> is

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
fits into that vision but the reality is

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.740 
fits into that vision but the reality is
that<00:00:20.010> people<00:00:20.670> make<00:00:20.699> their<00:00:21.060> own<00:00:21.090> meaning<00:00:21.570> of

the<00:00:22.410> vision<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.119> one<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.240> our<00:00:24.300> jobs<00:00:24.600> as

looking at those skills that we know

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.480 
looking at those skills that we know
were<00:01:41.020> important<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.530> hundred<00:01:41.800> years<00:01:41.979> ago<00:01:42.250> are

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
were important a hundred years ago are

were important a hundred years ago are
important<00:01:43.420> now<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.990> are<00:01:44.229> going<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.500> be<00:01:44.560> as

important now and are going to be as

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.380 
important now and are going to be as
important<00:01:45.340> probably<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.759> hundred<00:01:46.030> years<00:01:46.240> from

important probably a hundred years from
now<00:01:46.600> those<00:01:47.530> skills<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.490> qualities<00:01:48.790> are<00:01:49.030> being

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
now those skills and qualities are being

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.270 
now those skills and qualities are being
enhanced<00:01:49.690> by<00:01:49.840> technology<00:01:49.869> and<00:01:50.619> that's<00:01:50.979> really

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
enhanced by technology and that's really

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.310 
enhanced by technology and that's really
how<00:01:51.490> we're<00:01:51.700> seeing<00:01:51.970> it<00:01:52.210> all<00:01:52.360> through<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.110> lens

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
how we're seeing it all through the lens

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.469 
how we're seeing it all through the lens
though<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.860> how<00:01:53.920> does<00:01:54.640> this<00:01:54.790> improve<00:01:55.119> learning

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
though of how does this improve learning

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:03.800 
though of how does this improve learning
for<00:01:55.600> our<00:01:55.780> students

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:17.449 

I<00:02:15.410> think<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:16.560> enhanced<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.069> because<00:02:17.280> now

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
I think it's enhanced it because now

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.850 
I think it's enhanced it because now
teachers<00:02:17.790> have<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.660> many<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.470> much<00:02:19.620> more

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.410 
teachers have so many so much more
options<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.550> terms<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.880> how<00:02:20.940> they<00:02:21.180> want<00:02:21.360> to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
teach a certain lesson it's a lot more

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.059 
teach a certain lesson it's a lot more
fun<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.480> interactive<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.440> refreshes<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.980> in

technology<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:34.080> open<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.500> student

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
technology is that it's open to student

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.610 
technology is that it's open to student
initiation<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.580> it's<00:02:36.569> always<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.260> guess

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
initiation and it's always I guess

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.710 
initiation and it's always I guess
across<00:02:37.980> learning<00:02:38.459> experience<00:02:39.000> it's<00:02:39.390> never

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
across learning experience it's never

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.990 
across learning experience it's never
just<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.470> student<00:02:40.950> teaching<00:02:41.400> another<00:02:41.519> student

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
just a student teaching another student

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.250 
just a student teaching another student
and<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.209> never<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.660> teacher<00:02:42.870> teaching

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
and it's never just a teacher teaching

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.170 
and it's never just a teacher teaching
the<00:02:43.350> students<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:44.280> always<00:02:44.489> works<00:02:44.790> both<00:02:44.940> ways

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the students it always works both ways

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.090 
the students it always works both ways
that<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.049> student<00:02:46.410> has<00:02:46.500> some<00:02:46.590> measure<00:02:46.890> for

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
that the student has some measure for

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.259 
that the student has some measure for
the<00:02:47.160> teacher<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.760> teacher<00:02:47.790> some<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
the teacher and the teacher some of the

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.390 
the teacher and the teacher some of the
sheriff's<00:02:48.510> students<00:02:48.989> which<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.799> think<00:02:50.099> is<00:02:50.370> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
sheriff's students which I think is a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.100 
sheriff's students which I think is a
big<00:02:50.760> part<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.269> entire<00:02:51.480> UW<00:02:51.630> Tech

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
big part of the entire UW Tech

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.860 
big part of the entire UW Tech
experience<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.709> think<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:54.450> college<00:02:54.750> is

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
experience I think the college is

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.650 
experience I think the college is
preparing<00:02:55.349> us<00:02:55.470> well<00:02:55.830> for<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.819> new<00:02:57.000> technology

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
preparing us well for the new technology

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.930 
preparing us well for the new technology
side<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.110> world<00:02:58.260> because<00:02:59.069> I<00:02:59.280> think<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
side of the world because I think the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.699 
side of the world because I think the
future<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.269> technology<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.959> really<00:03:01.260> just

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
future of technology is really just

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.850 
future of technology is really just
using<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.519> collaboratively<00:03:03.180> online<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:04.530> do

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
using it collaboratively online to do

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.140 
using it collaboratively online to do
different<00:03:05.220> things<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:05.640> couldn't<00:03:05.970> do<00:03:06.090> it

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
different things we couldn't do it

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.470 
different things we couldn't do it
together

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
together

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.410 
together
um<00:03:06.660> no<00:03:07.260> online<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.980> one<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.880> things<00:03:09.090> that

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
um no online and one of the things that

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.020 
um no online and one of the things that
you<00:03:09.630> often<00:03:09.900> hear<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.730> technology<00:03:11.730> drives

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
you often hear is that technology drives

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.819 
you often hear is that technology drives
us<00:03:12.269> apart<00:03:12.390> keeps<00:03:12.989> us<00:03:13.200> separate<00:03:13.560> than<00:03:13.799> the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
us apart keeps us separate than the

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.460 
us apart keeps us separate than the
younger<00:03:14.549> generation<00:03:15.209> but<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.690> found<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:16.260> it's

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
younger generation but I found that it's

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.949 
younger generation but I found that it's
it's<00:03:16.890> brought<00:03:17.160> us<00:03:17.310> together<00:03:17.459> we<00:03:18.239> through

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
it's brought us together we through

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.050 
it's brought us together we through
technology<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.709> learn<00:03:19.950> together<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.700> we

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
technology we learn together and we

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.360 
technology we learn together and we
enter<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.510> students<00:03:21.989> world<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
enter the students world and the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.019 
enter the students world and the
students<00:03:23.819> can<00:03:24.120> become<00:03:24.480> teachers
