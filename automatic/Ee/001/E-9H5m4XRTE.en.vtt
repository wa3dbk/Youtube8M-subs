00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.170 
today we're gonna learn how to use the

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.949 
today we're gonna learn how to use the
bow<00:00:01.730> playing<00:00:02.730> open<00:00:03.060> strings<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.689> playing

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
bow playing open strings and playing

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.900 
bow playing open strings and playing
open<00:00:04.259> strings<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.710> when<00:00:04.920> you<00:00:05.370> don't<00:00:05.490> use<00:00:05.700> any

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
open strings is when you don't use any

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.020 
open strings is when you don't use any
fingers<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:07.140> play<00:00:07.319> notes<00:00:07.700> so<00:00:08.700> makes<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:08.970> a

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
fingers to play notes so makes it a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.160 
fingers to play notes so makes it a
little<00:00:09.120> bit<00:00:09.300> easier<00:00:09.630> so<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.840> can<00:00:09.990> just

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
little bit easier so you can just

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.039 
little bit easier so you can just
concentrate<00:00:10.740> on<00:00:10.769> hitting<00:00:11.219> these<00:00:11.370> strings<00:00:12.049> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
concentrate on hitting these strings the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.150 
concentrate on hitting these strings the
biggest<00:00:13.380> thing<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.530> you're<00:00:13.799> going<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:13.980> want

biggest thing that you're going to want

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.430 
biggest thing that you're going to want
to<00:00:14.250> try<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.759> do<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.269> not<00:00:15.719> touch<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.260> other

to try to do is not touch the other

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.760 
to try to do is not touch the other
strings<00:00:16.859> while<00:00:17.190> playing<00:00:17.520> each<00:00:17.820> string<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:19.680> we

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
strings while playing each string and we

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.650 
strings while playing each string and we
have<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.250> e<00:00:20.279> string<00:00:20.850> which<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> highest

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
have the e string which is the highest

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.910 
have the e string which is the highest
string<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> string<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:25.380> D<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.599> the<00:00:27.599> G<00:00:27.920> so

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
string the a string the D and the G so

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.490 
string the a string the D and the G so
on<00:00:29.039> my<00:00:29.160> board<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.029> some<00:00:30.300> notes<00:00:30.539> that

and the a string so one thing to
remember<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> bow<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.160> making<00:00:38.879> sure

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
remember with the bow is making sure

the a string your elbow should be a
little<00:00:42.870> bit<00:00:42.960> lower<00:00:43.170> than<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> instrument<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
little bit lower than the instrument and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.430 
little bit lower than the instrument and
the<00:00:44.969> D<00:00:45.180> string<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.600> elbow<00:00:45.870> should<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.170> about

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the D string the elbow should be about

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.170 
the D string the elbow should be about
even<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> instrument<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.000> this

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
even with the instrument just like this

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.900 
even with the instrument just like this
I<00:00:48.450> would<00:00:49.410> say<00:00:49.559> start<00:00:49.860> off<00:00:50.039> about<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.340> here

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
I would say start off about right here

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.819 
I would say start off about right here
you<00:00:51.149> about<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> little<00:00:51.870> bit<00:00:52.020> less<00:00:52.199> than<00:00:52.440> mid<00:00:52.620> bow

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you about a little bit less than mid bow

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.010 
you about a little bit less than mid bow
you<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:53.910> want<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.329> area<00:00:54.570> start

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you don't want to be in this area start

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.470 
you don't want to be in this area start
throw<00:00:55.980> back<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.059> want<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> go<00:00:57.329> all

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
throw back here and you want to go all

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.240 
throw back here and you want to go all
the<00:00:57.600> way<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> tip<00:00:58.079> over<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.949> end<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the way to the tip over the end of the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.910 
the way to the tip over the end of the
bow<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.719> would<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> D<00:01:01.350> string<00:01:01.859> stroke

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
bow so this would be a D string stroke

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.640 
bow so this would be a D string stroke
it's<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.330> you're<00:01:07.320> gonna<00:01:07.409> go

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
it's like that and then you're gonna go

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.539 
it's like that and then you're gonna go
the<00:01:07.979> other<00:01:08.100> direction<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.180> oh<00:01:10.549> that

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the other direction which is up oh that

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.660 
the other direction which is up oh that
would<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.790> another<00:01:12.060> D<00:01:12.330> string<00:01:12.600> stroke<00:01:13.670> another

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
would be another D string stroke another

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.890 
would be another D string stroke another
thing<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.270> want<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> make<00:01:15.600> sure<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
thing to that you want to make sure is

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.090 
thing to that you want to make sure is
that<00:01:15.960> you're<00:01:16.170> playing<00:01:16.350> nice<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.770> straight

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that you're playing nice and straight

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.580 
that you're playing nice and straight
and<00:01:18.030> sometimes<00:01:18.479> helps<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.080> yourself<00:01:19.439> in

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and sometimes helps to see yourself in

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.620 
and sometimes helps to see yourself in
the<00:01:19.680> mirror<00:01:20.009> doing<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> make

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the mirror doing this so just to make

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.280 
the mirror doing this so just to make
sure<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.900> your<00:01:21.990> boa<00:01:22.140> straights

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
sure that your boa straights

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.450 
sure that your boa straights
because<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.530> was<00:01:24.620> a<00:01:24.650> d-string<00:01:25.010> stroke<00:01:25.340> now

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
because that was a d-string stroke now

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.220 
because that was a d-string stroke now
we're<00:01:25.580> going<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.730> try<00:01:25.850> an<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.090> strange<00:01:26.390> joke<00:01:26.690> so
