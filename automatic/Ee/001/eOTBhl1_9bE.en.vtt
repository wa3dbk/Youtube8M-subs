malting<00:00:09.929> barley<00:00:10.969> this<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.179> pretty<00:00:13.139> much

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
malting barley this is pretty much

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.330 
malting barley this is pretty much
tipple<00:00:15.379> in<00:00:16.379> which<00:00:16.529> we've<00:00:16.710> been<00:00:16.830> cutting<00:00:17.160> for

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
tipple in which we've been cutting for

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.950 
tipple in which we've been cutting for
the<00:00:17.430> last<00:00:17.609> couple<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.000> days<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:20.420> so<00:00:21.420> quite<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the last couple of days and so quite a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.590 
the last couple of days and so quite a
nice<00:00:22.170> sample<00:00:22.500> quite<00:00:22.949> nice<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.460> bright<00:00:23.699> not

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
nice sample quite nice and bright not

nice sample quite nice and bright not
too<00:00:24.660> much<00:00:25.019> rubbish<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.650> not<00:00:25.800> too<00:00:26.039> much<00:00:26.220> dust

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
too much rubbish in it not too much dust

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.310 
too much rubbish in it not too much dust
and<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.970> far<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.359> samples<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:30.960> been<00:00:30.990> coming

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and so far the samples have been coming

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.220 
and so far the samples have been coming
back<00:00:31.730> quite<00:00:32.730> satisfactorily<00:00:33.540> really<00:00:33.989> we've

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
back quite satisfactorily really we've

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.750 
back quite satisfactorily really we've
got<00:00:34.469> sort<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.870> nitrogens<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> range<00:00:37.469> of

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
got sort of nitrogens in the range of

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.299 
got sort of nitrogens in the range of
1.6<00:00:38.760> 1.8<00:00:40.790> that<00:00:41.790> affects<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.480> amount<00:00:42.750> of

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
1.6 1.8 that affects the amount of

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.950 
1.6 1.8 that affects the amount of
molten<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.640> extracted<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.750> lower

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
molten can be extracted the lower

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.500 
molten can be extracted the lower
nitrogen<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:47.309> more<00:00:47.550> molt<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.530> team<00:00:49.829> at

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
nitrogen the more molt the team at

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
nitrogen the more molt the team at
burton-on-trent<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.230> extract<00:00:52.800> from<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
burton-on-trent and extract from the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.600 
burton-on-trent and extract from the
grain<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.649> we're<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.770> fourteen<00:00:56.370> percent

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
grain and we're about fourteen percent

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.029 
grain and we're about fourteen percent
moisture<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> store<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.379> that's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
moisture in the store here so that's

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.970 
moisture in the store here so that's
quite<00:00:59.219> good<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.969> noise<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.449> hear<00:01:00.980> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
quite good the noise you can hear is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.560 
quite good the noise you can hear is
coming<00:01:02.309> from<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> top<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.910> those<00:01:03.000> big<00:01:03.359> long

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
coming from the top of those big long

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.280 
coming from the top of those big long
tubes<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.559> those<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.979> fans<00:01:05.990> which<00:01:06.990> were

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
tubes and those are the fans which were

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.210 
tubes and those are the fans which were
cooling<00:01:07.890> fans

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
cooling fans

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.560 
cooling fans
with<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.490> big<00:01:10.670> lighted<00:01:11.000> up<00:01:11.090> there<00:01:11.270> that's<00:01:11.420> an

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
with a big lighted up there that's an

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.880 
with a big lighted up there that's an
extraction<00:01:11.930> plan<00:01:12.290> as<00:01:12.440> well<00:01:12.620> so<00:01:12.800> that's

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
extraction plan as well so that's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.130 
extraction plan as well so that's
sucking<00:01:13.370> sucking<00:01:14.210> air<00:01:14.480> out<00:01:14.510> through<00:01:14.960> the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
sucking sucking air out through the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.690 
sucking sucking air out through the
grain<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.620> then<00:01:15.710> expelling<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.400> into<00:01:16.610> the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
grain and then expelling it into the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.970 
grain and then expelling it into the
roofer<00:01:17.030> then<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:17.300> fan<00:01:17.510> that<00:01:17.720> they're<00:01:17.980> taking

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
roofer then the fan that they're taking

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.480 
roofer then the fan that they're taking
it<00:01:19.220> away<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:20.570> germination<00:01:21.140> on<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:21.650> has<00:01:21.830> been

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
it away the germination on this has been

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.690 
it away the germination on this has been
ok<00:01:22.910> so<00:01:23.210> far<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.570> got<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:23.840> rapid<00:01:24.230> germ<00:01:24.500> on<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.490> of

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
ok so far it's got a rapid germ on it of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.140 
ok so far it's got a rapid germ on it of
a<00:01:25.760> test<00:01:26.060> of<00:01:26.650> 99<00:01:27.650> cent<00:01:28.190> germination<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:28.970> that's

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
a test of 99 cent germination so that's

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.610 
a test of 99 cent germination so that's
good<00:01:29.360> needs<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.840> be<00:01:29.960> over<00:01:30.170> ninety<00:01:30.500> eight

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
good needs to be over ninety eight

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.690 
good needs to be over ninety eight
percent<00:01:30.970> so<00:01:32.020> it's<00:01:33.020> not<00:01:33.170> too<00:01:33.470> not<00:01:34.100> too<00:01:34.160> hot<00:01:34.520> in

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
percent so it's not too not too hot in

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.040 
percent so it's not too not too hot in
the<00:01:34.820> store<00:01:35.120> either<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.440> fingers<00:01:36.860> crossed<00:01:38.050> this

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
the store either so fingers crossed this

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.380 
the store either so fingers crossed this
should<00:01:39.260> all<00:01:39.730> should<00:01:40.730> all<00:01:40.850> make<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.150> grade

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
should all should all make the grade

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.030 
should all should all make the grade
which<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.750> just<00:01:41.930> as<00:01:42.110> well<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.590> think<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.860> said

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
which is just as well so I think I said

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.469 
which is just as well so I think I said
in<00:01:43.160> another<00:01:43.340> harvest<00:01:43.760> love<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.119> other<00:01:44.300> day

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
in another harvest love the other day

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.880 
in another harvest love the other day
there<00:01:44.720> is<00:01:44.810> an<00:01:44.900> awful<00:01:45.170> lot<00:01:45.229> of<00:01:45.290> spring<00:01:45.619> barley

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
there is an awful lot of spring barley

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.490 
there is an awful lot of spring barley
in<00:01:46.130> there<00:01:46.630> yeah<00:01:47.630> that's<00:01:47.960> been<00:01:48.170> planted<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:50.500> we

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
in there yeah that's been planted so we

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.930 
in there yeah that's been planted so we
really<00:01:51.680> need<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.070> some<00:01:52.250> tip-top<00:01:52.610> stuff

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
really need to have some tip-top stuff
