00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.830

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
all right now I've got the zoom all

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.240 
all right now I've got the zoom all
hooked<00:02:48.110> up<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.770> turned<00:02:49.610> on<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.180> ready<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.420> go

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
hooked up and turned on and ready to go

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.060

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
I'm gonna get a little loud but all

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.520 
I'm gonna get a little loud but all
you're<00:02:55.400> really<00:02:55.550> hearing<00:02:56.030> now<00:02:56.510> is<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.290> zoom

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
you're really hearing now is the zoom

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.240 
you're really hearing now is the zoom
microphone<00:02:57.800> itself<00:02:59.320> should<00:03:00.320> be<00:03:00.350> quite<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> bit

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
microphone itself should be quite a bit

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.160 
microphone itself should be quite a bit
clearer<00:03:02.230> what<00:03:03.230> was<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:05.510> should<00:03:05.750> be<00:03:05.900> quite

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
clearer what was that it should be quite

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.610 
clearer what was that it should be quite
a<00:03:06.200> bit<00:03:06.470> clearer<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.750> we'll<00:03:08.750> see<00:03:09.290> how<00:03:09.530> she

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
a bit clearer and we'll see how she

00:03:09.620 --> 00:04:02.000 
a bit clearer and we'll see how she
sounds<00:03:10.010> now<00:03:10.430> with<00:03:10.790> this

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.640 

all<00:04:03.010> right<00:04:03.160> now<00:04:03.430> if<00:04:03.850> you'll<00:04:04.120> notice<00:04:04.570> I<00:04:04.840> did

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
all right now if you'll notice I did

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.370 
all right now if you'll notice I did
actually<00:04:05.920> take<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.610> from<00:04:07.120> for<00:04:07.750> channel<00:04:08.200> down

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
actually take it from for channel down

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.400 
actually take it from for channel down
to<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.800> channel<00:04:09.480> because<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.690> four<00:04:11.020> channels

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
to to channel because the four channels

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.530 
to to channel because the four channels
still<00:04:11.710> not<00:04:12.280> going<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.550> convey<00:04:13.150> through<00:04:13.480> this

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
still not going to convey through this

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.330 
still not going to convey through this
so<00:04:16.540> I<00:04:16.600> just<00:04:16.870> switched<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.530> left<00:04:17.980> and<00:04:18.160> right

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
so I just switched it to left and right

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.280 
so I just switched it to left and right
stereo<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:22.660> can<00:04:22.870> make<00:04:23.050> your<00:04:23.260> own

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
stereo and you can make your own

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.090 
stereo and you can make your own
judgments<00:04:23.950> as<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.220> how<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:24.550> sounds<00:04:24.580> but<00:04:26.100> I've

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
judgments as to how it sounds but I've

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.310 
judgments as to how it sounds but I've
noticed<00:04:27.640> a<00:04:27.790> huge<00:04:27.820> difference<00:04:28.270> just<00:04:28.930> in<00:04:29.080> the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
noticed a huge difference just in the

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.650 
noticed a huge difference just in the
standard<00:04:29.950> mic<00:04:30.880> that's<00:04:31.120> built<00:04:31.390> into<00:04:31.600> the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
standard mic that's built into the

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.890 
standard mic that's built into the
camera<00:04:31.900> which<00:04:32.320> isn't<00:04:32.650> really<00:04:32.950> much<00:04:33.100> count<00:04:33.900> it

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
camera which isn't really much count it

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.100 
camera which isn't really much count it
also<00:04:35.050> clips<00:04:35.620> out<00:04:35.860> in<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.340> shows<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:37.000> was<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
also clips out in the shows that was the

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.690 
also clips out in the shows that was the
whole<00:04:38.290> reason<00:04:38.320> for<00:04:38.920> getting<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:39.310> external

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
whole reason for getting this external

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.770 
whole reason for getting this external
microphone<00:04:40.530> but<00:04:41.530> yeah<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.490> mean<00:04:42.850> I'm<00:04:43.570> going<00:04:43.690> to

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
microphone but yeah I mean I'm going to
