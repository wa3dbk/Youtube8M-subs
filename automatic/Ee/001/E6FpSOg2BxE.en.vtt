00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:07.019
The NASA ESA Hubble Space Telescope is famous
for looking deep into the past of the Universe.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.830
But it can also predict the future.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.150
Pictures made by Hubble over the years show
us the fate of the Solar System: a troubling

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.230
but beautiful preview of what will happen
when the Sun runs out of fuel more than five

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.019
billion years from now.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.880
Don't panic just yet.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.490
The Sun is about 4 1Ãš2 billion years old
- that's old by most standards, but less than

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.860
half way through its expected lifespan.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.790
However by observing countless stars similar
to the Sun, scientists now have a good idea

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.660
of what will happen to the Solar System in
the very distant future.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.230
Stars are balls of matter that produce energy
mainly by fusing atomic nuclei of hydrogen,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.330
forming helium.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.900
Now, when two nuclei fuse together, their
combined mass is slightly less than the sum

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:09.350
of the two original nuclei, and the difference
is released as energy.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.280
That's where sunlight comes from... and it's
also the process that powers thermonuclear

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.280
bombs.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.049
But while thermonuclear bombs use up their
fuel in just a fraction of a second, stars

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.719
are big enough to sustain nuclear fusion for
millions or indeed billions of years before

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:33.790
they too eventually run out of fuel.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.429
What happens next depends on the size of the
star.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:58.530
Really big stars explode as supernovae after
only a few million years, while the smallest

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.999
stars burn slowly enough to be virtually immortal:
their expected lifespan is much longer than

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:11.000
the present age of the Universe, meaning we've
never seen one die.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.230
But for stars like the Sun, which have a lifespan
measured in billions of years, astronomers

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.920
have made many observations of what happens
when the fuel supply runs out.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.610
They end with a whimper, not a bang.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.770
Here's how it goes - as revealed by Hubble
observations of dozens of stars at different

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.710
stages of evolution.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:40.640
First, the star swells up and cools down a
little, becoming a so-called red giant.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.620
When the Sun does this, it will destroy the
inner planets of the Solar System.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:56.530
Next, the outer layers are puffed out, forming
a dense cloud of gas and dust that totally

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.180
obscures the visible light from the star.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.830
This stage, called a pre-planetary, or protoplanetary
nebula, is tough to observe as it's so faint

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.290
- only dim infrared emissions from the dust
cloud and reflected starlight let astronomers

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.560
see anything at all.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.790
It's also a short period in stellar evolution,
just a few thousand years long, so these objects

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.940
are quite scarce.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.630
Hubble's images of pre-planetary nebulae show
a wide variety of shapes, hinting at complex

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.920
dynamics going on inside.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.730
The spiral structure of this nebula is particularly
unusual, and is likely due to a binary star

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.290
system shaping the cloud of gas and dust.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.830
As the star ejects its outer layers to form
the cold pre-planetary nebula, the core of

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.420
the star is left behind, leaving a small but
very hot remnant.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.050
Over a period of a few thousand years, radiation
from this hot leftover excites the gas in

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:12.790
the pre-planetary nebula, eventually making
it light up like a fluorescent sign.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.789
At this point, the faint pre-planetary nebula
becomes a bright planetary nebula.

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:24.569
In fact, these are bright enough that astronomers
have long been able to see them, which explains

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.870
their confusing name.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.030
Because they appear roughly spherical and
have a greenish tinge when observed visually,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.130
astronomers using early telescopes found their
appearance reminiscent of the planets of the

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.360
Solar System.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.050
High resolution observations from modern telescopes
including Hubble show that their shapes are

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.460
often far from spherical, and the planet-like
appearance is pretty dubious - but the name

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.680
has stuck.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.599
Eventually, planetary nebulae fade to nothing
as the gas and dust is diffused into space.

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:07.050
All that remains is a tiny, dense and dim
white dwarf - the ultimate destination of

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.479
the Sun, billions of years from now.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.770
But for stars there is life after death.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.680
The matter puffed into space by planetary
nebulae forms the building blocks for new

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.091
generations of stars and planets.

00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:24.091
But for stars there is life after death.

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:25.091
The matter puffed into space by planetary
nebulae forms the building blocks for new

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:25.094
generations of stars
