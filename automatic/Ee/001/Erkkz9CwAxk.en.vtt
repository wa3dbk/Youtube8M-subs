00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.969
 let's prepare some hamburgers with 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.950
 amaranth to see what is a very 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.350
 simple we are also going to save a little 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.879
 of meat because we really put it 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.410
 a lot of meat and this time not what 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.090
 we are going to do so almost we are almost going to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.600
 stay out of the street we will see what is 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.080
 easy 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 do not carry so many ingredients and 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.650
 finally we are going to obtain a product 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.800
 nutritious with protein 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.080
 minerals and obviously also with something 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.900
 of fresh vegetables and this is going to be a 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.670
 dish very very balanced and very rich for 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.950
 our recipes we need 200 grams 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.970
 of amaranth 4 eggs 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.770
 half diced onion 150 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.170
 grams of ground beef can be beef 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.760
 or pig or both if they do not consume 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.040
 Beef or pork can do it with 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.560
 equal chicken replacing it with the same 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.570
 quantity 150 grams 2 tablespoons 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.610
 chopped parsley to account that the parsley and 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.830
 all the guerritas must be put in 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.690
 some water that floats so that all 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.580
 the land they have goes to the bottom of 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.590
 Alicante and apart to put a little bit of 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.479
 droplets to disinfect the 3 minutes 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.060
 they're not going to leave it long two 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.310
 pinches of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.980
 water 2 pinches powdered onion 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.190
 dust 2 tracks 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.170
 white pepper salt to taste 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.240
 frying oil and well I'm going to 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.190
 accompany with the vinaigrette 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.190
 grated pine carrot 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.280
 first we are going to put in a bowl 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.049
 or a saucepan what they have at home that 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.820
 be quite broad 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.530
 let's empty the amaranth the four 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.990
 eggs let's mix a little bit with a 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.080
 have cited this mixture 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.760
 I 'm not going to put the onion 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.040
 I might 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.800
 add a little peanut or a 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.050
 little bit of almond 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.100
 minced and obviously it would give it a flavor 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.100
 richest meat 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.880
 our tracks there are tracks with two fingers 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.580
 of spades with three fingers I suggest that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.799
 for this to be with three fingers something that is 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.549
 interesting when one makes meatballs 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:10.539
 is that sometimes when we work meats 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.190
 raw they say how I taste it of salt already 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.569
 that if it's a bit complicated but 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.580
 times if it is necessary that although this 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.630
 raw try it a little bit 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.430
 and now I'm going to mix it 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.740
 many times we see the amaranth in the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.780
 market and we think that nothing else we can 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.370
 do joys rather have many 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.490
 Uses we can do current we can 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.600
 make smoothies 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.270
 we can make tortillas combine 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.430
 tortilla dough with a little flour 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.860
 of amaranth will again give us a 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.330
 rich texture also how can you 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.710
 integrate now if I 'm going to get more what 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.510
 they are very clean, you have to have 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.830
 a lot of hygiene to prepare them so that 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.890
 do not eat much meat're 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.870
 a good oil option 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.880
 and sometimes in the kitchen we to be 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.160
 very perfectionists we try to look 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.920
 another type of utensils that help us 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.260
 do something very round and for that 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.060
 we use these hoops that are steel hoops 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.330
 that we can really put on the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.030
 skillet 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.620
 we put there in our preparation and with 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.319
 a teaspoon presents it very well that 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.260
 we are going to do it 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.540
 to see what is left 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.819
 a very round burger even 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.090
 this recipe can we put in place of 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.970
 Ground beef 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.120
 tuna in oil that I think has 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.120
 plus 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.319
 I already have my pan cited here to fire 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.560
 medium 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.620
 and I'm going to put the hoop 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.650
 pan and 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.650
 then they say that power is not allowed 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.260
 as new that is going to have a vital 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.420
 I'm going to do it 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.129
 the only thing I'm doing is that it 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.830
 extend very well so that I stay what 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.660
 roundest possible 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.460
 This is perfection of the kitchen but 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.250
 well I think it will be playing a little bit 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.010
 with what we have in this kitchen 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.930
 I do not burn, nothing happens, the spoon 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.940
 I had to get wet with a little oil 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.680
 so that obviously my 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.510
 hamburger and once I take 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.010
 consistency has already taken shape 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.959
 so I do not know if you're overheating and 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.820
 obviously you can do other more 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.320
 now if they wanted to take away the excess 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.389
 good fat I put a little chat with a 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.660
 little brown paper in a 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.660
 tray 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.080
 it can be dexterity or kitchen paper that 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.659
 It is also absorbent 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.760
 the excess that could have but 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.710
 normally it does not absorb so much 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.540
 I'm not touching the center to see if 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.160
 it is firm if it is firm, it is already good 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.390
 cooked if you're still very granny 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.390
 center that says that the lack 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.710
 while it is finishing our 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.670
 a hamburger 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.580
 let's ride our plate 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.040
 bougainvillea bougainvillea vinaigrette 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.840
 it's a combustible flower 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.010
 and really here I have a little tree in 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.230
 home but you can do it 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.880
 also a neighbor sign always and 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.050
 when it is not in some avenues 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.090
 because then it's my turn 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.090
 flowers that are in very large avenues 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.449
 greasy really pollution 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.130
 vehicles if you win with finishing many 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.190
 m because it opens a more decent house 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.889
 with so much traffic and the leaves the flower 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.440
 it is cut I put it in water with droplets 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:34.380
 to disinfect about 34 minutes 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.030
 He took it out of there and let them dry and also 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.639
 I can take them out in the oven with a little ax 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.729
 with the absorbent and once they are 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.710
 dry blend the vinegar to liquefy the 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.270
 vinaigretta liquidated him separately I put him 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.130
 flowers and obviously there will liquefy 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.750
 It goes a little purple does not give a taste 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.949
 so characteristic but if you give everything 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.580
 the starting model of quite 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.840
 interesting more the taste is not strong 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.130
 but we can use those flowers 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.409
 that are out there wasted that 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.229
 I think they bring a lot to the kitchen one 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.699
 this is the bougainvillea if you know it 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.999
 there are several shades there are oranges and 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:09.429
 yellow there are roses there are like these are 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.999
 Moraditas and is important when 

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:12.009
 kitchen 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:13.719
 nothing else I take this away even this 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:17.009
 part of here led her to cut also 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:17.009
 because it is not more pleasant to the palate 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.539
 use it also for dried cakes 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:25.239
 I put a little bit of emily sometimes the 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.979
 sugar and those of josé carlos rivero in 

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:28.899
 this case the press that liquefies it with the 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.869
 vinegar and obviously has a vinaigrette 

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:34.479
 with bougainvillea good and after so much 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:36.729
 process came the nicest hour to 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.639
 enjoy a recipe that serve it and 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.769
 obviously try it we have here in 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.960
 our pancakes our hamburgers 

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:46.120
 as you want to call 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.030
 what I 'm going to do is cut a the 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.050
 cut in half to serve it and a 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.870
 side 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:57.680
 a little bit of cucumbers a little bit of 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:00.110
 carrot the lettuce I'm going to chop and 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.129
 finally I'm going to put this vinaigrette 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.129
 of bugambilias 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:07.289
 that the base of the vinaigrette is 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:09.779
 3 oil for one of vinegar in 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:14.639
 amounts can be whatever and now 

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:16.889
 a little bit the color that gives this 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:18.929
 vinaigrette the vinaigrette whenever 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:20.759
 put a little sugar to lower the 

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:23.279
 acidity many times we forget 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:26.759
 put a little sugar or honey and 

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:28.619
 well finally we have our 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:31.470
 amaranth burger with a rich 

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:36.030
 salad and with a vinaigrette 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:38.070
 of bugambilia moradita that is very 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.710
 nutritious and that is easy to prepare and 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.630
 which replaces so much in economics 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.120
 as in time a lot of work in the 

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:48.350
 kitchen waiting for you to have enjoyed 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.540
 with us this amaranth kitchen 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.070
 a plant native to Mexico and that 

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.680
 all these dishes can make them 

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:59.520
 in your home in an easy practical way 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.400
 and economic and remembering that it is a 

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:06.920
 very nutritious food easy to 

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.920
 get and also very Mexican 

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.780
