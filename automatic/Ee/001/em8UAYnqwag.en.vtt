00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
too expensive I looked up their other

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.240 
too expensive I looked up their other
stuff<00:04:25.849> and<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.330> prices<00:04:26.750> are<00:04:26.900> all<00:04:27.250> reasonably

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
stuff and the prices are all reasonably

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.439 
stuff and the prices are all reasonably
long<00:04:29.090> so<00:04:29.509> I<00:04:30.729> would<00:04:31.729> recommend<00:04:31.760> getting<00:04:32.270> one

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
long so I would recommend getting one

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.600 
long so I would recommend getting one
because<00:04:32.870> it's<00:04:33.169> the<00:04:34.099> only<00:04:34.159> thing<00:04:34.430> that

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
because it's the only thing that

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.140 
because it's the only thing that
compares<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.150> is<00:04:35.479> a<00:04:36.250> tech<00:04:37.250> deck<00:04:37.490> barrier<00:04:37.940> and

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
compares to is a tech deck barrier and

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.719 
compares to is a tech deck barrier and
that's<00:04:41.150> still<00:04:41.449> I<00:04:41.810> mean<00:04:42.560> not<00:04:43.010> even<00:04:43.039> really<00:04:43.460> the

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
that's still I mean not even really the

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.270 
that's still I mean not even really the
same<00:04:44.270> shape<00:04:44.659> or<00:04:45.199> it's<00:04:45.409> the<00:04:45.530> same<00:04:45.740> shape<00:04:46.099> just

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
same shape or it's the same shape just

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.140 
same shape or it's the same shape just
not<00:04:46.520> really<00:04:46.849> the<00:04:46.940> same<00:04:47.349> height<00:04:48.349> with<00:04:49.070> like
