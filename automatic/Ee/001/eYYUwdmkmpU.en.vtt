00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
flash and you cannot take or uncheck if

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.620 
flash and you cannot take or uncheck if
this<00:04:31.830> is<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.039> picture<00:04:32.760> mode

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.610

and this option is there for recording
so<00:04:39.620> let's<00:04:39.830> check<00:04:40.040> out<00:04:40.160> how<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.790> image<00:04:40.970> has

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
so let's check out how the image has

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.650 
so let's check out how the image has
come

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.620 

it<00:04:45.230> was<00:04:45.350> just<00:04:45.500> quite<00:04:45.800> good<00:04:46.040> and<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:47.330> picture

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
it was just quite good and the picture

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.350 
it was just quite good and the picture
is<00:04:47.660> not<00:04:47.750> pixelating<00:04:48.470> by<00:04:48.860> any<00:04:49.100> manner<00:04:49.370> that

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
is not pixelating by any manner that

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.390 
is not pixelating by any manner that
means<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.870> camera<00:04:51.440> quality<00:04:51.590> is<00:04:51.980> pretty<00:04:52.220> much

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
means the camera quality is pretty much

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.850 
means the camera quality is pretty much
good<00:04:52.700> as<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:53.540> uses<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.960> same<00:04:54.140> sensitizer<00:04:54.620> of

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
good as it uses the same sensitizer of

good as it uses the same sensitizer of
Sony's<00:04:55.310> Xperia<00:04:55.550> Z<00:04:59.620> dash<00:05:00.620> but<00:05:00.920> not<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.220> least
