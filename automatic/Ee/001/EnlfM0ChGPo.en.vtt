can<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:26.940> everything<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.650> I've

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
can see everything that's here so I've

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.640 
can see everything that's here so I've
got<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.070> cpu<00:01:29.850> information<00:01:30.330> here<00:01:30.510> user<00:01:30.810> system

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
got my cpu information here user system

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.800 
got my cpu information here user system
nice<00:01:32.040> Idol<00:01:32.640> you've<00:01:33.120> got<00:01:33.300> these<00:01:33.420> cool<00:01:33.750> little

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
nice Idol you've got these cool little

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.290 
nice Idol you've got these cool little
waves<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.270> you

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
waves that you can see here and so you

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.180 
waves that you can see here and so you
know<00:01:36.450> when<00:01:37.260> they're<00:01:37.470> filled<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.010> way<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
know when they're filled all the way to

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.560 
know when they're filled all the way to
the<00:01:38.310> top<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.730> probably<00:01:38.820> good<00:01:39.090> idea<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.420> turn

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the top it's probably good idea to turn

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.720 
the top it's probably good idea to turn
off<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> computer<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:40.440> how<00:01:41.160> to<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.400> give<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
off the computer or how to know give it

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.930 
off the computer or how to know give it
a<00:01:41.790> rest<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.300> bit<00:01:42.890> load<00:01:43.890> average<00:01:44.070> processes
