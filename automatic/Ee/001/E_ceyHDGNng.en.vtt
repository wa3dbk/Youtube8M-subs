00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.130 

because<00:03:28.880> at<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> end<00:03:29.120> they<00:03:29.450> had<00:03:29.660> two<00:03:29.930> guys

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
because at the end they had two guys

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.730 
because at the end they had two guys
left<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.770> I<00:03:31.670> was<00:03:31.880> on<00:03:32.000> one<00:03:32.210> dude<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:33.320> sorbets

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
on the other and I wound up thinking

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.180 
on the other and I wound up thinking
that<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:39.350> other<00:03:39.380> one<00:03:39.650> was<00:03:39.740> gonna<00:03:39.920> die<00:03:40.010> about

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
that the other one was gonna die about

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.440 
that the other one was gonna die about
my<00:03:40.310> diets<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.880> one<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.150> was<00:03:41.240> a<00:03:41.270> little

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
my diets the one that was a little

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.960 
my diets the one that was a little
health<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.020> I<00:03:42.260> was<00:03:42.530> wrong<00:03:42.830> so<00:03:43.430> we<00:03:43.580> decide<00:03:43.940> to

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
health and I was wrong so we decide to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.380 
health and I was wrong so we decide to
refocus<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:45.410> also<00:03:46.100> see<00:03:46.430> here<00:03:46.670> where<00:03:46.880> someone

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
refocus I also see here where someone

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.430 
refocus I also see here where someone
mentions<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:49.220> our<00:03:49.370> positioning<00:03:50.440> didn't

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
mentions that our positioning didn't

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.370 
mentions that our positioning didn't
feel<00:03:51.680> good<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.660> that's<00:03:53.660> what<00:03:53.959> made<00:03:54.200> me<00:03:54.230> think

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
feel good so that's what made me think

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.870 
feel good so that's what made me think
well<00:03:55.310> we'll<00:03:55.430> try<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:55.670> other<00:03:55.880> side<00:04:00.880> but

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
well we'll try the other side but

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.670 
well we'll try the other side but
overall<00:04:02.300> like<00:04:02.720> I<00:04:02.750> mean<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:04.280> feels<00:04:04.790> very<00:04:05.090> Opie

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.470 
overall like I mean it feels very Opie
and<00:04:06.680> it's<00:04:07.010> nothing<00:04:07.160> wrong<00:04:07.340> with<00:04:07.550> that<00:04:07.700> but<00:04:08.170> I

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
and it's nothing wrong with that but I

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.880 
and it's nothing wrong with that but I
really<00:04:11.480> enjoy<00:04:11.720> playing<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:13.280> class<00:04:13.610> because

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
really enjoy playing this class because

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.270 
really enjoy playing this class because
of<00:04:15.890> how<00:04:16.459> much<00:04:16.640> Oh<00:04:16.910> penis<00:04:17.419> it<00:04:17.630> was<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.950> can<00:04:19.100> say

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
of how much Oh penis it was you can say

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.980 
of how much Oh penis it was you can say
that<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:20.919> feels<00:04:21.919> as<00:04:22.190> almost<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:23.240> discharge

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
that it feels as almost you discharge

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.540 
that it feels as almost you discharge
you<00:04:24.140> got<00:04:24.230> to<00:04:24.350> have<00:04:24.440> your<00:04:24.530> discharge<00:04:24.980> on<00:04:25.190> and

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
you got to have your discharge on and

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.760 
you got to have your discharge on and
then<00:04:26.330> I<00:04:26.360> usually<00:04:26.720> tend<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.169> spread<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.560> dots

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
then I usually tend to spread the dots

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.210 
then I usually tend to spread the dots
by<00:04:28.040> hitting<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.730> death<00:04:28.940> field<00:04:29.830> see<00:04:30.830> here<00:04:31.070> I'll

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
by hitting the death field see here I'll

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.219 
by hitting the death field see here I'll
put<00:04:31.400> discharge<00:04:32.000> up<00:04:32.240> first<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:32.780> then<00:04:32.840> spread

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
put discharge up first and then spread

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.190 
put discharge up first and then spread
the<00:04:33.350> dodge<00:04:33.530> they<00:04:33.800> were<00:04:33.860> all<00:04:33.979> right<00:04:34.250> there<00:04:34.460> boom

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
the dodge they were all right there boom

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.890 
the dodge they were all right there boom
so<00:04:36.200> then<00:04:36.650> it's<00:04:36.860> just<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.850> know<00:04:37.910> hitting<00:04:38.660> with

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
so then it's just you know hitting with

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.690 
so then it's just you know hitting with
thrush<00:04:39.260> till<00:04:39.650> you<00:04:39.830> see<00:04:40.040> something<00:04:40.310> light<00:04:40.520> up

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
thrush till you see something light up

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.820 
thrush till you see something light up
and<00:04:40.820> then<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:40.970> hit<00:04:41.150> whatever<00:04:41.300> lights<00:04:41.600> up<00:04:41.840> done

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
and then you hit whatever lights up done

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.550 
and then you hit whatever lights up done
I<00:04:43.130> mean<00:04:43.460> it's<00:04:43.790> either<00:04:43.940> going<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.270> be

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560

not<00:07:38.149> as<00:07:38.300> much<00:07:38.449> as<00:07:38.509> a<00:07:38.689> guardian<00:07:39.110> but<00:07:39.579> the<00:07:40.579> fact

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:40.819 
not as much as a guardian but the fact

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:42.189 
not as much as a guardian but the fact
that<00:07:40.849> you<00:07:40.999> have<00:07:41.149> the<00:07:41.269> escapes<00:07:41.689> and<00:07:42.139> the

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199 
that you have the escapes and the

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:44.199 
that you have the escapes and the
stealth<00:07:42.619> that<00:07:42.979> just<00:07:43.189> makes<00:07:43.309> up<00:07:43.550> for<00:07:43.819> it<00:07:43.969> so

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:44.209 
stealth that just makes up for it so

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:47.319 
stealth that just makes up for it so
anyway<00:07:44.569> thanks<00:07:44.899> for<00:07:44.929> watching
