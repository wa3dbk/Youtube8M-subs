00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 remember that in the 90s 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.529
 cartoon network broadcast on its pauses 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.880
 commercials a series of animated shorts 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.130
 about mysteries myths and legends 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 urban this for the chain of 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.790
 white and black box television 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.650
 it's an excellent way to make sure 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.990
 that his mode of audience of the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.180
 commercial and free bands that do not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.010
 we will change the channel the shorts will 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.439
 characterized by having a unique 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.730
 narrator who even made the voices 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.710
 of the characters 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.869
 another characteristic of each short 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.300
 is that each story had a turn or 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.300
 ironic twist all this for misfortune of 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.910
 its protagonists but without a doubt 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.950
 most remembered by the great majority that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.750
 enjoyed these animations was the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.110
 great phrase that introduced us and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.510
 dismissed in each animation this is a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.160
 real story happened to a friend of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.220
 a friend 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.530
 talking about animation as such in itself was 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.290
 fairly good fairly limited 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.610
 but it did happen that said rooms 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.900
 come from a television series 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.220
 Canadian called freak stories where 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.979
 not only presented the aforementioned 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.490
 short but the show was run by 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.720
 a pair of animatronic puppets 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.780
 respectively our opinions were 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.670
 a cockroach and a worm the series counted 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.830
 with great acceptance and criticism in your country 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.869
 of origin and he called himself the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.300
 version for infants of the dimension 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.670
 others unknown Needless to say, the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.130
 program had several seasons due to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.259
 they were made numerous shorts that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.270
 in the end they would be transmitted to the rest 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.539
 of the continent through a new 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.649
 born cartoon network being honest the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.420
 truth is that a large part of the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.500
 stories shown were not very good 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.300
 let's say 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.789
 in fact some of the simple and 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.770
 pretty bad but in honor of the truth 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.380
 there were a few that were pretty 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.229
 entertaining in addition to seeing them as a child 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.450
 it was simply great so without more 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.450
 nothing to say this is my top 5 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.579
 number 5 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.430
 and the number 5 position we find 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:18.640
 a story about a guy named frank 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.560
 very but very great story it turns out that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.409
 frank these ladies buy in the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.010
 supermarket and for some strange and crazy 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:30.340
 reason and cheated in the supermarket by 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.650
 a person that one less would think 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.840
 love this court the truth is that it gives 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.689
 a very great lesson in life and if not 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.280
 I 've seen it I really do not recommend it but 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.780
 I just know that he left in the post 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.160
 number 5 continue with the count 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.069
 number 4 to position number 4 reaches the 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.540
 story of a girl called simple 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.810
 It turns out that Cindy is the typical girl 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.400
 superficial and of course has the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.050
 Fashionable haircut that is the honeycomb 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.180
 one day our protagonist starts 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.970
 to suffer the most incredible and very 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.400
 painful headaches are such pains 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.020
 of head that when going to the doctor 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.989
 they will surprise but in truth they 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.920
 will surprise what the doctor found in 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.980
 the head of cindy 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.130
 What I liked most about this short was what 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.830
 twisted and crazy that was his ironic twist 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.920
 definitely one of my favorites when I was 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.090
 a boy 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.090
 number 3 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.450
 to position number 3 the agents appear 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.209
 special wolves marley and her partner 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.830
 to the special people dyn is that I saw a 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.060
 obvious parody of the files 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.010
 x secrets and a very cool riddle 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.489
 our special agents are 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.489
 assigned a particular mission discover 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.130
 that very unconscious establishment on the 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.470
 treetop in the middle of the forest and 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.390
 over there had been a fire 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.569
 last night 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.050
 postscript there were no long rivers or anything 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.710
 the style near the area 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.050
 the answer this riddle is moan and the 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.990
 just like the supermarket short the 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.400
 turn comes from where least minus where 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.120
 I would think 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.120
 number 2 elector ya daniel is amazing 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.979
 just let me tell you it turns out that 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.620
 Daniel travels with his family to Mexico 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.360
 to spend the holidays and a 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.940
 moment to another one is on the street 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.380
 a chihuahua dog the family will 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.780
 He is so fond of the puppy that 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.180
 They decide to adopt it and name it 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.280
 george has already spent some time daniel 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.520
 decides to take him to school for a 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.530
 election and show it to your classmates a 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.720
 couple of hours later you call the parents 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.240
 from daniel these are received by the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.150
 science teacher and can not imagine the 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.699
 news that this one gave them this short me 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.470
 I love my big favorites but I do not 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.470
 it's compared to number one 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.500
 number 1 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.040
 history overthrew my great favorite of 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.230
 boy and what is it currently rocco in 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.150
 many complained that imprisoned 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.120
 is upset by the terrible food of 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.449
 prison one day in a fit of anger you 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.909
 threw the food in the face to a guard 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.490
 was taken to the solitary cell where 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.439
 he refused to eat the prison food of 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.050
 somehow he manages to 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:35.449
 escape from prison 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.520
 after wandering a while and dead of 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.159
 hungry rock gets a building 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.470
 abandoned but everything was very dark and 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:46.260
 his nose was cold so he did not 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.180
 I could smell nothing or see anything 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.550
 inside the building he runs into a 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.470
 refrigerator full of food had 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.120
 so hungry that it did not matter anymore and 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.720
 began to eat all the content of the 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.970
 fridge 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.969
 the next morning red could read a 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.429
 warning that was in the refrigerator 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.589
 have no idea what face I put the 

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:07.360
 first time I saw this cut I liked it 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:12.119
 so much that to date I do not remember with 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.119
 great nostalgia and as my big favorite 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.810
 the truth is that now that I see these 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.700
 stories again I notice that they are not such 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.630
 as I remember it now that now 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.630
 I look with other eyes 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.790
 but without a doubt this was one of my 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.580
 favorite moments in the old capture 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.350
 network but it seems a pity that 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.480
 do not produce this kind of stories 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.560
 that were good for hanging out 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.630
 commercial and commercial 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.610
 I'm surprised that a television station like 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.160
 cartoon network that had an incredible 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.780
 golden age of creativity in the 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.660
 now I only have a couple of 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.250
 animations of great quality and with it 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.889
 I think that what has once been lost 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.510
 characterized the channel if you like the 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.520
 video I cordially invite you to 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.200
 that you give him thumb up are you subscribe 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.540
 to my channel but that over all 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.520
 things you share with a friend of a 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.350
 friend i am kristen spinal and you 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.120
 I appreciate very much that you have taken your 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.120
 valuable time to see this work
