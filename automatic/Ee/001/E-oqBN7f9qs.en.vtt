00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
think like I said I spoke to the gaffer

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.110 
think like I said I spoke to the gaffer
before<00:04:04.590> signing<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.280> he<00:04:05.490> really<00:04:05.730> gave<00:04:05.880> me<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
before signing and he really gave me the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.750 
before signing and he really gave me the
confidence<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.980> think<00:04:08.010> that's<00:04:08.370> that's
