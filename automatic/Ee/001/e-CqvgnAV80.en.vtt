00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
like a chip this in the control is

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.080 
like a chip this in the control is

on different actuators it can be chillin

on different actuators it can be chillin
there<00:04:44.970> vibrates<00:04:45.449> on<00:04:45.599> the<00:04:45.660> left<00:04:45.900> or<00:04:46.229> on<00:04:46.260> the

there vibrates on the left or on the

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:57.529 
there vibrates on the left or on the
right<00:04:55.580> one<00:04:56.580> thing<00:04:56.789> that's<00:04:56.940> interesting<00:04:57.120> is

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
right one thing that's interesting is

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.450 
right one thing that's interesting is
I'm<00:04:57.690> an<00:04:57.810> older<00:04:58.020> controlling<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.919> controls

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
I'm an older controlling the controls

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.920 
I'm an older controlling the controls
will<00:04:59.580> probably<00:04:59.910> be<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.060> bit<00:05:00.300> more<00:05:00.510> messed<00:05:00.750> up

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
will probably be a bit more messed up

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.020 
will probably be a bit more messed up
with<00:05:01.080> this<00:05:01.260> axis<00:05:02.070> and<00:05:02.340> stuff<00:05:02.550> like<00:05:02.699> that

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
with this axis and stuff like that

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.740 
with this axis and stuff like that
and<00:05:03.590> as<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:04.680> can<00:05:04.800> see<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:05.370> tends<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.120> just<00:05:06.510> like

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
and as you can see it tends to just like

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.230 
and as you can see it tends to just like
go<00:05:07.110> veer<00:05:07.560> off<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.740> little<00:05:08.070> bit<00:05:08.220> so<00:05:08.430> if<00:05:08.940> you

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
go veer off a little bit so if you

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.450 
go veer off a little bit so if you
depending<00:05:09.690> on<00:05:09.750> how<00:05:09.889> each<00:05:10.889> other<00:05:10.979> works<00:05:11.220> I<00:05:11.430> say

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
depending on how each other works I say

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.460 
depending on how each other works I say
I<00:05:11.880> recommend<00:05:12.330> sending<00:05:12.539> in<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:13.050> dead<00:05:13.229> sense

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
I recommend sending in the dead sense

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.670 
I recommend sending in the dead sense
you<00:05:13.650> like<00:05:13.800> something<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.639> bit<00:05:14.849> large<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:15.720> don't

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
you like something a bit large I don't

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.649 
you like something a bit large I don't
use<00:05:16.979> my<00:05:17.130> left<00:05:17.370> stick<00:05:17.610> as<00:05:17.729> much<00:05:17.880> my<00:05:18.120> right<00:05:18.330> stick

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
use my left stick as much my right stick

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.740 
use my left stick as much my right stick
so<00:05:19.550> this<00:05:20.550> one<00:05:20.729> actually<00:05:20.880> be<00:05:21.210> a<00:05:21.240> bit<00:05:21.449> farther

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
so this one actually be a bit farther

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.560 
so this one actually be a bit farther
off<00:05:23.120> actually<00:05:24.120> meant<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.690> other<00:05:24.840> way<00:05:24.960> around

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
off actually meant the other way around

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:55.210 
off actually meant the other way around
yeah<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:27.810> that<00:05:27.990> is<00:05:28.020> I<00:05:53.389> forgot<00:05:54.389> to<00:05:54.570> click<00:05:54.690> apply
