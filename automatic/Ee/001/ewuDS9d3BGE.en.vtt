tend to go with the band I provided
water<00:02:38.480> slides<00:02:38.840> but<00:02:39.380> if<00:02:39.470> you're<00:02:39.560> going<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.709> go

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
water slides but if you're going to go

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.650 
water slides but if you're going to go
the<00:02:39.950> route<00:02:40.070> of<00:02:40.130> water<00:02:40.430> slides<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:41.360> have<00:02:41.450> lots

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
the route of water slides you have lots

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.479 
the route of water slides you have lots
of<00:02:41.780> options<00:02:41.959> from<00:02:42.410> like<00:02:42.560> wave<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:42.980> Kotobukiya

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
of options from like wave and Kotobukiya

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.880 
of options from like wave and Kotobukiya
you<00:02:43.790> can<00:02:43.940> use<00:02:44.269> whatever<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:45.170> find<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.769> your

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
liking and put it on your mech and now

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.140 
liking and put it on your mech and now
that<00:02:48.980> that's<00:02:49.040> all<00:02:49.220> explained<00:02:49.640> I'm<00:02:49.880> going<00:02:50.090> to

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
that that's all explained I'm going to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.340 
that that's all explained I'm going to
start<00:02:50.360> assembling<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.049> we'll<00:02:51.200> talk

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
start assembling this and we'll talk

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.600 
start assembling this and we'll talk
about<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.680> functions<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.130> different<00:02:52.190> pieces

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
about the functions of different pieces

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.070 
about the functions of different pieces
now<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.209> Master<00:02:53.510> Grade<00:02:53.630> line<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.930> very

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
now the Master Grade line is very

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.449 
now the Master Grade line is very
popular<00:02:54.590> because<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:54.980> its<00:02:55.130> great

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
popular because of its great

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.100 
popular because of its great
articulation<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.209> detailed<00:02:56.630> inner<00:02:56.810> frame

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
articulation and detailed inner frame

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.920 
articulation and detailed inner frame
and<00:02:57.320> as<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.890> can<00:02:57.980> see<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:59.450> functions<00:02:59.870> very

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
and as you can see it functions very

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.319 
and as you can see it functions very
much<00:03:00.230> like<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.410> joint<00:03:00.790> if<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.880> have<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.030> wide

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
much like a joint if you have a wide

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.509 
much like a joint if you have a wide
range<00:03:02.360> of<00:03:02.840> motion<00:03:03.230> allowing<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.310> pose

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
range of motion allowing you to pose

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.660 
range of motion allowing you to pose
your<00:03:04.549> mech<00:03:04.850> in<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.030> variety<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.450> different<00:03:05.660> ways

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
your mech in a variety of different ways

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.350 
your mech in a variety of different ways
but<00:03:07.670> how<00:03:07.790> do<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.910> get<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.150> kind<00:03:08.329> of

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
but how do you get this kind of

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.670 
but how do you get this kind of
articulation<00:03:08.840> well<00:03:09.079> this<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.290> where<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.500> poly

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
articulation well this is where the poly

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.350 
articulation well this is where the poly
caps<00:03:09.920> come<00:03:10.130> in<00:03:11.410> as<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:13.519> can<00:03:13.640> see<00:03:13.820> there's<00:03:14.090> poly

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
caps come in as you can see there's poly

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.810 
caps come in as you can see there's poly
caps<00:03:14.630> all<00:03:14.840> along<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.530> design<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.549> leg

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
caps all along the design of this leg

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.550
