00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.230 
because I did I let the dye sit for 12
hours<00:05:35.320> because<00:05:35.590> I<00:05:36.100> did<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:36.820> night<00:05:36.970> before<00:05:37.120> I

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
hours because I did the night before I

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.120 
hours because I did the night before I
had<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.450> go<00:05:37.540> back<00:05:37.690> to<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.930> class<00:05:38.140> the<00:05:38.650> next<00:05:38.950> day

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
had to go back to the class the next day

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.090 
had to go back to the class the next day
and<00:05:39.430> I<00:05:40.320> wanted<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.380> make<00:05:41.500> sure<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.770> hair<00:05:41.919> was

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
and I wanted to make sure the hair was

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.680 
and I wanted to make sure the hair was
really<00:05:42.340> saturated<00:05:43.060> in<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.210> color<00:05:43.479> was

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
really saturated in the color was

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.300 
really saturated in the color was
seeping<00:05:43.900> through<00:05:44.080> because<00:05:44.530> I<00:05:44.680> did<00:05:44.890> bleach<00:05:45.130> it

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
seeping through because I did bleach it

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.310 
seeping through because I did bleach it
