00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.060
 final video rework of the shield 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.609
 appliances 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.740
 not that there is more further to tell you about 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.820
 ignition means changing the backlight 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.130
 arrows so well immediately start with the fact that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.830
 here can be such a bet 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.490
 come across happens about some 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.300
 there is here on the nonsense holes 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.820
 known we will need to remove 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.150
 very easy to help us so 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.510
 same knife that we put this 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.329
 pad on Whatman white is normal and you can 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.030
 watch for printer paper and here's 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.129
 gently pressing here with a cloth 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.230
 wind countrymen of the legs and that's how I 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.760
 did in 1 1 1 just the opposite and again 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 the glass he will finish he will stick 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.230
 here and so on the perimeter of chik-chik-chik-chik 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.590
 then squeezed it out accordingly 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.629
 participation rip there every done so 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.860
 here their 4 turns out yes well everything is ready 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.719
 we go further we prepare under arrows 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.600
 the light guide is the same here only 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.520
 soldering hot smelted here 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.439
 make a bigger hole here for example 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.640
 on the finger paint the index showing 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.520
 about such a hole on will 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.110
 smelt also here and here what is here 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.810
 if this part suddenly falls apart 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.640
 Absolutely terrible further pliers 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.450
 neatly good and wet which seems 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.340
 swimming trunks and a knife cut everything here 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.320
 were to make it smooth our task 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.460
 and then when fully on court these here 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 these ends 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.939
 we just take and black lacquer here 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.970
 such varnish is common application in everything 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.490
 ordinary to nail to the cheapest 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.939
 then we black this morning 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.070
 the butt is this here inside 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.259
 which we get we paint over 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.670
 there was no light from the LED which 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.939
 arrows will highlight or 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.260
 further it is ready to proceed to themselves 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.030
 arrows 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.550
 let's say here girl speedometer take 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 it is big whatever color not 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.680
 I did the highlight I always delete 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.630
 equal here this one paint from it 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.970
 therefore , for this you need again from 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.160
 such a sharp knife can be 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.570
 Cantonese clear throughout 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.250
 neatly shrouded winter us 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.430
 the inside is therefore so 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.290
 the whole thing is covered with this knife and 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.730
 that is, everywhere else is nowhere left 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.420
 just not here that is all this 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.630
 then remove any problems later 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.920
 take a simple varnish of this varnish 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.260
 first, the main thing in one go 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.030
 we cover once we take 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.470
 next next in the second round 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.720
 back cover the second layer 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.930
 so that it is clearly and exactly white 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.400
 the main thing in one go do it and also I 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.140
 would advise when to dry here 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.760
 black marker make stripes fresh 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.890
 so that they do not shine if suddenly 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.540
 the scales will be bright and not the same color 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.570
 there will be arrows so that there is no light 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.860
 here at the edges there is already an idea where the arrow is light 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.010
 maybe a little dimmer than what in 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.280
 the basis with this is all this as far as we are 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.720
 here we will only remake 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.100
 tachometer so this she painted us 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.690
 ready as the arrow 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.980
 tank and temperature but the arrow 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.900
 tachometer is a little different already done 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.459
 that is , we also painted further too 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.769
 our task here is if you look closely 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.239
 we see that here we have light 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.440
 that's just where you need to shine 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.030
 LED that is generally backlight 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.340
 the arrows are all very simple 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.019
 no electronics purely mechanic in 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.910
 the right zone at the right moment when 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.620
 the arrow is moving on our axis 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.120
 her stepper motor she 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.019
 highlighted just the right need 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.209
 LED color 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.040
 and for this we need to do that here 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.100
 This part of Phil is just so tight 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.480
 close and paint the rod itself 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.820
 some he long boxes i 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.580
 I paint over either varnish or marker here 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.970
 this part is painted over with a thick layer 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.070
 they start better than fine things like that 45 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.390
 thin layers of lacquer covered with black to 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.450
 In no case did not make it through 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.150
 the color from the ends clearly lit up there 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.689
 LED over which it hangs 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.610
 there is everything before the idea is already clear everything is simple 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.750
 What's next to the LEDs is not to be confused 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.129
 just look when you are 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.439
 buy such a moment is very important 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.180
 take either one resistance or one 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.860
 domain resistance but 3 millimeters 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.510
 this is 5 millimeters more than a hundred 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.519
 diode we do not need it we do not 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.530
 good they can fall into sold 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.349
 sellers give you it and still the stadium they 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.260
 don't go go only 3mm 12 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.879
 volt better with two with two for 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.000
 which resistances are 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.680
 LED means looking immediately besides 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.560
 one leg is longer the other one is shorter here on 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.120
 one-time is not visible here you are here so much 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.539
 that to me is a plus, what is shorter 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.460
 minus is standard further inside even 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.780
 seen inside of him this is where 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.660
 entrails which are bigger 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.600
 this is minus all that less is a plus there on 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.880
 fight then everything is elementary 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.610
 here i use three leds here 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.110
 using always 4 here I use 2 to 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.330
 2 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.930
 then take that is, we figure it out 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.729
 by height 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.280
 but our he did not go beyond 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:52.440
 the height of this 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:54.870
 flower growers legs with minus 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.340
 minus leg at the bottom plus top here 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.140
 so it payalnichkom alloyed 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.540
 neatly everything is not fixed 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.000
 2 accordingly let's do it here 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.830
 backlight white arrow and when will 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 tachometer gain momentum here come 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.370
 will blush accordingly here 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.200
 do we put here so we insert 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.030
 the next LED is already we take a man 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.580
 different because white is bright red 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.200
 less bright means they need to be done 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.450
 2 1 will be white 2 3 will be red 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.330
 it means that it is already desirable to bend 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.920
 on the contrary, that is, that he had below 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.080
 plus top minus because otherwise there will be 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.340
 lots of wires from off my feet 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.430
 from to and between themselves they are kind of like 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.650
 connected means first so 2 so and 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.890
 reds here that is arrow 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.210
 we have a median lost our girl when 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.220
 we will not be there, she will 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.170
 highlighted in the desired zone fit 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.410
 color is the whole idea you can do with 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.270
 any speedometer even with 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.860
 but with gasoline temperature 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.490
 glad the collective farm did this only a couple of times 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:00.380
 some don't like it here 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:03.600
 I use 4 the same principles 1 2 3 and 4 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.690
 here will be placed not on January 2 here 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.550
 here 2 here u is a little higher also 1 and 2 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.980
 because the girl with us does not walk 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.080
 We forget here now so closely at it too 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.500
 so goes to here a little bit of us 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.760
 their goals will be here for a long time 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.580
 when you put them then on top 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.320
 so look why because so that 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.930
 arrows they did not hinder the rotation 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.200
 the arrows then take collect tidy 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.120
 the method will not be hit in detail 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.450
 we install connected solder there 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.940
 everything 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:36.400
 dress arrow 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.830
 put on let's say not really 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.650
 Just check it already, we put it in about 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.780
 one and a half millimeters here to 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.009
 was and accordingly the name engine 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.539
 rotate neatly 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.909
 connected and look at how much we have 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:54.180
 a clear transition boundary push 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:58.060
 the border as we prefer not all 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:00.009
 so well, the wheelbarrow and dismantled here 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.360
 accordingly, here is some problem 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:03.099
 Immediately everything will turn out to be bright 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.900
 then 4 LEDs plus 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.219
 large florist arrows problems 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.900
 were like i have to suffer here 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:10.930
 neatly through this hole 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.190
 it will be possible to move the 100 diodes here 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.990
 a little bit to suffer too 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.509
 what a small hole a small light guide 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:20.349
 Aim to be clearly in the entire area 

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:22.240
 there was the same lighting 

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:23.860
 draw so that there is no parasitic 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.050
 waving the red LED illumination, 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.370
 here this zone can be there 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.889
 dream up or neatly 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.449
 led varnish black under paint 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:36.639
 this part, well, that is, this is already yours 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:38.319
 see yourself discretion fantasize something 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.090
 there is actually all no 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:43.360
 the secret is very simple 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:46.349
 done thank you for the attention to the channel 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.349
 I will be glad
