as you know as is the team concept this

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.350 
as you know as is the team concept this
is<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.189> place<00:01:11.430> where<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.700> join<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> team

is the one place where you join a team

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.000 
is the one place where you join a team
and<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.689> you're<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> 95th<00:01:13.470> guy<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.830> our<00:01:13.950> team

and if you're the 95th guy on our team

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.330 
and if you're the 95th guy on our team
you're<00:01:14.729> damned<00:01:15.000> important<00:01:15.509> guy<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.130> we<00:01:17.130> try

you're damned important guy and we try

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.249

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
tremendously loyal to it and think that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.120

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
pike but later on I realized some of the

pike but later on I realized some of the
things<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.950> he<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.189> trying<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.759> get<00:02:00.149> across
