00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.700 

historically<00:00:53.719> hops<00:00:53.989> were<00:00:54.140> using<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.469> brewing

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
historically hops were using the brewing

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.560 
historically hops were using the brewing
industry<00:00:54.800> in<00:00:55.429> several<00:00:55.789> different<00:00:55.850> ways<00:00:56.059> you

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
industry in several different ways you

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.869 
industry in several different ways you
had<00:00:56.780> large<00:00:57.589> Brewers<00:00:57.949> who<00:00:58.070> were<00:00:58.160> looking<00:00:58.489> for

had large Brewers who were looking for
acres<00:00:59.300> and<00:00:59.449> acres<00:00:59.510> of<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.870> certain<00:01:00.109> kind<00:01:00.289> of

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
acres and acres of a certain kind of

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.369 
acres and acres of a certain kind of
aroma<00:01:00.649> hop<00:01:00.829> or<00:01:01.239> they<00:01:02.239> were<00:01:02.300> getting<00:01:03.289> really

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
aroma hop or they were getting really

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.869 
aroma hop or they were getting really
care<00:01:03.620> about<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:03.859> Roman<00:01:04.250> they<00:01:04.519> were<00:01:04.610> looking<00:01:04.729> for

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
care about a Roman they were looking for

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.450 
care about a Roman they were looking for
an<00:01:05.119> extract<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.750> just<00:01:06.040> cans<00:01:07.040> of<00:01:07.189> syrup

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
an extract and just cans of syrup

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.760 
an extract and just cans of syrup
basically<00:01:08.000> what<00:01:08.479> you've<00:01:08.600> seen<00:01:08.810> with<00:01:09.289> the<00:01:09.470> rise

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
basically what you've seen with the rise

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.160 
basically what you've seen with the rise
of<00:01:10.039> craft<00:01:10.340> is<00:01:10.789> really<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.119> shift<00:01:11.479> more<00:01:12.110> towards

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
of craft is really a shift more towards

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.999 
of craft is really a shift more towards
these<00:01:13.090> interesting<00:01:14.090> hop<00:01:14.869> varieties<00:01:15.259> mainly

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
these interesting hop varieties mainly

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.440 
these interesting hop varieties mainly
because<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:16.580> have<00:01:16.729> these<00:01:17.000> people<00:01:17.330> who<00:01:17.390> are

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
because you have these people who are

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.050 
because you have these people who are
using<00:01:17.750> such<00:01:18.140> large<00:01:18.590> amounts<00:01:19.009> ops<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.820> see

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
using such large amounts ops you see

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.600 
using such large amounts ops you see
things<00:01:20.299> that<00:01:20.630> aren't<00:01:21.590> necessarily<00:01:21.680> in<00:01:22.430> line

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
things that aren't necessarily in line

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.550 
things that aren't necessarily in line
with<00:01:22.789> what<00:01:22.939> old<00:01:23.119> school<00:01:23.360> operates<00:01:24.110> used<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.439> be

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
with what old school operates used to be

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.380 
with what old school operates used to be
where<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.399> have<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> little<00:01:25.850> this<00:01:25.970> know<00:01:26.149> that

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
where you have a little this know that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.550 
where you have a little this know that
now<00:01:26.569> it's<00:01:26.720> like<00:01:26.780> no<00:01:26.929> we're<00:01:27.080> going<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.259> load<00:01:27.409> it

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
now it's like no we're going to load it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.749 
now it's like no we're going to load it
up<00:01:27.679> and<00:01:27.740> we're<00:01:27.920> going<00:01:28.039> to<00:01:28.069> double<00:01:28.340> load<00:01:28.460> it<00:01:28.610> up

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
up and we're going to double load it up

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.330 
up and we're going to double load it up
and<00:01:29.000> see<00:01:29.330> what<00:01:29.360> we<00:01:29.569> get<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.069> I<00:01:31.069> think<00:01:31.130> that's

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
and see what we get and I think that's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.130 
and see what we get and I think that's
it's<00:01:31.970> been<00:01:32.119> kind<00:01:32.300> of<00:01:32.330> two-way<00:01:32.539> street<00:01:32.810> because

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
it's been kind of two-way street because

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.899 
it's been kind of two-way street because
what<00:01:33.619> you've<00:01:33.740> had<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.159> people<00:01:34.399> using<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.759> lot

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
what you've had is people using a lot

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.940 
what you've had is people using a lot
then<00:01:35.119> saying<00:01:35.360> I<00:01:35.569> would<00:01:35.720> like<00:01:35.899> this<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.679> now

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
then saying I would like this and now

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.080 
then saying I would like this and now
i'm<00:01:37.039> interested<00:01:37.429> saying<00:01:37.610> well<00:01:37.759> hell<00:01:37.880> we<00:01:37.909> got

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
i'm interested saying well hell we got

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.320 
i'm interested saying well hell we got
this<00:01:38.240> check<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:38.899> up<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.520> i<00:01:40.520> think<00:01:41.210> that's

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330
