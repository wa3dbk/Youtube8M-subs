00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
Cole and Tony moly I think those are the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.390 
Cole and Tony moly I think those are the
brands<00:01:21.900> where<00:01:22.140> they're<00:01:22.409> CC<00:01:22.770> creams<00:01:23.070> are

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
brands where they're CC creams are

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.210 
brands where they're CC creams are
quickly<00:01:24.000> developing<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.140> name<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
quickly developing a name out there and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.399 
quickly developing a name out there and
although<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> haven't<00:01:27.150> tried<00:01:27.479> any<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.810> those<00:01:27.990> CC

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
although I haven't tried any of those CC

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
although I haven't tried any of those CC
creams<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.920> believe<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.460> transition

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
creams I believe that they transition

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.569 
creams I believe that they transition
from<00:01:30.090> white<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.810> your<00:01:30.990> skin<00:01:31.320> color<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.250> reason

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
from white to your skin color the reason

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.969 
from white to your skin color the reason
that<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.880> personally<00:01:33.360> went<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> HERA<00:01:34.560> CC

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that I personally went for the HERA CC

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.859 
that I personally went for the HERA CC
cream<00:01:35.220> instead<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> other<00:01:36.090> brands<00:01:36.479> is

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
cream instead of the other brands is

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.010 
cream instead of the other brands is
because<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> read<00:01:37.470> numerous<00:01:37.920> reviews<00:01:38.340> doing

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
because I read numerous reviews doing

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.960 
because I read numerous reviews doing
comparisons<00:01:40.020> between<00:01:40.200> them<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.860> usually<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
comparisons between them and usually the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.929 
comparisons between them and usually the
HERA<00:01:42.240> CC<00:01:42.630> cream<00:01:42.840> came<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.409> as<00:01:43.680> their<00:01:44.310> favorite

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
HERA CC cream came out as their favorite

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.480 
HERA CC cream came out as their favorite
having<00:01:45.659> superior<00:01:46.290> coverage<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:47.250> well<00:01:47.430> as

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
having superior coverage as well as

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.270 
having superior coverage as well as
better<00:01:48.030> quality<00:01:48.409> so<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.740> North<00:01:50.070> American

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
better quality so a North American

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.370
