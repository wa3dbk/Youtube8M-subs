reviewing a map called Survivor or D

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.290 
reviewing a map called Survivor or D
survivor<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.890> survival<00:01:10.520> map<00:01:10.760> as<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.120> can

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
survivor so the survival map as you can

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.480 
survivor so the survival map as you can
see<00:01:11.480> in<00:01:11.750> front<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.380> map<00:01:12.560> there<00:01:13.280> are

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
see in front of the map there are

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.510 
see in front of the map there are
letters<00:01:13.910> D<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:14.930> E<00:01:15.380> which<00:01:15.770> of<00:01:15.950> course<00:01:15.980> means

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
letters D and E which of course means

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.650 
letters D and E which of course means
that<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.450> bomb<00:01:17.780> defusal<00:01:18.500> map<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:20.270> of

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
that it's a bomb defusal map and of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.800 
that it's a bomb defusal map and of
course<00:01:21.220> naturally<00:01:22.220> there<00:01:22.550> are<00:01:22.790> two<00:01:23.300> bomb

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
course naturally there are two bomb

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.969 
course naturally there are two bomb
sites<00:01:24.140> in<00:01:24.410> this<00:01:24.619> map<00:01:24.950> but<00:01:25.220> first<00:01:25.460> things<00:01:25.640> first

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
sites in this map but first things first

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.070 
sites in this map but first things first
the<00:01:27.979> survivor<00:01:28.369> map<00:01:28.760> is<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.060> snowman<00:01:29.600> as<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:29.930> can

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
the survivor map is a snowman as you can

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.859 
the survivor map is a snowman as you can
see<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.369> map<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.550> pretty<00:01:32.000> big<00:01:32.330> compared

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
see and the map is pretty big compared

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.410 
see and the map is pretty big compared
to<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.380> dust2<00:01:33.680> for<00:01:34.040> instance<00:01:34.390> there<00:01:35.390> are

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
to the dust2 for instance there are

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.150 
to the dust2 for instance there are
overall<00:01:36.020> two<00:01:36.500> ways<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:37.460> can<00:01:38.470> go<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.830> get

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
overall two ways that you can go and get

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.940 
overall two ways that you can go and get
to<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.400> bomb<00:01:40.610> sites<00:01:41.229> for<00:01:42.229> terrorists<00:01:42.770> and

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
to the bomb sites for terrorists and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.010 
to the bomb sites for terrorists and
cities<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.640> first<00:01:44.119> option<00:01:44.540> is<00:01:44.630> through<00:01:44.930> a

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
cities the first option is through a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.740 
cities the first option is through a
small<00:01:45.530> town<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.400> the<00:01:46.850> second<00:01:47.270> option<00:01:47.479> is

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
small town and the second option is

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.060 
small town and the second option is
going<00:01:47.810> over<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.410> deep<00:01:48.880> scar<00:01:49.990> if<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.259> will<00:01:51.530> using

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
going over a deep scar if you will using

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.070 
going over a deep scar if you will using
two<00:01:52.280> bridges<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.030> one<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.390> them<00:01:53.540> can<00:01:53.810> actually

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
two bridges and one of them can actually

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.309 
two bridges and one of them can actually
collapse<00:01:54.920> well<00:01:55.640> basically<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.509> CPS<00:01:56.990> need<00:01:57.200> to

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
collapse well basically the CPS need to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.820 
collapse well basically the CPS need to
secure<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.130> not<00:01:58.520> let<00:01:58.789> terrorists<00:01:59.569> to<00:02:00.200> plant<00:02:00.530> a

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
secure and not let terrorists to plant a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.540 
secure and not let terrorists to plant a
bomb<00:02:01.610> on<00:02:02.119> one<00:02:02.569> of<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.810> two<00:02:03.080> objectives<00:02:03.460> one<00:02:04.460> of

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
bomb on one of the two objectives one of

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.850 
bomb on one of the two objectives one of
the<00:02:04.700> objects<00:02:05.149> is<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.360> crash<00:02:05.780> plane<00:02:06.289> and<00:02:06.619> the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
the objects is the crash plane and the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.730 
the objects is the crash plane and the
other<00:02:06.890> one<00:02:07.310> is<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.490> truck<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.600> in<00:02:08.990> my<00:02:09.500> opinion

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
other one is a truck so in my opinion

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.570 
other one is a truck so in my opinion
this<00:02:10.490> map<00:02:10.789> has<00:02:11.120> way<00:02:11.720> too<00:02:11.750> many<00:02:12.260> places<00:02:12.800> to

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
this map has way too many places to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.210 
this map has way too many places to
actually<00:02:14.000> hide<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.630> camp<00:02:14.960> especially<00:02:15.710> for

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
actually hide and camp especially for

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.930 
actually hide and camp especially for
the<00:02:16.310> cities<00:02:16.790> when<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.960> comes<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.920> camping<00:02:19.819> in

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
the cities when it comes to camping in

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.180 
the cities when it comes to camping in
the<00:02:20.030> bomb<00:02:20.210> sites<00:02:20.680> especially<00:02:21.680> in<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.890> crash

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
the bomb sites especially in the crash

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.750 
the bomb sites especially in the crash
the<00:02:22.520> plain<00:02:23.060> sight<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:24.230> as<00:02:24.620> far<00:02:24.920> as<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.250> small

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
the plain sight now as far as the small

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.570 
the plain sight now as far as the small
town<00:02:26.120> goes<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.870> has<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.080> my<00:02:27.830> opinion<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.459> a

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
town goes it has a my opinion it is a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.850 
town goes it has a my opinion it is a
lot<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.060> choking<00:02:29.360> points<00:02:29.930> where<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.650> can

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
lot of choking points where you can

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.040 
lot of choking points where you can
actually<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.550> camp<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.390> with<00:02:32.569> your<00:02:32.720> buddies

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
actually just camp in with your buddies

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.100 
actually just camp in with your buddies
and<00:02:33.380> take<00:02:33.920> out<00:02:34.130> every<00:02:34.459> terrorist<00:02:34.970> or<00:02:35.450> counter

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
and take out every terrorist or counter

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.750 
and take out every terrorist or counter
terrorist<00:02:36.560> depends<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:37.160> which<00:02:37.340> side<00:02:37.580> you're

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
terrorist depends on which side you're

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.040 
terrorist depends on which side you're
on

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
on

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.100 
on
and<00:02:39.260> they<00:02:39.709> won't<00:02:39.950> know<00:02:40.100> what<00:02:40.130> hit<00:02:40.459> him<00:02:41.080> for<00:02:42.080> a

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
and they won't know what hit him for a

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.110 
and they won't know what hit him for a
new<00:02:42.319> player<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.680> think<00:02:43.310> this<00:02:43.580> map<00:02:43.819> will<00:02:44.090> be

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
new player I think this map will be

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.250 
new player I think this map will be
pretty<00:02:44.569> frustrating<00:02:45.500> until<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:47.690> or<00:02:47.930> he

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
pretty frustrating until you or he

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.250 
pretty frustrating until you or he
actually<00:02:49.180> figures<00:02:50.180> out<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.660> places<00:02:50.930> where

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
actually figures out the places where

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.770 
actually figures out the places where
the<00:02:51.500> enemy<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:51.830> hiding<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.430> figures<00:02:53.420> out<00:02:53.630> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
the enemy is hiding and figures out the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.070 
the enemy is hiding and figures out the
best<00:02:54.020> routes<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:54.620> actually<00:02:55.040> get<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.340> kill<00:02:56.080> the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
best routes to actually get a kill the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.600 
best routes to actually get a kill the
small<00:02:57.319> towns<00:02:58.569> advantages<00:02:59.569> are<00:02:59.810> are<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:01.310> fact

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
small towns advantages are are the fact

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.160 
small towns advantages are are the fact
that<00:03:02.620> long-range<00:03:03.620> weapons

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
that long-range weapons

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.220 
that long-range weapons
are<00:03:04.260> pretty<00:03:04.560> useless<00:03:05.160> because<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.390> variety

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
are pretty useless because of a variety

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.949 
are pretty useless because of a variety
of<00:03:07.500> places<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.489> hide<00:03:08.520> behind<00:03:09.180> especially

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
of places you can hide behind especially

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.220 
of places you can hide behind especially
the<00:03:10.560> parked<00:03:10.860> cars<00:03:11.130> how<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.180> course<00:03:12.510> if<00:03:13.020> you

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
the parked cars how but of course if you

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.860 
the parked cars how but of course if you
are<00:03:13.349> able<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.860> rush<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.370> other<00:03:14.400> team<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:15.750> can

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
are able to rush the other team you can

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.680 
are able to rush the other team you can
actually<00:03:16.200> in<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.250> town<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.970> small<00:03:18.239> town<00:03:18.510> you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
actually in the town the small town you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.110 
actually in the town the small town you
can<00:03:18.840> actually<00:03:18.989> get<00:03:19.410> up<00:03:19.560> on<00:03:19.739> up<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.250> relatively

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
can actually get up on up a relatively

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.309 
can actually get up on up a relatively
tall<00:03:21.810> building<00:03:22.319> there<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.980> use<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.610> BB

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
tall building there and use the a BB

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.710 
tall building there and use the a BB
which<00:03:25.319> which<00:03:26.069> could<00:03:26.520> be<00:03:26.700> really<00:03:27.060> effective

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
which which could be really effective

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.510 
which which could be really effective
but<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.020> course<00:03:28.290> if<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.590> are<00:03:28.830> able<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.130> rush

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
but of course if you are able to rush

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.410 
but of course if you are able to rush
them<00:03:29.790> now<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.110> two<00:03:31.739> bridges<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.970> second

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
them now for the two bridges the second

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.809 
them now for the two bridges the second
option<00:03:35.750> there<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:37.170> can<00:03:37.440> definitely<00:03:38.160> use<00:03:38.580> a

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
option there you can definitely use a

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.160 
option there you can definitely use a
long-range<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:40.500> long-range<00:03:41.340> weapon<00:03:42.000> but<00:03:42.870> I

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
long-range a long-range weapon but I

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.259 
long-range a long-range weapon but I
don't<00:03:43.440> really<00:03:43.620> recommend<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.549> because<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
don't really recommend it because the

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.030 
don't really recommend it because the
range<00:03:45.510> between<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.959> both<00:03:46.319> sides<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.890> the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
range between the both sides of the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.030 
range between the both sides of the
bridge<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.760> relatively<00:03:48.750> small<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.860> can

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
bridge is relatively small and you can

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.039 
bridge is relatively small and you can
just<00:03:50.250> do<00:03:50.430> well<00:03:50.610> with<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.880> simple<00:03:51.299> ak-47<00:03:52.140> or<00:03:52.260> m4

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
just do well with a simple ak-47 or m4

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.220 
just do well with a simple ak-47 or m4
but<00:03:55.049> in<00:03:55.380> my<00:03:55.650> opinion<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:56.549> two<00:03:56.790> bridge<00:03:57.420> area<00:03:57.720> is

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
but in my opinion the two bridge area is

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.370 
but in my opinion the two bridge area is
definitely<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:59.069> choking<00:03:59.850> point<00:04:00.180> for<00:04:01.019> the

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
definitely a choking point for the

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.400 
definitely a choking point for the
terrorists<00:04:02.370> although<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.269> gotta<00:04:03.600> say<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:04.170> the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
terrorists although I gotta say that the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.620 
terrorists although I gotta say that the
fact<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.830> there<00:04:05.040> are<00:04:05.250> two<00:04:05.640> bridges<00:04:05.940> not<00:04:06.330> one

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
fact that there are two bridges not one

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.240 
fact that there are two bridges not one
is<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:07.380> definitely<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.750> good<00:04:09.750> thing<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.350> it

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
is a definitely a good thing and it

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.770 
is a definitely a good thing and it
opens<00:04:12.090> up<00:04:12.209> more<00:04:12.420> options<00:04:12.660> for<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.290> terrorists

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
opens up more options for the terrorists

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.659 
opens up more options for the terrorists
but<00:04:15.780> oh<00:04:15.840> yeah<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.500> map<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.950> pretty<00:04:17.250> cool<00:04:17.609> I

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
but oh yeah the map is pretty cool I

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.979 
but oh yeah the map is pretty cool I
definitely<00:04:18.359> enjoyed<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:19.010> but<00:04:20.780> it's<00:04:21.780> not

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
definitely enjoyed it but it's not

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.070 
definitely enjoyed it but it's not
really<00:04:22.049> popular<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:24.000> server's<00:04:24.419> do<00:04:24.630> support

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
really popular the server's do support

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.100 
really popular the server's do support
this<00:04:25.350> map<00:04:25.590> but<00:04:25.979> they<00:04:26.430> have<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.820> but<00:04:27.180> people

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
this map but they have it but people

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.320 
this map but they have it but people
just<00:04:28.380> don't<00:04:28.620> tend<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:29.100> choose<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:30.030> if<00:04:30.150> they

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
just don't tend to choose it and if they

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.290 
just don't tend to choose it and if they
do<00:04:30.770> they<00:04:31.770> play<00:04:32.010> like<00:04:32.039> five<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.669> seven<00:04:32.970> minutes

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
do they play like five to seven minutes

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.969 
do they play like five to seven minutes
and<00:04:33.450> they<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.500> know<00:04:34.620> immediately

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
and they you know immediately

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.029 
and they you know immediately
immediately<00:04:35.789> rocket<00:04:36.690> boats<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.140> or<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.680> admin

changes them after a different one and I

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.110 
changes them after a different one and I
remember<00:04:42.450> as<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.140> said<00:04:43.340> for<00:04:44.340> new<00:04:44.640> players<00:04:44.970> for

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
the map adjusting to it I remember my

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.800 
the map adjusting to it I remember my
first<00:05:01.500> pups<00:05:01.860> on<00:05:02.100> this<00:05:02.400> this<00:05:02.610> was<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.789> war<00:05:03.150> while

back though when I join it I mean it was
a<00:05:07.830> really<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.430> really<00:05:08.930> frustrating
