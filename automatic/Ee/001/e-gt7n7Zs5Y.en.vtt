detergent you said the key word Melissa
it's<00:02:02.729> all<00:02:02.939> about<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> audience<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's all about the audience the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
it's all about the audience the
advertisers<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.070> find<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.520> audience<00:02:05.850> lots

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240

of places and probably at very good cost

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.210 
of places and probably at very good cost
so<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.270> question<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.989> when<00:02:10.500> will<00:02:10.679> viewers

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
so the question is when will viewers

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.530 
so the question is when will viewers
start<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.700> tune<00:02:11.910> in

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
start to tune in

when they do and when there's enough of
them<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.909> advertisers<00:02:15.629> will<00:02:16.140> be<00:02:16.290> interested

that's gonna happen over a longer window
than<00:03:41.909> just<00:03:42.180> when<00:03:42.510> they<00:03:42.659> open<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.079> doors<00:03:43.290> and

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
than just when they open the doors and

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.559 
than just when they open the doors and
when<00:03:43.799> they<00:03:43.949> start<00:03:44.220> broadcasting<00:03:44.790> that's<00:03:45.449> a

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
when they start broadcasting that's a

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.629 
when they start broadcasting that's a
great<00:03:45.810> point<00:03:46.109> though<00:03:46.290> walid<00:03:46.680> News<00:03:47.159> Corp<00:03:47.489> is

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
great point though walid News Corp is

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.219 
great point though walid News Corp is
always<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> business<00:03:48.569> of<00:03:48.720> trying<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.049> make

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
always in the business of trying to make

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.750 
always in the business of trying to make
money<00:03:49.440> they<00:03:49.650> have<00:03:49.739> public<00:03:50.040> shareholders<00:03:50.609> it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
money they have public shareholders it

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.969 
money they have public shareholders it
is<00:03:50.879> very<00:03:51.150> clear<00:03:51.810> why<00:03:52.319> they<00:03:52.560> would<00:03:52.709> open

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
is very clear why they would open

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.830 
is very clear why they would open
another<00:03:53.069> channel<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.849> branch<00:03:54.150> into<00:03:54.599> a<00:03:54.629> new

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
another channel and branch into a new

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.569 
another channel and branch into a new
market<00:03:55.049> or<00:03:55.290> buy<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> business<00:03:56.129> because<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.519> the

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
market or buy a business because in the

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.949 
market or buy a business because in the
long<00:03:56.760> term<00:03:56.939> they<00:03:57.090> want<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.389> make<00:03:57.510> money<00:03:57.659> and<00:03:57.810> I

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
long term they want to make money and I

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.659 
long term they want to make money and I
think<00:03:58.169> that<00:03:58.319> is<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.620> concern<00:03:59.040> here<00:03:59.489> is<00:03:59.639> that

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
think that is the concern here is that

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.550 
think that is the concern here is that
with<00:03:59.939> this<00:04:00.120> group<00:04:00.389> they<00:04:00.959> don't<00:04:01.139> need<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.409> make

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
with this group they don't need to make

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.319 
with this group they don't need to make
money<00:04:01.799> in<00:04:01.949> television<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.519> probably<00:04:03.060> not

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
money in television is probably not

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.149 
money in television is probably not
their<00:04:03.540> most<00:04:03.720> promising<00:04:04.109> revenue<00:04:04.650> stream<00:04:04.979> by<00:04:05.129> a

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
their most promising revenue stream by a

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.390 
their most promising revenue stream by a
lot<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:06.090> that's<00:04:06.359> what<00:04:06.659> brings<00:04:06.810> into<00:04:07.139> question

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
lot so that's what brings into question

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.110 
lot so that's what brings into question
why<00:04:08.400> are<00:04:08.609> they<00:04:08.790> doing<00:04:08.849> this<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.449> that<00:04:10.019> fair<00:04:10.409> I

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
why are they doing this is that fair I

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.759 
why are they doing this is that fair I
think<00:04:12.120> what<00:04:12.389> our<00:04:12.599> colleague<00:04:13.439> has<00:04:13.560> mentioned

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
think what our colleague has mentioned

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.890 
think what our colleague has mentioned
is<00:04:14.129> really<00:04:14.759> the<00:04:14.879> key<00:04:15.060> it's<00:04:15.329> an<00:04:15.569> ideological

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
is really the key it's an ideological

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.409 
is really the key it's an ideological
project<00:04:16.709> it's<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.949> political<00:04:17.459> project<00:04:17.729> it<00:04:18.180> can

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
project it's a political project it can

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.360 
project it's a political project it can
be<00:04:18.570> compared<00:04:18.989> on<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.169> media<00:04:19.680> level<00:04:19.859> with

be compared on a media level with

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.700

BBC America but there is something more
