00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.959
 hi guys then this evening a video 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.630
 fast video of the queen of univideo 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:15.330
 update on the Christmas tree 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.550
 with magazines because I decided to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.119
 answer a video to me 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.070
 you are doing 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.529
 in almost all almost all of them 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.060
 you asked me this question or not 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.039
 I always have time to respond to everyone 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.480
 or maybe there are also those who don't 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.289
 however, if his head is placed 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.199
 then in the tubes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.480
 maybe we make a video then the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.390
 question is how to replace the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.070
 imaginary spray glue because in the video 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.790
 so the little tree lists me 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.790
 I put the link 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.059
 then in that video I made you see 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.890
 that to pulverize we say 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.129
 sprinkle the glitter only with sapling 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.070
 he used this famous spray glue 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.180
 with the spray it looks pretty 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.710
 untraceable because so many people tell me 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.729
 that they ca n't find it from anybody 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.979
 part 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.229
 so you see me ask me what 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.850
 alternatively use me now 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.350
 I wanted to show you the sapling in which 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.060
 magazines I made this year because 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.740
 those of last year that I did 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.110
 see in the video released at the home of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.070
 my in Italy this year I have 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.070
 accomplished this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.799
 and then there is also another one but on the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.220
 mobile and as you see here I decided to 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.420
 attach rhinestones to us 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.369
 from bottles that he showed in 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.080
 video of the decorations of the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.750
 christmas star made with rolls la 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.159
 toilet paper and I had advanced and 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.720
 so he decided to stick it on 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.000
 give it an extra touch of light and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.509
 obviously as you see I put glitter 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.250
 donated then I did not have this year 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.740
 spray glue 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.750
 here is the gimmick and I found it 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.670
 the mou of those things that come all over 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.860
 for home improvement DIY 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.409
 from you that there are also in Italy that 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.880
 in fact they are the shops where the usual 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.979
 when I answer you I recommend 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.300
 try looking for this bubble spray 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.680
 because the on.li I also found it in 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.410
 italy are briko- type stores eurobrico 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.590
 ovi where you find a bit of everything 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.810
 in short, I think that kind of shop 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.060
 that maybe even good hardware 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.540
 or in short, must the paint factories of 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.320
 usually they should keep this kind of 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.030
 material 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.380
 but obviously it is not so easy to 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.360
 find out that you are all there 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.530
 asking where the castes find this 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.989
 neck 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.489
 so I don't have a moment 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.380
 in which I realized I didn't have it 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.590
 glue braille 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.420
 and then used the vinyl glue of 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.710
 I used to say in my answers that it was 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.380
 better not to use vinyl glue 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.850
 because vinyl glue is very liquid 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.040
 or in any case water-based and therefore there was 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.130
 the risk that the pages of the magazine 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.960
 which are however of thin paper yes 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.390
 crumple up if you fold it yes 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.140
 changed then I used it 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.510
 pure extended with a fan brush 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.700
 that now this is nice here 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.350
 fan and I used this 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.100
 because from these sectors a lot 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:24.430
 separate and with different lengths 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:28.120
 in this way they manage to enter too 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.260
 inside the folded pages e 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.630
 then the glue can be distributed 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.430
 better in a more uniform way than most 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:40.220
 uniform then you see the result 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.720
 we say somehow there is in the sense 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.890
 that the glitter is rightly so 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.380
 attacked because it has the effect 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.230
 I think it's different and I'll also explain 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.930
 why is different and I think it will succeed 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:59.440
 also to see then you see the glitter 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.950
 they are distributed less 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.750
 ordered less homogeneous in the sense that 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.140
 even if you try to spread the glue 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.430
 the best possible 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.830
 however, portions remain 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.640
 let's say streaks where there is 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.910
 glue and instead of the points where 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.180
 it is not distributed and glitter goes off 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.740
 to stick only where the glue is 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:28.950
 in fact you see that you see the glitter 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.850
 it has attached itself very well however in some 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:36.870
 points to some points in some places 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.650
 the schaefer effect did not arrive 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.700
 it's nice anyway because it still shines 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.680
 it glitters but I prefer the effect with the 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.850
 we recommend the spray glue for that 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.100
 also because the spray glue really 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.980
 arrives everywhere there is really benches in the 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.840
 smaller ravines so when born 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:04.110
 sprinkling too short for this yes 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.980
 attacks and as if they attacked one 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.020
 for one 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.300
 that is, its micro glitter that is 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.060
 they stick one by one on this glue 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:16.110
 spray while on the vinyl crowd 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.680
 sile is poured it settles everything together 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.890
 in bulk and then once you go dry 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.500
 to remove excess and remains remains 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.660
 this however remains as it does as one 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.229
 crust species heard to see 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.830
 the glittering breading that 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:36.300
 personally the other one is pretty 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.070
 more beautiful slice because in the other 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.680
 effect not seen you do not see this 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:45.009
 glitter toast can be seen in pages 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.240
 and it is micro glitter 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:50.889
 much nicer to me so you can 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.599
 use vinyl glue if not 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.300
 you have absolutely no way to find 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.069
 that spray but I recommend you anyway 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.180
 that spray because the set a lot more 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.159
 beautiful 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.479
 I definitely recommend the spray glue 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.309
 if you find it 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.499
 look for it in the kind of shops that you 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:10.569
 I said you think you will find it 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:11.919
 and this was my update for 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:15.009
 answer your question the most 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.229
 frequent and let me know 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.379
 let me know how you managed 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.909
 solve this crowd catch 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.979
 maybe there are other solutions than me 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.779
 I have not considered then let me know 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.809
 what you used let me in 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:32.499
