00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.600
 Hello everyone guys and welcome new details in tactics in this brief 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.349
 video I wanted to make a little bit of clarity on the question that from the messages that me 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.099
 have arrived since it is still not clear at all 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.700
 that is, the question does not count a zombis 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.410
 still many of you I keep wondering but because I don't have it as I do 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.900
 download 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.949
 first of all 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.800
 first clarity 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 looks down zombie inoxpran 2025 are two completely different things 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.340
 look down 2025 is a map that we only and exclusively 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.340
 for the multiplayr now I can even see it 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.090
 this is look down 2025 there is the only one for the multiple r &amp; c year 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.600
 pretty much everyone who bought the game any version either 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.100
 but that was bought if not the baby waanna oggio pronounced however in the 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.520
 very first days ie 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.990
 lille letter bought the games that arrived at the store practically 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.200
 I must also have already had all the 25 knickers ok this is one of the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.270
 curbs there is no zombie mode for nokton 2025 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.180
 there is only online 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.380
 now 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.870
 this is the look down zombies 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.440
 that you had showed excess loc 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.110
 the zombies 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.300
 how do you get those who bought the normal person in the game 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.580
 westbrook down zombies does not conceal not even 1025 underwear is not available for 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.820
 being able to activate it at the beginning there is no need for a code the code goes 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.830
 added 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.670
 iran and then later you can have 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.259
 for a tomtom and on the same thing but not everyone can have it 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.509
 are the conditions ragusa clarified another time I want to form total clarity way 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.159
 such that if someone were to ask for it again this video then 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.650
 perhaps. 1 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.190
 point 2 how do you get nuketown john wiese 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.050
 you have to buy this or the hardened version expert so if logically 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.089
 if you already have the normal version 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:16.399
 god is andy black ops 2 I don't want to sell the proper buy of this 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.399
 now we are known as retailers 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:24.609
 destop I don't know if you find it more or rather you probably won't find it 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:25.369
 more 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:26.589
 % 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:31.229
 if it is found it is found online perhaps by people who have bought it it sells it later 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.319
 a price a little more in fact 99 euros costs a bit of - before 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.409
 the alternative 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.679
 would be 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.179
 have what 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:44.009
 buy the collector's edition at keer shunt car parks 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.829
 that for every cost even more on print 9 the col du role you have 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.119
 then let's see 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.919
 only service you have already bought 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.599
 this edition or this edition you can have nuketown zombies 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.249
 otherwise you don't have it 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:04.249
 there is an exception for those who play immediately bought us suspense in black ops 2 there is 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.649
 the possibility of making a farm will be found below 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:12.759
 apo I would say beer the bell bell to relax beach on practically 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.759
 with ma 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.729
 because fraud will no longer be available ok I try to write for very few 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:21.849
 days because he says 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.239
 deadlines until November 26th you can have her drink after no anyway 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.749
 connection you can do the I could then also happens in more look down 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:31.469
 zombies 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.629
 the only alternative 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.200
 for those who have not taken on PC idv on sky on 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.299
 black ops 2 or that they have already bought 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.279
 practically blackops 2 on other hand platforms in the versions I did 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.689
 see this announcement and compare the yes yes 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.030
 the site is a step from me nothing but care 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.080
 follow the correspondent of the old elite premium by way offer 3 ie 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.829
 practically in italiam a one-off figure in this case of 49 euros 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.439
 then maybe size gets a bit crafty you can even make my qualkosina some 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:07.739
 cases 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.499
 and then later I told him all the dlc that will come out during the year without 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:15.169
 pay them so now just a slightly reduced figure at the price of all 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:15.909
 dlc 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.979
 however it is so, since this version seems, this site does not pass in December 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.879
 we will receive an assimilated weight of the IIC 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.849
 look down zombies 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.139
 I said that you can take a little bit I talk about the farmhouse xbox for 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.919
 cases bought directly from xbox costs 4000 microsoft points if 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.550
 then we go on to never buy non-site ponzi dosons where they cost less 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.610
 compared to normal 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.590
 what little is saved 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.750
 well guys this video is over I hope I have made it clear once 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.199
 for all on the question look down zombies came a 2025 on the matter 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.580
 you are step on how the town song will come 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.690
 and I went upstairs, see you next time if you found the 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:00.969
 content of this video at home south enjoy a greeting all show
