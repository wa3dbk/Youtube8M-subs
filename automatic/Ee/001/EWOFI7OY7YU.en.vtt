00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
an 11 foot cord I don't really need an

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.580 
an 11 foot cord I don't really need an
11-foot<00:00:20.609> cord<00:00:20.850> because<00:00:21.090> my<00:00:21.270> plug<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.289> right

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
there um but I can see how that could be

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.740 
there um but I can see how that could be
useful<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.410> somebody<00:00:26.130> who<00:00:26.430> needs<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.029> go<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
a cool button right there for like the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.510 
a cool button right there for like the
cool<00:00:47.730> glass<00:00:48.030> before<00:00:48.539> i<00:00:48.750> got<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.489> hair<00:00:50.489> dryer

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
cool glass before i got this hair dryer

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.819 
cool glass before i got this hair dryer
i<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:51.270> actually<00:00:51.420> using<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> t3<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
i was actually using the t3 the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.220 
i was actually using the t3 the
overnight<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.570> one<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
overnight one I like this one because it

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.590 
overnight one I like this one because it
literally<00:00:55.920> weighs<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.550> nothing<00:00:57.059> it's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
literally weighs like nothing it's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.389 
literally weighs like nothing it's
really<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.289> lightweight<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.190> one

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
really really lightweight and this one

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.610 
really really lightweight and this one
is<00:00:59.730> quite<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> bit<00:01:00.629> heavier<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.050> comparison

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
is quite a bit heavier in comparison

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.700 
is quite a bit heavier in comparison
it's<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:02.340> heavy<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:03.390> I'm<00:01:03.719> weak<00:01:04.019> so

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
it's not really heavy but I'm weak so

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
it's not really heavy but I'm weak so
the<00:01:05.430> difference<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:06.030> noticeable<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.590> me<00:01:08.810> so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the difference is noticeable for me so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.109 
the difference is noticeable for me so
it<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:09.930> heavier<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.920> quite<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.640> larger

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
it is heavier it is quite a bit larger

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.070 
it is heavier it is quite a bit larger
as<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.509> know<00:01:15.630> blow

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
as well but with this one you know blow

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.980 
as well but with this one you know blow
drying<00:01:16.290> my<00:01:16.380> hair<00:01:16.680> wasn't<00:01:17.009> really<00:01:17.689> worth<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
drying my hair wasn't really worth it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.480 
drying my hair wasn't really worth it
because<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:19.439> hair<00:01:19.650> would<00:01:19.770> end<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:20.009> being<00:01:20.040> this

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
because my hair would end up being this

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.130 
because my hair would end up being this
big<00:01:20.820> huge<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.520> frizzy<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.880> no<00:01:24.540> matter<00:01:24.720> what<00:01:24.840> I

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
big huge and frizzy and no matter what I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.940 
big huge and frizzy and no matter what I
did<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.470> what<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.070> used<00:01:26.840> brush<00:01:27.840> any<00:01:28.259> products<00:01:28.829> it

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
did or what I used brush any products it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.649 
did or what I used brush any products it
was<00:01:29.070> still<00:01:29.250> huge<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
was still huge and with this one I

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.120 
was still huge and with this one I
really<00:01:30.840> haven't<00:01:31.079> had<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.350> problem<00:01:31.770> with

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
really haven't had that problem with

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.190 
really haven't had that problem with
this<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:33.090> smoother<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> lot

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
this one it's a lot smoother it's a lot

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.370 
this one it's a lot smoother it's a lot
shinier<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.310> less<00:01:35.790> frizz<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:37.200> as

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
shinier it's less frizz and it's not as

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.749 
shinier it's less frizz and it's not as
big<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.720> takes<00:01:39.720> me<00:01:40.020> about<00:01:40.259> 15<00:01:41.040> minutes<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
big so it takes me about 15 minutes to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.969 
big so it takes me about 15 minutes to
blow<00:01:41.909> dry<00:01:42.090> my<00:01:42.150> hair<00:01:42.329> that's<00:01:42.899> probably<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.710> lot

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
blow dry my hair that's probably a lot

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.950 
blow dry my hair that's probably a lot
longer<00:01:44.159> than<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.880> majority<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.600> because

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
longer than the majority of you because

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.010 
longer than the majority of you because
I<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.380> such<00:01:46.770> thick<00:01:47.250> hair<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.810> so

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I do have such thick hair and I have so

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.450 
I do have such thick hair and I have so
much<00:01:49.200> hair<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:49.920> why<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.100> takes<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
much hair that that's why it takes a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.130 
much hair that that's why it takes a
while<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.939> know<00:01:51.000> when<00:01:51.270> my<00:01:51.299> sister<00:01:51.689> uses<00:01:51.869> this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
while I know when my sister uses this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.520 
while I know when my sister uses this
one<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:53.549> takes<00:01:53.759> her<00:01:54.030> 15<00:01:54.509> minutes<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.079> blow<00:01:55.290> dry

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
one it takes her 15 minutes to blow dry

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709 
one it takes her 15 minutes to blow dry
and<00:01:55.740> straighten<00:01:56.100> her<00:01:56.280> hair<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> mean<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.600> all

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
and straighten her hair so I mean it all

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.840 
and straighten her hair so I mean it all
depends<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.920> 15<00:01:59.189> minutes<00:01:59.430> for<00:01:59.579> me<00:01:59.700> it's

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
depends but 15 minutes for me it's

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.700 
depends but 15 minutes for me it's
really<00:02:00.030> fast<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:00.990> such<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> good<00:02:01.649> job

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
really fast for it to do such a good job

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.840 
really fast for it to do such a good job
and<00:02:01.979> then<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> don't<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.430> spend<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.729> much

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and then I don't have to spend as much

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.490 
and then I don't have to spend as much
time<00:02:02.909> straightening<00:02:03.479> my<00:02:03.570> hair<00:02:03.600> also<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
time straightening my hair also the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.749 
time straightening my hair also the
thing<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.070> probably<00:02:05.250> takes<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.610> while

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
thing is that it probably takes a while

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.300 
thing is that it probably takes a while
for<00:02:05.790> me<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.390> because<00:02:06.810> my<00:02:07.140> hair<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.469> colored<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
for me is because my hair is colored and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.490 
for me is because my hair is colored and
I<00:02:08.399> don't<00:02:08.700> want<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.970> damage<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.420> further<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.080> use

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
I don't want to damage it further I use

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.890 
I don't want to damage it further I use
the<00:02:10.739> lowest<00:02:11.160> settings<00:02:11.610> for<00:02:11.910> both<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.360> i<00:02:12.450> lo<00:02:12.660> I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the lowest settings for both so i lo I

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.800 
the lowest settings for both so i lo I
use<00:02:13.230> low

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
use low

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.500 
use low
air<00:02:14.080> flow<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.040> then<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.459> use<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.760> low<00:02:16.150> heat

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
air flow and then I use a low heat

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.870 
air flow and then I use a low heat
setting<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:17.800> might<00:02:18.220> also<00:02:18.430> be<00:02:18.670> why<00:02:18.819> it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
setting so that might also be why it

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.600 
setting so that might also be why it
takes<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.360> little<00:02:19.510> bit<00:02:19.720> longer<00:02:20.020> but<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.250> still

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
takes a little bit longer but I still

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.059 
takes a little bit longer but I still
find<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:22.060> that's<00:02:22.840> pretty<00:02:23.080> fast<00:02:23.349> for<00:02:23.530> drying<00:02:23.830> my

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
find it that's pretty fast for drying my

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.800 
find it that's pretty fast for drying my
hair<00:02:24.280> some<00:02:24.610> things<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.880> don't<00:02:24.940> like<00:02:25.209> about<00:02:25.330> this

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
hair some things I don't like about this

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.420 
hair some things I don't like about this
though<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.349> don't<00:02:26.620> really<00:02:26.890> like<00:02:27.040> where<00:02:27.310> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
though I don't really like where the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.089 
though I don't really like where the
placement<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.270> buttons<00:02:28.630> are<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.560> need<00:02:29.770> to

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
placement of the buttons are you need to

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.809 
placement of the buttons are you need to
push<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.420> buttons<00:02:32.400> backwards<00:02:33.400> towards<00:02:33.730> the

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
push the buttons backwards towards the

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.360 
push the buttons backwards towards the
back<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.269> blow<00:02:34.599> dryer<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:35.470> go<00:02:35.620> up<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.220> turn

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
back of the blow dryer to go up to turn

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.100 
back of the blow dryer to go up to turn
it<00:02:36.489> on<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:36.910> turn<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.180> higher<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:37.840> really

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
it on and to turn it higher it's really

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.940 
it on and to turn it higher it's really
easy<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.500> just<00:02:38.800> click<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.190> forward<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.950> then

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
easy to just click that forward and then

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.860 
easy to just click that forward and then
I<00:02:42.010> also<00:02:42.040> don't<00:02:42.400> like<00:02:42.519> where<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.300> cool<00:02:43.599> blast

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
I also don't like where the cool blast

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.350 
I also don't like where the cool blast
is<00:02:44.200> because<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.680> know<00:02:44.950> multiple<00:02:45.700> times<00:02:45.970> when

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
is because I know multiple times when

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.210 
is because I know multiple times when
I'm<00:02:46.510> blow<00:02:47.200> drying<00:02:47.230> my<00:02:47.500> hair<00:02:47.739> I'll

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
I'm blow drying my hair I'll

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.680 
I'm blow drying my hair I'll
accidentally<00:02:48.760> click<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.180> just<00:02:49.390> because<00:02:49.540> it's

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
accidentally click it just because it's

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.509 
accidentally click it just because it's
in<00:02:49.810> like<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.080> trigger<00:02:50.410> place<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.400> other

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
in like the trigger place the other

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.430 
in like the trigger place the other
thing<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:52.060> wanted<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.420> show<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.630> guys<00:02:52.750> was<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
thing I wanted to show you guys was the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.460 
thing I wanted to show you guys was the
crystal<00:02:53.860> seal<00:02:54.069> from<00:02:54.700> barb<00:02:55.239> barb<00:02:55.420> this<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:56.049> a

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
crystal seal from barb barb this is a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.650 
crystal seal from barb barb this is a
straightening<00:02:57.040> serum<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.420> direction

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
straightening serum so the direction

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.930 
straightening serum so the direction
said<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.170> can<00:02:59.319> use<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.470> before<00:02:59.739> or<00:03:00.010> after<00:03:00.790> you

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
said you can use it before or after you

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.490 
said you can use it before or after you
blow<00:03:01.120> dry<00:03:01.269> your<00:03:01.299> hair<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.870> really<00:03:02.260> feel

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
blow dry your hair and I really feel

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.949 
blow dry your hair and I really feel
like<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.830> makes<00:03:03.069> a<00:03:03.280> difference<00:03:03.459> in<00:03:03.880> how<00:03:04.480> my

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
like it makes a difference in how my

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.259 
like it makes a difference in how my
hair<00:03:05.170> straight<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.769> is<00:03:06.010> made<00:03:06.640> with<00:03:06.849> silicone

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
hair straight this is made with silicone

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.610 
hair straight this is made with silicone
so<00:03:07.540> it's<00:03:07.810> not<00:03:08.019> going<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.230> leave<00:03:08.319> your<00:03:08.440> hair

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
so it's not going to leave your hair

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.830 
so it's not going to leave your hair
greasy<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.220> oily<00:03:09.370> looking<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.239> the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
greasy and oily looking and the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.539 
greasy and oily looking and the
directions<00:03:11.260> say<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.440> use<00:03:11.650> four<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.040> five<00:03:12.190> drops

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
directions say to use four to five drops

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.039 
directions say to use four to five drops
which<00:03:12.910> i<00:03:13.060> think<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.360> really<00:03:13.599> good<00:03:13.780> amount

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
which i think is a really good amount

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.920 
which i think is a really good amount
for<00:03:14.260> my<00:03:14.470> hair<00:03:14.769> just<00:03:15.040> because<00:03:15.549> its<00:03:15.880> massive<00:03:16.269> but

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
for my hair just because its massive but

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.229 
for my hair just because its massive but
if<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.260> have<00:03:17.380> thinner<00:03:17.620> hair<00:03:18.010> or<00:03:18.730> shorter<00:03:19.060> hair

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
if you have thinner hair or shorter hair

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.300 
if you have thinner hair or shorter hair
and<00:03:19.420> that's<00:03:19.600> thinner<00:03:19.900> might<00:03:20.709> not<00:03:20.859> be<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.130> best

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
and that's thinner might not be the best

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.060 
and that's thinner might not be the best
option<00:03:21.519> I<00:03:21.790> would<00:03:21.850> probably<00:03:22.060> use<00:03:22.359> maybe<00:03:22.959> two<00:03:23.470> to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
option I would probably use maybe two to

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.340 
option I would probably use maybe two to
three<00:03:24.100> drops<00:03:24.760> instead<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.329> four<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.630> five<00:03:25.810> but

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
three drops instead of four to five but

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.050 
three drops instead of four to five but
i<00:03:26.410> really<00:03:26.829> really<00:03:26.950> love<00:03:27.190> this<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.670> smells<00:03:27.940> like

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
i really really love this it smells like

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.150 
i really really love this it smells like
incense<00:03:28.329> which<00:03:29.260> i<00:03:29.440> do<00:03:29.500> like<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.950> way<00:03:30.040> it

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
incense which i do like the way it
