00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.590 
across this little cleft in another clip
and<00:00:34.399> yeah<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.610> part<00:00:35.850> took<00:00:35.969> us<00:00:36.090> about<00:00:36.300> an<00:00:36.450> hour

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
and yeah that part took us about an hour

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.090 
and yeah that part took us about an hour
and<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> half<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.829> really

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and a half to do and it was really

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.560 
and a half to do and it was really
difficult<00:00:38.280> for<00:00:38.610> us<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.260> I

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
difficult for us but we got it and I

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.150 
difficult for us but we got it and I
recommend<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.590> probably

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
recommend if you do this you probably

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.180 
recommend if you do this you probably
shouldn't<00:00:44.789> need<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.300> least<00:00:45.329> three<00:00:45.780> people<00:00:46.190> I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
shouldn't need at least three people I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.729 
shouldn't need at least three people I
did<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.700> two<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.329> there's<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.440> me<00:00:49.590> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
one other person that would dumb did it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.959 
one other person that would dumb did it
and<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.739> was<00:00:52.800> pretty<00:00:53.010> difficult<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:55.969> kind

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
to sprint sprint right there and then

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.520 
to sprint sprint right there and then
you<00:02:30.239> at<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.510> concussion<00:02:31.050> rifle<00:02:31.170> have<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
you at the concussion rifle have to

you at the concussion rifle have to
shoot<00:02:31.739> him<00:02:31.769> in<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:31.980> back<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.700> really

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
shoot him in the back this is really

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.420 
shoot him in the back this is really
really<00:02:33.330> really<00:02:33.660> difficult<00:02:33.989> did<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.010> over<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
really really difficult did it over and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.100 
really really difficult did it over and
over<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.760> over<00:02:35.880> again<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.569> here's<00:02:36.840> first

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
over and over again so here's first

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.390 
over and over again so here's first
mission<00:02:37.410> or<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.590> person<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.920> gets<00:02:38.100> shot

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
mission or the person that gets shot

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.850 
mission or the person that gets shot
across<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.049> took<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.350> quite<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> bit<00:02:40.769> of

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
across so that took is quite a bit of

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.120 
across so that took is quite a bit of
time<00:02:41.269> I<00:02:42.269> think<00:02:42.989> what<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.470> reason<00:02:43.769> why<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:43.980> took

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
time I think what the reason why I took

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.759 
time I think what the reason why I took
us<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:44.489> much<00:02:44.610> time<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.239> cuz<00:02:45.660> got<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> really

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
us so much time is cuz got a really

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.180 
us so much time is cuz got a really
really<00:02:47.010> bad<00:02:47.250> checkpoint<00:02:47.819> until<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:49.190> 45

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
really bad checkpoint until like 45

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.830 
really bad checkpoint until like 45
minutes<00:02:50.430> after<00:02:50.819> we<00:02:50.910> did<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:51.660> had<00:02:51.810> to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
minutes after we did it so we had to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.320 
minutes after we did it so we had to
like<00:02:52.080> perverts<00:02:52.950> last<00:02:53.160> save<00:02:53.459> run<00:02:53.819> for<00:02:54.150> like<00:02:54.269> a

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
like perverts last save run for like a

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.630 
like perverts last save run for like a
minute<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.870> then<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.799> it<00:02:55.920> again<00:02:55.980> then<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.549> get

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
minute and then do it again then we get

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.420 
minute and then do it again then we get
a<00:02:56.819> laugh<00:02:57.299> doing<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.870> then<00:02:57.989> we'd<00:02:58.170> have<00:02:58.200> to

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
a laugh doing it and then we'd have to

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.009 
a laugh doing it and then we'd have to
run<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.670> another<00:02:59.760> minute<00:03:00.090> get<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> same

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
run for another minute get to the same

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.539 
run for another minute get to the same
place<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.560> do<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.489> fail<00:03:02.700> again<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:04.019> um<00:03:04.549> the

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
place and do it and fail again so um the

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.270 
place and do it and fail again so um the
checkpoint<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> get<00:03:06.299> there<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:07.130> really<00:03:08.130> really

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
checkpoint to get there is really really

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.680 
checkpoint to get there is really really
difficult<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:10.820> this<00:03:11.820> isn't<00:03:12.150> easy<00:03:12.269> i'm<00:03:12.510> not

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
difficult so this isn't easy i'm not

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.870 
difficult so this isn't easy i'm not
suggesting<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.350> go<00:03:13.590> out<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.920> try<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.220> I'm

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
suggesting you go out and try it I'm

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
just kind of showing you a basic idea of

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.039

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
if you go along the edge you'll skip the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.119 
if you go along the edge you'll skip the
loading<00:03:25.500> zone
