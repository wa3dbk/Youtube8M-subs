features on this point that do kit but I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.400 
features on this point that do kit but I
wish<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.280> had<00:00:50.489> an<00:00:50.610> air<00:00:50.730> about<00:00:50.879> 10<00:00:51.270> first<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
wish I had an air about 10 first and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.720 
wish I had an air about 10 first and
foremost<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.949> point<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.489> model

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
foremost on to point out that this model

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.910 
foremost on to point out that this model
is<00:00:54.090> highly<00:00:54.300> currently<00:00:54.840> available<00:00:55.079> with<00:00:55.620> the

transmission it's not an automatic
transmission<00:01:04.439> although<00:01:04.890> drives<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.549> one

transmission although drives like one

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.130 
transmission although drives like one
it's<00:01:05.909> still<00:01:06.090> got<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.240> mechanical<00:01:06.750> clutch<00:01:06.960> that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
it's still got a mechanical clutch that

it's still got a mechanical clutch that
is<00:01:07.290> controlled<00:01:07.710> electronically<00:01:08.369> hence<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
reason why it doesn't have a clutch
