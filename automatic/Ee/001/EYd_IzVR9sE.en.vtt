00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.880
 Hi, I'm Carolina and I give them the 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.850
 welcome to my culinary and today I 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.520
 I want to present the arepa the arepa is 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.430
 a traditional Venezuelan meal that 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 prepare a flour called flour with 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.290
 a precooked flour the arepas are 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.780
 delicious we can eat for the 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.820
 breakfast for the bone for dinner and 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.780
 the little ones love it but the 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.420
 snack 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.770
 to prepare it 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.230
 we need bread flour 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:45.200
 water a little salt the first thing that 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.570
 we do is place with a little water 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.130
 let's stop 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.130
 a cup of water 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.809
 we add a cup of bread flour for 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.350
 those who have no experience doing 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.699
 arepas the best way to start in 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.790
 the preparation of arepas 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.090
 is to use a fork to mix the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.550
 flour in the water we already carry a 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.950
 half a teaspoon of salt 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.580
 and we add one or two tablespoons of 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.580
 vegetable oil 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.250
 we started to add the cup of 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.250
 flour and let's mix 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:40.000
 to prevent clumping because 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:40.000
 if they are very very well 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.630
 Once the flour is incorporated into the water 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.479
 we proceed to mix with our hands 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.310
 and if the flour is very dry 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.690
 we add a little more water we want 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.690
 that is a more current 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.990
 approximately three four 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.750
 tablespoons of water 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.750
 and we are mixing our hands 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.010
 in a uniform way that is the same 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.010
 consistency 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.440
 ah 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.230
 once our hand is installed 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.000
 let stand for a couple of minutes 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.420
 to subsequently proceed to make the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.420
 areas 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.180
 ah 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.510
 we leave our more to review 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.720
 once our dough well rested 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.430
 we grab a small portion of the dough 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.430
 and we give it a ball shape 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.460
 once we have formed our 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:27.460
 small peeled we begin to crush 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.460
 with the back of our hands 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.420
 doing the same pressure and giving it 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.420
 turns 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.370
 in the case that the arepa does not fit 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.410
 completely round for the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.600
 beginners 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.130
 as we see the repatriates of our 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.060
 hands and palms 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.060
 come rounding 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.130
 we deserve the sisters as a little 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.020
 of water because there are many faces and thorax 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.710
 form the ball 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.710
 in our hands 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.200
 they are very rich they are usually repeated 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:17.209
 we make our ball other we go 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:22.389
 crushing with our hands 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.389
 and spinning it while you take it 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.059
 once 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:07.270
 elaborated in our arepas we proceed 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:10.259
 to cook them we put them a little 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.699
 oil in a pan with a napkin 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.619
 to avoid that our arepas in 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.439
 our guinness up at the time of 

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:20.649
 cook it we add a little oil 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:24.099
 and distributes it in all sources of 

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:26.360
 the base with a napkin our 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.940
 pan must be hot 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.830
 we proceed to cook our arepas 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.620
 nothing happens nothing see you 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.260
 approximately 3 to 4 minutes 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.630
 turning once you 're thin 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.630
 we know and we flip it from the other side 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.290
 and we want an average temperature
