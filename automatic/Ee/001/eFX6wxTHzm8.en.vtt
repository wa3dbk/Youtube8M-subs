00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
let's start off at first a bad point of

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.290 
let's start off at first a bad point of
this<00:00:10.110> game<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:11.010> it's<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.940> maps<00:00:12.150> are

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
this game is that it's the maps are

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.209 
this game is that it's the maps are
really<00:00:12.330> small<00:00:12.870> or<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.380> map<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.740> really<00:00:13.920> small

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
really small or the map is really small

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.550 
really small or the map is really small
I<00:00:14.280> only<00:00:14.460> played<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:14.969> map<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> can<00:00:16.049> only<00:00:16.199> say

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
I only played one map so I can only say

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.250 
I only played one map so I can only say
that<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.910> lot<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.210> chaos<00:00:18.449> over<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:19.050> it's

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
that it's a lot of chaos over here it's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.040 
that it's a lot of chaos over here it's
like<00:00:19.439> Call<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> Duty<00:00:20.820> inside<00:00:21.180> battlefield<00:00:21.810> or

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
on the Xbox by the way because beta is

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380 
on the Xbox by the way because beta is
only<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.979> expert<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> game<00:01:12.150> may<00:01:12.330> be

better or may not be better on the PC I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.310 
better or may not be better on the PC I
don't<00:01:15.000> know<00:01:15.119> I'm<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.410 
PC probably image and see the reload
speed<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:20.009> bad<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.580> game<00:01:20.640> or<00:01:21.299> at

they're going to patch it but it takes

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
they're going to patch it but it takes
ages<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.720> reload<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.619> enemies<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.159> kill

you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.720> customize<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.320> scope<00:01:37.680> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
you can see I can customize the scope I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.690 
you can see I can customize the scope I
can<00:01:38.070> customize<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> barrel<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.630> muzzle<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
can customize the barrel the muzzle the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.950 
can customize the barrel the muzzle the
receiver<00:01:41.700> group<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.450> don't<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.689> where<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
receiver group I don't know where that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.539 
receiver group I don't know where that
is<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> magazine<00:01:43.710> style<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.220> funny

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
is the magazine style that's funny

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.340 
is the magazine style that's funny
so<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> magazines<00:01:45.540> are<00:01:45.720> different<00:01:46.170> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
so the magazines are different I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.749 
so the magazines are different I
actually<00:01:46.799> don't<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.549> does

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
actually don't know what that does

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.310 
actually don't know what that does
though<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.509> change<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> paint<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
though you can change the paint and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.090 
though you can change the paint and
that's<00:01:49.439> also<00:01:49.710> cool<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.290> go<00:01:52.470> with

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that's also cool but I like to go with

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700 
that's also cool but I like to go with
that<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.520> non<00:01:53.820> paint<00:01:54.060> actually<00:01:54.570> they<00:01:55.110> may<00:01:55.409> or

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that with non paint actually they may or

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.609 
that with non paint actually they may or
may<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:56.130> add<00:01:56.399> more<00:01:57.350> customizations<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
may not add more customizations in the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.260 
may not add more customizations in the
full<00:01:58.829> game<00:01:59.040> because<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.640> only<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.030> beta

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
full game because this is only the beta

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.569 
full game because this is only the beta
and<00:02:00.600> that's<00:02:01.170> why<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.439> review<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.070> only<00:02:02.280> about

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
and that's why this review is only about

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.370 
and that's why this review is only about
the<00:02:02.790> beta<00:02:02.969> should<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.810> game<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.170> should

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the beta should I get the game or should

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.499 
the beta should I get the game or should
I<00:02:04.469> not<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.040> game<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.329> see

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
I not get the game so as you can see

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.359 
I not get the game so as you can see
they<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.110> spawn<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.590> kill<00:02:08.250> streak

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
they I can spawn on a kill streak

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.639 
they I can spawn on a kill streak
because<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.940> good<00:02:09.270> thing<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.410> kill

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
because a good thing is that the kill

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.839 
because a good thing is that the kill
streaks<00:02:10.890> are<00:02:11.069> good<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.550> game

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
streaks are good in this game

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.040 
streaks are good in this game
I<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.270> them

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
I like them

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.030 
I like them
being<00:02:13.200> there<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.620> choose<00:02:13.800> between

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
being there you can choose between

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.570 
being there you can choose between
support<00:02:14.970> or<00:02:15.270> assault<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.920> as<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.370> see

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
support or assault and as you can see

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.310 
support or assault and as you can see
the<00:02:17.850> RINs<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:18.480> slow<00:02:18.690> with<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.960> light

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
the RINs really slow with the light

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.500 
the RINs really slow with the light
machine<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.040> that's<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.430> bad<00:02:20.670> point<00:02:20.910> and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
machine and so that's a bad point and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.110 
machine and so that's a bad point and
you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.990> really<00:02:22.200> feel<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.940> mound<00:02:23.940> of

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
you can really feel the the mound of

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.270 
you can really feel the the mound of
weight<00:02:24.570> your<00:02:24.930> weapon<00:02:25.320> ways<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.890> don't<00:02:25.950> like

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
weight your weapon ways and I don't like

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.780 
weight your weapon ways and I don't like
that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
that

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.580 
that
I<00:02:26.820> like<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.390> spawn<00:02:27.660> principle<00:02:28.140> though<00:02:28.290> that

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
I like the spawn principle though that

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.560 
I like the spawn principle though that
you<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.830> spawn<00:02:29.070> on<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> Black<00:02:29.580> Hawk<00:02:30.210> for

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
you can spawn on the Black Hawk for

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.810 
you can spawn on the Black Hawk for
example<00:02:31.050> or<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.260> your<00:02:31.410> squad<00:02:31.740> mates<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:32.490> it's

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
example or in your squad mates but it's

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.180 
example or in your squad mates but it's
actually<00:02:33.240> not<00:02:33.270> necessary<00:02:33.990> because<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.950> game

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
actually not necessary because this game

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.090 
actually not necessary because this game
is<00:02:35.220> already<00:02:35.580> really<00:02:35.940> close<00:02:36.620> quarters<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.980> as

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
is already really close quarters and as

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.130 
is already really close quarters and as
you<00:02:38.220> can<00:02:38.370> see<00:02:38.490> here's<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> great<00:02:39.000> example<00:02:39.140> using

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
you can see here's a great example using

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.560 
you can see here's a great example using
the<00:02:40.290> smoke<00:02:40.590> screen<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:41.250> arming<00:02:41.940> an<00:02:42.030> objective

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
the smoke screen in arming an objective

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.510 
the smoke screen in arming an objective
and<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.170> good<00:02:43.410> thing<00:02:43.650> about<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:44.070> game<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.490> that

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
and a good thing about this game is that

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.090 
and a good thing about this game is that
the<00:02:44.670> animation<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.420> arming<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.960> or<00:02:46.260> disarming

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the animation of arming and or disarming

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.070 
the animation of arming and or disarming
and<00:02:47.190> objective<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.880> look<00:02:48.090> looks<00:02:48.420> great<00:02:48.510> you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
and objective is look looks great you

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.530 
and objective is look looks great you
know<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.260> cut<00:02:49.920> down<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.310> wires<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:51.000> don't<00:02:51.450> know

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
know you cut down the wires I don't know

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.150 
know you cut down the wires I don't know
if<00:02:51.600> your<00:02:51.720> teammates<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.170> pick<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.620> up<00:02:52.710> or<00:02:52.950> if

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
if your teammates can pick it up or if

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.490 
if your teammates can pick it up or if
you'd<00:02:53.340> like<00:02:53.430> I'll<00:02:53.820> disable<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.750> thingy<00:02:54.990> and

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
you'd like I'll disable the thingy and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.080 
you'd like I'll disable the thingy and
then<00:02:55.650> your<00:02:55.830> teammates<00:02:56.190> start<00:02:56.490> there

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
then your teammates start there

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.090 
then your teammates start there
disabling<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.290> sometimes<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.950> also

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
disabling it and sometimes it's also

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.520 
disabling it and sometimes it's also
really<00:02:59.490> hard<00:02:59.760> to<00:03:00.090> see<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:00.690> it's<00:03:00.870> an<00:03:01.020> enemy<00:03:01.170> or<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
really hard to see if it's an enemy or a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.620 
really hard to see if it's an enemy or a
teammate<00:03:02.070> who's<00:03:02.250> shooting<00:03:02.700> at<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.360> as

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
teammate who's shooting at you and as

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.720 
teammate who's shooting at you and as
you<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.810> see<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:04.050> put<00:03:04.170> color<00:03:04.650> correction<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.430> so

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
you can see I put color correction on so

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.570 
you can see I put color correction on so
my<00:03:05.940> enemies<00:03:06.360> had<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.570> green<00:03:07.020> or<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.770> blue<00:03:07.950> named

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
my enemies had a green or a blue named

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.990 
my enemies had a green or a blue named
tank<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.060> sever<00:03:09.360> red<00:03:10.260> one<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.860> my<00:03:11.010> teammates

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
tank in sever red one and my teammates

really<00:03:13.860> really<00:03:14.790> weird<00:03:14.910> then<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
really really weird then this is the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.270 
really really weird then this is the
pontine<00:03:16.110> animation<00:03:16.590> looks<00:03:16.800> cool<00:03:17.040> right

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
pontine animation looks cool right

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.699

then<00:03:19.800> pulling<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.250> thing<00:03:20.489> it's<00:03:21.030> pretty<00:03:21.209> slow

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
then pulling that thing it's pretty slow

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.470 
then pulling that thing it's pretty slow
though<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.620> bat<00:03:23.040> point<00:03:23.430> or<00:03:23.700> actually<00:03:23.850> good

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
though but a bat point or actually good

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.150

point<00:03:24.750> let's<00:03:25.020> say<00:03:25.170> let's<00:03:25.590> say<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:25.950> good

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
point let's say let's say it's a good

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.220 
point let's say let's say it's a good
point<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.610> there<00:03:27.000> are<00:03:27.120> still<00:03:27.270> few<00:03:27.570> glitches<00:03:27.900> in

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.190 
point is there are still few glitches in
this<00:03:28.380> beta<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.330> think<00:03:30.330> that's<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.600> good<00:03:30.780> good

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
this beta and I think that's a good good

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.320 
this beta and I think that's a good good
point<00:03:31.410> because<00:03:31.560> they<00:03:31.830> will<00:03:32.130> get<00:03:32.730> noticed<00:03:33.120> and

motivate getting kills instead of
playing<00:05:08.909> the<00:05:09.120> objective<00:05:09.210> because<00:05:09.779> when<00:05:09.930> you

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
playing the objective because when you

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.540
