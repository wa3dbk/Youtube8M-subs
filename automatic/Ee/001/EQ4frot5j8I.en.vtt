usually I do want to say I like to make
the<00:03:42.430> pump<00:03:42.819> a<00:03:43.000> little<00:03:43.120> bit<00:03:43.269> higher<00:03:43.630> than<00:03:43.870> the

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
the pump a little bit higher than the

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.470 
the pump a little bit higher than the
lava<00:03:44.200> source<00:03:44.500> because<00:03:45.340> then<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.850> has<00:03:46.120> like<00:03:46.420> a

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
lava source because then it has like a

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.960 
lava source because then it has like a
suction<00:03:47.019> it's<00:03:47.769> like<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.069> giant<00:03:48.370> straw<00:03:48.760> that

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
suction it's like a giant straw that

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.270 
suction it's like a giant straw that
goes<00:03:49.120> down<00:03:49.389> it<00:03:49.840> goes<00:03:49.900> really<00:03:50.410> far<00:03:50.739> down<00:03:50.799> into

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
goes down it goes really far down into

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.890 
goes down it goes really far down into
the<00:03:51.489> lava<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:51.850> starts<00:03:52.209> sucking<00:03:52.389> it<00:03:52.600> all<00:03:52.720> up

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
the lava and starts sucking it all up

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.900 
the lava and starts sucking it all up
and<00:03:53.109> all<00:03:53.260> that<00:03:53.410> cool<00:03:53.560> stuff<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:54.190> now<00:03:54.790> we're

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
and all that cool stuff so now we're

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.190 
and all that cool stuff so now we're
gonna<00:03:55.000> bring<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.359> straight<00:03:55.540> down<00:03:55.900> this

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
gonna bring it straight down this

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.830 
gonna bring it straight down this
cobblestone<00:03:56.440> pipe

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
cobblestone pipe

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.440 
cobblestone pipe
alright<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.049> now<00:03:59.200> it's<00:03:59.410> down<00:03:59.620> here<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.450> I'm

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
alright so now it's down here and I'm

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.259 
alright so now it's down here and I'm
gonna<00:04:01.690> set<00:04:02.019> up<00:04:02.170> some<00:04:02.440> tanks<00:04:03.430> just<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:03.970> show<00:04:04.209> you

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
gonna set up some tanks just to show you

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.780 
gonna set up some tanks just to show you
how<00:04:04.989> these<00:04:05.290> work<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:07.209> then

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
how these work so then

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.930 
how these work so then
we'll<00:04:09.569> bring<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.019> across<00:04:11.930> all<00:04:12.930> right<00:04:13.940> working

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
we'll bring it across all right working

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.080 
we'll bring it across all right working
good<00:04:15.120> all<00:04:15.690> right<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.320> now<00:04:16.880> once<00:04:17.880> we<00:04:18.060> start

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
good all right so now once we start

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.270 
good all right so now once we start
pumping<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.780> lava<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.560> lava<00:04:19.769> will<00:04:20.040> come

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
pumping the lava the lava will come

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.550 
pumping the lava the lava will come
straight<00:04:20.760> over<00:04:20.790> down<00:04:21.389> it'll<00:04:21.989> start<00:04:22.199> filling

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
straight over down it'll start filling

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.270 
straight over down it'll start filling
up<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.919> tags<00:04:24.050> I'm<00:04:25.050> actually<00:04:25.290> only<00:04:25.830> gonna<00:04:25.979> put

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
up the tags I'm actually only gonna put

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.850 
up the tags I'm actually only gonna put
one<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:28.080> gonna<00:04:28.199> start<00:04:28.380> filling<00:04:28.590> up<00:04:28.710> the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
one so it's gonna start filling up the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.320 
one so it's gonna start filling up the
tanks<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.280> then<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.550> say<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:29.940> run<00:04:30.120> out<00:04:30.300> of

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
tanks and then that say you run out of

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330 
tanks and then that say you run out of
lava<00:04:30.600> up<00:04:30.840> here<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.500> will<00:04:31.740> run<00:04:31.919> out<00:04:31.949> of<00:04:32.100> lava

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
lava up here you will run out of lava

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.920 
lava up here you will run out of lava
because<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.729> takes<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.030> lava<00:04:33.240> you'll<00:04:33.750> have

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
because it takes to lava you'll have

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.230 
because it takes to lava you'll have
that<00:04:34.139> last<00:04:34.440> little<00:04:34.830> bit<00:04:35.160> to<00:04:35.550> like<00:04:35.729> find<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.090> new

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
that last little bit to like find a new

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.409 
that last little bit to like find a new
source<00:04:36.449> so<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.840> give<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.050> time<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.940> now<00:04:39.120> what

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
source so it give you time so now what

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.900 
source so it give you time so now what
you<00:04:39.540> want<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:39.750> do<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:40.110> at<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.949> very<00:04:41.280> end<00:04:41.400> of

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
you want to do is at the very end of

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.310 
you want to do is at the very end of
your<00:04:42.030> cobble<00:04:42.449> stone<00:04:42.600> wherever<00:04:42.780> you<00:04:42.990> have<00:04:43.139> at

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
your cobble stone wherever you have at

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.870 
your cobble stone wherever you have at
your<00:04:43.350> house<00:04:43.620> or<00:04:43.830> whatever<00:04:43.949> you're<00:04:44.460> gonna<00:04:44.580> set

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.390 
your house or whatever you're gonna set
down<00:04:44.970> your<00:04:45.030> geothermal<00:04:45.840> generator<00:04:46.190> see<00:04:47.190> and

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
down your geothermal generator see and

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.400 
down your geothermal generator see and
then<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.000> lava<00:04:48.180> will<00:04:48.479> fill<00:04:48.690> up<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.139> then

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
then the lava will fill up and then

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.950 
then the lava will fill up and then
you're<00:04:50.250> gonna<00:04:50.340> run<00:04:50.699> your<00:04:51.180> glass<00:04:51.479> fiber<00:04:52.440> cable

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
you're gonna run your glass fiber cable

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.129 
you're gonna run your glass fiber cable
right<00:04:54.960> out<00:04:56.720> into<00:04:57.720> whatever<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:58.889> need<00:05:00.139> for

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
right out into whatever you need for

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.240 
right out into whatever you need for
electricity<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:02.580> that's<00:05:03.030> gonna<00:05:03.210> be<00:05:03.330> our

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
electricity so that's gonna be our

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.240 
electricity so that's gonna be our
electric<00:05:05.250> furnace<00:05:05.669> so<00:05:06.630> now<00:05:06.919> as<00:05:07.919> you<00:05:07.979> can<00:05:08.190> see

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
electric furnace so now as you can see

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.890 
electric furnace so now as you can see
this<00:05:08.789> doesn't<00:05:09.060> have<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.300> be<00:05:09.360> your<00:05:09.539> setup<00:05:09.780> I'm

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
this doesn't have to be your setup I'm

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.120 
this doesn't have to be your setup I'm
just<00:05:10.080> setting<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.320> up<00:05:10.380> like<00:05:10.470> this<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.889> show<00:05:11.070> you

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.339 
to go into any type of thing that uses
electricity<00:05:38.370> like<00:05:38.820> electric<00:05:39.300> furnace<00:05:39.900> and

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
electricity like electric furnace and

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:41.240 
electricity like electric furnace and
the<00:05:40.650> macerator

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
the macerator

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.730 
the macerator
so<00:05:42.000> now<00:05:42.150> what<00:05:42.300> we're<00:05:42.389> gonna<00:05:42.450> do<00:05:42.720> is<00:05:43.620> we're

and then we're gonna fill it up you can
put<00:05:53.830> four<00:05:54.460> stocks<00:05:54.880> in<00:05:55.150> there<00:05:55.270> doesn't<00:05:55.540> matter

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
put four stocks in there doesn't matter

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.950

let's<00:06:12.400> go<00:06:12.610> get<00:06:12.820> our<00:06:12.910> redstone<00:06:13.480> torch<00:06:14.760> and

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
let's go get our redstone torch and

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.730 
let's go get our redstone torch and
you're<00:06:16.270> gonna<00:06:16.360> put<00:06:16.630> this<00:06:16.750> on<00:06:16.990> both<00:06:17.170> sides<00:06:17.230> so

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
you're gonna put this on both sides so

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.150 
you're gonna put this on both sides so
there<00:06:17.980> and<00:06:18.850> then<00:06:19.720> there<00:06:19.960> and<00:06:20.140> you'll<00:06:20.560> see<00:06:20.590> they

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
there and then there and you'll see they

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.730 
there and then there and you'll see they
start<00:06:21.490> going<00:06:21.700> and<00:06:22.090> now<00:06:22.960> what<00:06:23.530> you're<00:06:23.590> gonna

start going and now what you're gonna

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.870 
start going and now what you're gonna
see<00:06:24.040> now<00:06:24.070> is<00:06:24.640> actually<00:06:25.570> let's<00:06:26.080> break<00:06:26.380> this<00:06:26.880> so

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
see now is actually let's break this so

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.560 
see now is actually let's break this so
we<00:06:28.150> can<00:06:28.330> actually<00:06:28.570> see<00:06:29.880> see<00:06:30.880> now<00:06:30.910> you<00:06:31.120> see<00:06:31.360> that

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
we can actually see see now you see that

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.530 
we can actually see see now you see that
is<00:06:32.200> the<00:06:32.470> straw<00:06:33.160> thing<00:06:33.520> that<00:06:33.700> goes<00:06:33.940> down<00:06:34.180> below

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
is the straw thing that goes down below

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.390 
is the straw thing that goes down below
the<00:06:34.870> pump<00:06:35.110> and<00:06:35.380> it'll<00:06:35.800> start<00:06:35.950> sucking<00:06:36.280> up<00:06:36.370> the

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
the pump and it'll start sucking up the

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.510 
the pump and it'll start sucking up the
lava<00:06:36.670> see<00:06:36.940> right<00:06:37.180> here<00:06:37.390> so<00:06:38.350> it'll<00:06:38.860> start<00:06:39.040> going

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
lava see right here so it'll start going

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.690 
lava see right here so it'll start going
down<00:06:40.260> all<00:06:41.260> the<00:06:41.290> way<00:06:41.740> down<00:06:41.980> and<00:06:42.220> it'll<00:06:42.400> fill<00:06:42.580> up

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
down all the way down and it'll fill up

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.300 
down all the way down and it'll fill up
that<00:06:42.730> tank<00:06:43.180> so<00:06:43.960> uh<00:06:43.990> I'll<00:06:44.530> come<00:06:44.740> back<00:06:44.920> once<00:06:45.190> the

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
that tank so uh I'll come back once the

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.580 
that tank so uh I'll come back once the
tank<00:06:45.520> is<00:06:45.610> filled<00:06:45.850> up<00:06:46.000> okay<00:06:46.900> we're<00:06:47.080> back<00:06:47.320> and

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
tank is filled up okay we're back and

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.680 
tank is filled up okay we're back and
the<00:06:47.650> tank<00:06:47.950> is<00:06:48.070> heavily<00:06:48.430> filled<00:06:48.790> up<00:06:48.940> and<00:06:49.150> as<00:06:49.480> you

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
the tank is heavily filled up and as you

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.860 
the tank is heavily filled up and as you
can<00:06:49.870> see<00:06:49.930> the<00:06:50.650> lava<00:06:50.830> has<00:06:51.160> come<00:06:51.460> down<00:06:51.730> um<00:06:52.360> this

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
can see the lava has come down um this

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.990 
can see the lava has come down um this
volcano<00:06:53.260> doesn't<00:06:53.920> isn't<00:06:54.310> gonna<00:06:54.400> last<00:06:54.580> long<00:06:54.850> I

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
volcano doesn't isn't gonna last long I

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.370 
volcano doesn't isn't gonna last long I
knew<00:06:55.180> it<00:06:55.330> because<00:06:55.480> I<00:06:55.690> didn't<00:06:55.990> put<00:06:56.080> that<00:06:56.230> much

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
knew it because I didn't put that much

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.760 
knew it because I didn't put that much
love<00:06:56.620> in<00:06:56.770> there<00:06:56.980> it's<00:06:57.160> just<00:06:57.370> on<00:06:57.520> the<00:06:57.640> top<00:06:57.880> so

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
love in there it's just on the top so

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.830 
love in there it's just on the top so
then<00:06:59.770> we<00:07:00.400> pumped<00:07:00.760> it<00:07:00.850> out<00:07:00.970> and<00:07:01.240> plus<00:07:01.570> it's

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 
then we pumped it out and plus it's

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.600 
then we pumped it out and plus it's
probably<00:07:02.170> getting<00:07:02.350> low<00:07:02.470> on<00:07:02.620> coal<00:07:02.830> but<00:07:03.340> it

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
probably getting low on coal but it

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.130 
probably getting low on coal but it
pumped<00:07:04.150> it<00:07:04.240> out<00:07:04.330> it<00:07:04.540> came<00:07:04.720> all<00:07:04.900> the<00:07:05.020> way<00:07:05.050> down

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.140 
pumped it out it came all the way down

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.020 
pumped it out it came all the way down
into<00:07:05.590> the<00:07:05.800> tank<00:07:06.040> the<00:07:06.190> tanks<00:07:06.490> halfway<00:07:06.820> filled

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
into the tank the tanks halfway filled

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.330 
into the tank the tanks halfway filled
up<00:07:07.210> and<00:07:07.450> the<00:07:07.870> rest<00:07:08.080> came<00:07:08.290> all<00:07:08.530> the<00:07:08.650> way<00:07:08.680> in<00:07:08.920> to

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
up and the rest came all the way in to

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.760 
up and the rest came all the way in to
the<00:07:09.430> geothermal<00:07:09.670> generator<00:07:10.030> and<00:07:10.660> right<00:07:11.320> here

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
the geothermal generator and right here

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.010 
the geothermal generator and right here
right<00:07:11.950> here<00:07:12.520> is<00:07:12.580> where<00:07:12.760> you<00:07:12.850> see<00:07:13.060> the<00:07:13.300> lava<00:07:13.720> is

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
right here is where you see the lava is

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.600 
right here is where you see the lava is
actually<00:07:14.560> powering<00:07:15.100> the<00:07:15.220> geothermal

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.610 
actually powering the geothermal

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.630 
actually powering the geothermal
generator<00:07:15.820> and<00:07:16.560> it<00:07:17.560> is<00:07:17.710> going<00:07:18.160> into<00:07:18.430> the

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.640 
generator and it is going into the

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.920 
generator and it is going into the
electric<00:07:19.030> furnace<00:07:19.210> actually<00:07:19.660> good<00:07:19.750> to<00:07:19.810> see

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930 
electric furnace actually good to see

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.860 
electric furnace actually good to see
the<00:07:20.050> electric<00:07:20.410> furnace<00:07:20.920> is<00:07:21.130> now<00:07:21.510> powered<00:07:22.510> so

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
the electric furnace is now powered so

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.830 
the electric furnace is now powered so
you<00:07:23.440> can<00:07:23.650> make<00:07:23.890> like<00:07:24.190> in<00:07:24.460> this<00:07:25.180> you<00:07:25.420> can<00:07:25.630> make

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
you can make like in this you can make

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.420 
you can make like in this you can make
you<00:07:25.990> could<00:07:26.140> put<00:07:26.230> overclockers<00:07:26.920> and<00:07:27.130> here<00:07:27.340> if

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.430 
you could put overclockers and here if

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.720 
you could put overclockers and here if
you<00:07:27.580> want<00:07:27.850> to<00:07:28.090> make<00:07:29.050> it<00:07:29.170> go<00:07:29.260> a<00:07:29.290> lot<00:07:29.560> faster<00:07:29.830> so

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:30.730 
you want to make it go a lot faster so

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.760 
you want to make it go a lot faster so
now<00:07:30.880> you<00:07:30.940> can<00:07:31.150> put<00:07:31.300> like<00:07:31.420> iron<00:07:32.020> ingots<00:07:32.410> in<00:07:32.590> here

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:32.770 
now you can put like iron ingots in here
