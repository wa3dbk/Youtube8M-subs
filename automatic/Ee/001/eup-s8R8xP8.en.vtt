hey<00:00:00.240> this<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.570> Sam<00:00:00.690> from<00:00:00.840> Kappa<00:00:01.110> in<00:00:01.350> this<00:00:01.439> video

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hey this is Sam from Kappa in this video

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.260 
hey this is Sam from Kappa in this video
I<00:00:01.740> wanted<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.010> do<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.129> quick<00:00:02.490> overview<00:00:02.669> of<00:00:03.120> some

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
I wanted to do a quick overview of some

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.380 
I wanted to do a quick overview of some
3d<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.290> how<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.069> take<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.339> case<00:00:05.640> from<00:00:05.879> start<00:00:06.270> to

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
3d and how to take a case from start to

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.110 
3d and how to take a case from start to
finish<00:00:07.370> first<00:00:08.370> you'll<00:00:08.580> see<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.030> the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
finish first you'll see this is the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.390 
finish first you'll see this is the
program<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.780> up<00:00:10.230> at<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.410> top<00:00:10.620> left<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:11.160> bar

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
program and up at the top left this bar

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.910 
program and up at the top left this bar
right<00:00:11.639> here<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:12.150> how<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.389> take<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> case<00:00:13.349> from

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
right here is how you take a case from

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.770 
right here is how you take a case from
start<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.400> finish<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:14.940> I'll<00:00:15.389> hit<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.599> first

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
start to finish so I'll hit the first

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.060 
start to finish so I'll hit the first
button<00:00:16.049> here<00:00:16.350> which<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> little<00:00:16.890> piece<00:00:17.039> of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
button here which is a little piece of

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.010 
button here which is a little piece of
paper<00:00:17.300> and<00:00:18.300> we're<00:00:18.449> just<00:00:18.539> going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.779> create<00:00:18.960> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
paper and we're just going to create a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.510 
paper and we're just going to create a
new<00:00:19.199> job<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.740> all<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.279> here<00:00:20.460> is

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
new job and all you have to do here is

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.800 
new job and all you have to do here is
select<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.910> material<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.420> I'm<00:00:21.480> going<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.660> click

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
select a material so I'm going to click

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.470 
select a material so I'm going to click
on<00:00:21.930> zirconia<00:00:22.789> and<00:00:23.789> from<00:00:24.029> there<00:00:24.210> we're<00:00:24.390> going

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
on zirconia and from there we're going

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.620 
on zirconia and from there we're going
to<00:00:24.600> bring<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.230> our<00:00:25.350> stls<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:27.300> I'm<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.510> going

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
to bring in our stls so I'm just going

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
to bring in our stls so I'm just going
to<00:00:27.720> locate<00:00:27.990> my<00:00:28.170> STL's<00:00:29.689> select<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.900> couple<00:00:31.590> of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
to locate my STL's select a couple of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.310 
to locate my STL's select a couple of
them<00:00:31.830> or<00:00:32.009> three<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.369> them<00:00:32.489> here<00:00:32.960> just<00:00:33.960> select

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
them or three of them here just select

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.840 
them or three of them here just select
the<00:00:34.469> object<00:00:34.500> type<00:00:35.540> and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:36.660> click<00:00:36.690> open<00:00:37.230> and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
the object type and then click open and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.729 
the object type and then click open and
then<00:00:38.850> from<00:00:39.059> there<00:00:39.239> it'll<00:00:39.540> open<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:40.079> this

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
then from there it'll open up this

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.190 
then from there it'll open up this
usually<00:00:41.129> takes<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.399> couple<00:00:41.520> seconds<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.450> STL's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
usually takes a couple seconds the STL's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.930 
usually takes a couple seconds the STL's
and<00:00:43.760> we<00:00:44.760> are<00:00:44.969> ready<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> go<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.050> from<00:00:46.379> there

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
and we are ready to go and from there

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.750 
and we are ready to go and from there
it'll<00:00:47.940> tell<00:00:48.270> us<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> minimum<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it'll tell us the the minimum or the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
it'll tell us the the minimum or the
maximum<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.539> fight<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.230> an<00:00:52.350> idea<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
maximum to fight so we get an idea of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.979 
maximum to fight so we get an idea of
what<00:00:52.980> block<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.270> material<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.750> want<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
what block or what material we want to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.650 
what block or what material we want to
be<00:00:55.079> using<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:56.969> want<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> import<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
be using and then we want to import the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.740 
be using and then we want to import the
job's<00:00:57.870> archive<00:00:58.320> or<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.030> milling<00:01:00.030> strategy<00:01:00.449> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
job's archive or the milling strategy so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.410 
job's archive or the milling strategy so
I'm<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.079> selecting<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.859> type<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.520> job<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.359> is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I'm just selecting the type of job it is

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.200 
I'm just selecting the type of job it is
is<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.840> Konya<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> crown<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.119> then

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
is or Konya and then a crown and then

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.550 
is or Konya and then a crown and then
I'm<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.510> select<00:01:06.659> my<00:01:06.869> milling<00:01:07.229> strategy

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
I'm going to select my milling strategy

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.719 
I'm going to select my milling strategy
and<00:01:07.650> you'll<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.220> standard

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and you'll see there's standard

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.160 
and you'll see there's standard
anatomical<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.630> then<00:01:09.780> standard

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
anatomical and then standard

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.710 
anatomical and then standard
substructure<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.610> pretty<00:01:11.790> much<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.510> we

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
substructure and this pretty much all we

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
substructure and this pretty much all we
use<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.170> only<00:01:13.350> time<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.650> use<00:01:13.799> high<00:01:13.920> quality<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
use the only time we use high quality is

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.480 
use the only time we use high quality is
for<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:14.970> complicated<00:01:15.299> bridges<00:01:16.490> you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
for a really complicated bridges you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.100 
for a really complicated bridges you
notice<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> top<00:01:18.270> left<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.750> have

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
notice here in the top left now we have

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.179 
notice here in the top left now we have
our<00:01:19.259> our<00:01:19.470> steps<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.640> our<00:01:20.729> process<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.420> milling

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
our our steps in our process for milling

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
our our steps in our process for milling
and<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.850> also<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> check

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and I also you know you want to check

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.630 
and I also you know you want to check
over<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.350> margins<00:01:25.740> make<00:01:26.009> sure<00:01:26.189> everything

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
over the margins make sure everything

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.490 
over the margins make sure everything
came<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.330> correctly<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> way

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
came in all correctly and there is a way

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.679 
came in all correctly and there is a way
to<00:01:28.560> fix<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.790> did<00:01:29.939> incorrectly<00:01:30.509> come

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
to fix that if it did incorrectly come

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.810 
to fix that if it did incorrectly come
in<00:01:30.810> which<00:01:30.930> doesn't<00:01:31.259> happen<00:01:31.380> all<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.560> often

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
in which doesn't happen all that often

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.200 
in which doesn't happen all that often
now<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> selected<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.579> import<00:01:35.579> block<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
now I selected the import block and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
now I selected the import block and
you'll<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.110> our<00:01:37.290> use<00:01:37.590> block<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.100> if

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you'll see we have our use block so if

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.679 
you'll see we have our use block so if
we<00:01:38.280> had<00:01:38.430> something<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.759> we've<00:01:38.970> previously

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
we had something that we've previously

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.080 
we had something that we've previously
used<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.100> want<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.610> bring<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.820> into<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
used and we want to bring it into the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
used and we want to bring it into the
block<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.100> I'm<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.220> going

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
block you can do that but I'm just going

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.929 
block you can do that but I'm just going
to<00:01:44.490> create<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.970> new<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
to create a new one and so you can you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.550 
to create a new one and so you can you
can<00:01:48.119> change<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.630> reduction<00:01:49.049> coefficient

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
can change the reduction coefficient

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.550 
can change the reduction coefficient
which<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.979> different<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.869> differs<00:01:52.350> from

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
which is different and it differs from

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920 
which is different and it differs from
zirconia<00:01:53.310> block<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.909> zirconia<00:01:54.360> block<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
zirconia block to zirconia block and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.050 
zirconia block to zirconia block and
then<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.649> also<00:01:56.009> set<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> height<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.530> then

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
then you also set the height and then

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.190 
then you also set the height and then
after<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.149> select<00:02:00.479> these<00:02:00.689> two<00:02:00.960> parameters

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
after you select these two parameters

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080 
after you select these two parameters
you<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> stock<00:02:02.189> code<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.820> kind<00:02:03.030> of

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
you do a stock code and this is kind of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.569 
you do a stock code and this is kind of
up<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:04.110> whether<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.070> how<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.310> want

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
up to you whether you know how you want

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.429 
up to you whether you know how you want
to<00:02:05.670> keep<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.930> know<00:02:07.049> your<00:02:07.259> organization

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
to keep you know your organization

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.830 
to keep you know your organization
usually<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.550> do<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.759> know<00:02:08.879> cap<00:02:09.119> FC<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.629> cap

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
usually we do you know cap FC your cap

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.080 
usually we do you know cap FC your cap
qz<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:10.709> I

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
qz and then I

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.020 
qz and then I
dennah<00:02:11.209> fire<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.050> DFG<00:02:12.819> so<00:02:13.819> I'm<00:02:13.879> just

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
dennah fire so this is DFG so I'm just

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.259 
dennah fire so this is DFG so I'm just
gonna<00:02:14.120> hit<00:02:14.330> okay<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:16.190> will<00:02:16.430> load<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.030> block

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
gonna hit okay it will load in the block

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.699 
gonna hit okay it will load in the block
and<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.599> notice<00:02:18.019> it<00:02:18.140> says<00:02:18.319> it's<00:02:18.590> gonna

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
and you notice it says it's gonna

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.070 
and you notice it says it's gonna
automatically<00:02:19.489> incline<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.450> objects<00:02:20.840> to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
automatically incline the objects to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.170 
automatically incline the objects to
reduce<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.830> used<00:02:22.220> space<00:02:22.640> which<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.150> course

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
reduce the used space which of course

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.320 
reduce the used space which of course
they<00:02:23.510> want<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.720> hit<00:02:23.870> yes<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:25.760> positions

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
they want to hit yes and it positions

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.759 
they want to hit yes and it positions
them<00:02:26.510> slightly<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.050> it'll<00:02:27.290> automatically

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
them slightly and it'll automatically

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.190 
them slightly and it'll automatically
position<00:02:28.280> items<00:02:28.549> in<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.819> blank<00:02:29.030> as<00:02:29.180> well<00:02:29.360> you

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200

click<00:03:28.010> where<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.400> want<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.730> spruce<00:03:29.030> we

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
click where you want the spruce we

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.120 
click where you want the spruce we
usually<00:03:30.019> like<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.319> them<00:03:30.410> on<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.590> corners<00:03:30.950> and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
usually like it them on the corners and

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.440 
usually like it them on the corners and
let's<00:03:31.190> say<00:03:31.549> we<00:03:31.670> want<00:03:31.819> to<00:03:31.849> change<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.239> type<00:03:32.420> of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
let's say we want to change the type of

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.449 
let's say we want to change the type of
room<00:03:32.840> we<00:03:33.500> hit<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.709> little<00:03:33.799> scissor<00:03:34.099> button

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
room we hit the little scissor button

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.879 
room we hit the little scissor button
there<00:03:34.639> we<00:03:35.389> select<00:03:35.690> what<00:03:35.930> we<00:03:36.109> want<00:03:36.319> to<00:03:36.440> change

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
there we select what we want to change

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.199 
there we select what we want to change
what's<00:03:37.400> brew<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.690> there's<00:03:39.970> there's<00:03:40.970> three

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
what's brew and so there's there's three

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.750 
what's brew and so there's there's three
types<00:03:41.389> there's<00:03:41.660> not<00:03:41.930> cuttable<00:03:42.760> completely

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
types there's not cuttable completely

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.190 
types there's not cuttable completely
cuttable<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.419> then<00:03:44.599> just<00:03:44.810> partially

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
cuttable and then just partially

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.500 
cuttable and then just partially
countable<00:03:45.530> red<00:03:45.859> is<00:03:45.980> partially<00:03:46.579> green<00:03:47.269> is

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
countable red is partially green is

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.970 
countable red is partially green is
completely<00:03:48.049> credible<00:03:48.169> so<00:03:48.530> what<00:03:48.650> that<00:03:48.799> means

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
completely credible so what that means

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.920 
completely credible so what that means
at<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.250> end<00:03:49.280> of<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.549> job<00:03:49.760> it'll<00:03:50.000> completely

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
at the end of the job it'll completely

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.300 
at the end of the job it'll completely
remove<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.349> spruce<00:03:51.680> so<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:51.950> don't<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.220> do

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
remove that spruce so you don't the do

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.190 
remove that spruce so you don't the do
it<00:03:52.459> later<00:03:52.639> so<00:03:54.099> we're<00:03:55.099> looking<00:03:55.370> good<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:57.019> then

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
it later so we're looking good and then

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.680 
it later so we're looking good and then
from<00:03:57.470> there<00:03:57.709> if<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.730> are<00:03:58.970> happy<00:03:59.239> with<00:03:59.510> its

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
from there if you are happy with its

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.440 
from there if you are happy with its
location<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:01.190> it's<00:04:01.370> spewing<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.090> everything

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
location and it's spewing and everything

location and it's spewing and everything
else<00:04:02.599> you<00:04:02.870> can<00:04:02.900> just<00:04:03.200> hit<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.500> final<00:04:03.799> button

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
else you can just hit the final button

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.920 
else you can just hit the final button
which<00:04:04.250> is<00:04:04.280> execute<00:04:04.940> milling<00:04:05.209> you<00:04:05.630> see<00:04:05.840> it

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
which is execute milling you see it

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.270 
which is execute milling you see it
automatically<00:04:06.349> saves<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.739> file<00:04:06.919> and<00:04:07.130> we're

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
automatically saves the file and we're

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.890 
automatically saves the file and we're
just<00:04:07.340> gonna<00:04:07.459> send<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.940> job<00:04:08.209> directly<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.810> the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
just gonna send the job directly to the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.479 
just gonna send the job directly to the
Machine<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.260> it<00:04:09.440> will<00:04:09.530> begun<00:04:09.769> begun<00:04:10.130> knowing

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
Machine and it will begun begun knowing

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.520 
Machine and it will begun begun knowing
and<00:04:10.760> after<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.540> calculates<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.049> job<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.410> can

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
and after it calculates the job you can

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.099 
and after it calculates the job you can
actually<00:04:12.829> also<00:04:13.010> do<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.340> virtual<00:04:13.940> mill<00:04:14.389> so<00:04:14.930> say

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
actually also do a virtual mill so say

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.199 
actually also do a virtual mill so say
if<00:04:15.230> you<00:04:15.349> just<00:04:15.560> want<00:04:15.769> to<00:04:15.859> wait<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.669> send<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:16.970> job

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
if you just want to wait to send the job

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.120 
if you just want to wait to send the job
and<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:17.660> virtually<00:04:18.169> know<00:04:18.320> it<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.560> check<00:04:18.799> make

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
and and virtually know it to check make

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.759 
and and virtually know it to check make
sure<00:04:19.159> it<00:04:19.459> looks<00:04:19.609> good

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
sure it looks good

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.320 
sure it looks good
and<00:04:21.100> we<00:04:21.250> do<00:04:21.459> this<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:21.669> lot<00:04:21.760> of<00:04:21.880> times<00:04:22.120> with

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
and we do this a lot of times with

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.870 
and we do this a lot of times with
complicated<00:04:23.229> cases<00:04:23.440> such<00:04:23.740> as<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:24.130> know<00:04:24.220> fiber

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
complicated cases such as you know fiber

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.800 
complicated cases such as you know fiber
our<00:04:25.360> plus<00:04:26.320> unit<00:04:26.710> bridges<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.660> know<00:04:28.750> you

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
our plus unit bridges and you know you

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.200 
our plus unit bridges and you know you
can<00:04:29.020> speed<00:04:29.260> up<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.500> process<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.639> colors

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
can speed up the process and the colors

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.600 
can speed up the process and the colors
indicate<00:04:31.419> the<00:04:31.780> different<00:04:32.080> steps<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.340> see

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
indicate the different steps so you see

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.520 
indicate the different steps so you see
here<00:04:33.850> we<00:04:34.000> have<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.540> darker<00:04:34.960> blue<00:04:35.199> for<00:04:35.440> the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
here we have a darker blue for the

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.260 
here we have a darker blue for the
internal<00:04:35.919> roughing<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:37.510> what<00:04:38.290> have<00:04:38.470> you<00:04:39.270> and

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
internal roughing and what have you and

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.330 
internal roughing and what have you and
so<00:04:40.960> that's<00:04:41.139> pretty<00:04:41.500> much<00:04:41.680> it<00:04:41.919> this<00:04:42.190> is<00:04:42.310> just

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
so that's pretty much it this is just

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.770 
so that's pretty much it this is just
been<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.669> quick<00:04:43.350> overview<00:04:44.350> of<00:04:44.590> some<00:04:45.580> 3d<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.240> how

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
been a quick overview of some 3d and how

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.590 
been a quick overview of some 3d and how
you<00:04:46.840> would<00:04:47.080> take<00:04:47.260> a<00:04:47.290> case<00:04:47.590> or<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.370> files<00:04:48.910> from

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
you would take a case or a files from

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.570 
you would take a case or a files from
start<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:49.960> finish<00:04:49.990> I<00:04:50.410> hope<00:04:51.010> you<00:04:51.160> enjoyed<00:04:51.430> it

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
start to finish I hope you enjoyed it

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.150 
start to finish I hope you enjoyed it
