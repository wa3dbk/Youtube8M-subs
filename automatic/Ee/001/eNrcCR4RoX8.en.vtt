00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.650
 Welcome to another lecture on 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.670
 monday regarding technology projects 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.069
 transistor ignition 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.389
 it's about an emergency generator 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.190
 Rebuild a four-stroke and here have 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.330
 I now tried a bright man 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.789
 kai k 2 543 transistor ignition you have 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.350
 built construction period about half 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.060
 hour and more tried if the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.949
 Ignition works well when you get it 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.689
 not with a breaker contacts 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.700
 used but with a hall sensor 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.110
 the tl 49 05 and that's why I have here 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.329
 made in the construction 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.210
 one can recognize us in front but the one 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.100
 spark plug then I have the hall here 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.489
 sensor on the right side with the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.250
 connections and the small magnets of the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.420
 the hall sensor triggers that is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.030
 done right here 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.890
 So I just stuck to it 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.239
 then go back and forth the hall 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.160
 sensor is triggered 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.199
 that would be comparable if it were now 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.660
 Axle of the emergency generator who the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.729
 and rotates based on each revolution 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.299
 impulse behind the circuit is like 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.320
 said construction was relatively easy and 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.350
 Now let's try it out 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.570
 works shut here now 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.800
 plus to the battery and then test 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.150
 we do it all 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.150
 this is a little bit the right one 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:43.760
 So you hear the ignition ignites 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:46.970
 very good with the hall sensor and the 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.530
 Ignition spark is also pretty strong me 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.750
 now try the camera down 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.300
 take and recognize something exactly 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.280
 It does not even make it from the back 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.390
 you can see the ignition coil and the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.070
 Battery and try now closer 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.070
 approach to go I have that is 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.980
 So in my opinion that is 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.030
 transistor ignition well suited here around 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.620
 to rebuild the emergency generator and mine 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.220
 home-made ignition is still closed here 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.140
 recognize 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.080
 I've been on the internet page 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.030
 only the effort is essential 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.040
 bigger than when you say in the finished 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.900
 kit so in my opinion 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.020
 it was also legal again 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.480
 install and try out the sparkle 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.140
 is working very well who so 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.760
 to use for the grill party or 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.760
 Have a nice evening and see you soon
