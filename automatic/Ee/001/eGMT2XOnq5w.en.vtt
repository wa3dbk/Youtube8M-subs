mode with networking you normally see
this<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> normal<00:00:57.690> procedure<00:00:58.020> it's

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
this this is all a normal procedure it's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.709 
this this is all a normal procedure it's
bringing<00:00:59.250> me<00:00:59.430> into<00:00:59.820> safe<00:01:00.420> mode<00:01:00.690> with

bringing me into safe mode with

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.349 
bringing me into safe mode with
networking<00:01:01.010> now<00:01:02.010> why<00:01:02.309> do<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.699> want<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.059> go<00:01:03.180> into

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
networking now why do we want to go into

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.690 
networking now why do we want to go into
safe<00:01:03.719> mode<00:01:03.750> well<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> reason<00:01:04.890> why<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.339> because

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
safe mode well the reason why is because

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.870 
safe mode well the reason why is because
it's<00:01:06.000> kind<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.950> way<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:07.979> turn<00:01:08.369> off<00:01:08.549> all

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it's kind of like a way to turn off all

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
it's kind of like a way to turn off all
the<00:01:09.180> extra<00:01:09.510> stuff<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:10.140> makes<00:01:10.380> Windows<00:01:10.770> do

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the extra stuff that makes Windows do

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770 
the extra stuff that makes Windows do
all<00:01:11.280> these<00:01:11.520> wild<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.000> wonderful<00:01:12.090> things<00:01:12.570> as

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
all these wild and wonderful things as

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.109 
all these wild and wonderful things as
well<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.619> all<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.130> extra<00:01:14.400> little<00:01:14.549> programs

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
well as all the extra little programs

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.890 
well as all the extra little programs
that<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.479> loading<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.100> also<00:01:17.100> turns<00:01:17.790> off<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.330> lot

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that are loading it also turns off a lot

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.560 
that are loading it also turns off a lot
of<00:01:19.110> devices<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:19.950> computer<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:21.090> instead

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
of devices on your computer so instead

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
of devices on your computer so instead
of<00:01:21.659> having<00:01:21.840> your<00:01:22.110> full<00:01:22.470> video<00:01:22.770> card<00:01:23.070> driver

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
of having your full video card driver

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460 
of having your full video card driver
the<00:01:24.090> software<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.659> makes<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> video<00:01:25.200> card

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the software that makes the video card

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.800 
the software that makes the video card
work<00:01:25.650> you're<00:01:26.100> getting<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.580> scaled-back<00:01:27.119> simple

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
work you're getting a scaled-back simple

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.630 
work you're getting a scaled-back simple
version<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.890> allows<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> see

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
version that just allows you to see

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.359 
version that just allows you to see
video<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.869> does<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.770> turns<00:01:32.100> off

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
video so what this does is it turns off

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.789 
video so what this does is it turns off
extra<00:01:32.970> startup<00:01:33.360> items<00:01:33.750> from<00:01:33.900> loading<00:01:34.320> both

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
extra startup items from loading both

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590 
extra startup items from loading both
windows<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.579> third-party<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.360> other

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
windows and third-party like other

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
windows and third-party like other
companies<00:01:37.220> programs<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> load

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
companies programs that load

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
companies programs that load
automatically<00:01:39.259> startup<00:01:40.259> programs<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
automatically startup programs and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.120 
automatically startup programs and
services<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:42.450> also<00:01:42.750> does<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.259> initialize

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
services and it also does not initialize

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.520 
services and it also does not initialize
or<00:01:44.340> startup<00:01:44.790> most<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.630> devices<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
or startup most of your devices in the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
or startup most of your devices in the
normal<00:01:46.890> way<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.729> puts<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.090> basic

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
normal way it just puts on basic

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.080 
normal way it just puts on basic
software<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.229> get<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.500> video<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.159> my<00:01:50.790> case

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
software to get your video up in my case

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.050 
software to get your video up in my case
I<00:01:51.270> chose<00:01:51.299> safer<00:01:52.110> safe<00:01:52.619> mode<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:52.829> networking

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
I chose safer safe mode with networking

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.580 
I chose safer safe mode with networking
so<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.119> gets<00:01:54.299> my<00:01:54.479> networking<00:01:54.899> component<00:01:55.439> set

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
so it gets my networking component set

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.399 
so it gets my networking component set
up<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:57.030> allows<00:01:57.299> me<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.540> use<00:01:57.630> my<00:01:57.780> hard<00:01:58.170> drive

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
up and it allows me to use my hard drive

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.459 
up and it allows me to use my hard drive
and<00:01:58.619> access<00:01:59.250> files<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.810> know<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.079> DVD

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and access files on the you know the DVD

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.190 
and access files on the you know the DVD
or<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> CD<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.180> your<00:02:03.479> computer<00:02:03.899> will<00:02:04.049> not

boot<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.680> recommend<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.460> try<00:02:05.640> safe<00:02:06.000> mode<00:02:06.210> with

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.410 
boot I recommend you try safe mode with

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
cool thing about safe mode is it comes

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.309 
cool thing about safe mode is it comes
up<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.330> asks<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.720> if<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.870> want<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> do

I'm aware of is simply accounting I did
System<00:02:46.980> Restore<00:02:47.130> was<00:02:47.430> simply<00:02:47.760> accounting<00:02:48.209> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
System Restore was simply accounting a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.560 
System Restore was simply accounting a
long<00:02:49.020> time<00:02:49.230> ago<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:50.610> kind<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.330> brought

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
long time ago and it kind of brought

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.110 
long time ago and it kind of brought
simply<00:02:52.170> accounting<00:02:52.560> back<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.190> date<00:02:53.550> just

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
simply accounting back to that date just

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.150 
simply accounting back to that date just
by<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.690> way<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.050> software<00:02:55.530> was<00:02:55.650> designed<00:02:55.860> at

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
by the way the software was designed at

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.949 
by the way the software was designed at
the<00:02:56.190> time<00:02:56.459> I'm<00:02:56.940> not<00:02:57.120> sure<00:02:57.269> if<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.420> occurs<00:02:57.780> on

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
the time I'm not sure if that occurs on

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.870 
the time I'm not sure if that occurs on
all<00:02:58.170> versions<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.680> simply<00:02:59.010> accounting<00:02:59.370> but

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
all versions of simply accounting but

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.640 
all versions of simply accounting but
that<00:03:00.060> happened<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.480> me<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.260> do<00:03:01.440> have

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
that happened to me so if you do have

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.800 
that happened to me so if you do have
simply<00:03:02.040> accounting<00:03:02.489> make<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.940> full<00:03:03.269> backup<00:03:03.480> of
