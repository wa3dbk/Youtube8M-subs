00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.320
 boteach brazil today the credit still distant maurice to huge 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.339
 which, moreover, includes 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:15.329
 yes in your the dry ones trechinho says as you must have noticed and several others 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:20.039
 Known songs from here, we'll be back in Brazil with more 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.039
 maurice even bigger 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.480
 the harp player has the sharp notes on the left side and therefore presses the button 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.399
 on the left side 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.480
 right hand with right hand 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.570
 and bass notes he hung fishing 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.300
 I said that he had the abuda grades studied right and the label's 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.480
 skeleton 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.070
 but you must have noticed that Maurice the norm does the opposite 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.130
 it has the notes abuda senate acp and the bass distilled 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.890
 this leads us to conclude that, as incredible as it may seem, Mauricio is 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.900
 normal although he is a musician playing the instrument of little 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.840
 is a neighborhood that is dry and other 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.390
 that's right the maurice is huge is with one neighborhood highlights in another 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.360
 and that's what you're going to keep fighting 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.400
 Today Brazil is today. 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400
 back with more Mauricio now 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.430
 the workouts too 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.910
 that's why 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.910
 ready 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.440
 dipp 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.440
 we are very close 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280
 everything was done within the expected 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
 the first numbers of the last weeks of life 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.620
 let's suddenly go the other results 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.539
 all 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.539
 every year 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.499
 I'm not afraid 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.889
 bruno 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.119

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.599

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.559
 technician 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.059
 fighting 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.739
 since June 2008 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.509
 he denies 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.900
 no one neither me 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.090
