00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.400 
know like lighter hair is like different
from<00:02:17.380> when<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.740> get<00:02:17.980> like<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.930> darker<00:02:19.930> version

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
from when you get like a darker version

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.350 
from when you get like a darker version
of<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.070> same<00:02:21.310> hair<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:22.090> gonna<00:02:22.270> be

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
of the same hair it's just gonna be

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.980 
of the same hair it's just gonna be
different

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.710 
different
I<00:02:23.020> guess<00:02:23.920> due<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.340> processing<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.360> out<00:02:25.480> there

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720
