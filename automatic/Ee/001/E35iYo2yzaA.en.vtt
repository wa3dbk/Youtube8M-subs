00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
around I wanted to show you the new fuel

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.990 
around I wanted to show you the new fuel
cell<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.040> similar<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.670> other<00:00:11.700> one

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
cell this is similar to the other one

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.629 
cell this is similar to the other one
but<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:12.719> using<00:00:12.960> polycarbonate<00:00:13.740> as<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
but it was using polycarbonate as the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.900 
but it was using polycarbonate as the
end<00:00:14.910> caps<00:00:15.179> now<00:00:15.839> i'm<00:00:15.900> using<00:00:15.990> photonic<00:00:16.760> this<00:00:17.760> is

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
end caps now i'm using photonic this is

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.700 
end caps now i'm using photonic this is
a<00:00:17.940> very<00:00:18.180> good<00:00:18.240> material<00:00:18.840> heat<00:00:19.140> resistant

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
a very good material heat resistant

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.950 
a very good material heat resistant

doesn't conduct conduct any electricity
so<00:00:25.199> I'm<00:00:25.470> using<00:00:25.859> them<00:00:26.010> as<00:00:26.130> my<00:00:26.279> end<00:00:26.789> plates<00:00:27.119> also

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
so I'm using them as my end plates also

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.900 
so I'm using them as my end plates also
a<00:00:27.840> thicker<00:00:28.199> middle<00:00:28.560> plate<00:00:28.769> now<00:00:29.099> exiting<00:00:29.699> my

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
a thicker middle plate now exiting my

gas up through the center and I recessed

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.900 
gas up through the center and I recessed
in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.120> battery<00:00:33.989> connections<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:34.890> i'm<00:00:35.730> also

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
in the battery connections here i'm also

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.880 
in the battery connections here i'm also
using<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.540> full<00:00:36.809> stainless<00:00:37.110> sheet<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> end

no leaks at all it's doing a great job I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.549 
no leaks at all it's doing a great job I
also<00:00:51.360> don't<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.840> use<00:00:51.989> no<00:00:52.110> gaskets

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
also don't have to use no gaskets

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.260 
also don't have to use no gaskets
between<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> end<00:00:53.160> plate<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:53.730> even<00:00:54.030> between

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the middle places because the philotic

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.459 
the middle places because the philotic
is<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.039> acting<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.789> gasket<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
is all acting like a gasket and this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.770 
is all acting like a gasket and this
runs<00:00:58.739> about<00:00:59.010> twenty<00:00:59.370> two<00:00:59.520> amps<00:00:59.820> right<00:01:00.000> now<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
runs about twenty two amps right now and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.470 
runs about twenty two amps right now and
she'll<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:01.920> four<00:01:02.250> liters<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> minute<00:01:02.670> when<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
she'll do four liters a minute when it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.460 
she'll do four liters a minute when it
gets<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> about<00:01:03.750> 110<00:01:04.409> degrees<00:01:05.090> I<00:01:06.110> was<00:01:07.110> making

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
gets to about 110 degrees I was making

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350 
gets to about 110 degrees I was making

well<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.610> then<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.790> made<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> little<00:02:00.210> jig<00:02:00.540> up

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
well and then I made a little jig up

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.120 
well and then I made a little jig up
over<00:02:00.960> here<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:02.250> set<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.950> plate<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
over here I set in the plate with the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.869 
over here I set in the plate with the
holes<00:02:05.960> one<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> gaskets<00:02:07.530> then<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.340> put<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
holes one of the gaskets then I put the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.300 
holes one of the gaskets then I put the
top<00:02:09.119> plate<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.569> here<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.160> use<00:02:11.280> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
top plate on here and then I use a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.240 
top plate on here and then I use a
dremel<00:02:11.640> or<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.000> road<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.930> it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
dremel or a road is it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.460 
dremel or a road is it
the<00:02:13.460> dremel<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:13.910> place<00:02:14.150> like<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.410> just

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
the dremel I place like this and just

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.200 
the dremel I place like this and just
run<00:02:15.770> around<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.070> edges<00:02:16.190> like<00:02:16.460> this<00:02:16.490> cuts<00:02:17.120> it

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
run around the edges like this cuts it

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
run around the edges like this cuts it
right<00:02:17.360> out<00:02:17.540> I'm<00:02:18.020> using<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.440> number<00:02:18.560> 6<00:02:18.920> 50<00:02:20.230> router

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
right out I'm using a number 6 50 router

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.910 
right out I'm using a number 6 50 router
bit<00:02:21.530> which<00:02:21.890> cuts<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.220> out<00:02:22.280> really<00:02:22.490> nice<00:02:22.720> and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
bit which cuts it out really nice and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.680 
bit which cuts it out really nice and
this<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.040> how<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.190> come<00:02:25.400> out<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.820> would<00:02:26.630> be

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
trying the new pwm soon as T gases and

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.390 
trying the new pwm soon as T gases and
working<00:02:30.320> on<00:02:30.440> them<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.709> should<00:02:30.950> be<00:02:31.040> getting<00:02:31.340> it
