00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.660
 behind me is a huge snow field and already 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.040
 tired of sports car dough anyway 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.610
 not worth it now garages 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.610
 so under this normal technique 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.610
 go 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.649
 lean hard on the back and you can do it harder 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.640
 you can generally everywhere back 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.790
 and somewhere obstacles 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.890
 deflate suspension often not 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.329
 roll over 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.520
 compared to the quad the same 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.270
 about or is it tougher 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.909
 it's softer quad cf moto x8 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.229
 an engine capacity of 800 cubes, I personally 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.210
 This used I can say that very 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:18.900
 reliable despite the fact that it is Chinese 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.900
 push button iodine Valea wound 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.880
 but 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.390
 if on some long journeys 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.460
 going to go need to put 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.619
 more trunk here from 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.630
 trunk that 's all for breaks the floor 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.170
 plastic pair glove bottles 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.549
 here it would seem to be 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.540
 gas tank here we have a gas tank no this 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.190
 false tank and gas tank is behind 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.460
 it looks like that's pretty 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.460
 simply 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.270
 friends quad bikes snowmobiles all bullshit 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.140
 soulless technique here it is real 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.140
 winter transport 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.650
 but 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.560
 but
