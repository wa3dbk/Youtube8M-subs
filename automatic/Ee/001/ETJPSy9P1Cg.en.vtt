was 120 1613 pre-orders you know per

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.719 
was 120 1613 pre-orders you know per
week<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> lot<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.840> total<00:01:25.740> 1<00:01:25.979> million

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.149 

1157<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.970> lot<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.150> one's<00:01:30.390> there<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
1157 that's a lot of one's there but you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.210 
1157 that's a lot of one's there but you
know<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.850> course<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.360> gone<00:01:33.720> up

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
know that's of course have gone up

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.950 
know that's of course have gone up
probably<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.310> bunch<00:01:35.640> by<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.240> which<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
probably a bunch by now which you know I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.039 
probably a bunch by now which you know I
know<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.290> only<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> few<00:01:37.710> days<00:01:37.860> later<00:01:38.390> but<00:01:39.390> come

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
know it's only a few days later but come

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.050 
know it's only a few days later but come
on<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.200> getting<00:01:40.619> closer<00:01:40.860> closer<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.400> halo<00:01:41.759> 4

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
on it's getting closer closer to halo 4

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.730 
on it's getting closer closer to halo 4
so<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.869> more<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.380> people<00:01:43.530> are

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so you know more and more people are

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.200 
so you know more and more people are
probably<00:01:43.950> trying<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.340> pre-order<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.939> stuff

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
probably trying to pre-order in stuff

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.050 
probably trying to pre-order in stuff
like<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> totally<00:01:47.130> non<00:01:47.460> halo

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
like that now on a totally non halo

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.719
