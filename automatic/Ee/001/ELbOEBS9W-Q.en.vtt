 as an obstacle to progress and for 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.240
 It's the creek story of heroism

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.410
 let's build heritage of the future 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.690
 we should not have a position of the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.000
 freezing to stop everything we have to have 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.860
 an intelligent position to perceive 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.870
 which are the essential features since the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.410
 who has heard of equity and has to be 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.590
 kept and what they are is dust from the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.199
 time and this has degree place the dust of the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.109
 another time without forgetting that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.989
 shall be set out in the assets of the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.290
 is in the old square soldiers who went 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.189
 know the standard for sharing 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.439
 and this has been almost 15 years through 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.420
 life will cost too big 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.490
 every day are opportune to 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.009
 discuss cities 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.490
 issues related to the great tourism 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.320
 about the 30 years of classification 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.950
 as world heritage 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.950
 we have here I am 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.890
 we thought it was an opportunity not to 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.220
 lose to not only know a little 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.060
 everything that is ingredient passed 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.149
 It's also like trying in a group is 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.579
 build the future is that time 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.110
 We intend and has proceeded to 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.329
 long at jazz at 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.090
 the conference of this kind of a table 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.540
 round is to address different thematic 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.390
 together collaborated in the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.910
 construction of the near future the citizen 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.080
 and the local authority launched the challenge 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.410
 all Anggrenses 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.150
 Let's get acquainted with what this one is. 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.680
 fundamental question we can not 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.390
 respect or love what does not 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.030
 We know the truth is that we 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.580
 we build the past and 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.800
 we change the past because we do not have 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.650
 none of the knowledge is accurate 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.510
 also respecting the myths needs to be 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.330
 have a deeper knowledge and are 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.400
 I need to go to the facts and not just be 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.990
 for I have heard that it is therefore 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.890
 importantly we know the history of 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.390
 our city 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.730
 we know our city ​​we know the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.920
 its evolution to make some take 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.630
 decisions that it respects and is exactly the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.480
 such assets and do not respect what 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.770
 that may appear as equity and this is 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.380
 an essential issue is the issue of 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.810
 self-knowledge that you have to 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.800
 to take away self-confidence and a 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.360
 It has to be very close and very 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.730
 between the institution in the state 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.170
 falcon bed and citizens 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.760
 so that it is perceived that what 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.340
 we want and where we are going 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.110
 already people seem to know a space 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.380
 which is in open door already to 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.800
 participation in the debate after the dates 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.040
 remembered here to bet on the 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.920
 citizenship over the course of these 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.709
 in these various events that there is a series 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.709
 of stories that repeat themselves being 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.430
 also the subject of other luiza 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.410
 public 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.260
 however they have all been 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.440
 assists that 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.850
 we had in the room full and we thought it was 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:48.180
 a discussion that needs to be done and from here 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.820
 future not only on non- durable dates 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.730
 but we have to get used to the level of 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.010
 citizenship to discuss the problems of our 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.459
 daily life and are thus more difficult to 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.850
 our church of mercy so to 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.750
 on the street had no pace was good in this 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.280
 disgrace 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.800
 who see today can not believe it 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.620
 I advise but this is how she had 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.049
 that's how she silvano time 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.500
 car traffic in stores trade 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.200
 the streets and the lack of people in the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.359
 hero creek city ​​center 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.640
 were addressed in this 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.770
 conference whose theme is far from 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.199
 know a final point 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.520
 I was with the abandonment in a part 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.979
 important part of the population of the 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.979
 city had not possible has nothing to do 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.900
 with these things are just left the 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.099
 flag by stitch on top of a 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.970
 time trend 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:45.580
 the automobile one of our studies 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.199
 banks their first equipment is quoted 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.759
 such buoys in question and the 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.889
 marketing back I think I was a 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.150
 first I consider that it would be 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.009
 tied back 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.930
 that was yesterday it is for general mines 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:00.360
 camera with paper strips plants for 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.360
 a case of exclusion than the video
