00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
quick zoom something on the moors it is

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.890 
quick zoom something on the moors it is
a<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:33.119> good<00:01:33.360> as<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> better

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
a really good as one of the better

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
a really good as one of the better
sniper<00:01:34.200> variants<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.400> an

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
sniper variants that they have an

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.010 
sniper variants that they have an
advanced<00:01:35.850> warfare<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.420> not<00:01:36.600> even<00:01:36.780> elite<00:01:36.990> i

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
advanced warfare it's not even elite i

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
advanced warfare it's not even elite i
believe<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.500> enlisted<00:01:38.130> or<00:01:38.220> professional

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
believe it's enlisted or professional

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.609 
believe it's enlisted or professional
but<00:01:38.909> either<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> city

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
but either way I do think that the city

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.929 
but either way I do think that the city
in<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.740> state<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.130> definitely<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> best

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
in the state is definitely the best

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.670 
in the state is definitely the best
bearing<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.420> any<00:01:42.630> gun<00:01:43.020> at<00:01:43.170> least<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.500> pub

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
bearing of any gun at least for pub

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.410
