00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello welcome example with 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.720
 I have you last time 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.090
 this ice mekka from chef aktor 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.650
 I want to introduce you today 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.610
 I've tried for that 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.770
 chocolate sauce cream and sugar and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.699
 that the ingredients I will be here in now 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.250
 mix this lid together for this 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.510
 we need a tablespoon because 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.740
 First , two tablespoons 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.420
 chocolate sauce or chocolate syrup 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.820
 depending on what you have in this 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.820
 cover so two spoons 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.360
 Who wants to can a spoon of sugar 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.920
 add 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.809
 depending on how you like it when you like 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.520
 It may be very sweet 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.570
 make another spoonful of sugar with it 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.170
 and I have a cup here 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.660
 whipped there are 200 grams in it and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.550
 I need about 100 grams so about 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.650
 half the half-cup roof 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:11.340
 So not quite the half decided 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.210
 yes that's the half and the whole 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.740
 ingredients are now mixed here so 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.740
 just stir well with the spoon 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.020
 since you can already see that with brown 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.009
 slowly it mixes like that and me 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.009
 I already spotted ten 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 so 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.250
 I really had the cup right now 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.790
 long in the freezer so two days 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:57.100
 long he is frozen now and come here 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:08.380
 the ingredients now, then I write 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:10.810
 the cup too with this lid and 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.010
 first shake it a bit 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.450
 the ingredient is a bit more 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:24.960
 can mix so now comes the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.960
 Cover up here so this shopping 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.460
 Now it's time to knead kneading again 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.720
 knead 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.260
 I am really curious if it is 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.320
 works kneading and kneading and hope 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.840
 that's right in there, I'll see 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.860
 purely 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.330
 still it is still liquid though 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.330
 Now, first kneaded well 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.659
 it still feels a bit 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.560
 I look at it smoothly 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.560
 also still liquid 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.560
 that is still fluid 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.860
 so I still continue to knead and now 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:06.370
 Let's take a look 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:10.120
 I'll unscrew the lid here, yes 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.930
 It's such a thick mixture 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.330
 arose 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.109
 but it is still too fluid 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.190
 for 1 so unfortunately it is not now 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.389
 won that looks more like a 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.680
 Eiscafe or something like that I write here the 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.150
 Cover it again and then I shake 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.150
 see it over here again 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:42.700
 viscous as molten as 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:51.890
 it looks a bit fatter than 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:55.130
 but before I tried it 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:58.340
 Tastes totally delicious and is now 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.130
 quite cold but correct as ice cream is 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.240
 it unfortunately did not become with me yes 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.980
 Overall, I am something again 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.440
 disappointed i do not know if i will be back 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.940
 he did something wrong now 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.610
 really two days completely in the Eisbach 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.470
 and I 've done all the ingredients search 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.610
 as in a booklet I stood've 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.730
 well kneaded and still yes it is like 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.260
 liquid ice but unfortunately not like 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.740
 I had not hoped for that 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.750
 ice cream parlor if you have this 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.100
 ice cream make up and fast factor 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.870
 then you write the comments like it 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.530
 maybe it worked for you 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.580
 it is simply just me again 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.010
 I would be happy about one 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.480
 comment and the video still like it 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.790
 I'm also happy about a thumb 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.500
 our other is looking up too 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.950
 videos and see you next time 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.950
 again
