drove<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.390> car<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.689> a<00:01:29.750> track<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.170> loved<00:01:30.439> it<00:01:30.590> I

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
drove that car of a track I loved it I

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.289 
drove that car of a track I loved it I
thought<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.920> was<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.040> very<00:01:31.310> capable<00:01:31.580> track<00:01:32.030> car

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
thought it was a very capable track car

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.450 
thought it was a very capable track car
not<00:01:32.960> really<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.229> daily<00:01:33.530> driver<00:01:33.770> just<00:01:34.130> like<00:01:34.220> this

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
not really a daily driver just like this

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.370 
not really a daily driver just like this
thing<00:01:34.700> over<00:01:34.820> here<00:01:34.909> but<00:01:35.479> Ford<00:01:35.780> raised<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.229> bar

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
thing over here but Ford raised the bar

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.859 
thing over here but Ford raised the bar
even<00:01:36.619> higher<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.729> technology<00:01:38.390> to

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
even higher the technology to

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.990 
even higher the technology to
performance<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:39.650> every<00:01:40.040> next<00:01:40.220> track<00:01:40.520> or<00:01:40.729> even

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
performance and every next track or even

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.170 
performance and every next track or even
in<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:41.119> car<00:01:41.390> really<00:01:42.049> raises<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.710> bar<00:01:42.890> for

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
in this car really raises the bar for

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.990 
in this car really raises the bar for
factory<00:01:44.180> race<00:01:44.689> cars
