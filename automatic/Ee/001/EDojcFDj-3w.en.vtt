00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.780
 welcome welcome i am frames stripe 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.910
 thin to draw well dot and today 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.710
 I come to talk to you about my book it's not my 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.170
 book because I wrote it is that 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.610
 it's mine the script is called bet and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.529
 edward and the book in question is 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.490
 learn to draw with the right side 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.310
 of the brain 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.910
 the title is very striking and is that the 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.750
 author associates the concept of teaching you to 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.280
 draw with a little neuroscience 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.830
 explaining that some skills 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.680
 what do you need to learn to 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.600
 draw are supposedly housed in 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.449
 the right hemisphere of the brain and you 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.230
 teaches exercises to empower and 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:53.530
 to be able to carry out drawings so high 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.620
 quality the best and greatest virtue of this 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.680
 book is that it teaches you to see how 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.010
 It is really to see things as they are 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.550
 and not as they seem to be they teach you to have 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.260
 the true vision of the artist 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.870
 and that's not to be fooled by your 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.630
 senses but through measures and 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.170
 measurements with the pencil and about 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.660
 exercises that will sharpen your vision 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.910
 you can see things as they are and 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.790
 so you can draw them from that same 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.440
 way that undoubtedly for me is one of 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.010
 the best virtues that this 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.110
 Book through their content and 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.150
 exercises has a lot of 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.850
 exercises is very tract is a book in 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.220
 the one that you're going to be working on topics and 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.160
 theme also something that goes very well because 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.940
 if it's just theory is boring and 2 does not 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.700
 he learns the same and good another concept that 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.460
 you are going to internalize that it goes very well 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.400
 everything in case you want to start 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.540
 from scratch with the drawing or want 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.930
 give it to someone who likes it 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:06.790
 draw tenor do not dare to break in 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.130
 it is in this art that it demystifies the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.230
 concept of what to draw that for 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.420
 drawing need to have a gift or a 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.040
 special talent is not a series of 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.320
 global skills that are needed 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.440
 learn and you need to practice that yes 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.140
 with a proper theory a few tips and 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.180
 a few correct exercises and a lot 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.220
 effort and a lot of practice on your part 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.140
 another of the cool things is that 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.709
 you will learn with this book is to do 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.390
 portraits of people who see the portrait is 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.800
 one of the treats one of the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.700
 whims all cartoonists 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.290
 we want to make our loved ones 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.720
 portraits then in a given moment of 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.160
 ourselves and good you will learn to 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.560
 draw hands basically to draw 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.709
 anything that you see in fact one of 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.450
 the aspects against this has 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.820
 book is that it does not teach you perspective 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.670
 which I consider essential for 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.010
 to be able to draw the things you imagine and 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.890
 understand what you see in a way a 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.220
 little bit more structural but for 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.270
 draw the things you see to draw 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.460
 landscapes people still lifes and others is 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.390
 a very good first step very good gift 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.610
 and a very good gift car 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.150
 if you know someone who is doing 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.030
 of professor now with the change this that 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.470
 there has been in education reform that 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.810
 have to act as a teacher of drawing and 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.740
 have no idea this is a very good 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.640
 material to start teaching with some 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.290
 bases a little solid and especially for 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.270
 that same person so I can start 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.070
 to enjoy the drawing 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.200
 I do not want to get entangled much more nor do 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.750
 a very heavy video so prost 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.510
 this is the subject that teaches you to see what 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.550
 it's a must-have lesson 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.379
 you need if you really want to draw 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.709
 things as they are without committing 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:04:01.810
 mistakes without without getting frustrated too 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.230
 emphasizes on the theme that drawing 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.950
 can learn no matter the person the 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.450
 age and the cultural baggage he has and 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.530
 especially 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.660
 that globally you are going to 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.130
 is going to give you the feeling that when 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.549
 you have finished the book you have finished 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.919
 all these exercises are going to be going to 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.620
 be closer to full control 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.620
 about the drawing and a real progression 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.490
 against the issue this one that does not teach 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.220
 the perspective but good is a first 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.949
 fundamental step learning to see with 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.270
 what the prospect can go after and 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:46.340
 Really 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:49.640
 and you are you can access without hesitation and now 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.130
 same to the post that there is in my web about 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.760
 of this book with a lot of content 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.190
 extra of texts a little more analyzed 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.570
 the pros and cons and links to 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.720
 that you can get it 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.070
 from amazon from the amazon portal 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.650
 Remember that if you buy the material 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.980
 since Amazon does not matter what you buy if 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.320
 you access amazon from my links 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.330
 you are directly helping a piece of 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.490
 book to start your collection of 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.220
 books to draw is a purchase 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.840
 mandatory and it is a very good gift for 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.840
 the people who want to start and do not know 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.990
 how or even where so good until 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.880
 here the criticism of drawing with the side 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.980
 of the brain of de ti eduard 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.840
 I hope you liked it, leave your 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.820
