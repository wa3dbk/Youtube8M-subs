the elective time that they have that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.410 
the elective time that they have that
flag<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.770> one<00:02:39.250> person<00:02:39.430> grab<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.910> flag<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.330> the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.349 
mom or 43 game it looks like most the
maps<00:03:55.720> are<00:03:56.140> pretty<00:03:56.799> close-knit<00:03:57.220> quarters<00:03:57.910> so

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
maps are pretty close-knit quarters so

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.680 
maps are pretty close-knit quarters so
SMGs<00:03:58.989> might<00:03:59.440> be<00:03:59.620> reign<00:03:59.829> supreme<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:01.150> ump

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
SMGs might be reign supreme and the ump

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.449 
SMGs might be reign supreme and the ump
it<00:04:01.900> seems<00:04:02.170> like<00:04:02.440> these<00:04:02.590> submachine<00:04:03.190> gun<00:04:03.340> of

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
it seems like these submachine gun of

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.420 
it seems like these submachine gun of
choice<00:04:03.489> once<00:04:04.150> again<00:04:04.950> who<00:04:05.950> knows<00:04:06.130> if<00:04:06.160> they're

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
choice once again who knows if they're

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.490 
choice once again who knows if they're
going<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:06.609> nerf<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.940> though<00:04:07.230> just<00:04:08.230> like<00:04:08.350> in

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
going to nerf it though just like in

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.319 
going to nerf it though just like in
black<00:04:08.709> ops<00:04:08.920> they<00:04:09.130> can<00:04:09.310> release<00:04:09.549> a<00:04:09.700> patch<00:04:09.910> on

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
black ops they can release a patch on

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.930 
black ops they can release a patch on
game<00:04:10.690> day<00:04:11.130> like<00:04:12.130> in<00:04:12.280> black<00:04:12.459> ops<00:04:12.670> where<00:04:12.850> they

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
game day like in black ops where they

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.479 
game day like in black ops where they
took<00:04:13.120> away<00:04:13.239> quickscoping<00:04:13.989> so<00:04:14.739> no<00:04:15.130> one<00:04:15.340> who

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
took away quickscoping so no one who

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.900 
took away quickscoping so no one who
didn't<00:04:15.820> have<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.209> game<00:04:16.570> before<00:04:16.780> its<00:04:17.079> release

also common in my word for two you know
two<00:04:47.170> kills<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:47.530> do<00:04:47.620> pred<00:04:47.890> you<00:04:48.100> get<00:04:48.190> the

two kills you do pred you get the
Harrier<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:48.880> then<00:04:48.970> you<00:04:49.060> get<00:04:49.210> your<00:04:49.240> chopper

Harrier and then you get your chopper
and<00:04:49.750> it's<00:04:49.900> just<00:04:50.050> too<00:04:50.470> much<00:04:50.500> air<00:04:50.800> support<00:04:51.280> if

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
and it's just too much air support if

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.660 
and it's just too much air support if
you<00:04:52.000> ask<00:04:52.150> me<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.480> slows<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:52.930> game<00:04:53.290> down<00:04:53.350> and<00:04:53.920> it

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
you ask me it slows the game down and it

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.810 
you ask me it slows the game down and it
makes<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:55.000> too<00:04:55.210> easy<00:04:55.240> for<00:04:55.720> bad<00:04:56.710> players<00:04:57.100> to<00:04:57.460> get

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
makes it too easy for bad players to get

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.200 
makes it too easy for bad players to get
good<00:04:58.060> scores<00:04:58.800> which<00:04:59.800> I<00:05:00.040> tend<00:05:00.580> not<00:05:00.670> to<00:05:00.910> be<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:01.030> fan
