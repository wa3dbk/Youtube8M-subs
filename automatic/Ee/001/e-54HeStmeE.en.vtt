00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.239
 Here you can see our video about the cucumber cultivation. 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.199
 The cucumbers are ideally preferred in the glasshouse. 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.119
 So the cucumber perennials carry cucumbers faster in summer. 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.570
 We use plastic pots. 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 The plastic dishes are filled with earth. 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.910
 Here you can see the seed for free-range cucumbers. 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.480
 The outdoor cucumber named 'Lothar', which grows in the dung-bed and covers the ground climbing. 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.560
 Furthermore, there are glass cucumbers, 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.690
 which are attached to a string or grow up along a scaffold. 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660
 There then the snake cucumbers can grow. 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.110
 Put the cucumber seed in the individual pots. 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.200
 One seed per pot, 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.520
 about an inch below the ground. 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.950
 We put the pots in the glass house. 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.620
 Here we see the preferred cucumbers. 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.110
 After about 10 days, the seedlings can be seen in this size. 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.170
 In this size, the cucumber plants are suitable for sale. 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.210
 Another form is the cucumber trees. 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.480
 Here you can see a so-called cucumber tree. 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.950
 A pumpkin is used as a base. 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.510
 And this pumpkin is refined with a cucumber. 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.180
 The advantage is, 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.910
 that the pumpkin provides an optimal source of nutrients. 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.649
 In summer vegetables can be grown. 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:23.199
 For this we have prepared this area. 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:25.869
 First, we sprinkle bio fertilizer 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.029
 We use Animalin from Oscorana 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.109
 in pelleted form over a large area on the ground. 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.319
 We also prepare the ground with stone meal. 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.310
 It is used for soil improvement and as a natural fertilizer 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.869
 with nitrogen and trace elements, 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:51.569
 which are ideal for tomatoes, melanzani, etc. 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.799
 We then milled and loosened the soil, 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.419
 so you can plant vegetables in the soil. 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.519
 The loosened soil is then covered with a black mulch foil. 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.469
 This foil stores and reflects the heat 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:13.359
 and prevents moisture loss. 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.759
 Furthermore, no weeds get through. 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:20.219
 So we can plant the cucumbers here. 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.369
 In the foil we tear individual holes 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.489
 in the prepared bed. 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.389
 Put the cucumber plants in the ground, 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.719
 press it lightly. 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.609
 This is how the cucumber plant can grow. 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.129
 The cucumber plants can grow up with this string. 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.809
 The advantage is that space is saved 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.329
 and the cucumbers turn green all around. 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.589
 They do not get any discoloration that they often get lying on the ground. 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:54.259
 Furthermore, one uses a sisal cord 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.169
 for vegetables 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.219
 and bind them at the bottom, 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.049
 with a light knot, not too tight, 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.809
 Otherwise one laces the plant off the Saftadern. 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:14.169
 The sisal cord is optimally hanging very loose, 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.759
 so that the cucumber plants can climb up. 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.329
 The cucumber plants grow up to the top.
