so<00:00:34.170> let's<00:00:34.649> start<00:00:34.949> making<00:00:35.129> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.939 

to<00:00:42.690> make<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.050> toast<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.680> are<00:00:43.769> going<00:00:43.890> to

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
to make this toast we are going to

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.459 
to make this toast we are going to
divide<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> recipe<00:00:44.789> into<00:00:45.000> four<00:00:45.329> steps<00:00:45.690> step

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
divide the recipe into four steps step

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
divide the recipe into four steps step
one<00:00:46.739> would<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.280> make<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.609> topping<00:00:47.879> step

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
one would be to make the topping step

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540 
one would be to make the topping step
two<00:00:49.050> would<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.620> mix<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> butter<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
garlic step three would be to assemble

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.579 
garlic step three would be to assemble
on<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.339> bread<00:00:53.609> and<00:00:53.940> fourth<00:00:54.629> would<00:00:54.839> be<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.140> bake

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
on the bread and fourth would be to bake

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.039 
on the bread and fourth would be to bake
it<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.070> let's<00:00:56.550> start<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:57.089> step<00:00:57.359> one<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
it so let's start with step one that is

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:00.889 
it so let's start with step one that is
making<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.469> topping<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.309> that<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.479> need<00:01:00.659> some
