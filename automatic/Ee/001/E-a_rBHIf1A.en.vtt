00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
hey everyone so this is the object we're

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.110 
hey everyone so this is the object we're
going<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.299> create<00:00:06.600> today<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:07.529> this<00:00:07.830> video<00:00:08.120> as

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
going to create today in this video as

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.480 
going to create today in this video as
you<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:09.420> see<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:10.110> felt<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.920> would<00:00:11.160> make<00:00:11.460> a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
you can see I felt it would make a

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.410 
you can see I felt it would make a
rather<00:00:11.820> beautiful<00:00:12.150> pencil<00:00:13.139> holder<00:00:13.530> or<00:00:14.420> some

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
rather beautiful pencil holder or some

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.290 
rather beautiful pencil holder or some
other<00:00:15.599> interesting<00:00:16.170> decorative<00:00:16.680> item<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.640> it

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
other interesting decorative item and it

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.000 
other interesting decorative item and it
would<00:00:18.420> probably<00:00:18.600> be<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> good<00:00:19.199> candidate<00:00:19.980> for

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
would probably be a good candidate for

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.810 
would probably be a good candidate for
3d<00:00:20.550> printing<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.180> well<00:00:22.130> this<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.310> actually<00:00:23.730> a

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
3d printing as well this is actually a

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.540 
3d printing as well this is actually a
render<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.359> did<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:25.470> quickly<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
render I did really quickly just to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.900 
render I did really quickly just to
illustrate<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:28.220> no<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.250> don't<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.670> if<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
illustrate that no I don't know if the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.389 
illustrate that no I don't know if the
shape<00:00:30.210> has<00:00:30.510> any<00:00:30.779> official<00:00:31.349> algebraic<00:00:32.160> or

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
shape has any official algebraic or

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.990 
shape has any official algebraic or
mathematical<00:00:33.300> description<00:00:34.430> but<00:00:35.430> my<00:00:35.610> friend

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
mathematical description but my friend

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.080 
mathematical description but my friend
David<00:00:36.480> Brennan<00:00:36.960> chose<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.770> call<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.309> ported

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
David Brennan chose to call it a ported

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
David Brennan chose to call it a ported
cube<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:41.219> what<00:00:41.399> I'll<00:00:41.520> go<00:00:41.700> with<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.180> well

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
cube so that's what I'll go with as well

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.850 
cube so that's what I'll go with as well
David<00:00:44.730> created<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.270> object<00:00:45.809> using<00:00:46.590> his<00:00:46.710> own

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
David created this object using his own

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.150 
David created this object using his own
unique<00:00:47.670> solid<00:00:48.239> modeling<00:00:48.719> techniques<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.890> his

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
unique solid modeling techniques on his

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.600 
unique solid modeling techniques on his
channel<00:00:50.640> using<00:00:51.539> wings<00:00:51.780> 3d<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.860> he<00:00:53.100> did<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.430> in

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
channel using wings 3d and he did it in

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.470 
channel using wings 3d and he did it in
just<00:00:54.120> under<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> minute<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> thought<00:00:57.360> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
just under a minute so I thought it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450 
just under a minute so I thought it
might<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.870> an<00:00:58.649> interesting<00:00:58.890> learning

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
might be an interesting learning

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.529 
might be an interesting learning
experience

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
experience

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.470 
experience
to<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.559> could<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.699> same<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.300> better

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
to see if we could do the same or better

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.539 
to see if we could do the same or better
in<00:01:03.960> 3ds<00:01:04.589> max<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> same<00:01:07.770> time<00:01:08.010> frame<00:01:08.340> or

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
in 3ds max in the same time frame or

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.020 
in 3ds max in the same time frame or
better<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.880> should<00:01:09.030> say<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.659> let's<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:12.810> started

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
better I should say so let's get started

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.390 
better I should say so let's get started
just<00:01:15.030> open<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.600> blank<00:01:15.930> scene<00:01:16.290> here

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
just open to a blank scene here

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.359 
just open to a blank scene here
the<00:01:18.299> first<00:01:18.570> thing<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.869> want<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.710> bring<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the first thing we want to do is bring a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.130 
the first thing we want to do is bring a
cube<00:01:20.790> into<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> scene<00:01:21.860> all<00:01:22.860> right<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:24.140> we'll

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
cube into the scene all right and we'll

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.039 
cube into the scene all right and we'll
give<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.320> three<00:01:25.799> by<00:01:26.040> three<00:01:26.400> by<00:01:26.610> three<00:01:27.049> segments

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
give it three by three by three segments

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.499 
give it three by three by three segments
unlinked<00:01:28.770> width<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.310> height<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.060> you'll<00:01:30.299> have

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
unlinked width and height so you'll have

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.310 
unlinked width and height so you'll have
this<00:01:31.400> alright<00:01:32.400> then<00:01:32.700> we'll<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.090> into<00:01:33.329> apply

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
this alright then we'll go into apply

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.039 
this alright then we'll go into apply
and<00:01:34.619> edit<00:01:34.829> poly<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.060> face<00:01:36.420> mode<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and edit poly going to face mode and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.070 
and edit poly going to face mode and
select<00:01:37.310> three<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.700> corner<00:01:39.119> faces

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
select three of the corner faces

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.890 
select three of the corner faces
then<00:01:41.200> go<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:41.590> select<00:01:42.160> similar<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.210> then

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
then go to select similar and then

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.570 
then go to select similar and then
delete<00:01:44.940> select<00:01:45.940> one<00:01:46.150> of<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.390> middle<00:01:46.690> phases

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
delete select one of the middle phases

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.520 
delete select one of the middle phases
select<00:01:48.580> similar<00:01:48.940> again<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:52.320> shift<00:01:53.320> click

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
select similar again and shift click

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.730 
select similar again and shift click
extrude<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.460> extrude<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:55.000> into<00:01:55.630> itself<00:01:56.020> until

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
extrude and extrude it into itself until

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.940 
extrude and extrude it into itself until
the<00:01:56.920> phases<00:01:57.370> are<00:01:57.400> just<00:01:57.670> about<00:01:57.880> touching<00:01:58.240> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the phases are just about touching and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.160 
the phases are just about touching and
then<00:01:59.950> we'll<00:02:00.190> control<00:02:00.670> click<00:02:00.970> on<00:02:01.150> vertices<00:02:01.780> and

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
then we'll control click on vertices and

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.770 
then we'll control click on vertices and
then<00:02:03.130> click<00:02:03.400> back<00:02:03.640> on<00:02:03.880> polygons

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
then click back on polygons

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.020 
then click back on polygons
delete<00:02:05.530> those<00:02:05.740> phases<00:02:06.340> go<00:02:07.240> back<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.660> vertices

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
delete those phases go back to vertices

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.230 
delete those phases go back to vertices
shift<00:02:10.030> click<00:02:10.380> weld<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:12.030> adjust<00:02:13.030> the

shift click weld and adjust the
threshold<00:02:13.810> until<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.740> see<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.280> they're<00:02:15.580> all

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
threshold until you see that they're all

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.880 
threshold until you see that they're all
welded<00:02:16.420> up<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:18.250> like<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:19.050> next<00:02:20.050> step<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:20.680> to

welded up just like that next step is to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.060 
welded up just like that next step is to
apply<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.280> shell<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.260> finally<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.290> turbosmooth

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
apply a shell and finally a turbosmooth

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.580 
apply a shell and finally a turbosmooth
and<00:02:25.030> we'll<00:02:25.390> give<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.720> couple<00:02:25.870> iterations

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
and we'll give it a couple iterations

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.270 
and we'll give it a couple iterations
here<00:02:27.600> alright<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.840> there<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.500> that's<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.270 
ported cube i'll give it three
iterations<00:02:38.380> just<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.800> make<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:38.950> nice<00:02:39.220> and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
iterations just to make it nice and

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.830 
iterations just to make it nice and
smooth<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:42.760> definitely<00:02:42.910> get<00:02:43.330> this<00:02:43.570> done

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
smooth you can definitely get this done

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.440 
smooth you can definitely get this done
i<00:02:44.260> mean<00:02:44.920> if<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.160> were<00:02:45.340> working<00:02:45.820> quickly<00:02:46.060> you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
i mean if you were working quickly you

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.330 
i mean if you were working quickly you
can<00:02:46.600> get<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:46.930> done<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.380> probably<00:02:47.620> i<00:02:47.890> did<00:02:48.220> it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
can get this done and probably i did it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.070 
can get this done and probably i did it
in<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.580> different<00:02:48.730> video<00:02:49.150> just<00:02:49.660> as<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> test<00:02:50.230> in

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
in a different video just as a test in

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.850 
in a different video just as a test in
like<00:02:53.080> 38<00:02:53.560> seconds<00:02:54.190> or<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.350> there's<00:02:56.350> only<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.590> few

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
like 38 seconds or so there's only a few

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.430 
like 38 seconds or so there's only a few
steps<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.610> as<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.880> can<00:02:58.030> see<00:02:58.350> but<00:02:59.350> the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
steps to it as you can see but the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.150 
steps to it as you can see but the
result<00:02:59.800> is<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:01.360> quite<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.690> beautiful

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
result is it's quite a beautiful

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.759 
result is it's quite a beautiful
symmetrical<00:03:03.160> object<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:05.260> caught<00:03:05.530> my<00:03:05.739> eye

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
symmetrical object and it caught my eye

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.180 
symmetrical object and it caught my eye

when I saw David David's video of his

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.080 
when I saw David David's video of his
wings<00:03:09.430> 3d<00:03:09.760> version<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.980> just<00:03:12.550> wanted<00:03:12.790> to

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
wings 3d version so I just wanted to

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.229 
wings 3d version so I just wanted to
bring<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:13.989> into<00:03:14.260> 3ds<00:03:14.830> max<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.580> see<00:03:16.000> if<00:03:16.090> we

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
bring it into 3ds max and see if we

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.790 
bring it into 3ds max and see if we
could<00:03:16.500> do<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.680> same<00:03:17.709> in<00:03:18.160> here<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:19.800> very

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
could do the same in here and very

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.360 
could do the same in here and very
quickly<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.190> came<00:03:21.489> up<00:03:21.640> with<00:03:21.670> this<00:03:21.940> technique

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
quickly I came up with this technique

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.140 
quickly I came up with this technique
right<00:03:24.370> so<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.209> may<00:03:25.900> actually<00:03:26.610> do<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.640> blender

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
right so I may actually do a blender

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.509 
right so I may actually do a blender
