he went the school was much more diverse

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
he went the school was much more diverse
than<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> today<00:01:23.869> you'd<00:01:24.869> take<00:01:25.110> the

standardized test and if you did well

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.270 
standardized test and if you did well
enough<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> you'd<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:31.159> it<00:01:32.159> was

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
enough on it you'd get in it was
