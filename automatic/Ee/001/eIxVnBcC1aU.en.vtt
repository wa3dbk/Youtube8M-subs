00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
kind of cool yeah it does is that the

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.450 
kind of cool yeah it does is that the
11th<00:01:30.580> generation<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:31.720> at<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.900> 10th<00:01:32.310> thing<00:01:33.310> us

is<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.649> 11<00:01:37.080> if<00:01:38.080> it's<00:01:38.259> not<00:01:38.470> it<00:01:39.220> still<00:01:39.430> might<00:01:39.670> be

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
is the 11 if it's not it still might be

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.249 
is the 11 if it's not it still might be
the<00:01:39.940> 10th<00:01:40.149> evo<00:01:40.450> but<00:01:40.630> it's<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.860> Lance<00:01:43.200> from<00:01:44.200> a
