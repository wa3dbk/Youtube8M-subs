hey<00:00:11.910> folks<00:00:12.210> welcome<00:00:12.480> back<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.929> metroid<00:00:13.440> prime

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
hey folks welcome back to metroid prime

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.269 
hey folks welcome back to metroid prime
here<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:15.030> town<00:00:15.299> overworld<00:00:15.890> not<00:00:16.890> actually

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
here on town overworld not actually

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.300 
here on town overworld not actually
staying<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:18.000> are<00:00:18.150> heading<00:00:18.449> over<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.310> area

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
staying we are heading over to the area

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.870 
staying we are heading over to the area
i<00:00:20.779> went<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> little<00:00:22.410> while<00:00:22.590> ago<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.609> i<00:00:23.699> said

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
i went to a little while ago and i said

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.580 
i went to a little while ago and i said
we<00:00:24.000> should<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> gravity<00:00:24.689> soup<00:00:24.900> before

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
we should get the gravity soup before

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.950 
we should get the gravity soup before
exploring<00:00:25.980> further<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.630> now<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.930> have

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
exploring further and now that we have

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.919 
exploring further and now that we have
the<00:00:28.230> gravity<00:00:28.500> suit<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.970> special<00:00:29.970> fusion<00:00:30.840> of

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the gravity suit in special fusion of

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.750 
the gravity suit in special fusion of
vision<00:00:31.550> we<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.700> go<00:00:32.820> do<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.120> now<00:00:34.640> for<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:35.730> i

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
vision we can go do that now for what i

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240 
vision we can go do that now for what i
understand<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> possible<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.440> crazy

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
understand it is possible to do crazy

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.420 
understand it is possible to do crazy
wax<00:00:38.640> secrets<00:00:39.210> breaking<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.160> get<00:00:41.160> through<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
wax secrets breaking and get through the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.060 
wax secrets breaking and get through the
area<00:00:41.700> without<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.200> but<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.379> sucks<00:00:43.800> it's

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
area without it but it sucks it's

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.979 
area without it but it sucks it's
horrible<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:44.969> fun<00:00:47.899> screw<00:00:48.899> those

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
horrible and it's not fun screw those

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.110 
horrible and it's not fun screw those
guys<00:00:49.460> anyway<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.579> remember<00:00:50.910> there's<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
guys anyway you remember there's a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.689 
guys anyway you remember there's a
missile<00:00:51.420> expansion<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.640> needed<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
missile expansion here needed the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.920 
missile expansion here needed the
gravity<00:00:54.030> suit<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.329> get<00:00:55.340> easy<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.399> pie<00:00:56.579> oh<00:00:59.930> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
gravity suit to get easy as pie oh and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.080 
gravity suit to get easy as pie oh and
we<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.260> jet<00:01:02.190> zap<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.609> whatever<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> hell

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
we have a jet zap or whatever the hell

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:11.529 
we have a jet zap or whatever the hell
this<00:01:03.210> thing<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:04.460> screw<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.810 

and<00:01:12.539> once<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.469> grapple<00:01:13.920> beam<00:01:14.100> it'll

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
and once we get the grapple beam it'll

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
and once we get the grapple beam it'll
be<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.969> lot<00:01:15.270> easier<00:01:15.329> to<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.929> through<00:01:15.990> because

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
be a lot easier to get through because

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.370 
be a lot easier to get through because
there<00:01:16.740> are<00:01:17.750> grapple<00:01:18.750> points<00:01:18.990> over<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.289> as

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
there are grapple points over there as

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.200 
there are grapple points over there as
you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.649> see<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> into<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.079> and<00:01:26.060> see<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
you can see so into here and see if you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:38.210 
you can see so into here and see if you
recognize<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.720 

yep<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.420> year<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.020> down<00:01:40.740> frigate<00:01:41.310> or

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
yep this year is the down frigate or

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.750 
yep this year is the down frigate or
crashed<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.330> good<00:01:42.450> or<00:01:42.600> something<00:01:42.870> like<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
crashed for good or something like that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.630 
crashed for good or something like that
it's<00:01:44.760> the<00:01:45.090> same<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.310> forget<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.550> were

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
it's the same as the forget that we were

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.930 
it's the same as the forget that we were
on<00:01:47.760> at<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:47.970> beginning<00:01:48.300> of<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.450> game<00:01:49.940> except

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
on at the beginning of the game except

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.450 
on at the beginning of the game except
it's<00:01:51.150> been<00:01:51.480> destroyed<00:01:52.290> by<00:01:52.590> impacting<00:01:53.370> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
it's been destroyed by impacting a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.410 
it's been destroyed by impacting a
planet<00:01:54.080> which<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.200> understandable<00:01:59.420> these

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
planet which is understandable these

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.220 
planet which is understandable these
these<00:02:01.290> uh<00:02:01.350> turrets<00:02:02.310> are<00:02:02.400> kind<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:02.580> weird<00:02:03.230> even

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
these uh turrets are kind of weird even

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.660 
these uh turrets are kind of weird even
if<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.380> freeze<00:02:04.650> them<00:02:04.830> they<00:02:05.310> aren't<00:02:05.550> one

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
if you freeze them they aren't one

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.359 
if you freeze them they aren't one
should<00:02:05.910> one<00:02:06.630> shot<00:02:06.810> missile<00:02:07.110> Kos<00:02:07.440> which<00:02:08.190> is

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
should one shot missile Kos which is

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.040 
should one shot missile Kos which is
surprising<00:02:08.850> most<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:09.630> things<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:12.050> still

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
surprising most of the things are still

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.699 
surprising most of the things are still
good<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.350> freeze<00:02:13.590> them<00:02:14.780> because<00:02:15.780> they<00:02:16.470> won't

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
good to freeze them because they won't

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.380 
good to freeze them because they won't
attack<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.459> frozen<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:18.240> there

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
attack you in the frozen and if there

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.949 
attack you in the frozen and if there
are<00:02:18.480> two<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.720> them<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.620> good<00:02:19.740> idea

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.510 

now<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.020> really<00:02:25.530> like<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.920> down<00:02:26.070> forget

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
now I really like the down forget

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.330 
now I really like the down forget
because<00:02:27.240> it's<00:02:27.810> one<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.680> most<00:02:28.740> ambient

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
because it's one of the most ambient

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.090 
because it's one of the most ambient
locations<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.090> game<00:02:30.650> much<00:02:31.650> more<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:31.890> than

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
locations in the game much more so than

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.920 
locations in the game much more so than
say<00:02:32.820> mag<00:02:33.540> more<00:02:34.490> or<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:36.030> area<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.600> we<00:02:36.720> go<00:02:36.870> to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
say mag more or the area that we go to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:54.070 
say mag more or the area that we go to
after<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:38.630> it's<00:02:39.630> really<00:02:39.810> look<00:02:40.050> at<00:02:40.170> this

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.140 

I<00:02:54.280> mean<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.310> have<00:02:55.460> no<00:02:55.580> idea<00:02:55.700> how<00:02:55.940> these<00:02:56.120> things

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
I mean I have no idea how these things

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.460 
I mean I have no idea how these things
are<00:02:56.390> suspended<00:02:56.990> but<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.980> know<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:59.350> mean<00:03:00.350> you

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
are suspended but you know I mean you

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.080 
are suspended but you know I mean you
could<00:03:00.620> make<00:03:00.860> some<00:03:01.310> sort<00:03:01.520> of<00:03:01.580> argument<00:03:01.850> about

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
could make some sort of argument about

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.110 
could make some sort of argument about
the<00:03:02.620> hydrodynamics<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:04.280> buoyancy<00:03:04.610> or

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
the hydrodynamics in buoyancy or

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.360 
the hydrodynamics in buoyancy or
something<00:03:05.420> but<00:03:05.780> sandwich<00:03:06.740> lands<00:03:06.950> on<00:03:07.190> them

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
something but sandwich lands on them

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.710 
something but sandwich lands on them
which<00:03:07.550> should<00:03:07.850> knock<00:03:08.060> them<00:03:08.270> down<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:11.510> got<00:03:11.690> a

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
which should knock them down we got a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.680 
which should knock them down we got a

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.420 

that<00:04:00.650> one<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.159> the<00:04:01.250> last<00:04:01.280> one<00:04:01.610> is<00:04:01.730> up<00:04:02.000> top<00:04:02.239> I

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.050 
opposite direction last time I think
that<00:04:27.050> was<00:04:27.260> where<00:04:28.250> we<00:04:28.400> thought<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.699> parasite

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
that was where we thought the parasite

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.120 
that was where we thought the parasite
queen<00:04:29.270> or<00:04:29.750> something<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:30.199> don't<00:04:30.770> remember<00:04:30.830> it's
