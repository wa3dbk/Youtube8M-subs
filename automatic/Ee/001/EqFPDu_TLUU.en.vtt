00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.420
 how is galvanic stroke located? 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:09.179
 known as r1000 and in this little 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.099
 video we're going to do a review and we're going to 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.679
 see the characteristics of samsung 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.679
 galaxy s 4 mini duos 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.529
 well this phone the samsung galaxy s 4 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:32.450
 mini duos actually their characteristic 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:35.030
 principal is that you have the space to 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.100
 two sims at the same time that wants 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.559
 say we can have two lines in the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.260
 same phone I think that's a 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.910
 more attractive because really good 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.340
 from then on almost all 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.190
 characteristics about them 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.350
 For example let's look first at the appearance 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.020
 physical is actually exactly the same 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.010
 that in that 4 mini 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.810
 measures 12 centimeters by 6 with 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.710
 a thickness of point 9 centimeters 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.710
 quite thin and very light and 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.710
 only 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.550
 on the other hand in the specifications 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.430
 techniques when we have a resolution 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.460
 that also affects you a little bit since 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.020
 in more than 540 x 960 pits 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.930
 as for the screen that is a 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.799
 super amoled screen and therefore 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.799
 when we were 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.690
 to the core of 1.7 gigahertz 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.549
 all applications are going to run 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:45.380
 pretty good and with a very speed 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.600
 considerable we are talking about what is 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.550
 a phone that now good then in 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.420
 these moments already 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:57.560
 when this video is made, it is not 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.420
 a phone of quite a cost 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.060
 quite accessible we are saying 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.730
 talking about four thousand four thousand 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.510
 weights are less than 350 dollars 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.120
 and good for the sensors practically 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.940
 I can go you bring all not in 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.640
 reality all the most basic sensors 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.160
 this is the gyroscope accelerometer 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.650
 proximity sensor the field sensor 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.080
 magnetic earth and all the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.140
 sensors that we use normally 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.150
 at stake especially and in applications of 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.150
 very specific purpose so that's why 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.460
 do not worry he's going to bring them all and 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.740
 obviously talking about the sims that is 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.950
 its most important characteristic why 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.400
 is that your voice is good you have two slots 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.000
 to insert the sim you have two 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.030
 lines 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.910
 obviously galindo line 2 this to 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.890
 can use them well, then in the menu you 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.650
 it is enough that you choose that although line 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.130
 you want to make the call or send the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.750
 message 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.090
 because actually for reception 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.980
 the two lines are always activated 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.080
 that means if they call you 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.020
 any of the two numbers you're going to 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.170
 receive the call 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.480
 no matter which one you try 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.030
 for the exit if you want to send a 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.650
 message then if you can decide with 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.330
 what line do you want to make if your 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.000
 Do you want to make a call? 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.060
 obviously it's the same 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.970
 and finally the network that for me is one 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.410
 of his elders how many because to what 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.170
 I mean with the good network because its 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.450
 connection is nothing more than three and as the 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.270
 mentioned and seen my other videos 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.050
 for me in compatibility with lte or 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.480
 4g is very important because of the plans 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.030
 of data and the speeds that you can 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.430
 achieve we are talking about that a 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.590
 uniqueness of 4g you will reach 40 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.680
 megas and maybe on this phone 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.350
 only for having 3g connectivity 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.470
 maybe you get to the mega mega and a half if 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.200
 Well, if they go well or if you have a lot 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.560
 luck in terms of the operating system 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.540
 well the factory operating system is going 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.730
 to arrive you with a living 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.590
 but immediately good to these 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.109
 heights there is an update here 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.970
 here so by operating system you do not 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:18.600
 you're behind for nothing 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.630
 and then finally in summary this 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.640
 phone is a great phone by the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.250
 cost is a great phone very good 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.100
 processor good image what would be your 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.780
 great Romans great pro is that if you by 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.400
 some reason you have two lines for 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.550
 example you have the line of work and the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.530
 personal line, it is undoubtedly a very 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.630
 good option instead of having 22 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.930
 phones in your pocket ours is 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.930
 one 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:50.400
 31 and you have your two phone lines 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.890
 both working as staff 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.140
 example, maybe you do not want two lines 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.960
 on the other hand for another situation that you 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.450
 you require it and for me what are the 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.160
 great cons of this good phone 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.980
 obviously, as I already mentioned, 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.640
 fact that nothing else is 3g to me that 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.620
 It is a pretty strong if you against me 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.800
 they like the data very much you will not have any 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.930
 problem but if you really like them 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.160
 videos and all that kind of stuff because 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.500
 the fact that it does not bring lte or 4g in 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.040
 this case you do not want to call because if it is 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:29.610
 a major problem and something that does not 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.770
 I mentioned just along the 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.790
 specifications is that it does not have 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:38.700
 Compatibility with mh l which is m hl 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.830
 good because it is this cable cited that 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.800
 it's getting so fashionable 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.050
 because now basically any 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.170
 phone with nhl compatibility what 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.850
 can do and what is this standard 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.670
 they talk and they say Carlos and you that you 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.850
 you connect to your mini usb which is where 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.950
 You charge your phone and you can take it out 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.780
 access email that means you can 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.880
 comment what you see on your screen what 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.740
 you can see on a television you can 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.740
 connect your phone to a television 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.320
 through hdmi and this he is very 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.310
 particular the samsung galaxy s four 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.350
 minutes does not support it so if 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.480
 you think for presentations or things from 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.480
 that style you can not either 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.980
 and good if you think about buying this 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.410
 phone I hope this video has you 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.910
 served a little to give you an idea that 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.300
 really how much and nothing else are we 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.020
 speaking that their great advantage are both 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.050
 both 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.900
 sims so as always if you liked the 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.370
 video I invite you to subscribe and I 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.370
 I see them in the next
