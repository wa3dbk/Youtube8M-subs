some<00:01:30.030> snow<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.840> we're<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> watch<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
some snow so we're going to watch the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.039 
some snow so we're going to watch the
storm<00:01:31.920> again<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.820> into<00:01:33.030> Denver<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.750> then

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
storm again get into Denver and then

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.510 
storm again get into Denver and then
we're<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.590> watch<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.920> movie<00:01:35.040> store<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
we're going to watch a movie store and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.830 
we're going to watch a movie store and
then<00:01:35.610> potentially<00:01:36.119> even<00:01:36.329> bring<00:01:36.509> severe

here's<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.220> look<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> snow<00:01:41.850> interesting

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
here's a look at the snow interesting

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.300 
here's a look at the snow interesting
here<00:01:42.869> right<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> topography<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
here right to see the topography and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.039 
here right to see the topography and
that's<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.240> about<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> same

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that's what it's all about it's the same

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.499 
that's what it's all about it's the same
moisture<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.860> warm<00:01:47.130> core<00:01:47.399> system<00:01:47.880> same

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
moisture this is a warm core system same

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.690 
moisture this is a warm core system same
moisture<00:01:49.020> moving<00:01:49.320> east<00:01:49.590> toward<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.399> of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
moisture moving east toward but of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
7,000 the air rises it cools and then we

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.649 
7,000 the air rises it cools and then we
see<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> changeover<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.880> snow<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.360> we're<00:01:57.509> going

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
see a changeover to snow and we're going

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.719 
see a changeover to snow and we're going
to<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> lot<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.619> between<00:01:59.189> about<00:01:59.310> 2<00:01:59.520> &amp;<00:01:59.700> 3

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
feet of snow and of course the snow here

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.370 
feet of snow and of course the snow here
in<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> Sierra<00:02:02.969> becomes<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.840> drinking<00:02:04.229> water

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
in the Sierra becomes the drinking water

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.200 
in the Sierra becomes the drinking water
for<00:02:04.740> California<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.640> summer<00:02:05.759> so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
for California for the summer so

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.419 
for California for the summer so
certainly<00:02:06.630> beneficial<00:02:07.079> three<00:02:07.920> year<00:02:08.160> drought

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
certainly beneficial three year drought

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.979 
certainly beneficial three year drought

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.300 
our winter weather expert coming up
about<00:02:11.610> if<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
about if the

is putting a dent in the drought you'll

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.570 
is putting a dent in the drought you'll
be<00:02:13.690> surprised<00:02:14.080> again<00:02:14.650> about<00:02:15.040> three<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.430> five

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
be surprised again about three to five

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.729 
be surprised again about three to five
inches<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.030> rain<00:02:16.360> where<00:02:16.720> we<00:02:16.930> stand<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:17.349> and

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
inches of rain where we stand now and

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.890 
inches of rain where we stand now and
we're<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.400> big<00:02:18.550> scheme<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:18.880> things<00:02:19.030> so

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
we're in the big scheme of things so

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.970 
we're in the big scheme of things so
we're<00:02:20.020> going<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> watch<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.560> storm<00:02:20.800> push

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
we're going to watch the storm push

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.280 
we're going to watch the storm push
eastward<00:02:21.310> on<00:02:21.459> Sunday<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> potential

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
eastward on Sunday this is the potential

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.410 
eastward on Sunday this is the potential
right<00:02:23.500> here<00:02:23.770> here's<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.310> front<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:25.150> north

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
right here here's the front the north

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.150 
right here here's the front the north
side<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.780> course<00:02:26.230> with<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.500> colder<00:02:26.860> air<00:02:27.040> is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
side of course with the colder air is

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.710 
side of course with the colder air is
but<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.400> warm<00:02:27.640> side<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.150> system

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
but the warm side of the system

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.509 
but the warm side of the system
moisture<00:02:29.349> coming<00:02:29.590> up<00:02:29.739> from<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.069> Gulf<00:02:30.280> and

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
moisture coming up from the Gulf and

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.710 
moisture coming up from the Gulf and
there's<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.730> potential<00:02:31.060> for<00:02:31.209> severe<00:02:31.690> weather

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
there's the potential for severe weather

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.780 
there's the potential for severe weather
so<00:02:32.500> we'll<00:02:32.650> talk<00:02:32.800> about<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.220> potentially

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
so we'll talk about that potentially

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.790 
so we'll talk about that potentially
some<00:02:33.940> isolated<00:02:34.330> showers<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.959> thunderstorms

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
some isolated showers and thunderstorms

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800 
some isolated showers and thunderstorms
that's<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.430> sunday<00:02:36.819> quadrant<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.480> then

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
that's the sunday quadrant and then

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.690 
that's the sunday quadrant and then
Sunday<00:02:38.140> night<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.920> all<00:02:39.010> pushes<00:02:39.430> eastward

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
Sunday night it all pushes eastward

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.790 
Sunday night it all pushes eastward
still<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.330> moves<00:02:40.690> in<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.050> southeast<00:02:41.500> as

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
still and moves in to the southeast as

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.710 
still and moves in to the southeast as
rain<00:02:42.099> so<00:02:42.430> no<00:02:42.940> one<00:02:43.150> not<00:02:43.330> going<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.569> see

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
rain so no one not going to see

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.780 
rain so no one not going to see
something<00:02:44.019> really<00:02:44.380> has<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.890> lot<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.250> legs<00:02:45.549> with

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
something really has a lot of legs with

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.670 
something really has a lot of legs with
this<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.239> we<00:02:46.420> are<00:02:46.450> going<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.900> be<00:02:47.019> impacted

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
this and we are going to be impacted

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.680 
this and we are going to be impacted
of<00:02:47.980> course<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.400> monster<00:02:48.940> storm<00:02:48.970> from<00:02:49.569> the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
of course this monster storm from the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.440 
of course this monster storm from the
winds<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.260> historic<00:02:50.830> rain<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.430> snow<00:02:51.730> to

people impacted it has been historic in
nature<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.959> was<00:02:59.049> built<00:02:59.290> as<00:02:59.470> such<00:02:59.709> and<00:02:59.980> it

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
nature it was built as such and it

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.100 
nature it was built as such and it
really<00:03:00.580> has<00:03:00.819> delivered<00:03:01.209> all<00:03:01.720> right<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:01.959> let's

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
really has delivered all right so let's

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.300 
really has delivered all right so let's
take<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.319> look<00:03:02.500> we're<00:03:02.650> talking<00:03:02.920> about<00:03:03.010> San

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
take a look we're talking about San

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.490 
take a look we're talking about San
Francisco<00:03:03.940> right<00:03:04.120> at<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.690> beginning<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.319> the

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
Francisco right at the beginning of the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.830 
Francisco right at the beginning of the
month<00:03:05.680> we<00:03:06.400> were<00:03:06.580> five<00:03:06.910> inches<00:03:07.390> below<00:03:07.660> average

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
month we were five inches below average

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.440 
month we were five inches below average
and<00:03:08.530> now<00:03:08.650> look<00:03:08.890> where<00:03:09.069> we<00:03:09.190> stand<00:03:09.519> just<00:03:10.030> with

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
and now look where we stand just with

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.900 
and now look where we stand just with
this<00:03:10.750> rain<00:03:11.380> we've<00:03:11.980> seen<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.430> last<00:03:12.610> few

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
this rain we've seen in the last few

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.940 
this rain we've seen in the last few
weeks<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.390> last<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.720> course<00:03:13.959> four<00:03:14.530> days<00:03:14.739> or

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
weeks in the last of course four days or

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.090 
weeks in the last of course four days or
so<00:03:15.160> year-to-date<00:03:15.700> 17<00:03:16.690> point<00:03:16.959> two<00:03:17.170> seven<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.769> get

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
so year-to-date 17 point two seven I get

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.770 
so year-to-date 17 point two seven I get
the<00:03:18.220> beginning<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.700> month<00:03:18.880> five<00:03:19.420> inches

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
the beginning of the month five inches

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.569 
the beginning of the month five inches
less<00:03:20.049> below<00:03:20.530> average<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.040> now<00:03:21.130> look<00:03:21.310> where<00:03:21.430> we

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
less below average and now look where we

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.539 
less below average and now look where we
are<00:03:21.760> certainly<00:03:22.510> much<00:03:22.810> closer<00:03:23.170> so<00:03:23.859> just<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
are certainly much closer so just in the

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:25.740 
are certainly much closer so just in the
few<00:03:24.730> days<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.120> can<00:03:25.150> see<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.480> mean<00:03:25.630> we're

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
few days you can see I mean we're

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.750 
few days you can see I mean we're
talking<00:03:25.900> about<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.320> three<00:03:26.650> year<00:03:26.829> drought<00:03:27.010> but

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
talking about a three year drought but

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.610 
talking about a three year drought but
there<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.180> potential<00:03:28.560> eradicated<00:03:29.560> a

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
there is the potential eradicated a

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.479 
there is the potential eradicated a
little<00:03:29.890> bit<00:03:30.069> Chris

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
little bit Chris

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.970 
little bit Chris
potentially<00:03:31.120> about<00:03:31.299> 20%<00:03:32.109> eradication<00:03:32.829> so

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
potentially about 20% eradication so

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.609 
potentially about 20% eradication so
that's<00:03:33.130> pretty<00:03:33.370> good
