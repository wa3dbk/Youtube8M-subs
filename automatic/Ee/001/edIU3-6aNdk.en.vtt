 hello I'm paco de lupas offices and 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.580
 following the process of how you 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.390
 makes a step-by-step reform now 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:17.530
 I show how we are going to put the 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:21.140
 panels as you see here we have tracked and 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:25.009
 on the trail have these panels 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.990
 here you see how it goes on top of the punished and 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.990
 this we have fastened with girl 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.160
 the whole stay that were already freezing 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.380
 in these 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.380
 in these holes here we are going to put 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.000
 white silicone and the top shot 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.340
 from the wall to the ceiling also 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.360
 let's put white silicone 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:04.200
 now it is shown where he comes 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.200
 the screen here we have the profile 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 and here we are going to put the crystals 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.330
 and the sliding door to separate the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.330
 reception of gas 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.549
 from the waiting room 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.810
 I also show you 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.810
 how will the aluminum frames go? 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.900
 we have in you and they put 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.280
 this is a piece and on this side it's going to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.280
 come the other piece 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.400
 in the next video I show you to him 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.400
 how are the crystals left 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.430
 and we have the crystals and the doors 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.340
 once everything is settled I know how 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.679
 they are left 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.550
 but so you can see the distance a little 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:11.260
 although now it is with everything 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.260
 material and tools 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.880
 if you see 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.550
 another of the steps that is necessary for 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.550
