00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
in this video we're gonna look at a

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.800 
in this video we're gonna look at a
website<00:00:01.800> that's<00:00:02.250> really<00:00:03.000> useful<00:00:03.240> for

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
website that's really useful for

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.539 
website that's really useful for
front-end<00:00:04.200> development<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:05.190> it's<00:00:05.339> called

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
front-end development and it's called

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.740 
front-end development and it's called
can<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:05.819> use<00:00:06.120> com

now obviously CSS html5 and things like
that<00:00:11.400> JavaScript<00:00:12.269> API<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.690> are<00:00:12.900> changing

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
that JavaScript API is are changing

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.269 
that JavaScript API is are changing
rapidly<00:00:14.490> on<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> front<00:00:15.269> end<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.570> development

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
rapidly on the front end of development

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.580 
rapidly on the front end of development
it's<00:00:17.279> quite<00:00:17.970> hard<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.270> keep<00:00:18.449> up<00:00:18.660> with<00:00:18.690> how<00:00:19.529> you

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it's quite hard to keep up with how you

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.040 
it's quite hard to keep up with how you
can<00:00:19.800> support<00:00:20.160> different<00:00:20.550> browsers<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.990> I

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
can support different browsers and can I

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.660 
can support different browsers and can I
use<00:00:22.080> sort<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.590> speaks<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.039> itself<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.609> the

use sort of speaks for itself in the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.179 
use sort of speaks for itself in the
sense<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.269> if<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:25.050> want<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.470> know<00:00:25.650> if<00:00:25.980> you

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
sense that if you want to know if you

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.730 
sense that if you want to know if you
can<00:00:26.400> use<00:00:26.699> something<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:28.050> supported

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
can use something and it be supported

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.859 
can use something and it be supported
fairly<00:00:29.130> widely<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.330> head<00:00:30.510> over<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.779> this

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
fairly widely you can head over to this

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.819 
fairly widely you can head over to this
site<00:00:31.140> type<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.430> CSS<00:00:33.180> selector<00:00:33.780> or<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
site type in the CSS selector or the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.190 
site type in the CSS selector or the
html5<00:00:35.760> feature<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.719> guess<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.079> you're

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
html5 feature I guess that you're

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.740 
html5 feature I guess that you're
looking<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.980> then<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.850> check<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
looking for and then you can check and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.340 
looking for and then you can check and
see<00:00:39.809> if<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.110> need<00:00:40.260> vendor<00:00:40.620> prefixes<00:00:41.309> or

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
see if you need vendor prefixes or

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.830 
see if you need vendor prefixes or
anything<00:00:43.350> else<00:00:43.969> any<00:00:44.969> issues<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.660> these

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
anything else any issues with these

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.319 
anything else any issues with these
things<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.489> example<00:00:48.030> let's

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
things like that so for example let's

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.209 
things like that so for example let's
take<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.600> look<00:00:48.899> at<00:00:49.110> something<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> has<00:00:50.039> been

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
take a look at something that has been

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.310 
take a look at something that has been
supported<00:00:50.760> quite<00:00:51.059> well<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.539> very<00:00:51.600> well<00:00:52.199> in

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
supported quite well or very well in

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.380 
supported quite well or very well in
browsers<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:52.890> quite<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> while<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.059> that's<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
browsers for quite a while and that's a

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.569 
browsers for quite a while and that's a
border<00:00:54.750> radius<00:00:55.100> it's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> border<00:00:56.430> radius

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
border radius it's a border radius

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
border radius it's a border radius
obliviously<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.420> round<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.230> corners

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
obliviously just round out the corners

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.619 
obliviously just round out the corners
of<00:00:58.739> an<00:00:58.829> element<00:00:59.160> with<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> radius<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.600> your

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
of an element with the radius of your

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.250 
of an element with the radius of your
choice<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> at<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> moment<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.570> gives<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
choice so at the moment this gives you a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.730 
choice so at the moment this gives you a
really<00:01:05.040> good<00:01:05.250> view<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.970> how<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.409> use<00:01:07.590> this

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
really good view of how you can use this

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.890 
really good view of how you can use this
across<00:01:08.400> different<00:01:08.700> browsers<00:01:09.180> you'll

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
across different browsers you'll

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
across different browsers you'll
probably<00:01:10.290> already<00:01:10.409> guess<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.920> red<00:01:11.490> means

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
probably already guess that red means

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.570 
probably already guess that red means

highly unlikely then if something isn't

it'll<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.930> fall<00:01:49.110> back<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.590> sharp<00:01:50.430> corners<00:01:50.909> so

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
it'll just fall back to sharp corners so

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.710 
it'll just fall back to sharp corners so
in<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.399> example<00:01:53.579> we<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
in this example we don't see the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
in this example we don't see the
requirement<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.470> any<00:01:55.710> vendor<00:01:56.369> prefixes

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
because there aren't requirements here

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.230 
because there aren't requirements here
if<00:02:00.210> we<00:02:00.450> were<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> look<00:02:00.840> at<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.850> property<00:02:02.850> that

if we were to look at a property that

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.420 
if we were to look at a property that
did<00:02:03.630> require<00:02:04.079> vendor<00:02:04.439> prefixes<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.219> for

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
did require vendor prefixes so for

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.339 
did require vendor prefixes so for
example<00:02:06.409> transform<00:02:08.509> then<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.629> can<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:10.050> here

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
example transform then you can see here

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.660 
example transform then you can see here
that<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.679> little<00:02:11.099> yellow

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
that we have little yellow

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.910 
that we have little yellow
box<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.240> here<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.570> tell<00:02:13.870> us<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.740> it's

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
box is here to tell us that it's

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.210 
box is here to tell us that it's
supported<00:02:15.460> with<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.820> particular<00:02:16.300> prefix<00:02:17.220> if

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
supported with a particular prefix if

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.890 
supported with a particular prefix if
you're<00:02:18.370> not<00:02:18.460> sure<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> vendor<00:02:19.030> prefix<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.690> it's

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
you're not sure a vendor prefix is it's

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.460 
you're not sure a vendor prefix is it's
basically<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:21.390> browsers<00:02:22.390> way<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.750> implementing

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
basically a browsers way of implementing

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.950 
basically a browsers way of implementing
a<00:02:23.530> feature<00:02:23.830> in<00:02:24.250> their<00:02:24.400> own<00:02:24.640> way<00:02:25.000> until<00:02:25.810> it's

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
a feature in their own way until it's

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.610 
a feature in their own way until it's
fully<00:02:26.230> standardized<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.730> at<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:27.940> moment<00:02:28.120> you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
fully standardized so at the moment you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.070 
fully standardized so at the moment you
can<00:02:29.620> see<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:30.210> if<00:02:31.210> we<00:02:31.300> have<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.630> look<00:02:31.840> here

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
can see that if we have a look here

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.840 
can see that if we have a look here
across<00:02:33.600> these<00:02:34.600> these<00:02:35.440> browsers<00:02:35.980> we've<00:02:36.160> got<00:02:36.430> a

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
across these these browsers we've got a

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.710 
across these these browsers we've got a
in<00:02:37.810> Safari<00:02:38.290> up<00:02:39.040> till<00:02:39.430> Safari<00:02:40.090> 8<00:02:40.390> it's

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
in Safari up till Safari 8 it's

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.930 
in Safari up till Safari 8 it's
supported<00:02:41.350> with<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.710> WebKit<00:02:42.190> prefix<00:02:42.700> because

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
supported with a WebKit prefix because

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.190 
supported with a WebKit prefix because
that's<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.300> CSS<00:02:44.080> rendering<00:02:44.320> engine<00:02:45.150> with

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
that's the CSS rendering engine with

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.820 
that's the CSS rendering engine with
let's<00:02:47.200> say<00:02:47.440> for<00:02:47.680> example<00:02:48.630> Microsoft<00:02:49.630> in<00:02:50.230> IE<00:02:50.380> 9

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
let's say for example Microsoft in IE 9

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.580 
let's say for example Microsoft in IE 9
this<00:02:51.790> was<00:02:52.030> supported<00:02:52.360> with<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.670> MS<00:02:54.670> prefix<00:02:55.590> so

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
this was supported with the MS prefix so

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.590 
this was supported with the MS prefix so
really<00:02:56.950> it's<00:02:57.190> up<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.550> you<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.910> decide<00:02:58.270> if

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
really it's up to you to decide if

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.500 
really it's up to you to decide if
you're<00:02:59.170> supporting<00:02:59.530> back<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.130> IE<00:03:00.310> 9<00:03:00.670> which<00:03:01.120> is

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
you're supporting back to IE 9 which is

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.330 
you're supporting back to IE 9 which is
probably<00:03:01.960> a<00:03:02.050> good<00:03:02.200> idea<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:04.210> might<00:03:04.840> want<00:03:05.110> to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
probably a good idea you might want to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.330 
probably a good idea you might want to
continue<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.520> use<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.970> MS<00:03:07.360> prefix<00:03:08.020> until<00:03:08.950> say

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
continue to use the MS prefix until say

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.850 
continue to use the MS prefix until say
you<00:03:10.150> know<00:03:10.300> people<00:03:10.600> drop<00:03:10.900> off<00:03:11.080> support<00:03:11.560> for<00:03:11.740> IE

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
you know people drop off support for IE

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.180 
you know people drop off support for IE
9<00:03:12.160> or<00:03:12.430> stop<00:03:12.880> using<00:03:13.060> IE<00:03:13.360> 9<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:14.800> same<00:03:15.040> with

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
9 or stop using IE 9 the same with

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.890 
9 or stop using IE 9 the same with
Chrome<00:03:15.520> as<00:03:15.700> well<00:03:15.730> if<00:03:16.030> for<00:03:16.270> some<00:03:16.300> reason

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
Chrome as well if for some reason

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.780 
Chrome as well if for some reason
someone<00:03:17.320> doesn't<00:03:17.800> have<00:03:17.830> auto<00:03:18.070> update<00:03:18.610> and

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
someone doesn't have auto update and

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.699 
someone doesn't have auto update and
then<00:03:18.880> not<00:03:19.090> on<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.270> higher<00:03:19.989> version<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.440> Chrome

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
then not on a higher version of Chrome

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.260 
then not on a higher version of Chrome
then<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.470> prefix<00:03:24.220> will<00:03:24.400> still<00:03:24.640> be<00:03:24.760> supported

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
then the prefix will still be supported

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.860 
then the prefix will still be supported
back<00:03:25.420> here

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
back here

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.590 
back here
I'm<00:03:26.650> with<00:03:26.830> Safari<00:03:27.270> obviously<00:03:28.270> up<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.420> the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
I'm with Safari obviously up to the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.290 
I'm with Safari obviously up to the
current<00:03:28.840> version<00:03:29.370> we're<00:03:30.370> still<00:03:30.640> looking<00:03:31.030> at

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
current version we're still looking at

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.740 
current version we're still looking at
the<00:03:32.370> requirement<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.520> have<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:34.000> WebKit

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
the requirement to have the WebKit

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.800 
the requirement to have the WebKit
prefix<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.709> by<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.130> way<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.570> row<00:03:37.570> along

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
prefix and by the way this row along

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.449 
prefix and by the way this row along
here<00:03:38.110> which<00:03:38.230> has<00:03:38.380> a<00:03:38.410> darker<00:03:38.830> background<00:03:38.950> is

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
here which has a darker background is

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.970 
here which has a darker background is
the<00:03:39.760> current<00:03:40.239> version<00:03:40.420> out<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:41.350> browser

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
the current version out of browser

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.000 
the current version out of browser
versions<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:43.630> again<00:03:43.840> this<00:03:43.959> isn't<00:03:44.140> supports<00:03:44.920> in

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
versions so again this isn't supports in

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.190 
versions so again this isn't supports in
Opera<00:03:45.370> Mini<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:46.209> really<00:03:46.450> it's<00:03:46.570> about<00:03:46.630> judging

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
Opera Mini so really it's about judging

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.580 
Opera Mini so really it's about judging
if<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:49.030> know<00:03:49.150> really<00:03:49.360> need<00:03:49.690> features<00:03:50.410> and

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
if you you know really need features and

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.870 
if you you know really need features and
that's<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:51.010> whole<00:03:51.160> point<00:03:51.340> of<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.520> website

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
that's the whole point of the website

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.199 
that's the whole point of the website
can<00:03:52.150> I<00:03:52.300> use<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:53.680> we've<00:03:53.800> also<00:03:53.950> got<00:03:54.250> things<00:03:54.520> well

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
can I use now we've also got things well

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.340 
can I use now we've also got things well
this<00:03:55.390> gives<00:03:55.540> us<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.810> lot<00:03:55.989> more<00:03:56.110> information

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
this gives us a lot more information

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.130 
this gives us a lot more information
here<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.130> this<00:03:57.580> of<00:03:57.760> related<00:03:58.270> things<00:03:58.959> to

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
here and this of related things to

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.880 
here and this of related things to
transform<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.310> 3d<00:04:00.730> transforms<00:04:01.510> SVG<00:04:02.290> effects

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
transform so 3d transforms SVG effects

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.160 
transform so 3d transforms SVG effects
as<00:04:03.070> well<00:04:03.270> but<00:04:04.270> we<00:04:04.360> also<00:04:04.480> get<00:04:04.720> this<00:04:04.840> these

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
as well but we also get this these

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.640 
as well but we also get this these
little<00:04:05.320> tabs<00:04:05.709> like<00:04:05.980> known<00:04:06.459> as<00:04:06.670> shoes<00:04:06.940> as<00:04:07.180> well

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
little tabs like known as shoes as well

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.160 
little tabs like known as shoes as well
so<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:09.010> can<00:04:09.190> look<00:04:09.340> through<00:04:09.400> these<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.850> decide

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
so you can look through these and decide

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.479 
so you can look through these and decide
whether<00:04:11.170> these<00:04:11.680> issues<00:04:12.070> are<00:04:12.190> going<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.370> be<00:04:12.459> a

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
whether these issues are going to be a

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.250 
whether these issues are going to be a
problem<00:04:12.700> for<00:04:12.820> you<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.630> we've<00:04:13.840> also<00:04:13.989> got

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
problem for you and we've also got
