00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
compare it to the Mantis so here we go

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.450 
compare it to the Mantis so here we go
it<00:00:12.630> weighs<00:00:12.840> more<00:00:13.170> than<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.380> mantis<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.860> probably

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
it weighs more than a mantis it probably

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.919 
it weighs more than a mantis it probably
weighs<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.639> par<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> widow<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.809> one

weighs on par with the widow it is one

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.630 
weighs on par with the widow it is one
of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> heaviest<00:00:16.320> weapons<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> game<00:00:16.949> just

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
of the heaviest weapons in the game just

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.029 
of the heaviest weapons in the game just
like<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.180> Claymore<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:19.320> has<00:00:19.680> about<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.949> same

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
like the Claymore it has about the same

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.429 
like the Claymore it has about the same
capacity<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.760> Mantis<00:00:21.180> same<00:00:21.750> fire<00:00:22.020> rate<00:00:22.260> it

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
capacity as the Mantis same fire rate it

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.140 
capacity as the Mantis same fire rate it
does<00:00:22.769> slightly<00:00:23.160> more<00:00:23.310> damage<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.029> has

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
does slightly more damage and it has

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.060 
does slightly more damage and it has
about<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.420> same<00:00:24.539> accuracy<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.830> there<00:00:25.949> are

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
about the same accuracy but there are

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.570 
about the same accuracy but there are
some<00:00:26.279> unique<00:00:26.640> aspects<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.750> weapon<00:00:28.580> which

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
some unique aspects to this weapon which

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.510 
some unique aspects to this weapon which
set<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.849> apart<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:31.019> thing<00:00:31.050> its<00:00:31.470> scope<00:00:31.679> its

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
set it apart for one thing its scope its

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.790 
set it apart for one thing its scope its
scope<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.090> totally<00:00:33.750> different<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.230> actually

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
scope is totally different I actually

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
scope is totally different I actually
personally<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:35.550> dislike<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.360> is

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
personally really dislike it it just is

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.209 
personally really dislike it it just is
extreme<00:00:37.200> tunnel<00:00:37.500> vision<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.920> me<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.129> it's

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
extreme tunnel vision for me and it's

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.600 
extreme tunnel vision for me and it's
just<00:00:38.340> very<00:00:38.550> distracting<00:00:39.710> personally<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
just very distracting personally but to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.810 
just very distracting personally but to
each<00:00:41.700> their<00:00:41.730> own<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.360> dot<00:00:42.629> scope

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
each their own so it's a dot scope

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.029 
each their own so it's a dot scope
beyond<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.600> has<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.500> bit<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.800> railgun

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
beyond that it has a bit of a railgun

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.490 
beyond that it has a bit of a railgun
effect<00:00:48.469> it<00:00:49.469> shoots<00:00:50.340> out<00:00:50.550> let's<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:52.320> see<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
effect it shoots out let's just see the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.189 
effect it shoots out let's just see the
projectile<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.190> shoots<00:00:53.789> out<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.270> ray<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> light

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
projectile it shoots out a ray of light

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.490 
projectile it shoots out a ray of light
I<00:00:55.230> believe<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:56.969> saw<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.420> energy<00:00:58.109> like

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I believe as you just saw of energy like

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.670 
I believe as you just saw of energy like
other<00:00:58.710> death<00:00:58.980> weapons<00:00:59.370> pulse<00:00:59.670> weapons<00:01:03.680> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
other death weapons pulse weapons it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.640 
other death weapons pulse weapons it
also<00:01:04.799> has<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> similar<00:01:05.630> reload<00:01:06.630> time<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
also has a similar reload time to the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.960 
also has a similar reload time to the
Mantis<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> other<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.490> shot<00:01:08.729> sniper

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
Mantis and the other one shot sniper

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.030 
Mantis and the other one shot sniper
rifles<00:01:09.420> beyond<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.770> an<00:01:10.890> actual

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
rifles beyond that if you have an actual

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.670 
rifles beyond that if you have an actual
opponent<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.630> don't<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.439> see

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
opponent and I don't think you can see

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.359 
opponent and I don't think you can see
here<00:01:16.189> no<00:01:17.420> opponents<00:01:18.420> are<00:01:19.220> highlighted<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
here no opponents are highlighted in a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.789 
here no opponents are highlighted in a
purplish<00:01:21.060> glow<00:01:21.390> by<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.049> weapon<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.590> can

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
purplish glow by this weapon so you can

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.130 
purplish glow by this weapon so you can
see<00:01:23.009> them<00:01:23.220> through<00:01:23.460> cover<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.689> example

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
see them through cover for example

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.200 
see them through cover for example
similar<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.310> mod<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.759> lets<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> see

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
similar to the mod that lets you see

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.780 
similar to the mod that lets you see
through<00:01:27.240> smoke<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.369> I'm<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:29.759> sure

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
through smoke it also and I'm not sure

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.249 
through smoke it also and I'm not sure
about<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.869> been<00:01:31.049> able<00:01:31.140> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
about this I have not been able to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.660 
about this I have not been able to
independently<00:01:31.500> confirm<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.640> been

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
independently confirm it but I have been

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.600 
independently confirm it but I have been
told<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.630> again<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.380> sure<00:01:34.490> can't<00:01:35.490> really

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
told this so again not sure can't really

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.850 
told this so again not sure can't really
confirm<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.049> hit<00:01:37.350> enemies

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
confirm here but you can hit enemies

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.980 
confirm here but you can hit enemies
through<00:01:38.280> cover<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.030> weapon<00:01:39.180> at<00:01:39.450> least

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
through cover with this weapon at least

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.109 
through cover with this weapon at least
to<00:01:40.259> an<00:01:40.380> extent<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.250> kind<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.759> has<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
to an extent so it kind of has the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
to an extent so it kind of has the
piercing<00:01:42.630> mod<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.229> allows<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
piercing mod that allows you to do a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.530 
piercing mod that allows you to do a
small<00:01:44.640> amount<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.939> damage<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.299> enemies

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
small amount of damage to enemies

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.289 
small amount of damage to enemies
through<00:01:45.720> cover<00:01:45.930> or<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> varying<00:01:46.950> amount

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
through cover or just a varying amount

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.520 
through cover or just a varying amount
built-in<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.720> has<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> couple<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.320> mods

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
built-in so it has a couple of mods

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.319 
built-in so it has a couple of mods
essentially<00:01:50.100> built<00:01:50.310> into<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.030> alone

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
essentially built into it so that alone

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.600 
essentially built into it so that alone
does<00:01:51.630> set<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.899> apart<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.829> let's<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.310> how

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
does set it apart but let's see how

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.789 
does set it apart but let's see how
accurate<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.180> without<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> scope<00:01:55.590> at

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
accurate it is without the scope at

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.249 
accurate it is without the scope at
short<00:01:56.159> range<00:01:56.310> let's<00:01:56.670> reset<00:01:57.030> our<00:01:57.119> targets<00:01:57.509> oh

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.389 

and<00:02:01.259> something<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.740> totally<00:02:02.040> forgot<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and something I totally forgot to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.310 
and something I totally forgot to
mention<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.149> weapon<00:02:03.479> has<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.689> brief<00:02:03.990> period

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
mention this weapon has a brief period

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.789 
mention this weapon has a brief period
before<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.860> fires<00:02:05.659> that<00:02:06.659> sound<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.259> it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
before it fires that sound is it

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.350 
before it fires that sound is it
preparing<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> fire<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.879> don't<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.209> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
preparing to fire so you don't have to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.619 
preparing to fire so you don't have to
commit<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> shot<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.979> oh<00:02:11.250> oh<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.239> wanted

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
commit to a shot you can oh oh I wanted

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.190 
commit to a shot you can oh oh I wanted
to<00:02:12.690> actually<00:02:12.840> can

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
to actually can

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.130 
to actually can
so<00:02:13.290> say<00:02:13.920> your<00:02:14.400> enemy<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.700> going<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.910> move<00:02:15.140> so

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
so say your enemy is going to move so

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.559 
so say your enemy is going to move so
you<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.470> don't<00:02:16.830> fire<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.670> likewise<00:02:18.300> you

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
you just don't fire but likewise you

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.330 
you just don't fire but likewise you
need<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.780> actually<00:02:18.959> prepare<00:02:19.290> for<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.069> delay

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
need to actually prepare for the delay

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.830 
need to actually prepare for the delay
before<00:02:20.580> firing<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.269> not<00:02:21.390> only<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.629> have<00:02:21.750> to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
before firing so not only you have to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.540 
before firing so not only you have to
lead<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.650> have<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.830> compensate<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.519> that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
lead but you have to compensate for that

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.600 
lead but you have to compensate for that
delay<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.650> makes<00:02:25.830> quickscoping<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.430> little

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
delay so it makes quickscoping a little

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.979 
delay so it makes quickscoping a little
more<00:02:26.760> difficult<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.660> something<00:02:27.750> to

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
more difficult it's just something to

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.050 
more difficult it's just something to
get<00:02:28.080> used<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.440> personally<00:02:29.160> despise<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.970> I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
get used to I personally despise it I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.059 
get used to I personally despise it I
really<00:02:30.269> do<00:02:30.420> not<00:02:30.540> want<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.900> deal<00:02:31.140> with<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.500> but

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
really do not want to deal with that but

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.559 
really do not want to deal with that but
again<00:02:32.310> your<00:02:32.459> mileage<00:02:32.760> may<00:02:32.790> vary<00:02:32.970> i'm<00:02:33.360> sure

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
again your mileage may vary i'm sure

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.059 
again your mileage may vary i'm sure
this<00:02:33.720> weapon<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.080> extremely<00:02:34.530> popular<00:02:34.709> with<00:02:34.950> a

this weapon is extremely popular with a

this weapon is extremely popular with a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
own if you enjoy the weapon more power

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.530 
own if you enjoy the weapon more power
to<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.480> but<00:02:39.989> now<00:02:40.200> let<00:02:40.680> us<00:02:40.799> test<00:02:41.130> it's<00:02:41.489> no<00:02:42.299> smoke

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
to you but now let us test it's no smoke

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.300 
to you but now let us test it's no smoke
ape<00:02:42.720> abilities<00:02:43.140> at<00:02:43.319> short<00:02:43.590> range<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:50.220> it

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
ape abilities at short range so it

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.289 
ape abilities at short range so it
certainly<00:02:50.400> doesn't<00:02:50.640> have<00:02:50.790> perfect<00:02:51.060> accuracy

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
certainly doesn't have perfect accuracy

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.280 
certainly doesn't have perfect accuracy
it<00:02:51.690> does<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.049> bit<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.290> spread<00:02:54.170> seems<00:02:55.170> to

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
it does have a bit of a spread seems to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.870 
it does have a bit of a spread seems to
go<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.829> right<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> bit<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.459> don't<00:02:56.730> know<00:02:56.819> if

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
go to the right a bit I don't know if

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.100 
go to the right a bit I don't know if
that's<00:02:57.000> consistent<00:02:57.450> though<00:02:57.540> let's<00:02:57.780> see<00:02:57.959> how

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that's consistent though let's see how

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.150 
that's consistent though let's see how
it<00:02:58.230> goes<00:02:58.410> at<00:02:58.620> mid-range<00:03:03.650> gotta<00:03:04.650> love<00:03:04.829> testing

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
it goes at mid-range gotta love testing

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.520 
it goes at mid-range gotta love testing
these<00:03:05.250> one<00:03:05.519> shots<00:03:06.110> everything<00:03:07.110> needs<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.380> take

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
these one shots everything needs to take

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.229 
these one shots everything needs to take
a<00:03:07.560> while<00:03:07.860> even<00:03:08.610> reloading<00:03:10.489> so<00:03:11.489> again<00:03:11.730> very

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
a while even reloading so again very

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.839 
a while even reloading so again very
poor<00:03:12.810> spread<00:03:13.260> even<00:03:13.620> at<00:03:13.709> medium<00:03:14.160> range<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.610> fact

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
poor spread even at medium range in fact

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.840 
poor spread even at medium range in fact
it's<00:03:15.090> nearly<00:03:15.930> completely<00:03:16.650> ineffective<00:03:17.010> let's

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
it's nearly completely ineffective let's

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.900 
it's nearly completely ineffective let's
see<00:03:18.120> if<00:03:18.359> that<00:03:18.569> was<00:03:18.750> more<00:03:18.959> luck<00:03:19.200> than<00:03:19.230> anything

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
see if that was more luck than anything

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.910 
see if that was more luck than anything
but<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.090> alone<00:03:21.389> proves<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.840> no<00:03:22.500> scoping

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
but that alone proves that no scoping

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.250 
but that alone proves that no scoping
and<00:03:23.069> medium<00:03:23.340> range<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> gamble<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:27.260> already

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
and medium range is a gamble I already

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.190 
and medium range is a gamble I already
told<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.680> was<00:03:28.829> much<00:03:29.010> better<00:03:29.190> as<00:03:29.459> was<00:03:30.359> that

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.330 

bring<00:03:34.200> them<00:03:34.319> in<00:03:36.470> I'm<00:03:37.470> having<00:03:37.829> trouble<00:03:38.040> even

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
bring them in I'm having trouble even

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.210 
bring them in I'm having trouble even
seeing<00:03:38.819> here<00:03:39.750> we<00:03:39.840> go<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.170> we<00:03:40.290> hit<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.530> head<00:03:40.709> we

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
seeing here we go so we hit the head we

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.770 
seeing here we go so we hit the head we
did<00:03:41.340> hit<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.489> torso<00:03:41.970> but<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.630> basically

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
did hit the torso but that basically

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.960 
did hit the torso but that basically
just<00:03:43.170> proves<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.769> is<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.280> total<00:03:44.730> gamble

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
just proves that this is a total gamble

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.050 
just proves that this is a total gamble
for<00:03:45.540> no<00:03:45.660> scoping<00:03:45.989> at<00:03:46.109> medium<00:03:46.410> range<00:03:46.910> let's<00:03:47.910> see

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
for no scoping at medium range let's see

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.879 
for no scoping at medium range let's see
if<00:03:48.150> things<00:03:48.359> somehow<00:03:48.630> get<00:03:48.930> better<00:03:49.109> at<00:03:49.380> medium

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
if things somehow get better at medium

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.250 
if things somehow get better at medium
to<00:03:50.040> long<00:03:50.250> range<00:03:50.600> kind<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.690> doubt<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.989> let's<00:03:52.170> see

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260

let's<00:04:59.100> try<00:04:59.250> medium<00:04:59.640> range<00:05:06.170> excellent

was the javelin the geth javelin sniper

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.660 
was the javelin the geth javelin sniper
rifle<00:06:22.420> it<00:06:22.660> is<00:06:23.110> essentially<00:06:23.740> a<00:06:23.770> mantis<00:06:24.280> it<00:06:24.490> is<00:06:24.610> a

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
rifle it is essentially a mantis it is a

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.330 
rifle it is essentially a mantis it is a

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
mantis with some built-in mods it weighs

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.510 
mantis with some built-in mods it weighs
more<00:06:27.790> where's<00:06:28.390> the<00:06:28.570> Mantis<00:06:28.870> it<00:06:29.860> weighs<00:06:30.190> quite

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
more where's the Mantis it weighs quite

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.640 
more where's the Mantis it weighs quite
a<00:06:30.550> bit<00:06:30.700> more<00:06:30.940> same<00:06:31.480> capacity<00:06:31.630> same<00:06:32.200> fire<00:06:32.410> rate

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
a bit more same capacity same fire rate

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.140 
a bit more same capacity same fire rate
a<00:06:32.680> bit<00:06:33.010> more<00:06:33.220> damage<00:06:33.610> and<00:06:33.790> the<00:06:34.690> same<00:06:35.410> accuracy
