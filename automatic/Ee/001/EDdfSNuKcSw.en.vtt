00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.490 
hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:02.639> want<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.030> talk<00:00:03.179> about<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.810> types<00:00:04.140> of

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
segment want to talk about the types of

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.000 
segment want to talk about the types of
iris<00:00:05.040> plants<00:00:05.609> now<00:00:06.270> irises<00:00:06.990> come<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:07.770> many

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
iris plants now irises come in many

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.770 
iris plants now irises come in many
different<00:00:08.130> shapes<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.880> sizes<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.540> fact

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
different shapes and sizes in fact

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.180 
different shapes and sizes in fact
there's<00:00:10.019> more<00:00:10.230> than<00:00:10.730> 1,500<00:00:11.900> varieties<00:00:12.900> of

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
there's more than 1,500 varieties of

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.430 
there's more than 1,500 varieties of
families<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.490> irises<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.870> there's<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.320> many

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
families of irises so there's so many

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.200 
families of irises so there's so many
different<00:00:16.590> types<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.190> viruses<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:17.820> they<00:00:17.970> fall

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
different types of viruses but they fall

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.090 
different types of viruses but they fall
in<00:00:18.359> different<00:00:18.660> categories<00:00:18.949> there's<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
in different categories there's the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.429 
in different categories there's the
irises<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.730> are<00:00:20.820> rhizomes<00:00:21.449> they<00:00:21.779> grow<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
irises that are rhizomes they grow and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.340 
irises that are rhizomes they grow and
like<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> root<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.090> bearded<00:00:24.600> iris<00:00:24.960> follow

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
like a root and so bearded iris follow

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.950 
like a root and so bearded iris follow
that<00:00:25.650> theory<00:00:26.160> they<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> thick<00:00:27.359> root<00:00:27.689> that

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
that theory they have a thick root that

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.720 
that theory they have a thick root that
grows<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.650> almost<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> level<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
grows just almost to the level of the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.429 
grows just almost to the level of the
ground<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.330> then<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.869> beautiful

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
ground and then they have beautiful

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.620 
ground and then they have beautiful
freely<00:00:31.890> flowers<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.820> are<00:00:32.940> gorgeous<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
freely flowers that are gorgeous and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.870 
freely flowers that are gorgeous and
make<00:00:33.960> gorgeous<00:00:34.260> cut<00:00:34.590> flowers<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.550> then

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
make gorgeous cut flowers and then

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.459 
make gorgeous cut flowers and then
there's<00:00:36.030> types<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.390> viruses<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.930> grow<00:00:37.230> from

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
there's types of viruses that grow from

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.190 
there's types of viruses that grow from
a<00:00:37.559> bulb<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.790> Dutch<00:00:39.090> iris<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.989> blooms

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
a bulb like the Dutch iris that blooms

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.440 
a bulb like the Dutch iris that blooms
in<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.440> spring<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> florists<00:00:42.270> use

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
in the spring and you the florists use

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.209 
in the spring and you the florists use
it<00:00:42.629> more<00:00:42.960> often<00:00:43.200> they<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> three

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
it more often they just have the three

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.910 
it more often they just have the three
petals<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.360> Dutch<00:00:45.660> iris<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> little

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
petals the Dutch iris just have a little

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.790 
petals the Dutch iris just have a little
tiny<00:00:47.219> bulb<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> tulip<00:00:48.120> bulb<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> doc<00:00:49.559> I

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
tiny bulb like a tulip bulb so the doc I

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.130 
tiny bulb like a tulip bulb so the doc I
risk<00:00:50.039> um<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> bulb<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> tulip<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
risk um in a bulb just like a tulip and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.080 
risk um in a bulb just like a tulip and
so<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.710> plant<00:00:53.160> them<00:00:53.340> any<00:00:53.550> time<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.000> year

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so you plant them any time of the year

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
so you plant them any time of the year
mostly<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> fall<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.680> they'll

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
mostly in the fall and then they'll

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.729 
mostly in the fall and then they'll
bloom<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.219> April<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.640> May<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> every<00:00:57.239> year<00:00:57.539> and

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
bloom in April and May of every year and

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.130 
bloom in April and May of every year and
so<00:00:58.739> they<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.480> bit<00:01:00.570> larger<00:01:00.750> bulb

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so they have a little bit larger bulb

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.650 
so they have a little bit larger bulb
like<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> tulip<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.879> short<00:01:03.239> tiny

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
like a tulip but then of the short tiny

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.289 
like a tulip but then of the short tiny
irises<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> iris<00:01:05.010> reticulata<00:01:05.299> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
irises like the iris reticulata and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.750 
irises like the iris reticulata and
those<00:01:07.049> bloom<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.470> early<00:01:08.010> spring<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.640> they're

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
those bloom in early spring and they're

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.179 
those bloom in early spring and they're
just<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.060> tiny<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.689> bulb<00:01:10.260> that's<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.040> like

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
just a tiny little bulb that's just like

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.330 
just a tiny little bulb that's just like
a<00:01:11.280> tiny<00:01:11.520> tulip<00:01:12.000> bulb<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
a tiny tulip bulb and then all of the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.630 
a tiny tulip bulb and then all of the
bearded<00:01:15.210> iris<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.409> Dutch<00:01:16.710> iris<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
bearded iris and the Dutch iris and the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.030 
bearded iris and the Dutch iris and the
short<00:01:17.939> iris<00:01:18.270> reticulata<00:01:18.500> need<00:01:19.500> full<00:01:19.770> sound

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
short iris reticulata need full sound

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.249 
short iris reticulata need full sound
with<00:01:20.130> good<00:01:20.310> drainage<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.540> once<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
with good drainage but then once all the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.679 
with good drainage but then once all the
irises<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.009> live<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.340> water<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
irises that can live in water like the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.350 
irises that can live in water like the
Japanese<00:01:25.259> iris<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> Siberian<00:01:26.820> Iris<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
Japanese iris and the Siberian Iris and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.020 
Japanese iris and the Siberian Iris and
the<00:01:27.420> Louisiana<00:01:28.140> irises<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the Louisiana irises they have just a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.480 
the Louisiana irises they have just a
basic<00:01:30.270> root<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.770> plant<00:01:32.040> them<00:01:32.220> right

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
basic root and you just plant them right

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.179 
basic root and you just plant them right
into<00:01:32.759> mucky<00:01:33.479> water<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.110> right<00:01:34.290> into<00:01:34.619> mud<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
into mucky water or right into mud and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.370 
into mucky water or right into mud and
they<00:01:35.579> will<00:01:35.790> grow<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.509> beautiful<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> they

can do son they prefer Sun but they can

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.539 
can do son they prefer Sun but they can
do<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> little<00:01:39.750> bit<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> shade<00:01:40.229> too<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:41.400> what

do a little bit of shade too but what

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.850 
do a little bit of shade too but what
iris<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.299> common<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.049> they're

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
iris have in common is that they're

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.670 
iris have in common is that they're
related<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.610> all<00:01:44.820> other<00:01:45.270> plants<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:46.140> fact<00:01:46.530> by
