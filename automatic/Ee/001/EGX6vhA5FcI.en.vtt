00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
will use this extension it'll create a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.020 
will use this extension it'll create a
much<00:03:30.640> more<00:03:30.780> power<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:32.200> unscrewed<00:03:32.710> and<00:03:32.920> my<00:03:33.760> legs

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
much more power to unscrewed and my legs

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.960 
much more power to unscrewed and my legs
will<00:03:34.270> hold<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.630> stern<00:03:34.960> wall<00:03:35.140> in<00:03:35.350> place<00:03:35.970> and
