right now so if it's not an issue of

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.100 
right now so if it's not an issue of
technology<00:02:43.100> then<00:02:43.430> why<00:02:43.820> don't<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:44.120> do<00:02:44.299> it<00:02:44.330> in

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
technology then why don't we do it in
