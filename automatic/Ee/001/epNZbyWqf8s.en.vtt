00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
be Jason tied to the fact that only

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.550 
be Jason tied to the fact that only
Jason's<00:02:04.030> high<00:02:04.209> desert<00:02:04.899> eagles<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.380> has<00:02:05.530> a

Jason's high desert eagles and has a
crunch<00:02:05.920> out<00:02:06.099> on<00:02:06.220> Batman<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:07.179> would<00:02:07.330> escalate
