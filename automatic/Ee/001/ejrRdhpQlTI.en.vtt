00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
formerly I put all my drill bits all my

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.920 
formerly I put all my drill bits all my
countersinks<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.610> soup<00:00:24.030> cans<00:00:24.360> like<00:00:24.780> my

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
countersinks and soup cans like my

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.710 
countersinks and soup cans like my
paddle<00:00:25.470> bits<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.860> still<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.400> didn't<00:00:27.360> work<00:00:27.570> out

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
paddle bits are still in didn't work out

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.210 
paddle bits are still in didn't work out
great<00:00:28.080> for<00:00:28.289> me<00:00:28.350> one<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.890> things<00:00:28.920> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
great for me one of the things that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
great for me one of the things that
happens<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.730> dust<00:00:30.029> gets<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.510> there<00:00:30.779> gets<00:00:31.350> to<00:00:31.440> be

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
happens is dust gets in there gets to be

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.600 
happens is dust gets in there gets to be
a<00:00:31.650> big<00:00:31.890> mess<00:00:32.390> soon<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.720> found<00:00:34.199> these<00:00:34.830> containers

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
a big mess soon I found these containers

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.920 
a big mess soon I found these containers
at<00:00:35.820> home<00:00:35.970> centers<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.570> these<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.809> really

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
at home centers and these have really

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.889 
at home centers and these have really
worked<00:00:37.559> out<00:00:37.800> well<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.040> me<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.600> sand

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
worked out well for me so on this sand

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.420 
worked out well for me so on this sand
what<00:00:40.079> I've<00:00:40.230> done<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.770> I've<00:00:40.890> taken<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.280> my

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
what I've done is I've taken all my

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.970 
what I've done is I've taken all my
twist<00:00:41.790> bits<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.470> realistically<00:00:43.470> I<00:00:43.590> found

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
twist bits and realistically I found

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.260 
twist bits and realistically I found
that<00:00:44.190> getting<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.579> back<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> drill

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that getting them back and the drill

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.319 
that getting them back and the drill
index<00:00:45.660> didn't<00:00:46.260> work<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.469> me<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.550> instead<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
index didn't work for me so instead I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.870 
index didn't work for me so instead I
organized<00:00:49.050> them<00:00:49.230> by<00:00:49.260> size<00:00:49.590> I've<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.430> this

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
organized them by size I've got in this

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.910 
organized them by size I've got in this
one<00:00:51.090> three<00:00:51.480> eights<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.870> bigger<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
one three eights and bigger and then you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.680 
one three eights and bigger and then you
can<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.579> work<00:00:53.610> my<00:00:53.969> way<00:00:54.000> down<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.510> line

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
can see as I work my way down the line

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.260 
can see as I work my way down the line
I've<00:00:54.989> got<00:00:55.200> spans<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.980> sizes<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:56.969> all<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
I've got spans of sizes going all the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.840 
I've got spans of sizes going all the
way<00:00:57.360> down<00:00:57.540> to<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> tiny<00:00:58.590> needle<00:00:59.070> size<00:00:59.520> bits

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
way down to the tiny needle size bits

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.200 
way down to the tiny needle size bits
that<00:01:00.059> are<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.200> other<00:01:01.410> containers

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210

counter<00:01:07.830> sinks<00:01:08.399> and<00:01:08.840> self<00:01:09.840> centering<00:01:10.259> bits<00:01:10.560> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
counter sinks and self centering bits so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
counter sinks and self centering bits so
I've<00:01:11.399> taken<00:01:11.670> most<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.300> my<00:01:12.420> drilling<00:01:12.810> supplies

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
I've taken most of my drilling supplies

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.199 
I've taken most of my drilling supplies
got<00:01:14.009> them<00:01:14.160> organized<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.819> these<00:01:14.910> different

00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:15.209 
got them organized in these different

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.999 
got them organized in these different
containers<00:01:15.929> now<00:01:16.410> I<00:01:16.440> know<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.770> you're<00:01:16.920> going

containers now I know what you're going

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.370 
containers now I know what you're going
to<00:01:17.069> say<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.550> how<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.209> you<00:01:18.330> know<00:01:18.539> when<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> need

to say is how do you know when you need
a<00:01:19.440> drill<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.729> size<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.240> gonna<00:01:21.330> get

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
a drill bit what size you're gonna get

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.900 
a drill bit what size you're gonna get
and<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.319> solve<00:01:22.649> that<00:01:22.770> problem<00:01:23.369> by<00:01:23.490> using<00:01:23.550> my

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
and I solve that problem by using my

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.820 
and I solve that problem by using my
digital<00:01:24.330> calipers<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:25.440> I'm<00:01:25.530> looking

digital calipers that's what I'm looking

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.010 
digital calipers that's what I'm looking
for<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.069> specific<00:01:26.300> specific<00:01:27.300> size<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> drill<00:01:27.840> bit

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
for a specific specific size a drill bit

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.559 
for a specific specific size a drill bit
I<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.590> pull<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.069> out<00:01:29.160> measure<00:01:30.149> it<00:01:30.330> with<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
I can pull it out measure it with the

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.660 
I can pull it out measure it with the
calipers<00:01:31.080> see<00:01:31.709> exactly<00:01:32.069> what<00:01:32.340> I've<00:01:32.459> got

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
calipers see exactly what I've got

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.699 
calipers see exactly what I've got
narrow<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.509> down<00:01:33.569> until<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.349> the<00:01:34.470> drill

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
narrow that down until I have the drill
