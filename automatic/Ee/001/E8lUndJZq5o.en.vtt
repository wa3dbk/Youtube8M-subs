00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.579
 coming with a new video because at first I did not know what to wear and 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.600
 that I decided to read a bit of Naruto's manga in 467 to be holy 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.050
 do not worry this first part does not count facts on an annual basis but rather 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.590
 I really did not expect this from autonomy 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.690
 because the story pretends much more than what my 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.840
 I'm afraid they bring something monotonous like what the Balearic author is doing 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.280
 before continuing we remember that what impressed us naruto remember the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.340
 Chronicles of the child hurricane will serve not to forget the essence of a student 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.390
 that was changing through time to what we see today 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.640
 eye this if it comes with spoll read a lot that I 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.479
 in my case what impressed me was the human side of the characters in the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.880
 series 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.160
 this title came to shake us leaving a message in each room 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.460
 let's say as an example the first maul of the series is abused until it could 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.420
 call it old because even though it worked for a cat it did not hesitate to attack and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.910
 kill another bad guy in the saga 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.820
 no doubt the part I did not expect was when it was abused he started crying in 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.310
 that Naruto bridge also cried 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.130
 a little more ica almost also cried 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.139
 hahaha xd leaving that saga and starting another 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.530
 we have the sublime exams 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.160
 the saga that would launch to the success in the world 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.780
 and it is also behind other fighting that's why the resemblance to such goals 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.660
 time because this part of the story was the one that had the most topics but despite 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.470
 that would be impressive 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.340
 the parties that most impress may be the fights parties 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.359
 since it had more prominence and the entrance of the stadium morelos and March 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:09.809
 sources of the ce 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:11.069
 and of course 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.110
 the past of each lost island of a character is important 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.189
 if I would end this saga 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.680
 then followed two pages where the organization of akatsuki appeared 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.319
 the fifth cancer 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.120
 these words were clear as a faithful reflection of the characters installed 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.599
 no longer 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.059
 finally to your powerful been one of my visits 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.549
 these were the particular tasks of groups 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.040
 the last series of the first part of naruto 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.230
 it was the most similar to the exams without it could have been a wonder if not 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.670
 were that he did not stop thinking what was a blatant copy of the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.290
 zodiac knights in the 12 houses the copy was very obvious but he achieved his 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.579
 committed to solve 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.729
 the characters of a lever so that not everything depends on them 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.239
 for the whole day 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.459
 everything is very confusing the fall of quality of profit motive 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:10.099
 if we skip the problem there we start with naruto shippuden we see a 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.249
 great change said while he was absent from naruto 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.859
 the animation is like something rigid because of the many chapters that 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.999
 they require autonomy for five chapters to be run it felt like they did not 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.019
 nothing will advance in history 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.209
 It was very slow and there have not been many high quality series that would overshadow 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.450
 naruto and that his rivals react and is that they managed to continue 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.449
 improving besides that they did not decide to start from scratch 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:39.759
 causing worse animations if we remember some chapters to 10 in the 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:43.999
 contest also comparing with what it was before and converting the first saga 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.559
 of chipude nen lamas forcedly elongated 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.749
 with only a special effects chapter 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:51.799
 in this time it takes quality 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.989
 maybe the studio directors of the corporate chipude series do away with the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.669
 culture and what better way than to kill naruto promoting the 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.659
 first naruto shippuden movie curiously titled the death of the 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:04.789
 actor 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:08.859
 the movie raised enough to continue with the lines mentioned 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.899
 great disappointment that they will have taken to see the movie but achieved its purpose 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:16.129
 it's shattered 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:17.719
 other attendees 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:20.820
 it would be from the castle josé marún this shoe store 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.639
 everything to succeed but it would not happen if it does not come 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.639
 but for its opening that day 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.570
 that had nothing to do with the essence of the matter and with those I swear that 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.820
 The environment was no longer an issue that we all knew 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.789
 maybe this 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.430
 mainar although it would be the first relief of the year 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.330
 they gave us the directors of areas in their rooms scuba gesta j sevilla
