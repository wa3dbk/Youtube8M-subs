little alarm clock obviously that
belongs<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.070> my<00:00:11.250> mother<00:00:12.410> she<00:00:13.410> says<00:00:13.650> it's

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
belongs to my mother she says it's

running<00:00:14.280> fast<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:15.030> an<00:00:15.809> extremely<00:00:16.320> fast<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.100> was

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
running fast is an extremely fast I was

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.010 
running fast is an extremely fast I was
going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> throw<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.910> away<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.449> said<00:00:18.810> well<00:00:18.990> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
going to throw it away I said well I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
going to throw it away I said well I
mean<00:00:19.230> look<00:00:19.529> at<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.859> first<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:22.670> suspect<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.850> has<00:00:24.029> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
mean look at it first I suspect it has a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.540 
mean look at it first I suspect it has a
bad<00:00:24.660> capacitor<00:00:25.470> inside<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:28.400> don't<00:00:29.400> know

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
bad capacitor inside of it I don't know

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.220 
bad capacitor inside of it I don't know
if<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> camera<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.269> picking<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.080> you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
if the camera is picking it up but you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.470 
if the camera is picking it up but you
can<00:00:31.380> hear<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.590> making<00:00:32.070> an<00:00:32.189> internal<00:00:33.000> buzzing

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
can hear it making an internal buzzing

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.080 
can hear it making an internal buzzing
sound<00:00:33.809> which<00:00:34.280> leads<00:00:35.280> me<00:00:35.460> more<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.790> believe

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
sound which leads me more to believe

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.819 
sound which leads me more to believe
that<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> has<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> bad<00:00:36.930> capacitor<00:00:39.649> let's<00:00:40.649> look

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that it has a bad capacitor let's look

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.670 
that it has a bad capacitor let's look
at<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> label<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.579> bottom<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:54.139 

made<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:47.039> China<00:00:47.719> what<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.899> expect<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
made in China what do you expect and you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
made in China what do you expect and you
can<00:00:54.270> see<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.870> label<00:00:55.770> reads<00:00:55.980> they<00:00:56.399> are

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
can see what the label reads they are

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.549 
can see what the label reads they are
okay<00:00:56.850> let's<00:00:57.120> open<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.050> see<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.440> it's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
okay let's open this up and see if it's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.069 
okay let's open this up and see if it's
actually<00:00:58.770> fixable<00:00:59.489> or<00:00:59.879> or<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> something

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
actually fixable or or is it something

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.470 
actually fixable or or is it something
we're<00:01:01.320> going<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> throw<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.789> are<00:01:02.969> all

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
we're going to throw here we are all

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.660 
we're going to throw here we are all
taken<00:01:03.960> apart<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> process<00:01:05.430> of

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
taken apart and I'm in the process of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.429 
taken apart and I'm in the process of
removing<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.360> blue<00:01:06.630> electrolytic

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
removing this blue electrolytic

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.370 
removing this blue electrolytic
capacitor<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.400> suspect<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.180> defective<00:01:09.960> if

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
capacitor that I suspect is defective if

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.480 
capacitor that I suspect is defective if
it's<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:12.170> probably<00:01:13.170> mean<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.619> AOL<00:01:14.280> for

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
it's not then probably mean the AOL for

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.300 
it's not then probably mean the AOL for
this<00:01:14.790> clock<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> cap<00:01:16.590> maybe

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
this clock but if it's the cap maybe

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100 
this clock but if it's the cap maybe
we'll<00:01:17.490> get<00:01:17.670> lucky<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.150> squeeze<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> few<00:01:18.930> more

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
we'll get lucky and squeeze a few more

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.140 
we'll get lucky and squeeze a few more
years<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> there<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.790> head<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
years out of there in the head of the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.359 
years out of there in the head of the
capacitor<00:01:21.810> connected<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> our<00:01:22.650> meter<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.280> as

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
capacitor connected to our meter and as

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.280 
capacitor connected to our meter and as
you<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.610> tell<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.150> definitely<00:01:24.689> bad<00:01:24.900> it's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
you can tell it's definitely bad it's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.740 
you can tell it's definitely bad it's
supposed<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> 220<00:01:26.640> micro<00:01:27.030> farad<00:01:27.450> it's

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
supposed to be a 220 micro farad it's

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.510 
supposed to be a 220 micro farad it's
reading<00:01:28.170> only<00:01:28.979> 75<00:01:29.820> micro<00:01:30.420> farad<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.340> it's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
reading only 75 micro farad so now it's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
reading only 75 micro farad so now it's
time<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.790> look<00:01:33.479> through<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:33.810> junk<00:01:33.869> box<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
time to look through my junk box and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.760 
time to look through my junk box and
find<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.100> capacitor<00:01:35.990> well<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> looks<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.409> this

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
find a capacitor well it looks like this

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.249 
find a capacitor well it looks like this
electrolytic<00:01:38.490> capacitor<00:01:39.119> was<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> problem<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
electrolytic capacitor was the problem I

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.100 
electrolytic capacitor was the problem I
replaced<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.130> 220<00:01:41.790> micro<00:01:42.329> farad<00:01:42.600> cap

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
replaced it with a 220 micro farad cap

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.190 
replaced it with a 220 micro farad cap
from<00:01:43.320> my<00:01:43.530> junk<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:45.149> clock<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:45.689> seems<00:01:46.079> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
from my junk and the clock now seems to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.530 
from my junk and the clock now seems to
be<00:01:46.290> keeping<00:01:46.770> good<00:01:47.189> time<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.210> making

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
be keeping good time and it's not making

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.330 
be keeping good time and it's not making
a<00:01:48.840> internal<00:01:49.829> buzzing<00:01:50.340> sound<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> yup<00:01:52.829> yeah

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
a internal buzzing sound so yup yeah

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520 
a internal buzzing sound so yup yeah
another<00:01:53.640> piece<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.119> cheap<00:01:54.390> electronics<00:01:55.259> aid

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
another piece of cheap electronics aid

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709 
another piece of cheap electronics aid
from<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.040> land<00:01:56.460> field<00:01:56.820> most<00:01:57.210> people<00:01:57.600> would

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
from the land field most people would

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.100 
from the land field most people would
just<00:01:57.750> thrown<00:01:58.320> something<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.219> away

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
just thrown something like this away

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.139 
just thrown something like this away
since<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.259> probably<00:02:01.710> cost<00:02:01.979> less<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.430> ten

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
since it probably cost less and ten

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.380 
since it probably cost less and ten
bucks<00:02:03.509> whenever<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> was<00:02:04.140> new<00:02:05.000> like<00:02:06.000> my<00:02:06.119> mother

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
bucks whenever it was new like my mother

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.889 
bucks whenever it was new like my mother
was<00:02:06.659> actually<00:02:06.810> going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> throw<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.530> away<00:02:07.619> but

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
was actually going to throw it away but

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.610 
was actually going to throw it away but
so<00:02:09.899> let<00:02:10.080> me<00:02:10.170> take<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.440> look<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.009> first

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
so let me take a look at it first

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.740 
so let me take a look at it first
it<00:02:12.860> appears<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.370> be<00:02:13.519> working<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.209> maybe<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:14.569> can

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
it appears to be working so maybe we can
