ECW<00:01:41.850> guys<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.780> probably<00:01:43.079> not<00:01:43.290> necessary

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
ECW guys it's probably not necessary

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.780 
ECW guys it's probably not necessary
because<00:01:45.240> I'm<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:46.049> running<00:01:46.439> ECW<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.430> this

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
because I'm not running ECW at this

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.670 
because I'm not running ECW at this
moment<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:50.810> for<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> record<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.229> was<00:01:52.380> going

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
moment so I for the record I was going

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.069 
moment so I for the record I was going
to<00:01:52.799> though<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.130> was<00:01:53.520> indeed<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.630> run<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
to though I was indeed going to run the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.149 
to though I was indeed going to run the
ECW<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> ECW<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:58.110> part<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.890> this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
ECW and have the ECW as part of this

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.420 
ECW and have the ECW as part of this
along<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> AWA<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> decided<00:02:01.950> heavily

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
along with the AWA but I decided heavily

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.959 
along with the AWA but I decided heavily
against<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.270> decided<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.079> merge<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:05.250> ECW

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
against it I decided to merge the ECW

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.520 
against it I decided to merge the ECW
with<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.340> WCW<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.410> be

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
with the WCW and so it's going to be

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.260 
with the WCW and so it's going to be
real<00:02:10.770> interesting<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.580> see<00:02:11.790> where<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.060> goes

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
real interesting to see where that goes

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
real interesting to see where that goes
I<00:02:12.629> figured<00:02:13.230> it'd<00:02:13.319> give<00:02:13.440> me<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.620> few<00:02:13.800> x

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
I figured it'd give me a few x

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.640 
I figured it'd give me a few x
put<00:02:15.069> in<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:15.250> NWO<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:17.079> randomly<00:02:17.469> you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
put in the NWO and just randomly you
