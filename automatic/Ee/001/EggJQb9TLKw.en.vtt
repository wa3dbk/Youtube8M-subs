 rice saint petersburg plane to the eyeballs 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.200
 june around just talk that 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.110
 spaces and night and about the day quadro cyclist 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.360
 And this time in Nikolsky it is in half an hour 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.099
 drive from St. Petersburg to the south meets there 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.520
 Galina Kosheleva Press Secretary 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.410
 events are the longest days of foot frame 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.779
 cycle 100 white night eat everything eaten with 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.779
 people's minds are just not completely complete 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.329
 how not to whim say how can we 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.120
 do not sleep for sight light enlightenment 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.800
 madness and quiet phase again so 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.800
 figuratively can probably be described 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.829
 any race when waiting then an attack 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.750
 blast and finish with comfort go off 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.519
 crazy this year on your professional 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.309
 holiday came from a variety 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.320
 cities more than 160 participants is only 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.120
 athletes after all day quadrocycle 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.829
 it is not only an exhibition festival but also 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.480
 pilot competitions and Kaliningrad 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.999
 Baltmotors teams 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.710
 Sergey Karyakin and Ilya Silent one of 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.690
 main contenders for victory 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.760
 despite the fact that here the first time is not 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.240
 on myself did not pass this holiday because 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.299
 format enough 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.000
 new for us we have never participated 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.009
 there are such formats as ontrack real growth 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.869
 scary rarely held most 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.810
 ATVs getting ready to participate 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.140
 in all disciplines that were 4 course 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.500
 These 1 discipline which opened and the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.299
 no kidneys from 7 to the trial agent figures 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.159
 the most different shapes on skill exactly 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.640
 own a technique in different situations . 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:40.570
 suspension bridge foam roads swing 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.679
 still sandbox logs in general c on 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.020
 skill on agility 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.179
 how best to go through the trial as well 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.799
 all the other tresses kindly agreed 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.100
 on his experience to tell all the same 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.740
 crackin 'and silent real is a discipline 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.250
 on a small space set 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.229
 obstacles artificially created naki 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.950
 This log is created in different ways. 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:06.130
 artificial slides on trial 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.950
 it is very important that the quad bike was 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.810
 balanced in every way noticed 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.760
 Such a mistake is very common 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.950
 dangerous ride down the hill on the brakes 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.790
 that is , you yourself need to overcome your fear 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.250
 and from the hill to go down that live on 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.510
 brake and yes you can also gas up 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.340
 of course it all depends on the length of the mountain 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.160
 short nose from the hills you can go down 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.750
 fast enough but don't click on 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.609
 brake because when you press on 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.890
 brake 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.760
 the whole weight goes forward and the quadric can 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.040
 easy to roll over 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.049
 it should be noted that this is a winner's advice 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.660
 Sergey Karyakin class people on 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.000
 jumbo 700 squares became the best in 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.250
 Trial as well as in the congregation where 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.350
 I yelled and from the team was from motor stim on 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.630
 of the same snow-white jumbo took and 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.640
 first and second places almost immediately 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.190
 after the arrival, free beta was told about 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.620
 of this specificity what is it like to win on 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.720
 rough terrain landing at the pilot 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.430
 should be lower to not 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.000
 overturned in the corners that is what 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.200
 lower center of gravity topic 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.740
 for each race you need to pick up 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.920
 some special custom tire settings 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.330
 some of this comes out that 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.000
 register on different 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.880
 ATVs we tried to show that 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.060
 technique on which language we speak in 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.250
 races it is fit for 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.500
 each of the races and races not 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.870
 ended in line was drag race 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.209
 it would seem and here ATVs 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.010
 Yes, and on the grass but nowhere to go 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:39.070
 intelligence battle drag race 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:42.890
 such discipline in which it would seem 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.350
 only power 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.890
 In fact, this is not so the organizers added 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.530
 zest and besides that you just need 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.720
 from the start you need to leave in 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.430
 the end 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.430
 slow down turn around 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.750
 emotions tried to suppress them 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.870
 however, I could not cope 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:10.780
 At the start, I overtook my opponent by not 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:13.930
 braced and squeezed hands 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.170
 the brake is stronger than necessary and made 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.910
 a coup through myself through the steering wheel and me 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.540
 rolled three times quad bike 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.280
 however the defense saved nothing hurt 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.100
 the only thing that suffered on 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.110
 quad plastic and further raised and 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.300
 continued races continued was on 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.370
 territory traffic spaniards she performed 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.320
 Baltmotors company specifically chose 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.910
 literally the dirtiest track where 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.280
 ATVs can show all their 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.970
 everywhere a valid entity but it is impossible 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.340
 if in secret there is no pilot want 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.650
 more sensible pilot Sergey Karyakin 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.530
 continues to share recipes for success 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.460
 very important when approaching the swamp is not 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.340
 slow down 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.460
 and try to go through this section 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.960
 just due to the inertia of some area 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.600
 a marsh where there is no traction of wheels with the ground 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.210
 you can go through the inertia quad 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.740
 cnet portal itself and get to the place 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.960
 where he can sleep well 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.910
 the wheels go on is always a formula 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.490
 success is preparing to prepare 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.800
 moral to victory 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.590
 do not lose hunger account start this 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.550
 actually when it sounds funny but such 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.979
 going on. 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.569
 racing but don't forget that 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.120
 grandfather is not worth selling them and not only 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.979
 sports fair and festival with all 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.110
 countries dozens of distributors 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.120
 dealers manufacturers tender their 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.039
 products have traditionally been exposed and to 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.569
 Leningrad plant Baltmotors spent 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.300
 official presentation of the new 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:40.250

 commercial director and dmitry at home iv 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.960
 told about the features and 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.210
 perspectives new models she opera 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.610
 kept by deep cooperation 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.759
 russian and taiwan side 2 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.490
 she was born and of our sports 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:14.400
 hobbies in the past year it was the jumbo 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.909
 700 this year is our new car 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.030
 index 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:20.340
 already with the new injection engine more 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.800
 lighter more powerful sportier 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:27.389
 even thinks about getting to them 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:30.070
 it was a team not two riders here a 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:33.120
 maybe 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.440
 still added crew look 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.410
 the sporting future of this model is for sure 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.360
 there will be a new holiday 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.860
 northwest white night two day 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.830
 money quadro cyclist and 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:49.350
 next year to go crazy again 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.350
 do not sleep and win
