00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:11.010
 be the same thing as dvd né 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.410
 and others were the format to formats that have here 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.869
 theresa theresa 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.090
 It's the DVD to bring 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.169
 if you originally grab a DVD 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.210
 and to go and see is what you want to end up finding on the internet on the sites 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.009
 this is what the first guy folks who went there picked up original dvd and passed did 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.769
 directors and works per person was laís south that I 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.120
 click on it I will show the same christmas in the movie connected via partition 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.920
 so what I'm going to use the real battalion 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.900
 very good team up to site worth and eastern 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.170
 can you pick up on my site like I left before 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.170
 the side give to those in it here 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.570
 there what we want we have all the little ones 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.480
 the titles that have the clinic dvd have the three entry has - wines 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.549
 How different will you play the audio? 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.329
 puts snow caption in the car for the options but above all one does not 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.639
 need to be everything 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:04.530
 is performance nano creamy part of weight 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.600
 We want the movie. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.670
 how will I know which suicide decision every state the title title 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.119
 title 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.619
 It is simple not to have the highest value 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.560
 you may notice that the minute-by-minute two minutes or less 73 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.759
 nineteen seconds 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.140
 so I'll get one of two in the hours in kleber hand minutes 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.960
 I already know 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.000
 the number guarantees 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.730
 You already know what to avoid. 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.320
 the one you injured 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.680
 very simple 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 I arrived in this part in the second part here where I start to get the ocde 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.740
 depending on what you want to do, right? 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.570
 for example 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.140
 I want a dubbed movie. It's in Japanese if you see it. 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.790
 different with life different from Japanese dial 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.679
 is Portuguese 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.519
 Of course we want Portuguese and even have a race with these two channels. 

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:48.170
 channels do not have these channels to calculate a hearing 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.090
 the best mold 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.170
 but maybe you have more options depend a lot on the DVD as I said can 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.060
 have eight men here 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.299
 you that I will choose 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.909
 Here I want to be deceived. 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.450
 will do english with subtitles 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.560
 there you want Portuguese and so on 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.490
 so I chose Portuguese 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.840
 if I had written for example that in English defense opted for English there I 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.780
 I came here if I would injure myself to go to the legend 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.720
 also portuguese 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.889
 can even Spanish and Chinese French and so on 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.530
 so every hefty period I do not know if the agenda 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.099
 could opt for double of the collegiate could 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.819
 would be the least would be mine 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.560
 to collect in tijuana but could go from the taste of the person 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.230
 and you also do not see with a simple program and work 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.849
 you can make changes 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.600
 you ashton himself he can see that it is not a going to be difficult 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.989
 then fitch 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.869
 I made the genesis in the agenda 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.259
 It's going to depend on you a lot and you fill me up. 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:38.589
 I did this part here. 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:40.479
 Paulo, sorry. 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.759
 for peace 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.299
 and you can convert it once the format is a discrete one to people who do not like 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.719
 that the graduation is little normal the pope to adapt and to train between 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.159
 computer vision there you can opt for here of course you are in a 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.159
 ideal I still prefer on Christmas to great improvement with the art 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.069
 even because it is not cheap to select swimming to catch a most severe era 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.559
 slightly simão pays baratinha that are very good 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:04.459
 I'm going to next 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.789
 Search by company: 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.839
 this here 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.969
 It's going to take a little bit, it does not depend on the other. 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.489
 here also depends little on the processor and the computer, but 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.459
 also because the program is starting the law or dvd but it is not 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.449
 ready to impede 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.739
 We're only doing the first integral part of recognizing poison to find 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.359
 show the option of the dollar 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.909
 kim wilde 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.729
 Loading a little 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.139
 remembering that this value adapts to any operating system 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.139
 for example took in 2 7 64 bits 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:41.150
 does not matter much 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
 here now savak iparque appears here 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.350
 so here dionei caetano then it's 27 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.679
 where he goes 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:55.019
 voices is change led on ferries 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.539
 Can I change the location? 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.389
 Can I give you a name? 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.510
 panucci proof for me may need to modify in hand and rename 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.320
 it was really a good time with him the choreography saves charges 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.919
 but I also do this more 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.339
 on the nets as bread and then altered rename worship easier right from the 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:12.329
 what do you expect from the time he 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.680
 here it is sometimes bothering here in an extension for example giving 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.699
 problem 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.189
 just choose the brazil you want to save and local work with 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:21.219
 all or want 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.860
 I'm going to next 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.330
 who cares he wants to do what he wants and knows what size you are going 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.979
 put on 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.029
 eighty-seven from the fourth to the sixth place of entitlement to any name 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.660
 if possible 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.009
 I do not know how many riders you think these things like that 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.400
 with the space of knowledge 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.029
 here I advise you to vote no division in the sprint 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.490
 Why not 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.270
 any intention of the people is not to go through a site the subject matters 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.430
 still it's up to you to see a dvd 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.500
 How do I want to know about him? 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.340
 computer may also occupy 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.639
 so I do not respect 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.400
 is good with deck 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.880
 here already much of the taste of the person is the quality of the bear that sent the 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.880
 video linné has several options here and preside 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.219
 due to this date I use it is to dismiss graveyard 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.199
 I like the session stayed for lisboa 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.100
 Can you give us a pen drive? 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.330
 clemer many people download the internet and boot on the pen drive and boot on tv on dvd 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.189
 to watch 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.630
 then listen to your choice of the dike kci you will play on any device 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.580
 only until the oldest buses have Christmas that well it will play 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.400
 so the alcohol tip is because they quit 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.360
 or give it here 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.330
 so I went to Quebec already 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.969
 I'll next 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.159
 ready only the first part setting simple and easy points 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.020
 I give this art the only thing chic or that is an artist I do not really like the 

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:42.379
 program is as follows he will show that she claims the little begins to seem 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:46.399
 a movie he's going to run the movie so little bit by bit maybe 

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.730
 if you are not already so fast it is already a fast program 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.169
 but he is not so fast 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.770
 if I had an option I have not found it yet because it comes 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.080
 they simply say 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.490
 if we did not show up if we lived better because it would involve more 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.999
 fast right 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.349
 but they could already be going through a movie 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.830
 double said that the exchange in the region he would show né the legend is not 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.360
 showing your video part 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.139
 He plays the movie here, it accelerates times. 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.729
 and will pass on enem 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.009
 could minimize here doing otherwise something this is something else 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.570
 interesting to read very light very simple 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.669
 with this law operate any operating system 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.530
 it was of low memory in the machine and it will work quietly minimize I can do 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:23.889
 and the other things normally 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.099
 He's doing his conversion. 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.080
 when it's over I'll show you now I'm going to give a dick sun is what 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.860
 will take a 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.379
 the minute 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:32.660
 in 5 minutes 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.550
 I'll vote later on with the second part of it. 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.669
 already ending the finalization was his affiliation 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.680
 we are moment and begin to make the process of the father, I was part of it 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.570
 opa proceeds by 60 no method is easier to do you can 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.800
 note that so far there is nothing abnormal easy levit simplex program 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.600
 and you will be able to get any drink and take 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.779
 he had already caught tomatoes that mind 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:58.319
 I have not had as I said in Chile in that of cricket 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.909
 and it ended in the hand and boot mine and pull this one here and know that not here 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:04.240
 all alone 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.629
 very simple 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:07.479
 so folks 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:08.360
 until here
