can play my left hand this fast and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.210 
can play my left hand this fast and
typically<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.530> you're<00:02:04.650> a<00:02:04.710> right<00:02:04.950> handed

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
typically if you're a right handed

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.620 
typically if you're a right handed
drummer<00:02:05.370> your<00:02:05.730> left<00:02:05.940> hand<00:02:06.150> is<00:02:06.270> gonna<00:02:06.450> be

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
drummer your left hand is gonna be

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.230 
drummer your left hand is gonna be
slower<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.260> why<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:08.070> spend<00:02:08.399> more<00:02:08.670> time<00:02:08.910> on

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
slower so why not spend more time on

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.130 
slower so why not spend more time on
