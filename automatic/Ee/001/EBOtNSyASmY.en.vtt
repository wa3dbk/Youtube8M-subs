00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.850 
other book fold we're gonna do the other
direction<00:00:36.040> as<00:00:36.280> well<00:00:37.260> again<00:00:38.260> try<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:38.530> be<00:00:38.650> nice

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
direction as well again try to be nice

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.080 
direction as well again try to be nice
and<00:00:39.040> precise<00:00:39.310> so<00:00:39.460> when<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:39.610> open<00:00:39.879> it<00:00:39.940> up

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
you'll have a really nice plus sign

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:42.479 
you'll have a really nice plus sign
right<00:00:42.070> there

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
right there

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.260

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.930 
and pinch right here at the bottom of
this<00:01:16.600> line<00:01:16.960> on<00:01:17.260> either<00:01:18.010> side<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:18.730> we're<00:01:18.850> gonna

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
this line on either side and we're gonna

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.440 
this line on either side and we're gonna
rotate<00:01:19.420> our<00:01:20.050> hands<00:01:20.650> close<00:01:21.580> together<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.090> that

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
rotate our hands close together so that

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.380 
rotate our hands close together so that
all<00:01:22.660> of<00:01:22.720> these<00:01:23.200> will<00:01:23.500> come<00:01:23.680> together<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:25.240> can

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
all of these will come together we can

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.550 
all of these will come together we can
make<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> nice<00:01:27.210> triangle<00:01:28.210> base<00:01:28.690> I'll<00:01:29.290> show<00:01:29.470> you

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
make a nice triangle base I'll show you

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.060 
make a nice triangle base I'll show you
that<00:01:29.680> this<00:01:29.830> is<00:01:29.920> called<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.190> waterbomb<00:01:30.610> base<00:01:32.070> so

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
that this is called a waterbomb base so

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.380 
that this is called a waterbomb base so
take<00:01:33.280> both<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.640> your<00:01:33.760> fingers<00:01:34.090> right<00:01:34.330> here

take both of your fingers right here

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.550 
take both of your fingers right here
right<00:01:34.750> up<00:01:34.840> against<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.170> edge<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.470> we're

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
right up against the edge and we're

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.160 
right up against the edge and we're
gonna<00:01:35.650> rotate<00:01:35.980> them<00:01:36.340> up<00:01:36.430> together<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:37.170> when

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
gonna rotate them up together and when

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.390 
gonna rotate them up together and when
they<00:01:38.260> come<00:01:38.440> together<00:01:38.590> they're<00:01:39.040> well<00:01:39.250> that's

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
they come together they're well that's

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.500 
they come together they're well that's
gonna<00:01:39.580> help<00:01:39.730> us<00:01:39.880> make<00:01:40.060> what's<00:01:40.270> called<00:01:40.330> a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
gonna help us make what's called a

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.100 
gonna help us make what's called a
waterbomb<00:01:41.020> base<00:01:41.080> so<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.590> have<00:01:41.710> two<00:01:41.920> edges<00:01:42.130> on

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
waterbomb base so you have two edges on

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.080 
waterbomb base so you have two edges on
either<00:01:44.110> side<00:01:44.470> we're<00:01:45.100> going<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.400> flatten<00:01:45.760> the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
either side we're going to flatten the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.930 
either side we're going to flatten the
paper<00:01:46.240> down<00:01:46.600> like<00:01:46.900> that<00:01:47.580> now<00:01:48.580> that's<00:01:48.730> not

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
paper down like that now that's not

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.550 
paper down like that now that's not
using<00:01:49.330> any<00:01:49.480> new<00:01:49.660> creases<00:01:49.870> that's<00:01:50.170> just<00:01:50.320> using

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
using any new creases that's just using

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.900 
using any new creases that's just using
all<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.860> creases<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.250> are<00:01:51.400> already<00:01:51.640> there

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
all the creases that are already there

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.050 
all the creases that are already there
we're<00:01:52.450> just<00:01:53.070> changing<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.520> way<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.820> they're

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
we're just changing the way that they're

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.740 
we're just changing the way that they're
folded<00:01:55.630> together<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.950> like<00:01:57.040> that<00:01:57.160> now<00:01:57.760> the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
folded together just like that now the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.710 
folded together just like that now the
next<00:01:58.990> step<00:01:59.170> we're<00:01:59.710> gonna<00:01:59.770> take<00:02:00.100> one<00:02:00.580> flap<00:02:00.820> and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
next step we're gonna take one flap and

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.350 
next step we're gonna take one flap and
we're<00:02:01.870> going<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.050> fold<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.830> over<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:04.000> now<00:02:04.180> we're

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
we're going to fold it over so now we're

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.620 
we're going to fold it over so now we're
gonna<00:02:04.450> have<00:02:04.720> three<00:02:05.560> flaps<00:02:05.980> on<00:02:06.220> one<00:02:06.580> side<00:02:06.820> three

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
gonna have three flaps on one side three

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.419 
gonna have three flaps on one side three
flaps<00:02:07.870> on<00:02:07.990> one<00:02:08.170> side<00:02:08.379> and<00:02:08.619> one<00:02:08.890> flap<00:02:09.129> on<00:02:09.369> the

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
flaps on one side and one flap on the

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.460 
flaps on one side and one flap on the
left<00:02:10.000> side<00:02:11.129> we're<00:02:12.129> gonna<00:02:12.220> now<00:02:12.459> take<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:13.510> one

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
left side we're gonna now take this one

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.959 
left side we're gonna now take this one
flap<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.920> extra<00:02:15.250> flap<00:02:15.459> we're<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.849> do<00:02:15.939> a

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
flap the extra flap we're going to do a

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.580 
flap the extra flap we're going to do a
kite<00:02:16.299> fold<00:02:16.510> we're<00:02:16.599> gonna<00:02:16.750> fold<00:02:16.959> this<00:02:17.260> edge

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
kite fold we're gonna fold this edge

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.440 
kite fold we're gonna fold this edge
this<00:02:18.459> leading<00:02:18.730> edge<00:02:18.879> right<00:02:19.090> there<00:02:19.269> is<00:02:19.359> going

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
this leading edge right there is going

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.150 
this leading edge right there is going
to<00:02:19.510> come<00:02:19.599> down

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
to come down

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.610 
to come down
and<00:02:20.820> it's<00:02:21.000> gonna<00:02:21.150> lie<00:02:21.390> right<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.320> middle

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
and it's gonna lie right on the middle

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:33.530 
and it's gonna lie right on the middle
line<00:02:23.990> just<00:02:24.990> like<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:31.490> okay<00:02:32.520> next<00:02:33.270> go<00:02:33.450> ahead

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
line just like this okay next go ahead

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.660 
line just like this okay next go ahead
and<00:02:33.810> rotate<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.860> over<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.900> now<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.380> facing

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
and rotate it over so now it's facing

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.630 
and rotate it over so now it's facing
the<00:02:38.670> opposite<00:02:39.120> direction<00:02:40.340> next<00:02:41.340> we're<00:02:41.550> going

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
the opposite direction next we're going

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.000 
the opposite direction next we're going
to<00:02:41.730> take<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.090> top<00:02:42.390> point<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.860> whole

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
to take this top point of the whole

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.560 
to take this top point of the whole
triangle<00:02:44.400> we're<00:02:44.580> gonna<00:02:44.670> bring<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.000> down<00:02:45.210> to

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
triangle we're gonna bring it down to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.530 
triangle we're gonna bring it down to
this<00:02:45.870> spot<00:02:46.230> right<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.180> also<00:02:48.300> think

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
this spot right here you can also think

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.420 
this spot right here you can also think
about<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:48.990> taking<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.740> edge<00:02:50.070> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
about it as taking this edge and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.070 
about it as taking this edge and
bringing<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.210> down<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.540> bottom<00:02:51.900> edge<00:02:52.050> and

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
bringing it down to the bottom edge and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.700 
bringing it down to the bottom edge and
cutting<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.680> whole<00:02:52.860> thing<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.520> half<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:55.470> just

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
cutting the whole thing in half so just

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.460 
cutting the whole thing in half so just
like<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.250> we<00:02:56.340> fold<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.760> down<00:02:57.470> it's

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
like this and we fold this down it's

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.630 
like this and we fold this down it's
gonna<00:02:58.650> thin<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.550> tail<00:02:59.820> all<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.240> way<00:03:00.570> down<00:03:01.640> to

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
gonna thin the tail all the way down to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.470 
gonna thin the tail all the way down to
a<00:03:02.670> point<00:03:04.490> like<00:03:05.490> that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.700 

next<00:03:09.480> we're<00:03:09.840> gonna<00:03:09.930> fold<00:03:10.320> up<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.670> dorsal<00:03:12.090> fin

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
next we're gonna fold up the dorsal fin

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.190 
next we're gonna fold up the dorsal fin
so<00:03:13.710> this<00:03:13.920> this<00:03:14.730> fold<00:03:15.090> right<00:03:15.330> here<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.810> top<00:03:16.050> of

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
so this this fold right here this top of

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.270 
so this this fold right here this top of
this<00:03:16.260> triangle<00:03:16.710> that's<00:03:16.830> going<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.100> turn<00:03:17.220> into

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
this triangle that's going to turn into

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.650 
this triangle that's going to turn into
our<00:03:17.460> dorsal<00:03:17.790> fin<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.090> we're<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.330> fold<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
our dorsal fin so we're going to fold it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.680 
our dorsal fin so we're going to fold it
up<00:03:19.520> enough<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:21.000> could<00:03:21.180> see<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.540> if

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
up enough so that you could see it if

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.760 
up enough so that you could see it if
you<00:03:21.780> were<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.900> flip<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.230> over<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.500> enough<00:03:22.680> so

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
you were to flip it over you enough so

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.250 
you were to flip it over you enough so
you<00:03:22.890> can<00:03:23.010> still<00:03:23.220> see<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:24.540> fin<00:03:24.870> poked<00:03:25.110> up

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
you can still see that that fin poked up

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.690 
you can still see that that fin poked up
right<00:03:25.500> there<00:03:25.910> just<00:03:26.910> like<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:28.490> next<00:03:29.490> step

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
right there just like that next step

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.530 
right there just like that next step
we're<00:03:30.150> gonna<00:03:30.240> take<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.870> edge<00:03:31.230> right<00:03:31.260> here

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
we're gonna take this edge right here

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.570 
we're gonna take this edge right here
I'm<00:03:33.540> gonna<00:03:33.660> fold<00:03:34.020> it<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.320> half<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.920> that's

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
I'm gonna fold it in half and that's

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.050 
I'm gonna fold it in half and that's
gonna<00:03:35.820> fin<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.710> little<00:03:37.710> bit<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.760> flipper

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
gonna fin a little bit of the flipper

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.220 
gonna fin a little bit of the flipper
and<00:03:39.150> if<00:03:39.240> you<00:03:39.330> want<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.540> have<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.690> nice<00:03:39.870> pointed

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
and if you want to have a nice pointed

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.360 
and if you want to have a nice pointed
flipper<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.710> can<00:03:40.860> leave<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.130> all<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.280> way

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
flipper you can leave it all the way

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.480 
flipper you can leave it all the way
down<00:03:41.490> there<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.240> can<00:03:42.360> also<00:03:42.540> fold<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.110> down

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
down there and you can also fold it down

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.040 
down there and you can also fold it down
just<00:03:44.490> like<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.150> if<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.540> look<00:03:45.720> at<00:03:45.900> it

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
just like this so that if you look at it

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.590 
just like this so that if you look at it
it<00:03:46.620> just<00:03:46.830> sort<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.160> thins<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.150> little<00:03:48.420> bit

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
it just sort of thins it a little bit

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.000 
it just sort of thins it a little bit
but<00:03:48.780> still<00:03:48.990> keeps<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.320> nice<00:03:49.470> little<00:03:49.709> flipper

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
but still keeps a nice little flipper

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.150 
but still keeps a nice little flipper
aspect<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:51.620> just<00:03:52.620> like<00:03:52.800> that

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
aspect to it just like that

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
of what kind of a shape I'm making right

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.979 
of what kind of a shape I'm making right
here<00:04:19.170> I<00:04:19.350> want<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.709> thin<00:04:20.010> this<00:04:20.280> down<00:04:20.840> not<00:04:21.840> all

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
here I want to thin this down not all

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.840 
here I want to thin this down not all
the<00:04:22.080> way<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.230> a<00:04:22.290> point<00:04:22.650> but<00:04:23.190> enough<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.670> right

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
the way to a point but enough to right

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.280 
the way to a point but enough to right
here<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.240> is<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.510> bump<00:04:24.720> at<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.900> top<00:04:24.960> of

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
here so this is the bump at the top of

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.290 
here so this is the bump at the top of
the<00:04:25.350> head<00:04:26.090> right<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:27.330> that

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
the head right like that

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.700 
the head right like that
okay<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:30.569> the<00:04:30.840> next<00:04:31.050> step<00:04:31.319> for<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.620> origami

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
okay so the next step for the origami

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.839 
okay so the next step for the origami
dolphin<00:04:32.400> we're<00:04:33.210> gonna<00:04:33.360> fold<00:04:34.129> the<00:04:35.129> front<00:04:35.639> of

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
dolphin we're gonna fold the front of

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.969 
dolphin we're gonna fold the front of
the<00:04:35.939> head<00:04:36.180> we're<00:04:36.689> gonna<00:04:36.780> fold<00:04:37.139> it<00:04:37.289> back<00:04:37.560> like

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
the head we're gonna fold it back like

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.360 
the head we're gonna fold it back like
this<00:04:38.969> and<00:04:39.270> then<00:04:39.599> right<00:04:40.169> back<00:04:40.530> out<00:04:40.740> again

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
this and then right back out again

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.209 
this and then right back out again
that's<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.120> pleat<00:04:42.509> fold<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.620> that's<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:43.949> we<00:04:44.069> get

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219 
that's a pleat fold and that's so we get

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.330 
that's a pleat fold and that's so we get
a<00:04:44.250> nice<00:04:44.460> nose<00:04:45.199> sort<00:04:46.199> of<00:04:46.289> like<00:04:46.439> a<00:04:46.650> bottlenose

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
a nice nose sort of like a bottlenose

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.270 
a nice nose sort of like a bottlenose
dolphin<00:04:48.379> just<00:04:49.379> like<00:04:49.560> that<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:49.860> it's<00:04:49.979> a<00:04:50.069> pleat

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
dolphin just like that so it's a pleat

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.950 
dolphin just like that so it's a pleat
that<00:04:50.310> goes<00:04:50.550> back<00:04:50.759> and<00:04:50.909> forth<00:04:51.000> then<00:04:51.629> the<00:04:51.719> next

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
that goes back and forth then the next

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.540 
that goes back and forth then the next
step<00:04:52.139> to<00:04:52.409> finish<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.770> off<00:04:52.919> we're<00:04:53.159> gonna<00:04:53.250> fold

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
step to finish it off we're gonna fold

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.089 
step to finish it off we're gonna fold
the<00:04:53.819> flukes<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.389> the<00:04:54.539> tail<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:55.050> go<00:04:55.740> ahead<00:04:55.979> and

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
the flukes of the tail so go ahead and

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.249 
the flukes of the tail so go ahead and
open<00:04:56.219> this<00:04:56.520> up<00:04:56.729> there's<00:04:57.210> two<00:04:57.509> sheets<00:04:57.870> of<00:04:58.050> in

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
open this up there's two sheets of in

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.950 
open this up there's two sheets of in
here<00:04:58.439> there's<00:04:58.650> two<00:04:59.270> sections<00:05:00.270> of<00:05:00.509> paper<00:05:00.719> go

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
here there's two sections of paper go

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.689 
here there's two sections of paper go
ahead<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.259> open<00:05:01.349> it<00:05:01.560> up<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.830> inside<00:05:02.639> reverse

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
ahead and open it up and inside reverse

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.769 
ahead and open it up and inside reverse
fold<00:05:03.330> one<00:05:04.550> bottom<00:05:05.550> section<00:05:05.939> down<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.479> can<00:05:06.599> see

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:06.779 
fold one bottom section down you can see

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.309 
fold one bottom section down you can see
how<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:07.259> open<00:05:07.949> it<00:05:08.189> up<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.520> push<00:05:08.939> it<00:05:08.969> down<00:05:09.319> just

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
how I open it up and push it down just

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.619 
how I open it up and push it down just
like<00:05:10.439> that<00:05:10.710> and<00:05:11.129> if<00:05:11.849> you<00:05:11.969> want<00:05:12.180> you<00:05:12.270> can<00:05:12.360> even

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629 
like that and if you want you can even

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:15.559 
like that and if you want you can even
open<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:13.020> up<00:05:13.199> and<00:05:13.439> then<00:05:14.370> fold<00:05:14.639> this<00:05:14.939> section<00:05:15.180> up

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
open it up and then fold this section up

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.179 
open it up and then fold this section up
as<00:05:15.900> well<00:05:16.319> in<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:17.729> middle<00:05:18.060> as<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:19.169> crimp<00:05:19.650> fold<00:05:19.949> so

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:20.189 
as well in the middle as a crimp fold so

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:21.800 
as well in the middle as a crimp fold so
it<00:05:20.250> would<00:05:20.400> come<00:05:20.580> down<00:05:20.819> and<00:05:21.120> then<00:05:21.240> back<00:05:21.389> up<00:05:21.449> and

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
it would come down and then back up and

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.100 
it would come down and then back up and
that<00:05:22.650> gets<00:05:22.919> you<00:05:23.129> that<00:05:24.090> full<00:05:24.389> tail<00:05:24.659> section

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
that gets you that full tail section

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.110 
that gets you that full tail section
right<00:05:25.259> there<00:05:25.289> for<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.740> flukes<00:05:26.009> on<00:05:26.310> the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
right there for the flukes on the

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.459 
right there for the flukes on the
dolphin<00:05:27.479> and<00:05:27.629> then<00:05:27.840> when<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.050> flip<00:05:28.259> it<00:05:28.349> over

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
dolphin and then when you flip it over

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:33.409 
dolphin and then when you flip it over
you<00:05:29.900> have<00:05:30.900> a<00:05:30.930> look<00:05:31.139> and<00:05:31.319> that<00:05:31.740> is<00:05:32.029> the<00:05:33.029> origami

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
you have a look and that is the origami

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.900 
you have a look and that is the origami
