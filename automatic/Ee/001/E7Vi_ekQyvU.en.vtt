little glitch tutorial for you guys um I
found<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.650> out<00:00:13.920> today<00:00:14.519> by<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.240> help<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.690> ESO

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
found this out today by the help of ESO

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.100 
found this out today by the help of ESO
when<00:00:17.009> he<00:00:17.630> went<00:00:18.630> into<00:00:19.430> a<00:00:20.660> glitch<00:00:21.660> where<00:00:21.960> you

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
when he went into a glitch where you

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.589 
when he went into a glitch where you
could<00:00:22.230> see<00:00:22.470> through<00:00:22.680> walls<00:00:22.919> by<00:00:23.520> using<00:00:23.790> pistons

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
could see through walls by using pistons

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.679 
could see through walls by using pistons
and<00:00:25.050> TMZ<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.360> I<00:00:27.360> thought<00:00:28.259> this<00:00:29.009> is<00:00:29.390> very<00:00:30.390> cool

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
and TMZ and I thought this is very cool

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.170 
and TMZ and I thought this is very cool
and<00:00:30.899> I<00:00:31.200> found<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.800> actual<00:00:31.950> original<00:00:32.340> video<00:00:32.910> I

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
and I found the actual original video I

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.220 
and I found the actual original video I
believe<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.850> link<00:00:36.060> for<00:00:36.330> that<00:00:36.390> will<00:00:36.540> be<00:00:36.810> in

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
believe and the link for that will be in

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.450 
believe and the link for that will be in
the<00:00:37.500> description<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:39.620> how<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.130> built

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the description so how this is built

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.090 
the description so how this is built
it's<00:00:42.300> actually<00:00:42.480> pretty<00:00:42.960> simple<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.680> need<00:00:43.860> two

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
it's actually pretty simple you need two

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.200 
it's actually pretty simple you need two
pieces<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.880> TNT<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:46.980> arm<00:00:49.310> two<00:00:50.310> Pistons<00:00:50.790> sticky

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
pieces of TNT to arm two Pistons sticky

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.920 
pieces of TNT to arm two Pistons sticky
pistons<00:00:52.550> some<00:00:53.550> redstone<00:00:53.790> wire<00:00:54.210> obviously<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
pistons some redstone wire obviously to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.470 
pistons some redstone wire obviously to
have<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.320> too<00:00:55.579> too<00:00:56.579> much<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.090> would

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
have to be too too much I would

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.520 
have to be too too much I would
recommend<00:00:57.720> bringing<00:00:58.200> around<00:00:59.510> ten<00:01:00.530> redstone

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
recommend bringing around ten redstone

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.189 
recommend bringing around ten redstone
even<00:01:01.770> though<00:01:01.860> I<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.100> five<00:01:02.899> plus<00:01:03.899> two<00:01:03.930> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
even though I have five plus two is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.240 
even though I have five plus two is
seven<00:01:04.619> all<00:01:04.949> together<00:01:05.129> right<00:01:05.489> now<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.500> 11<00:01:07.610> for

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
seven all together right now and 11 for

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.330 
seven all together right now and 11 for
making<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:12.090> glitch<00:01:12.530> occur<00:01:13.530> best

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
making the little glitch occur best

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.090 
making the little glitch occur best
place<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.300> in<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.170> cave<00:01:16.440> system<00:01:16.920> so

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
place to do this is in a cave system so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.420 
place to do this is in a cave system so
right<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.300> go<00:01:18.330> over<00:01:18.510> here<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:20.130> its

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
right now if I go over here and if its

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
right now if I go over here and if its
chest<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> way<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.840> could<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
chest was in the way you could see this

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.190 
chest was in the way you could see this
ladder<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.299> going<00:01:24.299> down<00:01:24.510> to<00:01:24.659> my<00:01:24.840> slime

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
ladder which is going down to my slime

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.560 
ladder which is going down to my slime
fun<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:27.260> I<00:01:28.260> added<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.070> clear<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.580> bunch<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.450> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
fun so I added a clear a bunch and I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.490 
fun so I added a clear a bunch and I
mean<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.930> bunch<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.560> caves<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:33.180> direction

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
mean a bunch of caves in this direction

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.440 
mean a bunch of caves in this direction
to<00:01:34.500> make<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.979> slime<00:01:35.220> farm<00:01:35.490> actually<00:01:35.970> work<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
to make the slime farm actually work and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.289 
to make the slime farm actually work and
spawn<00:01:37.320> slimes<00:01:37.680> instead<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.700> these<00:01:38.940> caves

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
spawn slimes instead of all these caves

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
spawn slimes instead of all these caves
by<00:01:40.159> spawning<00:01:41.159> bunch<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.710> creepers<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.130> such

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
by spawning bunch of creepers and such

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.719 
by spawning bunch of creepers and such
so<00:01:48.470> this<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.740> best<00:01:49.890> place<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.549> you're

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
so this is the best place because you're

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.640 
so this is the best place because you're
going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> lot<00:01:51.150> of<00:01:51.450> caves<00:01:51.840> lit<00:01:52.350> up<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
going to see a lot of caves lit up and

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.210 
going to see a lot of caves lit up and
whatnot<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.530> first<00:01:55.530> thing<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.799> want<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.100> is

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
whatnot so first thing you want to do is

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.429 
whatnot so first thing you want to do is
to<00:01:56.310> put<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> lever<00:01:56.790> down<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.390> specific<00:01:57.630> spot<00:01:57.990> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
to put a lever down in a specific spot I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:06.289 
to put a lever down in a specific spot I
want<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.869> get<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:03.049> 2<00:02:04.049> by<00:02:04.350> 1<00:02:04.590> slot<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.759> right

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
want to get a 2 by 1 slot like right

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.679 
want to get a 2 by 1 slot like right
here<00:02:06.570> still<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:07.080> could<00:02:07.259> stand<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.689> this

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:09.689 
here still I could stand here and this

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.179 
here still I could stand here and this
is<00:02:09.750> where<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.409> action<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.129> to

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:11.189 
is where all the action is going to

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.000 
is where all the action is going to
happen<00:02:11.609> so<00:02:12.120> right<00:02:12.329> now<00:02:12.359> I'm<00:02:12.689> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.139> bring

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
happen so right now I'm going to bring

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.770 
happen so right now I'm going to bring
some<00:02:14.219> wire<00:02:14.489> around<00:02:15.120> here

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.039 

kind<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.140> u-shaped<00:02:19.890> form<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:21.049> it's

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
kind of like a u-shaped form and it's

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.690 
kind of like a u-shaped form and it's
going<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.319> lead<00:02:22.560> toward<00:02:23.689> two<00:02:24.689> pistons<00:02:25.700> facing

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
going to lead toward two pistons facing

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.300 
going to lead toward two pistons facing
the<00:02:27.090> opposite<00:02:27.390> direction<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.189> it's<00:02:29.189> actually

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
the opposite direction so it's actually

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.580 
the opposite direction so it's actually
pointing<00:02:30.150> towards<00:02:30.629> where<00:02:31.019> I'm<00:02:31.319> gonna<00:02:31.530> be

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
pointing towards where I'm gonna be

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.220 
pointing towards where I'm gonna be
standing<00:02:31.920> when<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.459> glitch<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:33.000> being<00:02:33.989> used

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
standing when this glitch is being used

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.319 
standing when this glitch is being used
so<00:02:34.859> if<00:02:35.010> we<00:02:35.159> turn<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.459> on<00:02:35.609> right<00:02:35.790> now<00:02:35.849> just<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
so if we turn it on right now just to

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.000 
so if we turn it on right now just to
make<00:02:36.359> sure<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.849> turn<00:02:38.849> on<00:02:39.030> both<00:02:39.299> Pistons

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
make sure it is turn on both Pistons

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.699 
make sure it is turn on both Pistons
which<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.189> what<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.489> want<00:02:41.670> we<00:02:42.450> put<00:02:42.689> to<00:02:43.049> TNT

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
which is what we want we put to TNT

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.039 
which is what we want we put to TNT
right<00:02:44.519> there<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.000> whenever<00:02:45.810> we<00:02:47.930> turn<00:02:48.930> this

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
right there so whenever we turn this

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.390 
right there so whenever we turn this
lover<00:02:49.560> it's<00:02:50.069> going<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:51.230> move<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.470> CMT's<00:02:53.099> as

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
lover it's going to move the CMT's as

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.860 
lover it's going to move the CMT's as
you<00:02:53.700> see<00:02:53.970> back<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.930> forth<00:02:55.169> so<00:02:55.939> if<00:02:56.939> we<00:02:57.480> were

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
you see back and forth so if we were

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.149 
you see back and forth so if we were
standing<00:02:58.079> right<00:02:58.290> here<00:02:58.409> like<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.799> mentioned

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
standing right here like I mentioned

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.429 
standing right here like I mentioned
before<00:02:59.659> usually<00:03:00.659> you<00:03:00.780> would<00:03:00.900> get<00:03:01.049> suffocated

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
before usually you would get suffocated

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.379 
before usually you would get suffocated
because<00:03:03.680> obviously<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.609> block<00:03:05.879> you<00:03:06.269> know

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
because obviously it's a block you know

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.909 
because obviously it's a block you know
blocks<00:03:06.689> are<00:03:07.019> going<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.260> suffocate<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.799> if

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
blocks are going to suffocate you if

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.649 
blocks are going to suffocate you if
they're<00:03:08.129> pushed<00:03:08.370> into<00:03:08.639> you<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.060> would

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
they're pushed into you and you would

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:16.039 
they're pushed into you and you would
die<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:11.040> some<00:03:11.220> reason<00:03:11.579> in<00:03:13.040> 1.73<00:03:15.049> 1.7

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
die but for some reason in 1.73 1.7

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.899 
die but for some reason in 1.73 1.7
point<00:03:16.349> 3<00:03:16.620> by<00:03:17.129> bad<00:03:17.370> arm<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:19.829> would<00:03:19.980> work<00:03:20.010> that

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
point 3 by bad arm it would work that

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.800 
point 3 by bad arm it would work that
when<00:03:21.629> I<00:03:21.659> stand<00:03:22.500> here<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:23.060> do<00:03:24.060> these<00:03:24.269> squishes

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
when I stand here and do these squishes

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:34.039 
when I stand here and do these squishes
right<00:03:25.019> into<00:03:25.349> me<00:03:26.780> yep<00:03:27.949> this<00:03:28.949> happens<00:03:32.870> notch<00:03:33.870> has

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
right into me yep this happens notch has

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.469 
right into me yep this happens notch has
some<00:03:34.349> work<00:03:34.859> to<00:03:34.889> do<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.909> fix<00:03:36.150> this<00:03:36.949> but<00:03:38.419> it<00:03:39.419> is

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.479 
some work to do to fix this but it is

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:43.009 
some work to do to fix this but it is
very<00:03:40.049> useful<00:03:40.199> to<00:03:41.180> find<00:03:42.180> caves<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.810> like

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
very useful to find caves and I like

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.030 
very useful to find caves and I like
this<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.919> a<00:03:43.949> huge<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.090> mean<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.540> huge<00:03:46.199> cave

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
this is a huge and I mean a huge cave

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.599 
this is a huge and I mean a huge cave
system<00:03:47.810> that<00:03:48.810> i<00:03:48.840> had<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.139> light<00:03:49.889> up<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.280> lana

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
system that i had to light up and lana

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.369 
system that i had to light up and lana
and<00:03:50.909> i'm<00:03:51.209> pretty<00:03:51.329> sure<00:03:51.510> if<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.780> can't<00:03:51.989> see<00:03:52.349> it

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
and i'm pretty sure if you can't see it

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.680 
and i'm pretty sure if you can't see it
but<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.739> extends<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:53.790> more<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.269> way<00:03:54.479> and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
but it extends you and more that way and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.479 
but it extends you and more that way and
you<00:03:54.750> can<00:03:55.470> see<00:03:55.590> some<00:03:55.799> squid<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.840> can<00:03:57.959> see<00:03:58.489> so

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
you can see some squid so you can see so

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.659 
you can see some squid so you can see so
far<00:03:59.519> and<00:04:00.120> why<00:04:00.239> not<00:04:00.419> good<00:04:01.139> turn<00:04:01.709> around<00:04:02.069> you<00:04:02.430> do

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
far and why not good turn around you do

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.839 
far and why not good turn around you do
whatever<00:04:02.879> and<00:04:03.659> just<00:04:03.949> you<00:04:04.949> look<00:04:05.220> down<00:04:05.430> like

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
whatever and just you look down like

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.420 
whatever and just you look down like
there's<00:04:06.060> my<00:04:06.209> slime<00:04:06.479> farm<00:04:06.720> as<00:04:06.959> we<00:04:07.109> see<00:04:07.319> so<00:04:08.129> again

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
there's my slime farm as we see so again

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.189 
there's my slime farm as we see so again
this<00:04:09.409> glitch<00:04:10.409> which<00:04:11.810> should<00:04:12.810> be<00:04:12.959> patched

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
this glitch which should be patched

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.499 
this glitch which should be patched
though<00:04:13.530> at<00:04:14.009> some<00:04:14.220> point<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.879> really<00:04:15.209> helpful

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
though at some point is really helpful

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.229 
though at some point is really helpful
to<00:04:15.780> find<00:04:15.959> caves<00:04:16.380> right<00:04:16.919> now<00:04:17.130> in<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:17.759> spot<00:04:18.000> it

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
to find caves right now in this spot it

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.569 
to find caves right now in this spot it
is<00:04:18.389> not<00:04:18.630> really<00:04:19.079> useful<00:04:19.440> because<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.859> let<00:04:20.099> up<00:04:20.220> so

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
is not really useful because I let up so

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.659 
is not really useful because I let up so
many<00:04:20.729> kids<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:21.209> pretty<00:04:21.419> much<00:04:21.919> a<00:04:22.919> done<00:04:23.370> deal

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
many kids it's pretty much a done deal

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.490 
many kids it's pretty much a done deal
here<00:04:23.970> there's<00:04:24.300> some<00:04:24.570> caves<00:04:24.900> like<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.349> one

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
here there's some caves like that one

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.679 
here there's some caves like that one
there<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:26.700> one<00:04:26.909> up<00:04:27.060> there<00:04:27.330> but

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:28.689 
there and that one up there but

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.570 
there and that one up there but
again<00:04:29.229> those<00:04:29.469> are<00:04:29.499> not<00:04:29.769> going<00:04:29.949> to<00:04:30.039> affect<00:04:30.159> my

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
again those are not going to affect my

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.899 
again those are not going to affect my
slang<00:04:30.849> fun<00:04:31.119> as<00:04:31.299> much<00:04:31.959> as<00:04:32.589> long<00:04:33.039> as<00:04:33.189> I<00:04:33.309> get<00:04:33.369> bunch

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
slang fun as much as long as I get bunch

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.549 
slang fun as much as long as I get bunch
i'm<00:04:34.449> pretty<00:04:34.689> sure<00:04:34.809> i<00:04:34.899> only<00:04:35.169> have<00:04:35.289> enough

00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:35.559 
i'm pretty sure i only have enough

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:41.369 
i'm pretty sure i only have enough
slimes<00:04:36.539> to<00:04:37.539> last<00:04:37.749> Oh<00:04:38.019> like<00:04:38.919> a<00:04:39.219> good<00:04:40.229> amount<00:04:41.229> of

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
slimes to last Oh like a good amount of

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.989 
slimes to last Oh like a good amount of
time<00:04:41.529> pretty<00:04:41.739> much<00:04:41.829> so<00:04:42.459> as<00:04:42.669> you<00:04:42.789> can<00:04:42.849> see

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:42.999 
time pretty much so as you can see

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:48.989 
time pretty much so as you can see
there's<00:04:43.209> lava<00:04:43.479> you<00:04:44.019> can<00:04:44.169> see<00:04:47.669> mushrooms<00:04:48.669> over

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:48.999 
there's lava you can see mushrooms over

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:50.969 
there's lava you can see mushrooms over
there<00:04:49.269> and<00:04:49.479> whatnot<00:04:49.809> so<00:04:50.439> again<00:04:50.679> this<00:04:50.769> is<00:04:50.949> a

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
there and whatnot so again this is a

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.709 
there and whatnot so again this is a
very<00:04:51.489> useful<00:04:51.789> tool<00:04:52.479> to<00:04:53.489> find<00:04:54.489> caves<00:04:55.119> where

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:55.719 
very useful tool to find caves where

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:58.859 
very useful tool to find caves where
there<00:04:56.110> could<00:04:56.379> be<00:04:56.439> minerals<00:04:57.189> or<00:04:57.429> or<00:04:58.209> not<00:04:58.599> i'm

00:04:58.859 --> 00:04:58.869

there could be minerals or or not i'm
pretty<00:04:59.229> sure<00:04:59.379> i<00:04:59.439> use<00:04:59.709> this<00:05:00.300> kind<00:05:01.300> of<00:05:01.389> glitch

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
pretty sure i use this kind of glitch

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.719 
pretty sure i use this kind of glitch
not<00:05:01.809> with<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.229> tea<00:05:02.379> but<00:05:02.919> with<00:05:04.319> gravel<00:05:05.729> while

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
not with the tea but with gravel while

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.329 
not with the tea but with gravel while
back<00:05:06.939> before<00:05:07.269> when<00:05:07.449> it<00:05:07.479> was<00:05:07.599> actually<00:05:08.139> a<00:05:08.349> good

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:09.339 
back before when it was actually a good

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.299 
back before when it was actually a good
you're<00:05:09.999> able<00:05:10.360> to<00:05:10.509> do<00:05:10.599> that<00:05:10.889> look<00:05:11.889> see<00:05:12.069> walls

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:12.309 
you're able to do that look see walls
