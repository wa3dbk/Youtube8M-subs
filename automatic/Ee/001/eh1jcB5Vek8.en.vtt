00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.870
 many you ask me about tricks to the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.880
 time to do hair coloring in 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.500
 house and that is that we often make the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.839
 same mistakes today I bring you some 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.059
 simple tips for you to dye in 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.010
 home be a success thanks to onyia 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.900
 many of us apply the dye 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.730
 directly or we do the test 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.950
 allergy at the time of application 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.840
 we have to do it 48 hours before 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.460
 because even if you've never had an allergy 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.250
 this can appear at any time 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.470
 so do not trust us often we do 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
 mix well before applying it and not 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.760
 you have to do it right at the moment 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 before applying the dye because then 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.200
 because when the developer together with 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.510
 the colored molecules the formula 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.970
 active we should not keep that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.670
 mix for a later time because 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.100
 it will oxidize already and it would not have an error effect 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.200
 regular wash your hair before 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.720
 apply the product you do not have to do it 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.239
 because the color takes better in the hair 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.980
 dry it would not be necessary to wash it 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.739
 right after because the formula 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.840
 incorporates cleansing agents I tell you 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.700
 a very good trick to prevent the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.960
 skin is soiled is to apply a little 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.390
 vaseline 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.090
 at the hairline and in the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.860
 many ears we believe that by leaving the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.540
 dye more time than indicated in the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.790
 hair we get clarification as 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.470
 fine what happens is just the opposite if 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.820
 we leave it more time we will lose the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.220
 control over the tone that we walk 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.140
 looking for habitual error many times 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.540
 we apply the right conditioner 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.070
 after rinsing the hair first there is 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.229
 than rinse it with cold water to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.270
 enhance the brightness and then remove the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.460
 excess moisture with a towel to 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.020
 that the product is not diluted at the time 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.119
 to apply the conditioner we have to 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.190
 do it in means and tips not in the root 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.380
 in this way we will avoid greasing the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.360
 hair and because I love goal is already the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.700
 first permanent dye without ammonia 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.100
 totally covers the gray hair improves the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.820
 hair quality and leaves it soft with 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.890
 lifetime 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.810
 it smells very good thanks precisely to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.729
 that does not have ammonia and also to the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.860
 oils and then its price is very 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.810
 affordable being a premium brand of 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.240
 garnier so if you have not tried it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.240
 do it because I assure you I love it
