00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.420 
for reckless driving and I think that's
the<00:05:24.199> stupidest<00:05:24.560> charge<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:24.949> could<00:05:25.099> ever<00:05:25.250> get

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
the stupidest charge you could ever get

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.760 
the stupidest charge you could ever get
when<00:05:25.610> you<00:05:25.699> look<00:05:25.819> at<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.030> English<00:05:26.150> language

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
when you look at the English language

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.320 
when you look at the English language
because<00:05:27.770> I<00:05:27.800> didn't<00:05:27.979> think<00:05:28.069> about<00:05:28.219> it<00:05:28.340> if<00:05:28.520> home

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
because I didn't think about it if home

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.430 
because I didn't think about it if home
less<00:05:29.830> means<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:30.979> don't<00:05:31.129> have<00:05:31.190> any<00:05:31.400> homes<00:05:31.639> and

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
less means you don't have any homes and

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.760 
less means you don't have any homes and
fear<00:05:33.440> less<00:05:33.919> means<00:05:34.430> you<00:05:34.550> don't<00:05:34.699> have<00:05:34.729> any<00:05:34.969> fear

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
fear less means you don't have any fear

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.469 
fear less means you don't have any fear
shouldn't<00:05:36.770> reckless<00:05:37.490> me<00:05:37.879> you<00:05:38.000> don't<00:05:38.180> have<00:05:38.300> any

shouldn't reckless me you don't have any
wrecks<00:05:40.389> and<00:05:41.389> I<00:05:41.659> thought<00:05:41.930> that<00:05:42.110> was<00:05:42.229> a<00:05:42.289> good

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
wrecks and I thought that was a good

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.930 
wrecks and I thought that was a good
thing<00:05:42.800> when<00:05:42.919> you're<00:05:43.099> driving<00:05:43.370> not<00:05:43.669> to<00:05:43.789> have
