her hair bring down all the way to the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.510 
her hair bring down all the way to the
bottom<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> hair<00:01:09.659> curling<00:01:10.500> iron<00:01:10.680> then

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520

particularly<00:01:26.460> Kurt<00:01:27.030> Crowley<00:01:28.020> iron<00:01:28.200> usually

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
particularly Kurt Crowley iron usually

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.359 
particularly Kurt Crowley iron usually
takes<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.909> while<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.869> curl<00:01:31.500> her<00:01:31.680> hair<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.189> curl

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
takes a while to curl her hair to curl

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.429 
takes a while to curl her hair to curl
hair<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:33.590> don't<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.680> why<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.720> does<00:01:36.780> so

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
hair I don't know why it just does so

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.440 
hair I don't know why it just does so
and<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.979> doesn't<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> heating<00:01:39.000> he

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
and it doesn't really have a heating he
he<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:42.860> heat<00:01:45.110> no<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.140> can't<00:01:46.740> think<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
he like heat no I can't think of the

word<00:01:48.560> phallic<00:01:50.930> setting<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:53.630> yeah<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> doesn't

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
word phallic setting so yeah it doesn't

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.929

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
just has on and off so I don't really

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.160 
just has on and off so I don't really
know<00:01:59.700> what<00:01:59.880> temperature<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.540> currently

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
know what temperature this currently

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.639 
know what temperature this currently
iron<00:02:01.320> heats<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:03.259> probably<00:02:04.259> held<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
iron heats up to probably held that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.080 
iron heats up to probably held that
