00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.160
 Difference 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.160
 Lurking e-free 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.230
 ana 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.230
 Oh Oh 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.360
 Really 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.510
 It is still warm today Arthur 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.860
 This is the cold one is lanes 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.860
 But you think the witch 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:36.120
 Yeah yeah line network because the king like the cormorant 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:40.170
 But late at night the chilly station 7 cans bulk is the best is to drive 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.550
 I feel warm now compared to that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.430
 It is better than Mr. Oetama 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.350
 If you compare much of 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.579
 The vegetables and drinks that have not been stored in the storage room are frozen with no more than one 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.089
 Barn 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.430
 Not open unless of course over the meaning of the window 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.570
 a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:07.190
 It is not cold nor snow 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.380
 It is that snow doesn't melt and it takes time for money and time to remove snow . 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.560
 The power of the king like 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:19.149
 Call me if you lend me more 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.149
 This is not an easy solution as it gets in the way 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.570
 It is so hard to live in a cold country 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.460
 That is why the ties between the people are strong 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.460
 Close to other towns 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.509
 Oh my God come not Iran, such as the Tokaa 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.509
 Unreasonable 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:53.730
 If I 'm trained I'll fight against such things while walking around outside with my short sleeves when I 'm in my twenties 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.010
 I was holding the ice pillar instead of ice candy 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.040
 But I got used everything 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.890
 I think that Rudger is strong against the cold 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:11.610
 If so, let us show you the best places to save 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:14.670
 When I was a kid, it was a very cold wolf that I called a secret base and made a huge pillow. 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.940
 Only the local people know only 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.490
 There are many places of interest in Kanbaruk 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.560
 Rouge Uh 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.970
 After all 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.970
 I'm a great person
