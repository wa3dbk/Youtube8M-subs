this machine is easy to operate first we

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.760 
this machine is easy to operate first we
select<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:17.980> gun<00:00:18.189> and<00:00:18.970> then<00:00:19.480> we<00:00:20.290> select<00:00:20.500> the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
select the gun and then we select the

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.929 
select the gun and then we select the
material<00:00:21.450> whatever<00:00:22.450> material<00:00:23.410> program<00:00:24.010> we

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
time and the power if you need to adjust

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.209 
time and the power if you need to adjust
additional<00:00:46.329> time<00:00:46.570> and<00:00:46.600> power<00:00:47.050> we<00:00:47.739> can<00:00:47.920> do<00:00:48.100> this

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
additional time and power we can do this

00:00:48.219 --> 00:01:00.520 
additional time and power we can do this
on<00:00:48.399> a<00:00:51.329> clean<00:00:52.329> world<00:00:52.780> can<00:00:53.230> be<00:00:53.440> achieved

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.560 

this<00:01:01.530> machine<00:01:01.950> will<00:01:02.130> will<00:01:02.340> 20<00:01:02.910> millimeters

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
this machine will will 20 millimeters

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:18.690 
this machine will will 20 millimeters
sheet<00:01:04.020> metal's<00:01:04.500> together<00:01:05.040> easily

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.630 

as<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.450> can<00:01:19.600> see<00:01:19.869> that<00:01:20.369> penetration<00:01:21.369> is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
as you can see that penetration is

00:01:21.640 --> 00:02:20.480 
as you can see that penetration is
excellent

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.540 

now<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.550> world<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.090> going<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.420> be<00:02:22.600> tested

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.760 

as<00:02:26.820> we<00:02:27.330> can<00:02:27.540> see<00:02:27.750> we<00:02:27.990> are<00:02:28.020> pulling<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> sheet

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
as we can see we are pulling the sheet

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.410 
as we can see we are pulling the sheet
metal's<00:02:29.250> away<00:02:31.340> when<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.490> world<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.910> properly

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
metal's away when the world is properly

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.070 
metal's away when the world is properly
done<00:02:33.690> where<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.650> welding<00:02:35.010> occurred<00:02:35.870> will<00:02:36.870> be

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
done where the welding occurred will be

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.390 
done where the welding occurred will be
burned<00:02:37.380> either<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.310> material<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:40.500> there

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
burned either of material so there

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.560 
burned either of material so there
should<00:02:41.640> be<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> hole<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.450> one<00:02:42.990> sheet<00:02:43.440> metal<00:02:44.570> so

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
should be a hole in one sheet metal so

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.650 
should be a hole in one sheet metal so
it's<00:02:45.750> getting<00:02:46.050> pulled<00:02:46.320> now<00:02:46.880> slowly<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:48.630> are

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
it's getting pulled now slowly we are

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.780 
it's getting pulled now slowly we are
getting<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.140> very<00:02:49.740> important<00:02:52.100> as<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.520> see

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
getting it very important as you can see

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.720 
getting it very important as you can see
it's<00:02:53.970> tearing<00:02:54.440> it's<00:02:55.440> tearing<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
it's tearing it's tearing and the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.900 
it's tearing it's tearing and the
welding<00:02:57.120> part<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:58.260> in<00:02:58.860> one<00:02:59.160> side<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.760> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
welding part is in one side of the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.870 
welding part is in one side of the
material<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:01.290> as<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.520> there's<00:03:02.790> a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
material and as you can see there's a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.280 
material and as you can see there's a
hole<00:03:03.120> coming<00:03:03.450> around<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:09.540> welding<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:09.990> so

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
hole coming around now the welding is so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:43.699 
hole coming around now the welding is so
strong<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:11.240> material<00:03:12.240> is<00:03:12.360> being<00:03:12.600> stripped

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.440 

now<00:03:44.709> we<00:03:44.770> are<00:03:45.069> going<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.430> operate<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.940> single

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.959 
Paula as you know it's in spot-welding
you<00:04:42.789> need<00:04:42.999> to<00:04:43.209> have<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:43.599> pressure<00:04:44.069> time<00:04:45.069> and

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969 
you need to have the pressure time and

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.259 
you need to have the pressure time and
the<00:04:46.149> power<00:04:47.069> so<00:04:48.069> the<00:04:48.219> pressure<00:04:48.489> is<00:04:48.759> given<00:04:48.939> by

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
travels all the way up to 30 which

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.329 
travels all the way up to 30 which

our<00:06:21.590> tests<00:06:21.949> will<00:06:22.610> now<00:06:22.940> be<00:06:23.479> performed<00:06:24.340> showing

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
our tests will now be performed showing

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.309 
our tests will now be performed showing
that<00:06:25.580> the<00:06:26.000> arm<00:06:26.330> is<00:06:26.569> not<00:06:26.810> hot<00:06:28.389> right<00:06:29.389> thank<00:06:30.229> you

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 
that the arm is not hot right thank you

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.619 
that the arm is not hot right thank you
for<00:06:30.530> watching<00:06:30.889> EasyBib<00:06:31.280> what<00:06:32.090> it<00:06:32.240> does<00:06:32.449> and

for watching EasyBib what it does and

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:34.990 
for watching EasyBib what it does and
inverters<00:06:33.169> controller<00:06:33.590> system<00:06:34.039> we<00:06:34.789> will<00:06:34.940> be

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
inverters controller system we will be

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.089 
inverters controller system we will be
bringing<00:06:35.479> more<00:06:35.690> and<00:06:35.750> more<00:06:35.900> videos<00:06:36.409> in<00:06:36.620> gucchy

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
bringing more and more videos in gucchy

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.620 
bringing more and more videos in gucchy
what<00:06:37.669> we<00:06:37.849> can<00:06:38.030> join<00:06:38.210> with<00:06:38.240> us<00:06:38.599> thank<00:06:39.560> you
