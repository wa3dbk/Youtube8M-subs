the<00:01:52.590> very<00:01:52.740> first<00:01:52.950> these<00:01:53.310> which<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.729> marked<00:01:54.000> by

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the very first these which is marked by

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.429 
the very first these which is marked by
those<00:01:54.240> big<00:01:54.479> dots<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.990> that's<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.380> they

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
those big dots and that's what they

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.499 
those big dots and that's what they
represent<00:01:55.890> those<00:01:56.700> little<00:01:56.969> graph<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.299> here

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
represent those little graph up here

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.030 
represent those little graph up here
actually<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:58.380> shows<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.799> bass

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
actually just shows you all the bass

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.289 
actually just shows you all the bass
these<00:01:59.729> spikes<00:02:00.320> all<00:02:01.320> base<00:02:01.759> if<00:02:02.759> i<00:02:02.969> move<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
these spikes all base if i move the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.840 
these spikes all base if i move the
track<00:02:03.509> over<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.930> where<00:02:04.079> there's<00:02:04.229> no<00:02:04.350> kicks

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
track over to where there's no kicks

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.940 
track over to where there's no kicks
there's<00:02:05.850> no<00:02:06.659> there's<00:02:07.170> no<00:02:07.200> spikes<00:02:07.530> there's<00:02:07.829> no

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
there's no there's no spikes there's no

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.820 
there's no there's no spikes there's no
base<00:02:08.270> this<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.450> used<00:02:09.660> because<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.349> program

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
base this is used because this program

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.530 
base this is used because this program
assumes<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.849> don't<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.270> headphones

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
assumes that you don't have headphones

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.520 
assumes that you don't have headphones
so<00:02:13.230> you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.020 
so you
actually<00:02:13.890> hear<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.100> next<00:02:14.220> track<00:02:14.520> over<00:02:14.790> here

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
actually hear the next track over here

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.190 
actually hear the next track over here
so<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:17.130> kind<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.400> use<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:18.600> figure<00:02:19.050> out

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so you kind of use that to figure out

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.270 
so you kind of use that to figure out
where<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.560> next<00:02:19.770> time<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.950> might<00:02:20.040> want<00:02:20.220> to

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
where in the next time you might want to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.949 
where in the next time you might want to
line<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.430> up<00:02:20.580> because<00:02:20.760> most<00:02:21.090> DJ's<00:02:21.450> they<00:02:21.720> may

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
line it up because most DJ's they may

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.020 
line it up because most DJ's they may
not<00:02:22.470> want<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.770> start<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> very<00:02:23.220> beginning<00:02:23.819> but

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
not want to start the very beginning but

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.220 
not want to start the very beginning but
maybe<00:02:24.209> start<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.630> very<00:02:24.750> first<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.140> these

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
maybe start on the very first of these

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.100 
maybe start on the very first of these
bass<00:02:26.190> kicks<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:27.330> that's<00:02:27.569> how<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:27.900> get<00:02:27.990> to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
bass kicks so that's how you can get to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.360 
bass kicks so that's how you can get to
that<00:02:28.140> really<00:02:28.410> quick<00:02:28.620> without<00:02:28.920> actually

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
that really quick without actually

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.190 
that really quick without actually
having<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.610> hear<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.630> if<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.870> know<00:02:31.020> your

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
having to hear it so if you know your

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170 
having to hear it so if you know your
song<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.890> very<00:02:32.010> well<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.580> can<00:02:32.790> pretty<00:02:33.060> much

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
song is very well you can pretty much

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.420 
song is very well you can pretty much
tell<00:02:33.540> where<00:02:33.720> everything<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.280> in

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
tell where everything is if you know in

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.949 
tell where everything is if you know in
this<00:02:35.550> one<00:02:35.790> part<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> song<00:02:36.360> right<00:02:36.930> here

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
this one part of the song right here

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.229 
this one part of the song right here
that<00:02:37.470> there's<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.830> drop<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.430> know<00:02:38.730> which<00:02:39.030> right

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
that there's a drop you know which right

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.840 
that there's a drop you know which right
here<00:02:39.480> there's<00:02:39.780> no<00:02:39.930> bass<00:02:40.200> kicks<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.850> will

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
here there's no bass kicks and you will

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.309 
here there's no bass kicks and you will
have<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> pretty<00:02:42.510> rough<00:02:42.600> idea<00:02:42.900> about<00:02:43.140> where

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
have a pretty rough idea about where

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.220 
have a pretty rough idea about where
it's<00:02:43.440> supposed<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.739> belong<00:02:44.959> but<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.140> to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
it's supposed to belong but you have to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.420 
it's supposed to belong but you have to
know<00:02:46.320> your<00:02:46.380> music<00:02:46.680> very<00:02:46.830> well<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.100> do<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.280> like

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
know your music very well to do it like

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.860 
know your music very well to do it like
this<00:02:48.500> they<00:02:49.500> also<00:02:49.650> think<00:02:49.920> about<00:02:50.720> mixing<00:02:51.720> is

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
this they also think about mixing is

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.060 
this they also think about mixing is
that<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.350> lot<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.680> different<00:02:52.769> things

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
that you have a lot of different things

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.740 
that you have a lot of different things
to<00:02:53.160> take<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.430> consideration<00:02:53.519> like<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.570> on

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
to take in consideration like this on

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.600 
to take in consideration like this on
right<00:02:54.870> here<00:02:55.140> if<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.709> go<00:02:55.920> ahead<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.100> start<00:02:56.430> from

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
right here if I go ahead and start from

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.110 
right here if I go ahead and start from
the<00:02:56.730> beginning<00:02:57.650> it's<00:02:58.650> very<00:02:58.800> basic<00:02:59.370> it's<00:03:00.000> a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the beginning it's very basic it's a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.699 
the beginning it's very basic it's a
little<00:03:00.239> up<00:03:00.510> be<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.900> sense<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.560> doesn't

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
little up be in a sense like it doesn't

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.920 
little up be in a sense like it doesn't
sound<00:03:01.890> very<00:03:02.100> dark<00:03:02.430> or<00:03:02.580> anything<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.239> speed<00:03:03.900> it

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
sound very dark or anything I speed it

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.180 
sound very dark or anything I speed it
up<00:03:05.030> if<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.690> get<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.959> feel<00:03:07.260> for<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.560> music<00:03:07.920> it's

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
up if you get a feel for the music it's

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.520 
up if you get a feel for the music it's
not<00:03:08.430> too<00:03:09.300> strong<00:03:09.569> it's<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:09.959> funky<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.440> it's

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
not too strong it's just funky and it's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.280 
not too strong it's just funky and it's
nice<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.390> kind<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.900> keep<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
nice and you kind of have to keep the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.930 
nice and you kind of have to keep the
flow<00:03:13.500> going<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:14.069> way<00:03:14.250> that's<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> most

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
flow going that way that's the most

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.630 
flow going that way that's the most
important<00:03:15.420> fact<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.870> got<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.170> keep<00:03:16.640> getting

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
important fact you got to keep getting

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.280 
important fact you got to keep getting
the<00:03:17.700> flow<00:03:17.880> go<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.239> certain<00:03:18.390> direction<00:03:18.510> or

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
the flow go in a certain direction or

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.740 
the flow go in a certain direction or
don't<00:03:19.860> make<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.160> too<00:03:20.250> drastic<00:03:20.850> like<00:03:21.090> you

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
don't make it too drastic like you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.390 
don't make it too drastic like you
probably<00:03:22.260> would<00:03:22.500> not<00:03:22.650> want<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:22.920> fit<00:03:23.130> anything

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
probably would not want to fit anything

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.199 
probably would not want to fit anything
to<00:03:24.980> way<00:03:25.980> too<00:03:26.040> different<00:03:26.640> from<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:26.940> is

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
to way too different from this is

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.430 
to way too different from this is
basically<00:03:27.540> what<00:03:27.720> I'm<00:03:27.780> saying<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.170> don't<00:03:28.320> want

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
basically what I'm saying you don't want

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.960 
basically what I'm saying you don't want
to<00:03:28.530> put<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.070> probably<00:03:29.489> wouldn't<00:03:29.670> want<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.880> fit

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
to put you probably wouldn't want to fit

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.190 
to put you probably wouldn't want to fit
death<00:03:30.180> punk<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.540> top<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:30.900> because<00:03:31.110> it

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
death punk on top of this because it

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.170 
death punk on top of this because it
would<00:03:31.290> just<00:03:31.440> sound<00:03:31.560> too<00:03:31.980> happy<00:03:32.220> or<00:03:32.610> too<00:03:32.850> funky

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
would just sound too happy or too funky

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.729 
would just sound too happy or too funky
or<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:33.600> two<00:03:33.690> different<00:03:33.840> just<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.350> really<00:03:34.530> mix

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
or just two different just to really mix

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.090 
or just two different just to really mix
into<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.100> really<00:03:35.340> well<00:03:35.959> this<00:03:36.959> song<00:03:37.260> isn't

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
into this really well this song isn't

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.170 
into this really well this song isn't
too<00:03:38.400> different<00:03:38.610> from<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.060> one<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:42.060> know

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
too different from this one you know

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.090 
too different from this one you know
very<00:03:42.209> basic<00:03:42.840> if<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.290> speed<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.560> up<00:03:43.709> toward<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
very basic if I speed it up toward the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.599 
very basic if I speed it up toward the
middle<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:46.019> has<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.680> basic<00:03:47.100> bass<00:03:47.340> pattern

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
middle it has that basic bass pattern

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.500 
middle it has that basic bass pattern
and<00:03:49.130> this<00:03:50.130> song<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.579> a<00:03:50.670> little<00:03:50.790> bit<00:03:51.060> darker<00:03:51.209> and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
and this song is a little bit darker and

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.449 
and this song is a little bit darker and
a<00:03:51.540> little<00:03:51.570> more<00:03:51.780> deep<00:03:52.019> than<00:03:52.049> this<00:03:52.350> one<00:03:52.620> that's

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
a little more deep than this one that's

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.009 
a little more deep than this one that's
another<00:03:53.670> thing<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.420> also<00:03:54.600> kind<00:03:54.959> of

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
another thing is that you also kind of

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
where it kind of progressively gets more

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.690 
where it kind of progressively gets more
and<00:03:58.920> more<00:03:59.010> climatic<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:01.070> on<00:04:02.070> top<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.400> you

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
you don't really want to change the BPM

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.860

while<00:04:30.740> it's<00:04:30.890> playing<00:04:31.070> this<00:04:31.850> is<00:04:32.000> why<00:04:32.180> let<00:04:32.810> me

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
while it's playing this is why let me

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.960 
while it's playing this is why let me
speed<00:04:33.080> up<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.320> song<00:04:36.340> see<00:04:37.660> its<00:04:38.660> pitch<00:04:38.840> shifting

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880

and that really ruins the rest of the
song<00:04:44.060> on<00:04:44.270> people<00:04:44.540> trying<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.810> listen<00:04:45.110> in<00:04:45.200> just

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:32.329 
and then I can pick the right moment to

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:38.009 
and then I can pick the right moment to
fade<00:05:32.509> out<00:05:32.659> of<00:05:32.749> this<00:05:36.369> sounds<00:05:37.369> pretty<00:05:37.399> flawless
