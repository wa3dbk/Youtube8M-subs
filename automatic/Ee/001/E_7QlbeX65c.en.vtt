00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.290
 Vitor carvalho speaks with another one

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.120
 video is the first video of the happy year 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.830
 New year for everyone I wish mine. 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.310
 my wishes for happiness is everyone 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.400
 that I wanted to travel to 2014 in the last 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.330
 then proof of year please visit there 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.880
 you will know 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.890
 The people, I want to thank you all here. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.210
 Wished me improvements as you can see 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.920
 still so bad in the throat was that 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.599
 not having the live and I 'm just going back 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.010
 to do there and when his throat is 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.380
 Good, but it's only the case that you're doing. 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.660
 Another thing Galera show responded to 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.070
 questions the guys have been doing then 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.320
 now that you have arrived and how are you? 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.000
 draw paper not lonely paper so 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.100
 I do not know when I'll do the drawing first. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.039
 realistic and I am now very focused on the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.680
 with the cast because 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.620
 First thing for me, this pen here. 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.280
 is equal to her 00.50 17 who used the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.039
 channel way with own equals and the role and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.979
 that used to use 4 to 3 in the inter is if 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.380
 It's just okay, and I'm not going to change anything in the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.970
 channel with respect to this 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.770
 there came not to avoid but my comment 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.479
 Dad can not afford it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.159
 with a package that I told you 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.490
 They bought and buy a couple of fronts 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.310
 buy an icon like I said it here 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.619
 It will only replace me but it will be 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.240
 like you're saying paper and mon is 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.979
 with her the first one but nothing is certain that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.450
 It will make things easier for you and the life of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.740
 you two things 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.350
 before we had problems with 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.659
 light when the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.420
 Graphite is my hand when it was in the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.500
 front was also a big problem 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.540
 crowded with comments from people talking 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.060
 I saw so much shot at the front I need to see the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.130
 drawing as critic on the front was 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.020
 drawn now will not be a problem 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.729
 because you will see the screen and you will not 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.920
 lives in carbonita explain to you 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.570
 I did not have it right before either 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.630
 Look, for example, if I 'm going to do it now. 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.810
 a very simple drawing we will go 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.129
 able to make a very basic drawing 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.450
 right here without much freshness because 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.900
 people are drawing like they are 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.970
 on paper we can do everything here 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.910
 no problem 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.209
 without any problem that we can 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.910
 do everything right here very simple here 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.420
 very easy but today's class is for this 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.709
 class today is to teach or give some 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.760
 tips for you regarding 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.140
 coordination 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.239
 I know there are a lot of people with this problem. 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.130
 and is a great way to start the year that 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.450
 us 18 days since we do not have 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.819
 video on the channel and eight days ago 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.250
 difference to the designer without taking the 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.330
 paper without drawing the pen without drawing 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.760
 nothing without 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.410
 So let's train a little, you have to 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.620
 do the exercise that way even if 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.720
 the galley clean traits is not to do 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.590
 below how I'm going to do it now is like this 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.700
 what do you have to do? 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.799
 Not so, okay, it 's not for doing this. 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.510
 so it is not good if you do not 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:09.220
 is training collection clean traces and 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.340
 also the singer 's to be crooked 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.260
 even train their coordination 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.150
 start training and seeing that I do not 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.680
 I'm totally supporting my brother, yes. 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.040
 I touched my hand but I'm not 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.989
 supporting me, if not my hand goes there 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.940
 I want a back and if it has to 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.299
 total strength she will not then I 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.790
 I have to close the right free hand and have 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.480
 other exercises there what you can 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.480
 do too 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.780
 but I know how to do more serious talk than 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.889
 There is a choice, my people were born and 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.900
 thinks it is a little silly that it is 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.260
 if you want to improve a lot if you do 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.100
 this at least once a day 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.680
 xis win is xd so oxy goes too 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.069
 help a lot 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.829
 it's easier, so do not stay 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.690
 annual fresh since lost child 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.209
 to school 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.680
 only then about the lord of the preschool 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.489
 I'm sorry to the family, too. 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.489
 negative increase 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.180
 your preschool price and knows a lot 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:19.299
 of coordination 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.299
 this will help your drawing a lot 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.760
 so I tried there I saw that it improved a lot 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.370
 your drawing has other exercises here 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:34.010
 I also do not know where to go. 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:36.170
 where will you try in the good description then 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.040
 while tool did not have good people 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.300

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.270
 Thank you very much to everyone who 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.670
