you're going to see you guys collide and
your<00:01:14.520> drags<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.299> wide<00:01:15.750> open<00:01:16.640> this<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.820> really

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
your drags are wide open this is really

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.880

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
consistent it works just about every

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.710 
consistent it works just about every
single<00:01:20.070> time<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.600> replay

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
single time as you can see on the replay

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.010 
single time as you can see on the replay
here<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.159> said<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.549> key<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.420> getting

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
here like I said the key here is getting

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.789 
here like I said the key here is getting
a<00:01:25.490> Byron<00:01:26.490> Maxwell<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:27.090> picked<00:01:27.450> off<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
a Byron Maxwell here picked off and the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.310 
a Byron Maxwell here picked off and the
way<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.159> works<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.479> swing

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
way this works is because that swing

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 
way this works is because that swing
route<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.770> Jews<00:01:32.009> check<00:01:32.220> runs<00:01:32.520> he's<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
route that Jews check runs he's going to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.499 
route that Jews check runs he's going to
collide<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.049> linebacker<00:01:34.320> every<00:01:35.040> time

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
collide with that linebacker every time

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.240 
collide with that linebacker every time
so<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.500> man<00:01:37.829> coverage

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
so I can see as you can see man coverage

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.560 
so I can see as you can see man coverage
he's<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> collide<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.299> that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
he's going to collide with that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.080 
he's going to collide with that
linebacker<00:01:40.520> KJ<00:01:41.520> Wright<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> hit

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
there you go and I'm tackled by the guy

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.700 
there you go and I'm tackled by the guy
covering<00:02:11.690> but<00:02:11.840> our<00:02:11.930> peers<00:02:12.230> because<00:02:12.350> i<00:02:12.530> didn't

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
covering but our peers because i didn't

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.320 
covering but our peers because i didn't
put<00:02:12.800> bring<00:02:13.010> our<00:02:13.100> peers<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.670> different<00:02:14.120> route

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.030 

here's<00:02:17.330> one<00:02:17.660> more<00:02:17.870> example<00:02:18.350> i<00:02:18.560> think<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:18.890> is

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
here's one more example i think this is

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.600 
here's one more example i think this is
the<00:02:19.130> one<00:02:19.220> where<00:02:19.370> he<00:02:19.520> gets<00:02:19.700> picked<00:02:19.940> real<00:02:20.330> good

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the one where he gets picked real good

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.270 
the one where he gets picked real good
nope<00:02:22.610> it's<00:02:22.820> not<00:02:22.880> but<00:02:23.480> as<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.960> can<00:02:24.050> see<00:02:24.260> lots<00:02:25.010> of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
nope it's not but as you can see lots of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.120 
nope it's not but as you can see lots of
open<00:02:25.610> field<00:02:25.850> easy<00:02:26.210> first<00:02:26.630> down<00:02:26.960> 10<00:02:27.530> plus<00:02:27.830> yards

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
open field easy first down 10 plus yards

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.270 
open field easy first down 10 plus yards
a<00:02:28.570> very<00:02:29.570> very<00:02:29.990> good<00:02:30.320> play<00:02:30.709> against<00:02:31.040> someone

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280
