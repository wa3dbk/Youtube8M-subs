here<00:03:39.109> to<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:40.190> manifold<00:03:40.669> intake<00:03:41.000> runner

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
here to the manifold intake runner

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.900 
here to the manifold intake runner
control<00:03:41.660> solenoid<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:43.730> vacuum

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
control solenoid so this is the vacuum

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.390 
control solenoid so this is the vacuum
source<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.870> as<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.500> can<00:03:45.680> see<00:03:45.919> we've<00:03:46.130> got<00:03:46.340> a

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
source and as you can see we've got a

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.940 
source and as you can see we've got a
crack<00:03:46.790> in<00:03:46.819> it<00:03:47.209> so<00:03:47.959> with<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.380> crack<00:03:48.709> in<00:03:48.919> that

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
crack in it so with that crack in that

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.640 
crack in it so with that crack in that
hose<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.760> can't<00:03:50.209> draw<00:03:50.450> vacuum<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.410> cell

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
hose it can't draw vacuum so the cell

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.940 
hose it can't draw vacuum so the cell
enoyed<00:03:51.950> won't<00:03:52.310> work<00:03:52.669> so<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:54.079> repair<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.500> very

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
enoyed won't work so the repair is very

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.479 
enoyed won't work so the repair is very
simple<00:03:55.370> just<00:03:55.579> to<00:03:55.760> replace<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.389> hose<00:03:57.430> now<00:03:58.430> to

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
simple just to replace this hose now to

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.339 
simple just to replace this hose now to
replace<00:03:58.880> this<00:03:59.180> it's<00:03:59.450> actually<00:03:59.569> pretty<00:04:00.049> simple

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
replace this it's actually pretty simple

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.650 
replace this it's actually pretty simple
you<00:04:01.010> just<00:04:01.250> pull<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.519> vacuum<00:04:01.849> line<00:04:02.030> off<00:04:02.209> here

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
you just pull the vacuum line off here

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.539 
you just pull the vacuum line off here
and<00:04:02.810> there's<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.500> little<00:04:03.680> keeper<00:04:04.099> fort<00:04:04.400> right

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
and there's a little keeper fort right

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.750 
and there's a little keeper fort right
there<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:04.940> pop<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.329> out<00:04:06.340> then<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.459> can<00:04:07.609> reach

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
there you pop it out then you can reach

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.409 
there you pop it out then you can reach
down<00:04:08.030> here<00:04:08.299> to<00:04:08.419> the<00:04:08.540> cell<00:04:08.780> enoyed<00:04:09.109> a<00:04:10.269> lot<00:04:11.269> off

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
down here to the cell enoyed a lot off

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.140 
down here to the cell enoyed a lot off
of<00:04:11.450> there<00:04:12.519> now<00:04:13.519> the<00:04:13.579> one<00:04:13.790> thing<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.120> remember

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
of there now the one thing to remember

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.810 
of there now the one thing to remember
and<00:04:15.049> make<00:04:15.379> note<00:04:15.620> of<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:15.949> has<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.310> be<00:04:16.430> routed

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
and make note of this has to be routed

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.250 
and make note of this has to be routed
right<00:04:17.000> so<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:17.419> it<00:04:17.539> doesn't<00:04:17.900> melt<00:04:18.049> on

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
right so that it doesn't melt on

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.259 
right so that it doesn't melt on
something<00:04:18.680> hot<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.220> you<00:04:19.639> can<00:04:19.820> see<00:04:20.000> how<00:04:20.120> it's

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
something hot and you can see how it's

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.390 
something hot and you can see how it's
kind<00:04:20.479> of<00:04:20.539> tucked<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:21.019> right<00:04:21.049> here<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:22.130> need<00:04:22.310> to

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
kind of tucked in right here you need to

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.270 
kind of tucked in right here you need to
put<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.729> new<00:04:22.880> one<00:04:23.060> back<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.690> way<00:04:23.900> and

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
put the new one back in that way and

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.520 
put the new one back in that way and
then<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:25.460> can<00:04:25.639> just<00:04:25.820> simply<00:04:26.000> pull<00:04:26.419> your<00:04:26.719> hose

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
then you can just simply pull your hose

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.149 
then you can just simply pull your hose
out<00:04:28.750> now<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.810> can<00:04:30.050> see<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.349> crack<00:04:30.620> as<00:04:30.860> we<00:04:31.010> kind

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
out now you can see the crack as we kind

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.850 
out now you can see the crack as we kind
of<00:04:31.280> spread

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
of spread

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.580 
of spread
a little<00:04:32.129> bit<00:04:32.780> it's<00:04:33.780> just<00:04:33.870> standard<00:04:34.379> vacuum

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
a little bit it's just standard vacuum

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.379 
a little bit it's just standard vacuum
hose<00:04:35.009> so<00:04:35.189> just<00:04:35.430> go<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.610> your<00:04:35.729> parts<00:04:36.030> store<00:04:36.300> you

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
hose so just go to your parts store you

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.360 
hose so just go to your parts store you
might<00:04:36.509> want<00:04:36.719> to<00:04:36.750> take<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:36.930> with<00:04:37.259> them<00:04:37.439> so

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
might want to take that with them so

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.830 
might want to take that with them so
that<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.610> get<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:38.879> right<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.150> same<00:04:39.330> diameter

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
that you get the right the same diameter

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.080 
that you get the right the same diameter
hose<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:41.219> just<00:04:41.430> need<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.699> get<00:04:41.819> a<00:04:41.849> piece<00:04:42.030> of

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
hose and you just need to get a piece of

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.950 
hose and you just need to get a piece of
that<00:04:42.240> it's<00:04:42.870> alright<00:04:43.229> if<00:04:43.379> it<00:04:43.530> curls<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.960> then

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
that it's alright if it curls and then

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.189 
that it's alright if it curls and then
we<00:04:46.080> put<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.349> back<00:04:46.439> on<00:04:46.710> now<00:04:47.629> we<00:04:48.629> take<00:04:48.870> our<00:04:49.080> new

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
we put it back on now we take our new

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.809 
we put it back on now we take our new
piece<00:04:49.409> of<00:04:49.439> hose<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.039> probably<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.460> hardest

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
piece of hose and probably the hardest

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.059 
piece of hose and probably the hardest
part<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.180> this<00:04:51.270> job<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.810> getting<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:52.889> go

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
part of this job is getting it to go

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.339 
part of this job is getting it to go
back<00:04:53.460> behind<00:04:53.729> and<00:04:54.300> then<00:04:54.539> out<00:04:54.719> front<00:04:55.110> again

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
back behind and then out front again

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.740 
back behind and then out front again
because<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.430> hose<00:04:56.580> just<00:04:56.879> has<00:04:57.030> no<00:04:57.210> play<00:04:57.479> once

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
because the hose just has no play once

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.899 
because the hose just has no play once
you<00:04:57.870> get<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.139> back<00:04:58.259> there<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:59.340> short<00:04:59.610> cut<00:04:59.819> I

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
you get it back there so short cut I

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.089 
you get it back there so short cut I
found<00:05:00.240> on<00:05:00.389> something<00:05:00.960> like<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.379> is<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.949> take

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
found on something like that is to take

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:03.649 
found on something like that is to take
a<00:05:02.159> little<00:05:02.310> power<00:05:02.610> loop<00:05:02.909> and<00:05:03.090> spray<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.360> into<00:05:03.509> a

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
a little power loop and spray it into a

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.170 
a little power loop and spray it into a
rag<00:05:03.900> and<00:05:04.289> then<00:05:05.189> just<00:05:05.370> take<00:05:05.520> any<00:05:05.729> kind<00:05:05.939> of<00:05:06.060> a

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
rag and then just take any kind of a

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.659 
rag and then just take any kind of a
wire<00:05:06.509> that<00:05:06.960> you've<00:05:07.169> got<00:05:07.379> and<00:05:07.650> just<00:05:07.680> lubricate

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
wire that you've got and just lubricate

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.350 
wire that you've got and just lubricate
that<00:05:08.699> wire<00:05:10.610> then<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.789> can<00:05:11.939> just<00:05:12.150> take<00:05:12.330> your

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
that wire then you can just take your

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.830 
that wire then you can just take your
hose<00:05:12.719> and<00:05:13.099> slide<00:05:14.099> it<00:05:14.279> on<00:05:14.430> that<00:05:14.610> wire<00:05:14.849> makes<00:05:15.719> a

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
hose and slide it on that wire makes a

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.100 
hose and slide it on that wire makes a
lot<00:05:15.960> easier<00:05:16.319> to<00:05:16.469> work<00:05:16.590> with<00:05:17.599> now<00:05:18.599> we<00:05:18.659> just<00:05:18.930> need

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
lot easier to work with now we just need

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.450 
lot easier to work with now we just need
to<00:05:19.229> bend<00:05:19.409> it<00:05:19.560> into<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.860> curve<00:05:21.949> so<00:05:22.949> it'll<00:05:23.310> go

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
to bend it into a curve so it'll go

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:32.209 
to bend it into a curve so it'll go
around<00:05:27.800> but<00:05:28.800> just<00:05:29.009> insert<00:05:29.580> it<00:05:29.610> in<00:05:29.879> here<00:05:31.219> wrap

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
around but just insert it in here wrap

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.980 
around but just insert it in here wrap
it<00:05:32.370> around<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:32.699> back<00:05:34.639> and<00:05:35.690> get<00:05:36.690> it<00:05:36.779> to<00:05:36.870> where

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
it around the back and get it to where

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.839 
it around the back and get it to where
to<00:05:37.080> come<00:05:37.259> out<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.560> front<00:05:43.310> once<00:05:44.310> we<00:05:44.460> get<00:05:44.580> it<00:05:44.759> out

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
to come out the front once we get it out

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.779 
to come out the front once we get it out
where<00:05:45.029> we<00:05:45.180> can<00:05:45.300> get<00:05:45.479> to<00:05:45.690> it<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.159> just<00:05:47.159> pull<00:05:47.699> the

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
where we can get to it and just pull the

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.869 
where we can get to it and just pull the
wire<00:05:47.969> from<00:05:48.360> out<00:05:48.539> from<00:05:48.930> under<00:05:49.199> it<00:05:49.550> and<00:05:50.550> your

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
wire from out from under it and your

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.559 
wire from out from under it and your
hoses<00:05:51.089> around<00:05:51.599> it<00:05:52.819> then<00:05:53.819> we<00:05:54.089> need<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.360> wrap

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
hoses around it then we need to wrap

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:59.180 
hoses around it then we need to wrap
down<00:05:54.779> to<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.139> solenoid<00:05:57.560> so<00:05:58.560> we<00:05:58.680> take<00:05:58.860> our<00:05:59.039> hose

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
down to the solenoid so we take our hose

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.129 
down to the solenoid so we take our hose
and<00:05:59.520> just<00:05:59.990> slide<00:06:00.990> it<00:06:01.110> right<00:06:01.169> on<00:06:01.439> the<00:06:01.560> solenoid

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
and just slide it right on the solenoid

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.510 
and just slide it right on the solenoid
and<00:06:04.139> then<00:06:04.349> we<00:06:04.409> need<00:06:04.560> to<00:06:04.680> tuck<00:06:04.889> it<00:06:05.039> back<00:06:05.159> into

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
and then we need to tuck it back into

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.059 
and then we need to tuck it back into
these<00:06:05.669> little<00:06:05.990> indentations<00:06:06.990> to<00:06:07.620> keep<00:06:07.800> it<00:06:07.949> in

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:08.069 
these little indentations to keep it in

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:14.059 
these little indentations to keep it in
place<00:06:11.449> and<00:06:12.449> then<00:06:12.629> our<00:06:12.719> hose<00:06:12.930> is<00:06:13.199> coming<00:06:13.770> out<00:06:13.889> to

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 
place and then our hose is coming out to

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.480 
place and then our hose is coming out to
front<00:06:15.529> we've<00:06:16.529> got<00:06:16.560> a<00:06:16.740> little<00:06:17.009> keeper<00:06:17.339> down

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
front we've got a little keeper down

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.129 
front we've got a little keeper down
here<00:06:17.789> to<00:06:17.909> put<00:06:18.060> it<00:06:18.180> in<00:06:18.710> and<00:06:20.300> then<00:06:21.300> it<00:06:21.629> just<00:06:21.839> plugs

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
here to put it in and then it just plugs

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:34.150 
here to put it in and then it just plugs
right<00:06:22.379> in<00:06:24.949> should<00:06:25.949> be<00:06:25.979> all<00:06:26.189> set

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160
