privileged<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.330> they<00:03:30.450> come<00:03:30.690> together<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.380> it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
privileged and they come together and it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.620 
privileged and they come together and it
really<00:03:32.100> isn't<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.520> they<00:03:32.910> feel<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.300> real

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
really isn't that they feel like real

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.290 
really isn't that they feel like real
people<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:35.460> I<00:03:35.640> think<00:03:36.120> they're

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
people and I I think they're

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.630 
people and I I think they're
well-crafted<00:03:37.050> characters<00:03:37.830> again<00:03:38.160> feeling

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
well-crafted characters again feeling

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.910 
well-crafted characters again feeling
different<00:03:39.120> from<00:03:39.300> other<00:03:39.510> movies<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.590> think

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
different from other movies and I think

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.380 
different from other movies and I think
that's<00:03:41.040> important<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.760> think<00:03:41.940> by<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
that's important and I think by the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.080 
that's important and I think by the
first<00:03:43.290> 20<00:03:43.620> minutes<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.580> get<00:03:44.730> into<00:03:44.970> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
first 20 minutes you really get into the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.880 
first 20 minutes you really get into the
movie<00:03:45.420> even<00:03:45.630> though<00:03:45.900> really<00:03:46.560> all<00:03:46.710> they're

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
movie even though really all they're

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.940 
movie even though really all they're
doing<00:03:46.920> is<00:03:47.250> talking<00:03:47.490> to<00:03:47.760> each<00:03:47.880> other<00:03:48.090> um<00:03:48.950> one

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
doing is talking to each other um one

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.170 
doing is talking to each other um one
thing<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.190> think<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.460> so<00:03:50.640> impressive<00:03:51.000> about

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
thing I think is so impressive about

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.500 
thing I think is so impressive about
this<00:03:51.390> movie<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.320> obviously<00:03:52.830> most<00:03:52.980> actors

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
this movie is that obviously most actors

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.930 
this movie is that obviously most actors
work<00:03:54.510> off<00:03:54.750> each<00:03:54.810> other<00:03:55.260> with<00:03:55.470> chemistry<00:03:56.010> they

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
work off each other with chemistry they

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.400 
work off each other with chemistry they
have<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.240> be<00:03:57.330> in<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.510> same<00:03:57.720> scene<00:03:58.050> but<00:03:58.290> with

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
have to be in the same scene but with

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.590 
have to be in the same scene but with
this<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:59.130> actors<00:03:59.520> just<00:03:59.640> in<00:04:00.090> one<00:04:00.300> room<00:04:00.420> by

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
this the actors just in one room by

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.690 
this the actors just in one room by
themselves<00:04:00.780> but<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.590> chemistry<00:04:01.740> feels<00:04:02.520> like

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
themselves but the chemistry feels like

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.730 
themselves but the chemistry feels like
it's<00:04:02.850> there<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.420> thought<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.290> chemistry<00:04:04.680> was

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
it's there I thought the chemistry was

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.710 
it's there I thought the chemistry was
super<00:04:05.490> strong<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:05.910> this<00:04:06.000> movie<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.360> again<00:04:06.690> I

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
super strong in this movie and again I

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.660 
super strong in this movie and again I
think<00:04:06.930> that's<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:07.380> impressive<00:04:07.680> for<00:04:08.250> not<00:04:08.490> even

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
think that's so impressive for not even

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.400 
think that's so impressive for not even
being<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.300> same<00:04:09.480> room<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.960> don't<00:04:10.110> know<00:04:10.230> how

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
being in the same room I don't know how

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.100 
being in the same room I don't know how
they<00:04:10.440> made<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.160> movie<00:04:11.340> maybe<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.990> know

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
they made the movie maybe the you know

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.960 
they made the movie maybe the you know
the<00:04:13.230> person<00:04:13.590> was<00:04:13.740> like<00:04:13.980> saying<00:04:14.250> his<00:04:14.430> lines<00:04:14.670> on

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
the person was like saying his lines on

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.330 
the person was like saying his lines on
the<00:04:15.120> other<00:04:15.240> end<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.560> room<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.980> just<00:04:17.220> thought

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
the other end in the room I just thought

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.979 
the other end in the room I just thought
was<00:04:17.460> very<00:04:17.549> impressive<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.450> this<00:04:18.780> whole

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
was very impressive that this whole

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.590 
was very impressive that this whole
movie<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.410> really<00:04:19.760> one<00:04:20.760> Scene<00:04:21.060> one<00:04:21.270> person

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
movie is really one Scene one person

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.480 
movie is really one Scene one person
talking<00:04:21.810> themselves<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.919> it's

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
talking themselves and it's

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.279 
talking themselves and it's
really<00:04:23.819> impressive<00:04:24.030> movie<00:04:24.509> in<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.780> way<00:04:24.960> and

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
really impressive movie in that way and

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.249 
really impressive movie in that way and
again<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.400> story<00:04:26.580> it's<00:04:27.180> touching<00:04:27.539> it's<00:04:28.080> as

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
again the story it's touching it's as

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.540 
again the story it's touching it's as
touching<00:04:28.740> stories<00:04:29.099> i<00:04:29.250> thought<00:04:29.430> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
touching stories i thought the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.180 
touching stories i thought the
characters<00:04:30.060> felt<00:04:30.660> realistic<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:31.919> that's

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
characters felt realistic and that's

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.589 
characters felt realistic and that's
what<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.370> love<00:04:32.580> about<00:04:32.610> Josh<00:04:32.940> means<00:04:33.180> work<00:04:33.419> is

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
what I love about Josh means work is

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.089 
what I love about Josh means work is
that<00:04:33.630> even<00:04:34.440> though<00:04:34.680> it's<00:04:34.830> supernatural

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
that even though it's supernatural

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.790 
that even though it's supernatural
element<00:04:35.759> it<00:04:35.910> brings<00:04:36.210> out<00:04:36.479> these<00:04:37.259> realistic

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
element it brings out these realistic

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800 
element it brings out these realistic
real<00:04:38.460> problems<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.389> think<00:04:39.599> it's<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.780> really

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
real problems and I think it's a really

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.339 
real problems and I think it's a really
cool<00:04:40.550> romantic<00:04:41.550> film<00:04:41.849> but<00:04:42.810> it's<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:43.110> hidden

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
cool romantic film but it's a hidden

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.170 
cool romantic film but it's a hidden
romantic<00:04:43.949> film<00:04:44.160> in<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:44.370> way<00:04:44.520> it's<00:04:44.819> really<00:04:45.090> about

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
romantic film in a way it's really about

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.409 
romantic film in a way it's really about
these<00:04:45.539> two<00:04:45.780> people<00:04:46.229> and<00:04:46.710> um<00:04:46.949> I<00:04:47.789> also<00:04:48.180> thought

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
these two people and um I also thought

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.809 
these two people and um I also thought
the<00:04:48.479> visuals<00:04:49.050> are<00:04:49.169> great<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.770> way<00:04:49.919> that<00:04:50.310> like

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
the visuals are great the way that like

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.610 
the visuals are great the way that like
say<00:04:51.060> dylan's<00:04:51.509> were<00:04:51.690> Rebecca's<00:04:52.139> life<00:04:52.319> they

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
say dylan's were Rebecca's life they

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.200 
say dylan's were Rebecca's life they
showed<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.009> a<00:04:53.069> couple<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.400> times<00:04:53.460> I<00:04:53.880> thought<00:04:54.030> I

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
showed it a couple of times I thought I

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.649 
showed it a couple of times I thought I
was<00:04:54.330> really<00:04:54.569> great<00:04:54.840> I<00:04:55.530> love<00:04:56.069> the<00:04:56.250> song<00:04:56.490> that

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
was really great I love the song that

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.760 
was really great I love the song that
jocelyne<00:04:57.659> actually<00:04:58.110> made<00:04:58.289> for<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.530> movie

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
jocelyne actually made for the movie

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.499 
jocelyne actually made for the movie
climbing<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.520> was<00:04:59.729> like<00:04:59.849> looking<00:05:00.120> for<00:05:00.300> him<00:05:00.389> like

climbing I was like looking for him like

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.779 
climbing I was like looking for him like
is<00:05:00.630> this<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.840> real<00:05:01.110> song<00:05:01.409> I<00:05:01.680> found<00:05:02.400> out<00:05:02.610> he

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
is this a real song I found out he
