was<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> big<00:01:22.200> flaw<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:23.159> least<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.759> me<00:01:26.119> actually

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
was a big flaw at least for me actually

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.469 
was a big flaw at least for me actually
two<00:01:27.299> main<00:01:27.780> things<00:01:28.790> overall<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> good<00:01:30.240> case

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
two main things overall it's a good case

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.580 
two main things overall it's a good case
a<00:01:30.509> lot<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.049> protection<00:01:31.549> but<00:01:32.549> unfortunately<00:01:33.590> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
a lot of protection but unfortunately it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.359 
a lot of protection but unfortunately it
adds<00:01:35.659> significant<00:01:36.659> amount<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.930> weight<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
adds significant amount of weight to the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:48.760 
adds significant amount of weight to the
phone<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:43.490> also<00:01:44.600> it's<00:01:46.159> really<00:01:47.159> hard<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:48.149> push

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770

really<00:01:49.770> hard<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.130> push<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> buttons<00:01:50.759> like

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
really hard to push the buttons like

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.690 
really hard to push the buttons like
volume<00:01:51.420> rocker<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:52.590> hard<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.950> push<00:01:53.340> asleep
