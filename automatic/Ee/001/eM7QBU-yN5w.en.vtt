00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.390
 hello girls until today we are going to 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.370
 make a simple easy quick video 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.990
 for girls who do not know how to do that 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.720
 outlined is a request that has 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.730
 made my subscriber rosemary but I said 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.560
 already several times you saw please tell me 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.209
 how they see the eye level can be fast 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.400
 well I will do today two 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.249
 styles with pencil eyeliner a 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.259
 pencil format that is the quickest easy 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.929
 and simple to do and then the other one will be 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.189
 with liquid eyeliner and supposedly 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.140
 the more complicated the more you are 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.849
 complicated then authorize we go then 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.040
 next to the tutorial let's start 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.230
 quickie and I 'm going to use this pencil 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.340
 black to be delineated let's take 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.740
 note that the pencil that we are going to 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.400
 use be a pencil that is creamy 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.640
 but that at the same time is not very fatty that 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.020
 run the delineated ok then already 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.820
 considering this we are going to start 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.500
 and to take into account three points in the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.480
 eye that is the central part the part 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.000
 initial and the final part 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.010
 to have a quick easy delineation 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.750
 simple the general usually what 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.700
 What I recommend is to start with the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.559
 part of iberia there are many people who 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.750
 they say it's not good to stretch to then 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.000
 to get eyeliner okay this theory 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.150
 is true and now it is not because if 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.590
 you are over 30 years old like me 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.690
 It is necessary to stretch a little 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.330
 folds to be able to make him relieved 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.670
 Now if you have 15 20 25 years of 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.720
 no other can put you having to 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.149
 stretch the robbery no longer they are another 20 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.399
 well then let's always start 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.820
 from the middle of the eye towards the 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.950
 beginning or towards the end that does not 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.950
 is so important to where 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.860
 and more or less something like that and then now what 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.120
 that we are going to take into account is for the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.010
 time of day that we are going to use this 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.720
 delineated and for the occasion 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.670
 will use it for the day for in the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.160
 work or whatever we're not going to do 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.960
 no type of corner or delineated 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.940
 cut 1 because for the money office is 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.950
 the right name then we're going to 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.390
 just finish with a small 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.030
 lift but without exaggerating at all 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.560
 always taking into account girls that the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.200
 where are we going to start lifting 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.360
 the outline must match the part 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.350
 where the lower eyelid ends 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.300
 can the dads of but end up here and 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.180
 from there but in the part of the 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.459
 upper tab is where I'm going to take 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.459
 note that to go up 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:08.440
 if we're just going to connect the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:11.730
 end of this appointment with the part of others 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.730
 wines that we already had 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.040
 that's all for the delineated with latex 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.330
 now let's go to the hardest part 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.780
 supposedly that is with that of a 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.400
 delineated with liquid eyeliner now 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.010
 let's go then, but a little bit the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.120
 eyeliner so it's not too 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.880
 occupied 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.090
 let's then use a small piece 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.080
 here to help us move the hand 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.840
 in teeth I understand 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.480
 is one of the best known tricks in 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.240
 none of the makeup so let's go 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.960
 so 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.520
 here other than to start from the beginning 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.560
 from the animal out 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.460
 and we will start then in a stroke 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.150
 fine 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.150
 Y 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.470
 and at the end we're going to do for the levels 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.180
 will begin to raise the delineated from the 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.490
 bottom where three minutes 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.490
 while the lower eyelid 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.520
 for silva 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.460
 making a line and made a spike and then 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.400
 and that line is interrupted 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.400
 we connect it to the main 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.590
 already work and just fill 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:06.780
 this triangle and redouble the line that 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.780
 We made the thickness that we want 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.770
 do not 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.289
 plus 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.289
 ah 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.470
 criticism this is the result in the end I 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.570
 I hope you like it put in 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.950
 practice and he told me until then 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.950
 and until then
