seeing<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.570> playing<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.530> development<00:00:14.490> of

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
seeing and playing the development of

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.750 
seeing and playing the development of
Edward<00:00:15.529> I<00:00:17.029> I<00:00:18.029> think<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.600> main<00:00:18.779> thing<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.830> get

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
Edward I I think the main thing is I get

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.179 
Edward I I think the main thing is I get
his<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.150> reason<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> first<00:00:22.020> two<00:00:22.289> films<00:00:22.920> for

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
his the reason the first two films for

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.000 
his the reason the first two films for
Edward<00:00:23.460> was<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.760> sort<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.029> fraught<00:00:24.480> and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
Edward was so sort of fraught and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.370 
Edward was so sort of fraught and
difficult<00:00:26.010> with<00:00:26.220> because<00:00:26.550> he<00:00:26.640> had<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> decide

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
difficult with because he had to decide

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.660 
difficult with because he had to decide
whether<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> was<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.890> good<00:00:29.039> idea<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.550> be

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
whether or not it was a good idea to be

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.429 
whether or not it was a good idea to be
with<00:00:29.820> Bella<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.539> at<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.929> end<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.109> New<00:00:31.289> Moon

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
with Bella and at the end of New Moon

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.410 
with Bella and at the end of New Moon
he's<00:00:31.619> decided<00:00:32.070> well<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.430> saw<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.180> happens

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
he's decided well I saw what happens

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
he's decided well I saw what happens
when<00:00:33.540> I'm<00:00:33.630> not<00:00:33.750> with<00:00:33.899> her<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:35.040> mean<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
when I'm not with her so I I mean I

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.040 
when I'm not with her so I I mean I
don't<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.149> make<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> decision<00:00:36.510> anymore<00:00:36.899> so

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
don't have to make a decision anymore so

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.569 
don't have to make a decision anymore so
it's<00:00:37.590> easy<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.579> also<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.000> committing<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.570> her

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
it's easy and also in committing to her

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.540 
it's easy and also in committing to her
he<00:00:41.579> becomes<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.329> immediately<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.370> more<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
he becomes just immediately a more of a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.090 
he becomes just immediately a more of a
part<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> world<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.629> he<00:00:45.690> has<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
part of the world and he has to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.840 
part of the world and he has to
communicate<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.190> people<00:00:47.370> he<00:00:47.430> can't<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.760> be

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
communicate with people he can't just be

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.910 
communicate with people he can't just be
detached<00:00:48.300> from<00:00:48.420> everything<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.829> in

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
detached from everything and I think in

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.150 
detached from everything and I think in
doing<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:51.420> makes<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:52.680> makes<00:00:52.980> his

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
doing that it makes it makes his

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.330 
doing that it makes it makes his
spectrum<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.910> emotions<00:00:54.800> every<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.039> many<00:00:56.190> new

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
spectrum of emotions every so many new

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.250 
spectrum of emotions every so many new
things<00:00:56.579> come<00:00:56.850> into<00:00:56.969> his<00:00:57.149> head<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.390> he<00:00:57.719> feels

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
things come into his head and he feels

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
things come into his head and he feels
everything<00:00:58.469> differently<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> becomes<00:01:00.239> more

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
everything differently and becomes more

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.170 
everything differently and becomes more
human<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> think<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> kind<00:01:03.059> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
human so I think that was the kind of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
human so I think that was the kind of
interesting<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> difficult<00:01:04.500> bit<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.739> see

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
interesting and the difficult bit to see

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.370 
interesting and the difficult bit to see
how<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.820> know<00:01:05.970> introducing<00:01:06.810> emotions<00:01:07.200> into

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
how you know introducing emotions into

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
how you know introducing emotions into
Edward<00:01:07.650> which<00:01:07.799> he's<00:01:08.010> doesn't<00:01:08.520> feel<00:01:08.939> I've<00:01:09.270> been

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
Edward which he's doesn't feel I've been

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.990 
Edward which he's doesn't feel I've been
the<00:01:09.659> previous<00:01:10.020> two<00:01:10.200> exactly<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.580> also<00:01:11.850> I

life and even if you break up with them
absolutely<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.479> think<00:02:09.509> monogamy<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.320> a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
absolutely and I think monogamy is a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.440 
absolutely and I think monogamy is a
very<00:02:10.560> Christian<00:02:11.220> thing<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.700> know<00:02:11.850> because<00:02:12.270> if

movie you know - that you don't be just

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.260 
movie you know - that you don't be just
so<00:02:30.440> one-dimensional<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.590> our<00:02:31.770> choices<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.700> we

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
so one-dimensional in our choices and we

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.690 
so one-dimensional in our choices and we
try<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.570> make<00:02:33.989> love<00:02:34.320> choices<00:02:34.980> with<00:02:35.160> our<00:02:35.340> head

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
but it has to be hmm I think one of the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.550 
but it has to be hmm I think one of the
biggest<00:02:38.640> shows<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.120> Edward<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:40.110> know<00:02:40.230> of

love in the movie is when Bella comes

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.880 
love in the movie is when Bella comes
back<00:02:45.180> after<00:02:45.360> kissing<00:02:45.660> Jacob<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.530> Edward

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
back after kissing Jacob and Edward

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.430 
back after kissing Jacob and Edward
being<00:02:47.070> able<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.280> understand<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.140> any<00:02:49.140> end
