let's<00:05:24.550> say<00:05:24.729> all<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.030> my<00:05:25.330> analog<00:05:25.840> input

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
let's say all of my analog input

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.360 
let's say all of my analog input
together<00:05:26.410> regardless<00:05:26.710> of<00:05:26.800> which<00:05:26.919> box<00:05:27.160> I<00:05:27.280> could

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
together regardless of which box I could

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.310 
together regardless of which box I could
take<00:05:27.580> I'm<00:05:28.120> gonna<00:05:28.300> go<00:05:28.419> ahead<00:05:28.539> and<00:05:28.660> grab<00:05:28.900> analog

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
take I'm gonna go ahead and grab analog

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.930 
take I'm gonna go ahead and grab analog
one<00:05:29.500> and<00:05:29.650> two<00:05:29.740> from<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.009> uln<00:05:30.340> 2<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.759> this

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
one and two from the uln 2 and this

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.830 
one and two from the uln 2 and this
dragon<00:05:32.099> right<00:05:33.099> after<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.550> analog<00:05:33.940> input<00:05:34.720> for

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
dragon right after the analog input for

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.600 
dragon right after the analog input for
the<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.199> know<00:05:35.260> for<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.710> two<00:05:35.889> eight<00:05:36.070> 8/2<00:05:36.250> so

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
the you know for the two eight 8/2 so

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.650 
the you know for the two eight 8/2 so
now<00:05:36.699> I<00:05:36.729> have<00:05:36.910> all<00:05:36.940> my<00:05:37.030> analog<00:05:37.419> Channel

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
now I have all my analog Channel

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.540 
now I have all my analog Channel
together<00:05:37.870> you<00:05:38.440> can<00:05:38.590> grab<00:05:38.740> any<00:05:38.949> single<00:05:39.340> strip

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
together you can grab any single strip

grab any multiples and strip so if I
grab<00:05:43.539> let's<00:05:43.960> say<00:05:44.169> these<00:05:44.320> six<00:05:44.889> or<00:05:44.979> seven<00:05:45.190> strips

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
grab let's say these six or seven strips

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.159 
grab let's say these six or seven strips
and<00:05:45.639> move<00:05:45.789> them<00:05:46.000> they<00:05:46.479> move<00:05:46.630> across<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:47.020> bus

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
and move them they move across the bus
