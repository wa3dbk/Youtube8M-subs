00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hi it's nice of the 4 fantastic 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.330
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.210
 little video so started to help in 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.599
 thief so that's a question that one 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.490
 arises because often starting out 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.929
 do not really get to that and so 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 I will explain how it is 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.199
 you come from three tips to everything from 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.199
 following me today I'm going to 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.349
 learn the souk rails then all the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.160
 world says it and make salt like 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.050
 that's the slide idea of ​​time - either 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 because he's really calculating he's 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.110
 hard to do so today I you 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.360
 learn the wild 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.940
 so here it is we ourselves to put ourselves 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.420
 like that on the group bar with the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.930
 right foot 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.730
 if you are from the case normally for 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.210
 who I anticipated to give you 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.579
 when you put stella and c4 but for 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.090
 me like that it's TV that you 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.620
 will give more balance and after we've been 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.290
 the host is in front exits normally 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.820
 it's easy then months now before we 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.290
 would seem to count on you risk you 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.760
 break your mouth you have not want 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:19.470
 start trading again just to wear 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:22.200
 on the bar and how good she is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.909
 that you help series to dream everything 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.909
 in you can start at 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.090
 after my worst do not forget all 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.200
 these little details there because we all 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.730
 that I come back in fact it's really 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.620
 important 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.800
 so after if I can give a little 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.380
 advice for all slides in general 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.850
 in fact to try not too hungry on 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.740
 the sidewalks if you start on the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.800
 sidewalks it's a hassle this time a 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 slide bar so watch the balance goes 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.930
 to be open in alabama is as for it 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.790
 always with a goatee like that to 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.080
 make the house walk you go 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.110
 see that means a lot better 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.300
 to go down one sees I'm still going to 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.560
 learn from another little slide if it's 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.410
 not good and it pays that's what have a 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:31.720
 foot so it's also pretty easy in 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:32.370
 the fact that it's called suddenly it 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.300
 it's good 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.300
 I tell you 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:52.840
 the two arrows that I advise you 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.200
 to do at first but try well 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.530
 persevere 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.590
 normally you will get there liked 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.180
 share page subscribe there is no 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.290
 tale throws and but the task but also 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.290
 by the way
