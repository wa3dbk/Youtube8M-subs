curious<00:02:36.969> what<00:02:37.969> are<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.239> limits<00:02:38.629> of<00:02:38.810> this

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
curious what are the limits of this

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.899 
curious what are the limits of this
medium<00:02:39.469> why<00:02:39.620> are<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.889> limits<00:02:40.159> of<00:02:40.280> paper<00:02:40.549> and

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
medium why are the limits of paper and

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.280 
medium why are the limits of paper and
that's<00:02:41.120> when<00:02:41.299> I<00:02:41.329> started<00:02:41.689> making<00:02:41.900> all<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
that's when I started making all the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.140 
that's when I started making all the
things<00:02:42.530> one<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.340> first<00:02:43.549> things<00:02:43.609> I<00:02:43.879> did<00:02:43.909> was

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
things one of the first things I did was

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.649 
things one of the first things I did was
a<00:02:44.629> beehive<00:02:45.049> and<00:02:45.889> it<00:02:46.159> be<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.609> made<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.420> little

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
I want to give my mermaid a 3d torso to

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.280 
I want to give my mermaid a 3d torso to
make<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.260> torso<00:03:35.770> 3d<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.520> called<00:03:37.150> two<00:03:37.480> triangles

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
make the torso 3d I called two triangles

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.309 
make the torso 3d I called two triangles
out<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.890> card<00:03:39.220> stock<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.940> have<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.690> triangles

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
out of card stock I have the triangles

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.920 
out of card stock I have the triangles
already<00:03:41.620> cut<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:42.190> need<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.180> put<00:03:43.330> glue<00:03:43.630> in<00:03:43.660> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
already cut I need to put glue in the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.960 
already cut I need to put glue in the
triangles<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:47.010> need<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.130> attach<00:03:48.370> all<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.730> wires

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
triangles I need to attach all the wires

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.390 
triangles I need to attach all the wires
to<00:03:49.630> this<00:03:49.840> triangle<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:51.130> is<00:03:51.280> the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
to this triangle and that is the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.760 
to this triangle and that is the
trickiest<00:03:51.790> part<00:03:52.120> I'm<00:03:52.630> going<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.140> let<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.560> head

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
trickiest part I'm going to let the head

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.110 
trickiest part I'm going to let the head
on<00:03:53.920> top<00:03:53.950> of<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.370> heart<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.000> could

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
on top of the heart so that I could

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.890 
on top of the heart so that I could
determine<00:03:55.600> how<00:03:55.930> long<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.410> wire<00:03:56.590> has<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.130> be<00:03:57.250> I

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
determine how long the wire has to be I

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.449 
determine how long the wire has to be I
need<00:03:58.900> about<00:03:59.140> six<00:03:59.440> inches<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.890> wire<00:04:00.040> for<00:04:00.430> the

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
need about six inches of wire for the

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.509 
need about six inches of wire for the
torso<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.180> tail<00:04:01.830> now<00:04:02.830> I'm<00:04:02.950> going<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.340> make

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
torso and the tail now I'm going to make

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.699 
torso and the tail now I'm going to make
a<00:04:03.550> loop<00:04:03.850> at<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.090> end<00:04:04.239> of<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.540> wire<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.410> is

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
a loop at the end of the wire so that is

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.490 
a loop at the end of the wire so that is
staying<00:04:06.100> place<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:07.239> arms<00:04:07.720> will<00:04:07.900> also<00:04:08.290> come

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
staying place the arms will also come

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.509 
staying place the arms will also come
out<00:04:08.680> of<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.130> upper<00:04:09.459> torso<00:04:10.920> I'm<00:04:11.920> going<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.340> try

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
out of the upper torso I'm going to try

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.319 
out of the upper torso I'm going to try
to<00:04:12.550> do<00:04:12.970> all<00:04:13.180> these<00:04:13.540> wires<00:04:13.780> together<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:15.329> am

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
to do all these wires together I am

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.719 
to do all these wires together I am
ready<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.780> glue<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.260> other<00:04:17.440> hand

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.060 

I'm<00:04:21.729> going<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.150> call<00:04:22.449> the<00:04:22.660> strip<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:23.020> paper<00:04:23.259> so

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
I'm going to call the strip of paper so

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.980 
I'm going to call the strip of paper so
that<00:04:24.100> i<00:04:24.310> could<00:04:24.460> start<00:04:24.850> trying<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.360> attach<00:04:25.720> it

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
that i could start trying to attach it

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.279 
that i could start trying to attach it
to<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.410> hearts<00:04:27.240> basically<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.479> am<00:04:28.900> dragging

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
to the hearts basically I am dragging

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.100 
to the hearts basically I am dragging
the<00:04:29.680> paper<00:04:29.889> around<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.610> two<00:04:30.789> hearts<00:04:31.180> now<00:04:32.080> I

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
the paper around the two hearts now I

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.070 
the paper around the two hearts now I
have<00:04:32.259> to<00:04:32.560> trim<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.949> excess<00:04:33.130> paper

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.080 

I'm<00:04:38.080> going<00:04:38.350> to<00:04:38.470> put<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.770> arms<00:04:39.160> in<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.790> upper

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
I'm going to put the arms in the upper

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.199 
I'm going to put the arms in the upper
torso

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:46.209 

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:48.699 

I'm<00:04:47.209> going<00:04:47.419> to<00:04:47.569> use<00:04:47.689> the<00:04:47.839> same<00:04:48.049> technique<00:04:48.499> to

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:48.709 
I'm going to use the same technique to

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:58.809 
I'm going to use the same technique to
build<00:04:49.009> the<00:04:49.459> other<00:04:49.669> pieces<00:04:50.059> of<00:04:50.329> my<00:04:50.479> mermaid<00:04:57.819> my

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
build the other pieces of my mermaid my

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.899 
build the other pieces of my mermaid my
lower<00:04:58.999> torso<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.569> dry<00:04:59.839> so<00:05:00.199> I'm<00:05:00.709> going<00:05:01.219> to<00:05:01.429> put

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
lower torso is dry so I'm going to put

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.929 
lower torso is dry so I'm going to put
it<00:05:01.999> in<00:05:02.089> the<00:05:02.209> wire<00:05:03.099> I'm<00:05:04.099> putting<00:05:04.489> the<00:05:04.610> beat<00:05:04.789> on

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:04.939 
it in the wire I'm putting the beat on

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.769 
it in the wire I'm putting the beat on
the<00:05:05.059> wire<00:05:05.209> just<00:05:05.689> to<00:05:05.839> decorate<00:05:06.019> them<00:05:07.569> the<00:05:08.569> bit

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:08.779 
the wire just to decorate them the bit

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.049 
the wire just to decorate them the bit
is<00:05:08.929> on<00:05:09.139> and<00:05:09.469> then<00:05:09.709> i<00:05:09.860> went<00:05:10.009> ahead<00:05:10.159> and<00:05:10.369> glue<00:05:10.939> the

00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:11.059 
is on and then i went ahead and glue the
