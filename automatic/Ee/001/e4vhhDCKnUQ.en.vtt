RDF<00:02:05.350> VX<00:02:06.350> storm<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:07.520> end<00:02:08.050> then<00:02:09.050> had<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.259> really

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
RDF VX storm the end then had a really

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.759 
RDF VX storm the end then had a really
badly<00:02:09.950> made<00:02:10.280> creeper<00:02:10.819> face<00:02:11.440> because<00:02:12.440> I

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
badly made creeper face because I

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.530 
badly made creeper face because I
honestly<00:02:13.610> could<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> room<00:02:14.090> but<00:02:14.269> they<00:02:14.330> looked

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
honestly could a room but they looked

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.660 
honestly could a room but they looked
like<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.980> then<00:02:16.459> had<00:02:16.610> another<00:02:16.910> face<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:19.459> know

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
like it then had another face and I know

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.190 
like it then had another face and I know
if<00:02:19.819> another<00:02:20.090> face<00:02:22.090> which<00:02:23.090> was<00:02:23.269> just<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.900> face<00:02:24.080> I

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
if another face which was just a face I

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.100 
if another face which was just a face I
wanted<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.470> do<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:25.430> then<00:02:25.670> kind<00:02:26.569> of<00:02:26.630> rippled<00:02:27.019> out

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
wanted to do it then kind of rippled out

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.559 
wanted to do it then kind of rippled out
which<00:02:27.800> didn't<00:02:28.250> look<00:02:28.519> very<00:02:28.760> good<00:02:28.910> because

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
which didn't look very good because

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.430 
which didn't look very good because
Pistons<00:02:30.230> lag<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.130> there's<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:31.760> many<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.090> them

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
Pistons lag and there's so many of them

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.860 
Pistons lag and there's so many of them
it<00:02:33.440> just<00:02:34.030> one<00:02:35.030> second<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:36.769> just<00:02:37.599> takes<00:02:38.599> a<00:02:38.720> wad

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
it just one second it just takes a wad

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.380 
it just one second it just takes a wad
update<00:02:39.260> here's<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.160> panel<00:02:40.489> we<00:02:40.670> used<00:02:40.940> me<00:02:41.330> and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
update here's the panel we used me and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.940 
update here's the panel we used me and
lets<00:02:41.660> me<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.319> I'm<00:02:42.500> an<00:02:42.620> aesthetic<00:02:44.560> used<00:02:45.560> to

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
lets me and I'm an aesthetic used to

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.920 
lets me and I'm an aesthetic used to
plot<00:02:46.400> out<00:02:46.610> what<00:02:46.849> our<00:02:47.030> letters<00:02:47.569> would<00:02:47.690> look

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
plot out what our letters would look

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.690 
plot out what our letters would look
like<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.780> creeper<00:02:51.079> face<00:02:51.230> was<00:02:51.829> hard<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.250> do<00:02:52.400> and

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
like the creeper face was hard to do and

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.460 
like the creeper face was hard to do and
I<00:02:53.110> admit<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:54.349> it<00:02:54.440> wasn't<00:02:54.739> very<00:02:54.860> good<00:02:56.110> it's<00:02:57.110> 11

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
I admit that it wasn't very good it's 11

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.520 
I admit that it wasn't very good it's 11
by<00:02:57.590> 11<00:02:57.620> each<00:02:58.099> pixel<00:02:58.579> is<00:02:58.730> two<00:02:59.209> by<00:02:59.390> two<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.200> that

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
by 11 each pixel is two by two so that

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.729 
by 11 each pixel is two by two so that
would<00:03:00.829> be<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:01.040> pixel<00:03:01.549> those<00:03:02.150> four<00:03:02.750> that's<00:03:03.530> one

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
would be a pixel those four that's one

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:13.360 
would be a pixel those four that's one
pixel<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.959> haven't<00:03:09.920> seen<00:03:10.190> any<00:03:10.519> TVs<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:12.590> are<00:03:12.650> of

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
pixel I haven't seen any TVs that are of

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.370 
pixel I haven't seen any TVs that are of
this<00:03:13.819> size<00:03:14.090> apart<00:03:14.569> from<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.840> think<00:03:15.049> I<00:03:15.170> saw<00:03:15.350> one

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
this size apart from I think I saw one

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.309 
this size apart from I think I saw one
that<00:03:15.829> was<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.910> digital<00:03:17.329> diamond<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.750> couple<00:03:18.200> of

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
that was the digital diamond a couple of

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.229 
that was the digital diamond a couple of
days<00:03:18.590> ago<00:03:18.829> that<00:03:19.670> was<00:03:19.850> 91<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:21.380> think<00:03:22.209> but<00:03:23.209> I

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
days ago that was 91 I think but I

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.120

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
comment to post a link to it I'd love to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.819 
comment to post a link to it I'd love to
have<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.180> look<00:03:35.299> at<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.630> see<00:03:35.780> how<00:03:35.810> it's<00:03:36.620> been

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
have a look at it and see how it's been

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.309 
have a look at it and see how it's been
wired<00:03:37.100> differently<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.880> me<00:03:38.060> because<00:03:39.049> this

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
wired differently to me because this

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.509 
wired differently to me because this
section<00:03:39.889> is<00:03:40.069> quite<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:41.769> large<00:03:42.769> for<00:03:43.190> what<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.430> is

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
section is quite a large for what it is

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.780 
section is quite a large for what it is
I<00:03:43.819> mean<00:03:43.940> all<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.209> is<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:44.450> it's<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.690> path<00:03:44.959> up<00:03:45.290> to

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
I mean all it is is it's a path up to

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.819 
I mean all it is is it's a path up to
each<00:03:46.790> decoder<00:03:47.239> for<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.750> animation<00:03:50.829> think

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
each decoder for the animation think

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.289 
each decoder for the animation think
that's<00:03:51.950> probably<00:03:52.130> about<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.579> then<00:03:52.730> thanks<00:03:53.150> for

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
that's probably about it then thanks for

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:59.739 
that's probably about it then thanks for
watching<00:03:53.620> I'm<00:03:54.620> VX<00:03:55.160> storm<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:56.260> thanks<00:03:57.260> goodbye
