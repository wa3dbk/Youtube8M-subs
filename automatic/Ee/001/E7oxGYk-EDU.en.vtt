00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.210
 Not so long ago Google loved it 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.099
 specific to your conference where it 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.049
 a new version of and wide shows one 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.730
 namely android m or at least that is 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.379
 the code name including it at the moment 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.670
 until life goes on 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.039
 took a while before we had it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.080
 but here it is on a nexus 5 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.640
 it's a preview image a reasonable one 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.019
 limit the preview image must immediately 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.599
 also say very many functions are still 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.769
 not present and I have it yes I have it 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.539
 just not in daily use 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.009
 used because he wasn't good enough there 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.899
 is for but of course I have 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.590
 walked extensively through and in this 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.780
 preview 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.579
 I'm going to tell you all about it android 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.559
 m will be in the fall for consumers 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.059
 become available when exactly 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.760
 not clear but expect it 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.410
 will be around November now 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.280
 so you want to download a preview 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.930
 that's nice to look at 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.770
 furthermore, you are not very concerned 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.020
 It will release Android 5 and 2 or 5 point 5 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.680
 the name is probably still there 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.840
 not stuck 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.640
 rumors are about macademia net cookie 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.379
 that is not really a beautiful course 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.690
 rather I think they are another one 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.260
 start a partnership with mars or milky 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.150
 way 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.250
 and my name might be enough too 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.680
 think up for that matter so I guess 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.080
 they are working on that and that macademia 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.909
 that cookie and an intermediate form is only 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.960
 well we are going to see the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.470
 functionality perhaps 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.270
 most important is that android m yes a lot 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.090
 got better app permissions 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.369
 you can now use applications anyway 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.750
 deny any authorization or of course 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.250
 admit permission 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.470
 you can in the menu you can do a list 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.729
 calls where yes for example 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.200
 permissions for the camera 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.700
 authorization or a microphone et cetera 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.439
 all can be seen and there you can 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.939
 on and off per app 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.770
 in addition, apps will no longer be lost 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.079
 ask permissions when you download them 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.430
 from the play store but only when you get something 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.270
 is going to use what that authorization needs 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.250
 has 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.500
 Imagine you are adding a photo for the first time 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.240
 stop a whatsappje with your camera then 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.680
 who at that time may ask what 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.210
 have the camera 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.100
 that is not yet effective in this image 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.030
 but that is how it finally looks 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.399
 will see 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.130
 other important function food box and 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.200
 box is a function that allows the battery 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.729
 yes expensive a lot needs to be improved 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.160
 especially in standby 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.780
 your all kinds of processes are sent to the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.090
 background applications be 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.560
 previously put into sleep mode 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.690
 but the still come 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.730
 notifications and that means the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.170
 battery would last up to 2 times as long 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.129
 have to go in standby and off I have 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.650
 unable to verify 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.540
 but at least that is a lot 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.950
 promising and I am very curious how 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.840
 finally unpacking 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.160
 the search function has been expanded and now offers 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.049
 a boat with your four most used 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.400
 applications I think that's very much 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.180
 is going to be handy in everyday 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.280
 use 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.799
 another very handy added feature 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.120
 is well design works unfortunately not yet 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.129
 in this image but the idea agrees 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.420
 that if you make an application sit down 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.130
 no matter what it is 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.599
 if you hold down the home button then 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.670
 google now appears 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.690
 that is not new but what is new now 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.640
 is that that 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.709
 yes the application looks at the content 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.900
 is there and then starts looking for something 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.870
 for example you are a youtube video 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.280
 skrillex is watching skrillex 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.140
 of course not his real name 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.700
 if you go to google now then it will 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.220
 which, for example, counter mine 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.599
 come and you so euhm yes context again 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.060
 provide additional information 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.590
 what seems pretty handy interface 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.060
 of androids at lollipop of course 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.310
 went all the way up and with android 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.380
 changed him much day it 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.150
 one thing is that the menu and 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.040
 vertical scrolling list is in place 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.840
 from the horizontal list that we knew 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.069
 from android lollipop and those earlier 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.900
 android versions 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.790
 other thing is that the head bullying what 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.680
 adjusted is selection or 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.690
 text selection I must say is now per 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.579
 word and there comes a pop upje with which 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.530
 up you can do things quickly with that 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.019
 selected text is not yet working 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.190
 in this bump but that will come 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.690
 apart from that, they are mostly small ones 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.370
 things that I in this picture we 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.380
 all of them could not see land on it 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.450
 yes that is mainly a developers 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.919
 it is for example chromecast and 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.599
 tips that means you are in one 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.889
 application and chrome tab can go 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.079
 open so you do all 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.910
 functionality of chrome but so 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.889
 still in the application environment 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.900
 links between apps will be better 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.069
 be when you take photos from the nos app to 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.930
 the youtube there shines 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.489
 then you can verify those links 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.709
 and then you will no longer own 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.639
 saying ok go to youtube to this 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.840
 to open 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.160
 so they are all small things 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.480
 it is also support for some extra 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.250
 things added 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.569
 Fingerprint scanners must state you and 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.819
 of course have one it is this 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.280
 not the case with this nexus 5 but that 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.780
 are now standard supported in android 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.329
 usb-c becomes standard in android 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.479
 and that also means that 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.540
 android phones 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.430
 from android m as powerbank we can 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.170
 serve for other android phones or 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.140
 of course other devices with your son 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.370
 usb-c port they have that in yes 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.930
 Google is pushing it a bit 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.180
 and that is of course nice 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.950
 last things android p android p 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.330
 will only be rolled out later but that 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.920
 becomes the mobile payment service 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.870
 from google that if all goes well 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.760
 go to work easily and make mobile payments 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.830
 really yes should be available to everyone 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.730
 make it through nfc so you have to 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.710
 an nfc 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.320
 device of course that was in one 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.210
 nutshell android m and ever m will be 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.470
 a wound later this year in November 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.150
 likely to come on the market 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.620
 it's not a shock and the updates 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.330
 the are some things 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.130
 added optimized after 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.470
 most important to me are the 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.680
 app permissions that finally improved 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.270
 are used in android the yes 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.950
 applications that you find at your search bar 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.420
 get that find very handy you can 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.940
 also search applications 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.910
 with that now and whatever I agree with 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.680
 is the battery saving that Google 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.390
 has all had to go 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.520
 see how it will work out 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.440
 but yes it is certainly not shocking 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.440
 update just fine update
