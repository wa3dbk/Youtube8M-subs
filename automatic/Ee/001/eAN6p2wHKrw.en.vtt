to lead with my lead metagross he leaves

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.260 
to lead with my lead metagross he leaves
with<00:00:32.980> an<00:00:33.100> SP<00:00:33.460> ah<00:00:33.489> nice<00:00:33.760> which<00:00:33.970> is<00:00:34.090> right<00:00:34.239> off

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
with an SP ah nice which is right off

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.150 
with an SP ah nice which is right off
the<00:00:34.510> bat<00:00:34.660> into<00:00:34.840> his<00:00:34.930> Blastoise<00:00:35.620> his<00:00:35.800> eyes<00:00:35.920> to

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
the bat into his Blastoise his eyes to

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.310 
the bat into his Blastoise his eyes to
set<00:00:36.340> up<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:36.520> stealth<00:00:36.760> rocks<00:00:37.060> so<00:00:37.810> I'm<00:00:37.930> kind<00:00:38.230> of

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
set up the stealth rocks so I'm kind of

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.080 
set up the stealth rocks so I'm kind of
figuring<00:00:38.559> he<00:00:39.010> might<00:00:39.220> wrap<00:00:39.489> it<00:00:39.670> spin<00:00:39.910> so<00:00:40.059> I

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
figuring he might wrap it spin so I

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.970 
figuring he might wrap it spin so I
decided<00:00:40.450> to<00:00:40.570> go<00:00:40.690> on<00:00:40.809> his<00:00:40.989> zapdos<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:41.710> scare<00:00:41.950> it

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
decided to go on his zapdos to scare it

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.950 
decided to go on his zapdos to scare it
away<00:00:42.150> but<00:00:43.150> he<00:00:43.239> ends<00:00:43.420> up<00:00:43.450> going<00:00:43.660> for<00:00:43.900> the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
away but he ends up going for the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.290 
away but he ends up going for the
earthquake<00:00:44.440> so<00:00:45.070> my<00:00:45.489> zapdos<00:00:45.879> takes<00:00:46.120> that

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
earthquake so my zapdos takes that

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.910 
earthquake so my zapdos takes that
pretty<00:00:46.540> nicely<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.200> then<00:00:47.290> he<00:00:47.379> predicts<00:00:47.710> a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
pretty nicely and then he predicts a

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.979 
pretty nicely and then he predicts a
thunderbolt<00:00:48.910> really<00:00:49.210> nicely<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.720> goes<00:00:49.840> out

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
thunderbolt really nicely and goes out

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.540 
thunderbolt really nicely and goes out
into<00:00:50.110> an<00:00:50.260> electivire<00:00:50.800> which<00:00:51.070> of<00:00:51.160> course<00:00:51.190> get

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
into an electivire which of course get

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.729 
into an electivire which of course get
his<00:00:51.640> motor<00:00:51.879> drive<00:00:52.180> boost<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:53.260> I<00:00:53.290> go<00:00:53.440> out<00:00:53.470> into

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
his motor drive boost so I go out into

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.189 
his motor drive boost so I go out into
metagross<00:00:54.159> and<00:00:54.430> heat<00:00:54.580> ice<00:00:54.760> punches<00:00:55.269> which<00:00:55.510> was

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
metagross and heat ice punches which was

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.630 
metagross and heat ice punches which was
pretty<00:00:56.409> obvious<00:00:56.589> so<00:00:56.980> I<00:00:57.040> went<00:00:57.159> into<00:00:57.280> metagross

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
pretty obvious so I went into metagross

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.729 
pretty obvious so I went into metagross
to<00:00:57.790> resist<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.089> ice<00:00:58.269> punch<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.839> now<00:00:59.559> I'm<00:00:59.680> just

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
to resist the ice punch and now I'm just

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.500 
to resist the ice punch and now I'm just
going<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.010> explode<00:01:00.250> I'm<00:01:00.760> pretty<00:01:01.089> sure<00:01:01.269> my

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
going to explode I'm pretty sure my

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.360 
going to explode I'm pretty sure my
Metagross<00:01:02.080> can<00:01:02.440> live<00:01:02.680> an<00:01:02.800> earthquake<00:01:03.190> just

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
Metagross can live an earthquake just

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.770 
Metagross can live an earthquake just
because<00:01:03.640> metagross<00:01:04.059> has<00:01:04.269> pretty<00:01:04.540> good

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
because metagross has pretty good

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.780 
because metagross has pretty good
defense<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.409> he<00:01:06.040> lives<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.460> earthquake

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
defense and he lives the earthquake

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.490 
defense and he lives the earthquake
pretty<00:01:07.030> nicely<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.750> I<00:01:07.930> do<00:01:07.990> get<00:01:08.229> off<00:01:08.350> the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
pretty nicely and I do get off the

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.710 
pretty nicely and I do get off the
explosion<00:01:09.070> so<00:01:09.220> I<00:01:09.250> take<00:01:09.460> out<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:09.790> elective

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
explosion so I take out that elective

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.180 
explosion so I take out that elective
hour<00:01:10.840> before<00:01:11.200> it's<00:01:11.290> able<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.560> do<00:01:11.650> too<00:01:12.040> much

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
hour before it's able to do too much

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.370 
hour before it's able to do too much
damage<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.640> my<00:01:12.729> team<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.510> do<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.630> motor<00:01:14.049> drive

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
damage to my team to do that motor drive

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.530 
damage to my team to do that motor drive
i<00:01:14.560> gave<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.490> electivire<00:01:15.970> goes<00:01:16.120> down<00:01:16.330> as

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
i gave it so electivire goes down as

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.500 
i gave it so electivire goes down as
well<00:01:16.690> as<00:01:16.990> my<00:01:17.170> Metagross<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.070> now<00:01:18.880> i'm<00:01:19.180> going

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
well as my Metagross and now i'm going

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.050 
well as my Metagross and now i'm going
to<00:01:19.570> go<00:01:19.659> out<00:01:19.840> into<00:01:20.140> my<00:01:20.590> flygon<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.460> he<00:01:21.790> goes<00:01:21.940> out

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
to go out into my flygon and he goes out

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.850 
to go out into my flygon and he goes out
into<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.240> Blaziken<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:22.990> my<00:01:23.170> flag<00:01:23.620> on<00:01:23.770> his

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
into a Blaziken and my flag on his

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.649 
into a Blaziken and my flag on his
choice<00:01:24.190> scarf<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.760> decided<00:01:25.090> just<00:01:25.299> to<00:01:25.360> try<00:01:25.630> to

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
choice scarf so I decided just to try to

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.090 
choice scarf so I decided just to try to
go<00:01:25.869> for<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.079> earthquake<00:01:26.530> not<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.860> over

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
go for the earthquake not to over

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.639 
go for the earthquake not to over
predict<00:01:27.460> but<00:01:28.060> he<00:01:28.210> predicts<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.719> and<00:01:28.899> goes<00:01:29.289> into

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
predict but he predicts it and goes into

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.789 
predict but he predicts it and goes into
his<00:01:29.890> own<00:01:30.039> flygon<00:01:30.549> which<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.030> course<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:32.110> mrs.

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
his own flygon which of course it mrs.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.800 
his own flygon which of course it mrs.
do<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:33.009> levitate<00:01:33.369> so<00:01:33.969> go<00:01:34.119> out<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.270> adapt<00:01:34.630> oh

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
do to levitate so go out and adapt oh

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.240 
do to levitate so go out and adapt oh
it's<00:01:34.960> not<00:01:35.049> really<00:01:35.320> sure<00:01:35.500> at<00:01:35.680> this<00:01:35.829> flag<00:01:36.070> I<00:01:36.189> was

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
it's not really sure at this flag I was

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.709 
it's not really sure at this flag I was
going<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.549> do<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:36.789> he<00:01:37.000> just<00:01:37.180> goes<00:01:37.359> into<00:01:37.600> an

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
going to do and he just goes into an

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.469 
going to do and he just goes into an
outrage<00:01:38.170> which<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:39.579> does<00:01:40.030> less<00:01:40.299> than

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
outrage which actually does less than

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.779 
outrage which actually does less than
half<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.899> my<00:01:41.020> zapdos<00:01:41.530> just<00:01:41.799> because<00:01:42.100> my<00:01:42.280> zapdos

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
half to my zapdos just because my zapdos

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.940 
half to my zapdos just because my zapdos
is<00:01:43.030> physically<00:01:43.509> bulky<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.079> I'm<00:01:44.649> just<00:01:44.799> going

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
is physically bulky and I'm just going

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.440 
is physically bulky and I'm just going
to<00:01:44.979> go<00:01:45.100> for<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.280> roost<00:01:45.579> kind<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:45.939> distort<00:01:46.270> our

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
to go for the roost kind of distort our

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.480 
to go for the roost kind of distort our
and<00:01:46.750> he<00:01:47.619> goes<00:01:47.799> for<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:47.979> average<00:01:48.130> again

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
and he goes for the average again

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.980 
and he goes for the average again
obviously<00:01:48.670> because<00:01:49.149> he's<00:01:49.270> locked<00:01:49.509> into<00:01:49.840> it

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
obviously because he's locked into it

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.289 
obviously because he's locked into it
and<00:01:50.200> I'm<00:01:50.679> going<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:50.859> go<00:01:50.979> for<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.219> roost<00:01:51.609> so

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
and I'm going to go for the roost so

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.959 
and I'm going to go for the roost so
that<00:01:52.689> puts<00:01:52.990> me<00:01:53.229> up<00:01:53.439> to<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.740> pretty<00:01:54.369> high<00:01:54.640> amount

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
that puts me up to a pretty high amount

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.789 
that puts me up to a pretty high amount
of<00:01:55.030> health<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.810> think<00:01:56.079> I<00:01:56.170> can<00:01:56.320> take<00:01:56.500> two

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
of health and I think I can take two

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.529 
of health and I think I can take two
more<00:01:57.039> so<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.310> decided<00:01:57.640> just<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.909> stay<00:01:58.119> in<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:58.479> he

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
more so I decided just to stay in and he

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.599 
more so I decided just to stay in and he
gets<00:01:58.689> confused<00:01:59.140> so<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.829> decided<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.219> predict<00:02:00.520> a

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
gets confused so I decided to predict a

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:01.980 
gets confused so I decided to predict a
switch<00:02:00.880> figuring<00:02:01.299> he's<00:02:01.390> probably<00:02:01.630> locked

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
switch figuring he's probably locked

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.929 
switch figuring he's probably locked
into<00:02:02.289> outrage<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:02.829> doesn't<00:02:03.130> want<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.399> run<00:02:03.820> the

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
into outrage and doesn't want to run the

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.389 
into outrage and doesn't want to run the
risk<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.380> confusion<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:05.920> go<00:02:06.130> for<00:02:06.369> the

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
risk of confusion so I go for the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.010 
risk of confusion so I go for the
Thunderbolt<00:02:07.119> but<00:02:07.299> he<00:02:07.359> ends<00:02:07.479> up<00:02:07.539> staying<00:02:07.780> in

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
Thunderbolt but he ends up staying in

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.560 
Thunderbolt but he ends up staying in
which<00:02:08.229> was<00:02:08.410> really<00:02:08.830> strange<00:02:09.759> but<00:02:10.119> good<00:02:10.179> for

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
which was really strange but good for

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.730 
which was really strange but good for
him<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.050> unfortunately<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:13.540> zapdos<00:02:14.410> can't

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
him and unfortunately my zapdos can't

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.140 
him and unfortunately my zapdos can't
live<00:02:14.890> another<00:02:15.070> one<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.520> he<00:02:15.610> snaps<00:02:15.940> out<00:02:16.090> of

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
live another one and he snaps out of

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.520 
live another one and he snaps out of
this<00:02:16.270> confusion<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.110> he<00:02:17.200> doesn't<00:02:17.350> get

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
this confusion so he doesn't get

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.470 
this confusion so he doesn't get
confused<00:02:17.980> once<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.490> takes<00:02:18.670> down<00:02:18.819> my<00:02:19.000> zapdos

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
confused once and takes down my zapdos

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.900 
confused once and takes down my zapdos
um<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:20.770> was<00:02:20.920> just<00:02:21.069> wrong<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.460> thought<00:02:21.610> my<00:02:21.730> tab

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
um that was just wrong I thought my tab

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.700 
um that was just wrong I thought my tab
does<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.240> take<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.420> outrage<00:02:23.110> from<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.500> point

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
does it take to outrage from that point

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.800 
does it take to outrage from that point
but<00:02:23.890> he<00:02:23.980> couldn't<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.790> now<00:02:25.240> he's<00:02:25.569> confused

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
but he couldn't so now he's confused

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.840 
but he couldn't so now he's confused
again<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.380> go<00:02:26.590> out<00:02:26.710> in<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:26.920> is<00:02:27.130> or<00:02:27.280> because<00:02:27.670> he

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
again I go out in this is or because he

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.880 
again I go out in this is or because he
resists<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.240> outrage<00:02:28.690> anyway<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.200> he<00:02:29.560> has<00:02:29.740> to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
resists the outrage anyway so he has to

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.390 
resists the outrage anyway so he has to
switch<00:02:30.100> after<00:02:30.280> that

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
switch after that

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.530 
switch after that
I'm<00:02:31.579> just<00:02:31.700> going<00:02:31.849> to<00:02:31.909> go<00:02:32.030> for<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.239> swords

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
I'm just going to go for the swords

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.940 
I'm just going to go for the swords
dance<00:02:32.720> predicting<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.260> switch<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.709> even<00:02:33.860> if

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
dance predicting to switch and even if

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.649 
dance predicting to switch and even if
he<00:02:34.010> stays<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.489> I'm<00:02:34.610> pretty<00:02:34.849> sure<00:02:35.000> he<00:02:35.239> scarfed

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
he stays in I'm pretty sure he scarfed

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.500 
he stays in I'm pretty sure he scarfed
so<00:02:36.049> it<00:02:36.680> won't<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.220> know<00:02:37.340> yeah<00:02:38.030> I'm<00:02:38.390> pretty

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
that Blastoise now with brick break and

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.220 
that Blastoise now with brick break and
I<00:02:55.099> am<00:02:55.220> getting<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.549> useless<00:02:55.730> crit<00:02:56.150> but<00:02:56.959> yeah

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
that blast price goes down and that's

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.369 
that blast price goes down and that's
pretty<00:02:58.670> nice<00:02:58.909> and<00:02:59.180> now<00:02:59.930> he's<00:03:00.079> going<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.260> go<00:03:00.349> out

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
pretty nice and now he's going to go out

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.740 
pretty nice and now he's going to go out
into<00:03:00.739> blaziken<00:03:01.040> which<00:03:01.909> i'm<00:03:02.060> expecting<00:03:02.629> to<00:03:02.659> be

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
into blaziken which i'm expecting to be

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.690 
into blaziken which i'm expecting to be
like<00:03:03.260> scarfed<00:03:03.799> or<00:03:03.950> something<00:03:04.280> even<00:03:04.519> either

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
like scarfed or something even either

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.180 
like scarfed or something even either
way<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.030> faster<00:03:05.359> so<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:06.019> go<00:03:06.349> out<00:03:06.409> a<00:03:06.500> lot<00:03:06.769> e<00:03:06.829> on<00:03:07.069> us

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
way is faster so I go out a lot e on us

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.520 
way is faster so I go out a lot e on us
to<00:03:07.280> take<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.579> fire<00:03:07.760> type<00:03:08.060> move<00:03:08.299> I<00:03:08.569> don't<00:03:09.470> think

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
to take the fire type move I don't think

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.170 
to take the fire type move I don't think
bullet<00:03:09.889> punch<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.250> KO<00:03:10.400> at<00:03:10.519> that<00:03:10.670> point<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.150> I

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
bullet punch and KO at that point and I

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.610 
bullet punch and KO at that point and I
just<00:03:11.359> don't<00:03:11.540> have<00:03:11.599> risked<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.109> be<00:03:12.200> honest<00:03:12.530> I

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
just don't have risked it to be honest I

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.410 
just don't have risked it to be honest I
want<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:12.889> keep<00:03:13.040> scissor<00:03:13.280> for<00:03:13.459> later<00:03:13.670> he<00:03:14.239> gets

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
want to keep scissor for later he gets

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.479 
want to keep scissor for later he gets
the<00:03:14.599> burn<00:03:14.810> hacks<00:03:15.109> on<00:03:15.260> latias<00:03:15.650> which<00:03:16.040> isn't

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
the burn hacks on latias which isn't

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.309 
the burn hacks on latias which isn't
really<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.879> big<00:03:16.939> of<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.269> deal<00:03:17.450> because<00:03:17.720> latias

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
really that big of a deal because latias

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.140 
really that big of a deal because latias
is<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.620> special<00:03:18.950> sweeper<00:03:19.220> anyway<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.730> damages

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
is a special sweeper anyway the damages

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.699 
is a special sweeper anyway the damages
becomes<00:03:20.450> annoying<00:03:20.689> especially<00:03:21.019> when<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.560> add

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
becomes annoying especially when you add

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.250 
becomes annoying especially when you add
the<00:03:21.859> stand<00:03:22.099> storm<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.209> damage<00:03:23.629> because

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
the stand storm to that damage because

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.080 
the stand storm to that damage because
now<00:03:24.439> he<00:03:24.829> has<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:24.980> sandstorm<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.939> burn

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
now he has the sandstorm and the burn

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.449 
now he has the sandstorm and the burn
doing<00:03:26.420> annoying<00:03:26.689> damage<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.230> me<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:27.980> on<00:03:28.340> the

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
doing annoying damage to me so on the

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.770 
doing annoying damage to me so on the
switch<00:03:28.670> i<00:03:28.760> decided<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.120> call<00:03:29.269> mine<00:03:29.510> because<00:03:29.750> I

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
switch i decided to call mine because I

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.720 
switch i decided to call mine because I
expected<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.319> switch<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.799> at<00:03:31.370> this<00:03:31.489> point

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
expected the switch and at this point

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.660 
expected the switch and at this point
you<00:03:31.909> know<00:03:32.000> my<00:03:32.269> launch<00:03:32.480> isn't<00:03:33.019> too<00:03:33.230> useful<00:03:33.670> and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
you know my launch isn't too useful and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.830 
you know my launch isn't too useful and
this<00:03:35.000> time<00:03:35.150> around<00:03:35.239> I<00:03:35.389> was<00:03:35.449> just<00:03:35.569> going<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.750> be

this time around I was just going to be

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.780 
this time around I was just going to be
a<00:03:35.900> pain<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.590> decided<00:03:36.859> just<00:03:36.919> to<00:03:37.099> dragon<00:03:37.579> pulse

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
a pain so I decided just to dragon pulse

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.909 
a pain so I decided just to dragon pulse
and<00:03:37.970> get<00:03:38.120> as<00:03:38.209> much<00:03:38.389> damage<00:03:38.629> as<00:03:38.840> possible

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
and get as much damage as possible

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.439 
and get as much damage as possible
should<00:03:39.919> do<00:03:40.069> decent<00:03:40.519> damage<00:03:40.639> after<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.239> call

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
should do decent damage after the call

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:42.640 
should do decent damage after the call
mind<00:03:41.690> even<00:03:41.900> though<00:03:42.019> he<00:03:42.139> does<00:03:42.319> get<00:03:42.470> the

about<00:03:47.449> half<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.930> his<00:03:47.989> tyranitar<00:03:48.590> which<00:03:49.400> isn't

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
about half to his tyranitar which isn't

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.030 
about half to his tyranitar which isn't
too<00:03:49.790> shabby<00:03:49.819> actually<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.590> I<00:03:51.620> go<00:03:51.769> out<00:03:51.889> into

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
too shabby actually so I go out into

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.619 
too shabby actually so I go out into
flygon<00:03:52.489> because<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:52.879> know<00:03:52.940> I'm<00:03:53.150> faster<00:03:53.510> with

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
flygon because I know I'm faster with

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.390 
flygon because I know I'm faster with
flygon<00:03:54.019> because<00:03:54.319> mine<00:03:54.530> scarfed<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.250> just

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
flygon because mine scarfed and I just

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.740 
flygon because mine scarfed and I just
go<00:03:55.519> for<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.730> u-turn<00:03:56.150> because<00:03:56.449> I<00:03:56.510> thought<00:03:56.690> he

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
go for the u-turn because I thought he

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.780 
go for the u-turn because I thought he
may<00:03:57.019> switch<00:03:57.379> and<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:58.040> u-turn<00:03:58.340> actually

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
may switch and the u-turn actually

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.670 
may switch and the u-turn actually
doesn't<00:03:59.090> quite<00:03:59.299> KO<00:03:59.569> tyranitar<00:04:00.290> which<00:04:00.470> makes

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
doesn't quite KO tyranitar which makes

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.800 
doesn't quite KO tyranitar which makes
me<00:04:00.859> upset<00:04:00.979> so<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.459> go<00:04:01.609> in<00:04:01.639> my<00:04:01.819> own<00:04:01.940> tyranitar<00:04:02.569> not

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
me upset so I go in my own tyranitar not

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.689 
me upset so I go in my own tyranitar not
and<00:04:02.989> yeah<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.530> kind<00:04:03.919> of<00:04:03.949> figured<00:04:04.010> he<00:04:04.310> dies<00:04:04.459> fan

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
and yeah I kind of figured he dies fan

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.789 
and yeah I kind of figured he dies fan
um<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.659> like<00:04:05.720> spanking<00:04:06.079> mrs.<00:04:06.379> but<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:06.620> really

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
um it's like spanking mrs. but it really

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.379 
um it's like spanking mrs. but it really
wouldn't<00:04:07.010> have<00:04:07.069> done<00:04:07.250> much<00:04:07.310> anyway<00:04:07.819> and<00:04:08.150> I

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
wouldn't have done much anyway and I

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.119 
wouldn't have done much anyway and I
just<00:04:08.540> go<00:04:08.629> for<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.810> stone<00:04:09.049> edge<00:04:09.260> my<00:04:09.859> Grover

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
just go for the stone edge my Grover

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.289 
just go for the stone edge my Grover
this<00:04:10.250> don't<00:04:10.400> edge<00:04:10.519> basically<00:04:11.030> because<00:04:11.209> I

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
this don't edge basically because I

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.399 
this don't edge basically because I
don't<00:04:11.540> want<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.780> go<00:04:11.870> for<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.049> earthquake<00:04:12.379> and

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
don't want to go for the earthquake and

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.349 
don't want to go for the earthquake and
have<00:04:12.650> him<00:04:12.769> switch<00:04:13.010> out<00:04:13.159> and<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.400> flygon<00:04:13.849> or

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
have him switch out and to flygon or

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.759 
have him switch out and to flygon or
something<00:04:14.659> or<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:15.260> know<00:04:15.349> something

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
something or that you know something

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.560 
something or that you know something
else<00:04:15.919> I<00:04:16.159> just<00:04:16.820> want<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.030> get<00:04:17.120> damaged<00:04:17.449> on

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
else I just want to get damaged on

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.289 
else I just want to get damaged on
basically<00:04:17.959> anything<00:04:18.139> he<00:04:18.349> decided<00:04:18.590> to<00:04:18.650> go<00:04:18.769> into

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
basically anything he decided to go into

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.930 
basically anything he decided to go into
but<00:04:20.299> after<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:20.780> kill<00:04:21.109> his<00:04:21.550> tyranitar<00:04:22.550> he<00:04:22.789> goes

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
but after I kill his tyranitar he goes

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.629 
but after I kill his tyranitar he goes
out<00:04:23.150> into<00:04:23.300> his<00:04:23.690> Blaziken<00:04:24.349> and<00:04:24.560> sky<00:04:25.039> uppercuts

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
out into his Blaziken and sky uppercuts

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.210 
out into his Blaziken and sky uppercuts
me<00:04:25.820> which<00:04:26.389> hurts<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.500> reason<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.919> stayed

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
me which hurts and the reason I stayed

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.680 
me which hurts and the reason I stayed
in<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.639> don't<00:04:28.849> have<00:04:28.970> anything<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.330> really

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
in so I don't have anything to really

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.390 
in so I don't have anything to really
take<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.020> sky<00:04:30.289> uppercut<00:04:30.590> or<00:04:30.949> a<00:04:31.039> fighting-type

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
take a sky uppercut or a fighting-type

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.420 
take a sky uppercut or a fighting-type
move<00:04:31.789> so<00:04:32.419> I<00:04:32.449> just<00:04:32.720> had<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.840> leave<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.349> in<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:34.070> now

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
move so I just had to leave it in so now

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.610 
move so I just had to leave it in so now
I<00:04:34.460> do<00:04:34.610> go<00:04:34.940> out<00:04:35.060> in<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.240> flag<00:04:35.449> on<00:04:35.659> and<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:36.080> predict

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
I do go out in the flag on and I predict

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.290 
I do go out in the flag on and I predict
a<00:04:36.680> switching<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.039> fly<00:04:37.220> got<00:04:37.460> his<00:04:37.669> flag<00:04:37.909> on<00:04:38.120> this

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
a switching to fly got his flag on this

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.690 
a switching to fly got his flag on this
time<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:38.720> i<00:04:38.750> go<00:04:38.990> for<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.229> outrage<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.950> of

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
time so i go for the outrage and of

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.890 
time so i go for the outrage and of
course<00:04:40.940> that's<00:04:41.060> super<00:04:41.330> effective<00:04:41.599> it<00:04:41.840> will
