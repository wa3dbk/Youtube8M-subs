that shows in this video this is the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.000 
that shows in this video this is the
2012<00:01:06.710> zx-14r<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> has<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.110> 1441<00:01:10.110> CC<00:01:10.740> motor

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
2012 zx-14r so it has the 1441 CC motor

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.719 
2012 zx-14r so it has the 1441 CC motor
so<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.909> line<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.830> fuel<00:01:13.830> injected<00:01:14.400> ram<00:01:14.700> air

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
so in line for fuel injected ram air

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.580 
so in line for fuel injected ram air
liquid<00:01:17.729> cooled<00:01:17.990> they<00:01:18.990> did<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> couple<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
liquid cooled they did a couple of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100 
liquid cooled they did a couple of
things<00:01:19.770> new<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.310> these<00:01:20.460> 2012<00:01:21.090> zx-14<00:01:21.810> s<00:01:21.990> they

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
things new on these 2012 zx-14 s they

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.530 
things new on these 2012 zx-14 s they
added<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> second<00:01:22.740> radiator<00:01:23.100> fan<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:24.210> control

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
added a second radiator fan to control

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.660 
added a second radiator fan to control
heat<00:01:24.810> better<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.619> lighten<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> wheels<00:01:26.340> up

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
heat better they lighten the wheels up

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
heat better they lighten the wheels up
by<00:01:26.850> about<00:01:27.030> 3<00:01:27.299> pounds<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.900> course<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.290> just

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
by about 3 pounds of course they just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.710 
by about 3 pounds of course they just
increase<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.430> displacement<00:01:30.150> from<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
increase the displacement from the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.319 
increase the displacement from the
previous<00:01:31.170> es<00:01:31.470> 14s<00:01:32.130> by<00:01:32.250> almost<00:01:32.520> 100<00:01:32.729> C<00:01:33.090> seats

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
previous es 14s by almost 100 C seats

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.850 
previous es 14s by almost 100 C seats
it's<00:01:33.570> about<00:01:33.750> 90<00:01:34.110> CCS<00:01:34.619> from<00:01:35.549> 1352<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.740> 1441<00:01:38.509> and

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
it's about 90 CCS from 1352 to 1441 and

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.160 
it's about 90 CCS from 1352 to 1441 and
then<00:01:40.860> these<00:01:40.950> also<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.520> traction<00:01:41.820> control

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
then these also have traction control

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.929 
then these also have traction control
and<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.899> has<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.320> power<00:01:46.530> modes<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:49.939> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
and it has some power modes and the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.370 
and it has some power modes and the
power<00:01:51.180> mode<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> traction<00:01:51.899> control<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
power mode the traction control so you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.350 
power mode the traction control so you
can<00:01:52.560> set<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.799> power<00:01:53.130> mode<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.850> there<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.149> says

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
can set your power mode so there it says

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.280 
can set your power mode so there it says
it<00:01:55.140> says<00:01:55.350> full<00:01:55.619> power

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 

it's<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:58.740> full<00:01:58.979> power<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.579> then<00:01:59.820> low<00:02:00.000> power

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it's a go full power and then low power

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.440 
it's a go full power and then low power
and<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.700> go<00:02:02.820> over<00:02:02.939> here<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.149> traction

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and you can go over here and traction

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.850 
and you can go over here and traction
control<00:02:03.630> mode<00:02:04.170> well<00:02:04.950> -<00:02:05.369> mode<00:02:05.909> 3<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:07.740> you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
control mode well - mode 3 and then you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.920 
control mode well - mode 3 and then you
can<00:02:08.039> also<00:02:08.610> turn<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.090> traction<00:02:09.330> control<00:02:09.479> off

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.750 

anyway

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.660 

there<00:02:17.360> we<00:02:17.480> go<00:02:17.659> and<00:02:18.530> then<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:19.250> other<00:02:19.430> cool

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
there we go and then the other cool

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.369 
there we go and then the other cool
thing<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.269> can<00:02:20.450> do<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.930> can<00:02:21.079> do<00:02:21.200> all

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
thing that you can do and you can do all

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.089 
thing that you can do and you can do all
that<00:02:21.409> from<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.040> handlebar<00:02:22.459> here<00:02:23.709> is<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:24.920> can

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
that from the handlebar here is you can

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.069 
that from the handlebar here is you can
do<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.549> but<00:02:25.730> by<00:02:25.849> pushing<00:02:26.329> here<00:02:26.659> you<00:02:26.900> can

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
do that but by pushing here you can

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.809 
do that but by pushing here you can
scroll<00:02:27.349> through<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.650> dash<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.310> hopefully<00:02:28.760> you

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
scroll through the dash so hopefully you

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.490 
scroll through the dash so hopefully you
can<00:02:28.849> see<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:29.209> as<00:02:29.510> battery<00:02:29.870> voltage<00:02:30.260> outside

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
can see this as battery voltage outside

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.830 
can see this as battery voltage outside

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.750 
fuel range and then back to the battery
voltage<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.579> it's<00:02:38.239> really<00:02:38.420> cool<00:02:38.659> that<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:40.610> can

it has the solo Cal on it the rear seat

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.050 
it has the solo Cal on it the rear seat
is<00:02:57.739> under<00:02:57.980> here<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.430> can<00:02:58.549> take<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:58.819> cowl
