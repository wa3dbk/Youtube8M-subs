okay so we've established that a super
zoom<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.430> zoom<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.539> super<00:00:28.199> way<00:00:28.460> super<00:00:29.460> but

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
zoom can zoom in a super way super but

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.910 

the<00:00:47.030> benefit<00:00:47.510> was<00:00:47.690> superzoom<00:00:48.170> it's<00:00:48.710> quite

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
the benefit was superzoom it's quite

got<00:02:48.370> bored<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.760> wildlife<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.569> went<00:02:49.810> for<00:02:49.959> some

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
got bored of wildlife so I went for some

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.089 
got bored of wildlife so I went for some
battered<00:02:50.650> wildlife<00:02:51.159> by<00:02:51.579> to<00:02:51.640> see<00:02:52.890> one<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
battered wildlife by to see one of the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.100 
battered wildlife by to see one of the
big<00:02:54.220> comes<00:02:54.430> with<00:02:54.640> super<00:02:54.939> zooms<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.329> that<00:02:55.540> the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
big comes with super zooms is that the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.929 
big comes with super zooms is that the
performance<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.709> not<00:02:56.739> too<00:02:57.310> good<00:02:57.579> throughout

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
the range but what about his lens

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.990 
the range but what about his lens
sharpness<00:03:02.409> is<00:03:02.650> good<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.159> center<00:03:03.609> from

it's<00:04:17.120> something<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.420> do<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.630> donuts<00:04:18.049> from

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
it's something to do the donuts from

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:26.659 
it's something to do the donuts from
this<00:04:18.500> place<00:04:20.560> I'll<00:04:21.560> take<00:04:21.739> picture

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.880 

right<00:04:28.129> we<00:04:29.129> have<00:04:29.280> careful<00:04:29.699> framing<00:04:30.060> here

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.180 

it<00:04:33.890> isn't<00:04:34.280> completely<00:04:34.520> practical<00:04:35.390> however

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
it isn't completely practical however

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.380 
it isn't completely practical however
but<00:04:37.190> there<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.490> problem<00:04:37.730> with<00:04:37.880> his<00:04:37.970> lens<00:04:38.120> and

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
but there is a problem with his lens and

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.240 
but there is a problem with his lens and
it's<00:04:38.510> not<00:04:38.660> just<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.050> autofocus<00:04:39.500> which<00:04:39.860> is<00:04:40.040> not

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
it's not just the autofocus which is not

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.850 
it's not just the autofocus which is not
that<00:04:40.670> quick<00:04:41.150> it's<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.290> fact<00:04:42.500> that<00:04:42.620> the

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
that quick it's the fact that the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.910 
that quick it's the fact that the
minimum<00:04:43.190> focus<00:04:43.580> distance<00:04:44.380> well<00:04:45.380> for<00:04:45.560> one<00:04:45.710> it's

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
minimum focus distance well for one it's

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.840 
minimum focus distance well for one it's
not<00:04:46.190> that<00:04:46.760> close<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:48.250> there's<00:04:49.250> two<00:04:49.520> of<00:04:49.670> them

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
not that close and there's two of them

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.150 
not that close and there's two of them
and<00:04:50.530> long<00:04:51.530> range<00:04:51.940> it's<00:04:52.940> longer<00:04:53.860> close<00:04:54.860> range

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
and long range it's longer close range

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.900 
and long range it's longer close range
fifty<00:04:56.120> centimeters<00:04:56.830> but<00:04:57.830> as<00:04:58.040> you<00:04:58.490> go<00:04:58.670> through

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
fifty centimeters but as you go through

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.130 
fifty centimeters but as you go through
the<00:04:59.060> zoom<00:04:59.240> range<00:04:59.450> it<00:05:00.410> gets<00:05:00.680> further<00:05:00.980> away<00:05:01.340> so

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
the zoom range it gets further away so

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.330 
the zoom range it gets further away so
when<00:05:03.140> you're<00:05:03.260> sitting<00:05:03.560> at<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.740> table<00:05:03.950> when<00:05:04.250> you

when you're sitting at a table when you

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.740 
when you're sitting at a table when you
want<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.550> take<00:05:04.730> some<00:05:04.940> food<00:05:05.180> shots<00:05:05.570> or

something Annie's oom in you slowly

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.610 
something Annie's oom in you slowly
start<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.270> see<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:11.630> go<00:05:12.110> out<00:05:12.320> of<00:05:12.560> focus<00:05:14.470> so<00:05:15.470> when

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
start to see it go out of focus so when

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.700 
start to see it go out of focus so when
