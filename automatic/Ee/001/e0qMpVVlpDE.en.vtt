00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello guys you drive it 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.779
 long-awaited races I'm on a new car 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.500
 who added this update 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.150
 which came out just an hour ago and this 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.289
 car honestly I do not really 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.210
 like i bought and then reasons to 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.939
 ride on something unusual unusual 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.430
 and besides, her spoiler 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.340
 when we accelerate to high speeds and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.689
 it seemed to me very funny and 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.300
 I really think it's better to go with now 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.290
 ipod view off hood 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.600
 ok i took this tag but somehow not by 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.739
 honestly there are two circles here anyway 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.629
 I still have to go through this 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:50.010
 whirl this round all the words already 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.610
 lost while here went to the shelves I think 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.170
 again I will not do a review on 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.360
 update this many are already engaged i 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.250
 just as usual I will say that I am more 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.520
 I just liked it and naturally this one 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.990
 car more or less spoiler he 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.810
 really cool and the boat is beautiful 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.010
 such a wooden color and immediately 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.220
 bought despite the fact that she is very 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.950
 dear and when I still forgot about 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.560
 a small bonus why i didn't take it down 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.229
 why with a small bonus console game 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.970
 We have added a birth which is called 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.299
 having done which was originally only 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.630
 so far we have this crap 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.780
 quickly view everything i'm ready now ok 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.820
 get through as much as I like 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.939
 jumped in let's sleep again 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.369
 so try again I did not even understand 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:47.460
 what I jumped so well 5 5 5 is crap 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.570
 really don't get it I'll try with the usual 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.619
 overlooking the main thing exactly can call in this 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.220
 the problem is i am real and what is it what is it 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.770
 Like the first time I drove on 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.090
 but now it is absolutely impossible therefore 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.690
 use this tactic 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.580
 u so because guys you saw yourself 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.030
 in vain as long as it is bhagavan 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.560
 it's impossible not to call in but why 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:21.050
 no tricks, too, must be applied as 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.620
 so now again these narrow streets so not 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.620
 bump into 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.670
 here we have again yes here again you will 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:37.720
 these narrowly difficult passable street so 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.120
 To the right I hold on to the third position in 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.340
 Basically spoke a little bit 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:50.819
 distracted well ok ok so i already 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.410
 Now I will finish went perfectly 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.959
 Yes, I finished the guys at 3 positions 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.110
 through the park seconds see you next 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.880
 the race of the guys in this moment with me 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.130
 microphone turned on literally 5 seconds 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.130
 so don't worry i'll be right back 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.280
 friends apologize microphone 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.320
 would disconnect for a few seconds and in 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:33.240
 Basically today now everything is in order 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.980
 but we are going to overcome this half bow and me 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.460
 actually blew well let's fold me 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.040
 blew then why shouldn't i give that 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.610
 are you really doing better 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.550
 now all the same take acceleration again 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.330
 let me explode our kind so kind 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.680
 what the fuck is 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.250
 why the hell guys nokia I understood everything 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.230
 understood no more mercy 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.550
 so the main thing is to equalize no no 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.580
 please never break 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:09.690
 they will weigh the aika and not twist it 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:13.950
 cool but clearly all uh by 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:17.370
 so probably now 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.530
 oh my god it's just unbearably killed 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.919
 and kill plans somehow overcome 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:29.220
 this race so I control very badly 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.400
 the car is in the air, why are we skilled then 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:37.919
 I can't figure it out 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:44.400
 I was all called here so nefig 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:46.070
 hurt me so so neatly not 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.600
 don't turn over but why 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.910
 oh how good is acceleration right now 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.870
 take acceleration so for me it is not necessary 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.150
 ITS metrics how I surpassed the 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.180
 and again and in third place finished 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.150
 Well, this is a direct action. I was a race. 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.280
 strained all the time sat ok guys on 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.460
