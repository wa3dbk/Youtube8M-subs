 little news we have to work

 this tree of this tree asked you 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.820
 many times I explain the doubles 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.460
 trunk the forests this tree is a 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.960
 perfect example for that because I'm going 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.070
 to teach the topic of branching that 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.050
 always have to go from inside to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.340
 outside and all that triangular history 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.080
 gone as a whole to laterality 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.640
 individual singularity from all 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.649
 points of view from above from the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.470
 sides of skirts everything I'm going to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.489
 explain and that's going to be a very video 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.110
 nutritious for everyone as the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.410
 kyrie is a although there were people gone 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.170
 contrary 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.880
 let's do the work of this tree 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.309
 let's work we 're going to leaf the 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.570
 big ficus that they brought to me we're going to 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.710
 do a job on one and this one 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.300
 giant with a design but determined 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.420
 we are going to make bonsai updates 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.040
 but I will surely do tomorrow the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.500
 update of the experiment of the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.460
 substrates I will do the update 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.570
 surely on Sunday of the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.640
 experiment of the invention experiment 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.259
 East of the tray with the sand of 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.570
 silica to keep the chords 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.340
 small we are going to work also the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.170
 bonsai to be or to sound this one that has the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.180
 super long waterfall in fact not even 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.840
 I know if I'm going to do it in cascade or in 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.280
 moyock and everything will look and I have to do 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.539
 many jobs I will do a 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.160
 work also from taiwan that is 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.729
 totally disheveled from zamora and is 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.110
 incredible and I have here some are already in 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.930
 some stories I have a lot 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.800
 very much very much more so this end 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.060
 of the week I'm going to do some 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.619
 very nice updates that stops 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.960
 like it a lot because apart it's something that 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.820
 I asked him assiduously that you are waiting 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.110
 and from Monday we will enter another 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.300
 Once again headfirst into work 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.530
 technicians like the wiring of this 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.210
 precious pine 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.860
 a double trunk a style that I think that 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.660
 I have never worked in depth with 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.790
 what was going to be but well this has 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.920
 everything has to be pine that I do not 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.220
 interesting because apart in the black pine 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.569
 is a Scots pine of a variety with 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.060
 I try a little different from those of the brush 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.340
 classic mitsumi the samurai is 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.080
 amazing to watch the samurai as it goes down like this 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.390
 is the samurai can have them 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.890
 defoliated having wired it and the cane 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.410
 that we gave him a little while ago 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.440
 you agree that we made the video inside the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.670
 study and everything because that 's super 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.709
 and it's good because we're going to have 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.940
 many samurai jobs too and 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.769
 work it of course you can not 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.090
 leave well also because then it 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.739
 loses a little the training that we have 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.150
 done and that's it and that's it 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.680
 Well, we're already going to do the 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.810
 pine work we are going to do many 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.340
 more jobs I have to polish is also 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.870
 a coil that works in a video 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.920
 I have to polish is also a milestone of 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.870
 women that there is a big branch and 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.030
 throw the Chinese and veda precisely that 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.780
 will be a little forward in the bread already 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.720
 the century does not work 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.660
 taiwan the samurai and the guys this 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.800
 giant man huge one thousand jobs and 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.270
 you will all see it only goes to
