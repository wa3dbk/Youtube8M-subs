00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
by buying a ps3 controller it turned out

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.130 
by buying a ps3 controller it turned out
to<00:00:30.039> be<00:00:30.160> a<00:00:30.189> fake<00:00:30.550> one<00:00:30.580> I<00:00:31.060> bought<00:00:31.689> it<00:00:31.839> from<00:00:31.990> a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
to be a fake one I bought it from a

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.680 
to be a fake one I bought it from a
seller<00:00:32.470> from<00:00:32.769> the<00:00:32.920> United<00:00:33.339> States<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:34.059> it

seller from the United States and it

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.930 
seller from the United States and it
looked<00:00:34.930> very<00:00:35.019> real<00:00:35.650> until<00:00:36.460> I<00:00:36.519> started

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
looked very real until I started

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.780 
looked very real until I started
scrutinizing<00:00:37.750> it<00:00:37.870> I<00:00:38.280> started<00:00:39.280> reading<00:00:39.519> the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
scrutinizing it I started reading the

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.500 
scrutinizing it I started reading the
text<00:00:40.210> on<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.480> back<00:00:40.660> and<00:00:40.989> I<00:00:41.350> noticed<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:41.890> typo<00:00:42.510> it

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
text on the back and I noticed a typo it

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.290 
text on the back and I noticed a typo it
says<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.900> system<00:00:44.589> software<00:00:45.100> update<00:00:46.000> may<00:00:46.239> be

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
says a system software update may be

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.799 
says a system software update may be
required<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.309> I<00:00:48.610> started<00:00:49.090> digging<00:00:49.270> into<00:00:49.629> it

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
required so I started digging into it

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.540 
required so I started digging into it
and<00:00:50.050> I<00:00:50.140> actually<00:00:50.320> happen<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:51.010> have<00:00:51.280> another

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
and I actually happen to have another

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.830 
and I actually happen to have another
box<00:00:52.059> from<00:00:52.539> a<00:00:52.660> legit<00:00:53.079> controller<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:55.420> blueish

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
box from a legit controller the blueish

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.020 
box from a legit controller the blueish
coloring<00:00:56.410> of<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.649> box<00:00:56.890> is<00:00:57.219> a<00:00:57.520> little<00:00:57.699> bit

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
coloring of the box is a little bit

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.780 
coloring of the box is a little bit
different

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.450 

and<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:06.630> there's<00:01:06.870> a<00:01:07.050> symbol<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.860> says<00:01:08.070> Sony

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and then there's a symbol that says Sony

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.790 
and then there's a symbol that says Sony
Computer<00:01:08.730> Entertainment<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
Computer Entertainment the one on the

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.280 
Computer Entertainment the one on the
right<00:01:10.980> just<00:01:11.160> looks<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.520> different

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
right just looks a little different

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
right just looks a little different
intricate<00:01:13.290> designs<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.310> hard<00:01:14.580> for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
intricate designs like this are hard for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.150 
intricate designs like this are hard for
pirates<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.660> copy<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:19.200> way<00:01:19.380> they<00:01:19.530> cut<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> Box

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
pirates to copy the way they cut the Box

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
pirates to copy the way they cut the Box
is<00:01:20.370> a<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.730> different<00:01:21.120> too<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:23.850> noticed

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
is a little different too and I noticed

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.770 
is a little different too and I noticed
the<00:01:24.360> bottom<00:01:24.750> has<00:01:25.260> some<00:01:25.560> differences<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.250> well

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.719 

but<00:01:30.780> here's<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> bane<00:01:31.410> giveaway<00:01:31.979> when<00:01:32.580> you

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
but here's the bane giveaway when you

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.060 
but here's the bane giveaway when you
press<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.210> analog<00:01:33.720> stick<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.530> fake<00:01:34.830> one

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
press on the analog stick the fake one

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.580 
press on the analog stick the fake one
makes<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.400> totally<00:01:35.820> different<00:01:36.180> sound<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.290> let's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
makes a totally different sound so let's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.680 
makes a totally different sound so let's
try<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.700> left<00:01:38.940> is<00:01:39.090> real<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
try this the one on the left is real and

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:50.690 
try this the one on the left is real and
the<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> right<00:01:40.410> is<00:01:40.530> fake<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:50.369> one<00:01:50.550> on

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the one on the right is fake the one on

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.730 
the one on the right is fake the one on
the<00:01:50.820> right<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.150> just<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.479> lot<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.960> stiffer<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the right is just a lot more stiffer and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.609 
the right is just a lot more stiffer and
makes<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.100> different<00:01:53.850> sound<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.330> together

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
makes a different sound all together

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.170 
makes a different sound all together
Sony<00:01:55.619> would<00:01:55.830> not<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.160> this<00:01:56.340> sloppy<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.030> have

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
Sony would not be this sloppy to have

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.420 
Sony would not be this sloppy to have
differences<00:01:57.570> between<00:01:57.930> its<00:01:58.320> controllers<00:01:58.920> they

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
differences between its controllers they

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.760 
differences between its controllers they
would<00:01:59.580> do<00:01:59.729> everything<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.330> same<00:02:00.570> way<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.650> I'm

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
would do everything the same way so I'm

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.230 
would do everything the same way so I'm
going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> end<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.250> sending<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.759> controller

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
going to end up sending this controller

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
going to end up sending this controller
back<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> thought<00:02:04.110> I'd<00:02:04.200> share<00:02:04.440> this<00:02:04.649> with

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
back but I thought I'd share this with

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
back but I thought I'd share this with
you<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.729> keep<00:02:05.850> an<00:02:06.030> eye<00:02:06.149> out<00:02:06.180> but

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you just so you can keep an eye out but

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.780 
you just so you can keep an eye out but
now<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> ps4<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.009> out<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.369> probably

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
now that the ps4 is out it's probably

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.669 
now that the ps4 is out it's probably
too<00:02:09.000> little<00:02:09.239> too<00:02:09.509> late<00:02:09.780> there's<00:02:10.320> probably

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
too little too late there's probably

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.130 
too little too late there's probably
fake<00:02:10.920> ps3<00:02:11.670> controllers<00:02:12.150> everywhere<00:02:12.720> there's

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
fake ps3 controllers everywhere there's

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.840 
fake ps3 controllers everywhere there's
a<00:02:13.230> lot<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.650> factories<00:02:14.070> in<00:02:14.250> China<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.820> are

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
a lot of factories in China that are

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.330 
a lot of factories in China that are
copying<00:02:15.480> stuff<00:02:16.140> from<00:02:16.440> around<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.860> world<00:02:17.040> and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
copying stuff from around the world and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.979 
copying stuff from around the world and
selling<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.000> they've<00:02:18.570> gotten<00:02:18.840> really

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
selling it and they've gotten really

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.320 
selling it and they've gotten really
good<00:02:19.230> at<00:02:19.290> replicating<00:02:19.590> stuff<00:02:20.310> but<00:02:21.060> they're

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
good at replicating stuff but they're

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.670
