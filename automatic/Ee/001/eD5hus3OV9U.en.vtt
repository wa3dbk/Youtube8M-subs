called<00:00:44.510> a<00:00:44.720> 2d<00:00:45.049> platformer<00:00:45.710> but<00:00:45.890> there's

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
called a 2d platformer but there's

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.539 
called a 2d platformer but there's
really<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:47.540> much<00:00:47.570> more<00:00:48.080> going<00:00:48.350> on<00:00:48.650> here<00:00:48.710> to
