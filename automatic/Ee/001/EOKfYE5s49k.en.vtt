00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
three decks but I'm pretty sure the only

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.609 
three decks but I'm pretty sure the only
two<00:00:18.090> decks<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.539> people<00:00:18.960> will<00:00:19.050> be<00:00:19.170> focusing

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
on our wind-ups and the in sectors why I

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.170 
on our wind-ups and the in sectors why I
don't<00:00:24.570> include<00:00:24.900> ninjas<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.769> top<00:00:26.580> tool<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
