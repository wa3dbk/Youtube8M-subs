00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
using your big TV it's actually very

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.160 
using your big TV it's actually very
very<00:00:33.770> difficult<00:00:34.190> to<00:00:34.579> get<00:00:34.700> used<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:35.239> fly<00:00:35.540> fpv<00:00:35.780> on

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
very difficult to get used to fly fpv on

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.049 
very difficult to get used to fly fpv on
this<00:00:36.380> little<00:00:36.559> cup<00:00:37.070> or<00:00:37.219> indoors<00:00:37.609> because<00:00:37.760> the

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
this little cup or indoors because the

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.330 
this little cup or indoors because the
space<00:00:38.329> is<00:00:38.390> very<00:00:38.660> confined<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.949> drifting

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
space is very confined and the drifting

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.270 
space is very confined and the drifting
can<00:00:40.789> easily<00:00:41.180> get<00:00:41.329> this<00:00:41.539> to<00:00:41.780> walls<00:00:42.260> but<00:00:43.039> it

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
can easily get this to walls but it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.130 
can easily get this to walls but it
scratch<00:00:43.609> resistant<00:00:44.120> I've<00:00:44.300> crashing<00:00:44.750> into<00:00:44.989> all

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
scratch resistant I've crashing into all

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.389 
scratch resistant I've crashing into all
the<00:00:45.289> number<00:00:45.559> of<00:00:45.679> times<00:00:45.890> when<00:00:46.100> I'm<00:00:46.190> practicing

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
the number of times when I'm practicing

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.910 
the number of times when I'm practicing
the<00:00:46.820> fpv<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.359> it<00:00:47.989> didn't<00:00:48.170> upgrade<00:00:48.320> is<00:00:48.649> still

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
the fpv and it didn't upgrade is still

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.290 
the fpv and it didn't upgrade is still
fine<00:00:49.129> very<00:00:49.309> well<00:00:49.519> let<00:00:49.910> me<00:00:50.000> give<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:50.210> the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
fine very well let me give you the

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.200 
fine very well let me give you the
flight<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:51.469> can<00:00:51.620> see<00:00:51.890> Miriam<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:52.940> going<00:00:53.120> to

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
flight and we can see Miriam is going to

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.869 
flight and we can see Miriam is going to
shoot<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.539> quadcopter<00:00:54.140> first<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.339> so<00:00:55.789> you

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
shoot the quadcopter first and so you

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.400 
shoot the quadcopter first and so you
can<00:00:56.030> see<00:00:56.089> how<00:00:56.239> stable<00:00:56.690> it<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:56.929> in<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.260> air

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
can see how stable it is in the air

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.189 
can see how stable it is in the air
using<00:00:57.859> dym<00:00:58.429> for<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.910> then<00:00:59.480> maybe<00:00:59.719> time<00:01:00.050> my

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
using dym for and then maybe time my

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.139 
using dym for and then maybe time my
time<00:01:00.320> she<00:01:00.559> will<00:01:00.649> shoot<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.399> video<00:01:01.640> on<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.850> TV

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149

loving<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.950> only<00:03:59.130> thing<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.430> don't<00:03:59.580> like<00:03:59.790> is

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
loving it the only thing I don't like is

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.509 
loving it the only thing I don't like is
the<00:04:00.150> flight<00:04:01.049> time<00:04:01.080> because<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.799> fpv<00:04:02.190> system

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
the flight time because the fpv system

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.800 
the flight time because the fpv system
is<00:04:02.610> also<00:04:02.850> taking<00:04:03.030> power<00:04:03.330> from<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.600> same

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
is also taking power from the same

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.550 
is also taking power from the same
battery<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.860> flight<00:04:05.130> time<00:04:05.370> significantly

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
battery so the flight time significantly

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.930 
battery so the flight time significantly
reduced<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:08.040> basically<00:04:08.519> I'm<00:04:08.730> actually

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
reduced so basically I'm actually

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.900 
reduced so basically I'm actually
getting<00:04:09.269> like<00:04:10.100> 3-4<00:04:11.100> minutes<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.670> flight<00:04:11.880> time

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
getting like 3-4 minutes of flight time

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.020 
getting like 3-4 minutes of flight time
only<00:04:12.420> or<00:04:12.739> maximum<00:04:13.739> five<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.489> six<00:04:14.700> minute<00:04:14.940> if

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
only or maximum five to six minute if

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.120 
only or maximum five to six minute if
I'm<00:04:15.150> flying<00:04:15.299> slow<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.840> have

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
I'm flying slow and have

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.040 
I'm flying slow and have
rap<00:04:16.430> which<00:04:16.850> is<00:04:17.000> actually<00:04:17.239> enough<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.870> have

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050 
rap which is actually enough to have

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.780 
rap which is actually enough to have
