00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:03.779
 Online advertising has its own language, 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:05.946
 If it sounds like a foreign language to you, 

00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:07.745
 You are not alone who you think this is. 

00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:10.006
 But it is important that terminology becomes familiar to you, 

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:14.089
 So you can make the most of your AdWords investment. 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.674
 To help understand the whole thing, we give you this scenario: 

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:18.745
 Owen plans to have a wedding, 

00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:21.165
 Brenda works as a photographer. 

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:23.585
 Brenda uses AdWords for online advertising 

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:26.006
 For people looking for a photographer. 

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.216
 This is one of her ads. 

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:30.947
 Brenda picks up three types of images: 

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:32.007
 Young children, 

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:32.980
 Real estate, 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.547
 And weddings. 

00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:37.478
 They use different ads for each of their business areas. 

00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:41.262
 Each ad group is one of the ad groups. 

00:00:41.262 --> 00:00:43.904
 Brenda is assigned to each ad group 

00:00:43.904 --> 00:00:47.211
 Words and phrases suitable for that part of their business. 

00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.173
 These are the keywords. 

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:53.146
 AdWords uses keywords to help identify ads 

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:56.800
 Which will be shown to people searching for things online. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.949
 The three ad groups for Brenda are a campaign. 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.046
 The campaign is where Brenda decides big things, 

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:06.714
 Such as device preferences where your ads will appear, 

00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:10.631
 And the amount you spend on them. 

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:15.997
 Owen enters the search query "Experienced Wedding Photographer" on Google.com. 

00:01:15.997 --> 00:01:20.213
 The phrase "experienced wedding photographer" is the search term he entered. 

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.673
 It shows two types of search results: 

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:26.646
 The organic search results displayed in the middle of the page 

00:01:26.646 --> 00:01:30.173
 Are sites that match the search term entered by Owen. 

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.646
 No one can pay for his position in these results. 

00:01:33.646 --> 00:01:37.006
 The second type of results, the results paid, 

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:38.312
 They usually appear at the top of the page, 

00:01:38.312 --> 00:01:39.174
 Or below, 

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:41.646
 Or on the right side. 

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:45.341
 These are ads from businesses that use AdWords. 

00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:48.614
 In most cases, the advertiser pays the costs when someone initiates like Owen 

00:01:48.614 --> 00:01:50.686
 By clicking one of these ads. 

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:54.378
 See, does Brenda's ad appear when Owen is researching it? 

00:01:54.378 --> 00:01:55.590
 This varies depending on the situation. 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.215
 Whenever someone uses Google to search, 

00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:02.423
 An auction determines which ads appear and rank. 

00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:05.460
 There are two main factors that determine the outcome: 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.675
 How much an advertiser wants to pay for each click, 

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:10.332
 This is the price offer, 

00:02:10.332 --> 00:02:13.339
 And another factor called "Quality Score". 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.713
 Quality Score is an estimate of the relevance and usefulness of your ad 

00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:19.279
 And the page of your website to which it links 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.981
 For the person who sees your ad. 

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.612
 Sets your bid and Quality Score together 

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:30.713
 Whether the Brenda ad will appear on the Owen search results page as well as where it appears. 

00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:33.319
 Bids differ from budget. 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.235
 Bids affect how much you spend 

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:38.121
 Each time someone clicks on your ads. 

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:40.437
 Your budget affects how much you spend 

00:02:40.437 --> 00:02:42.863
 Every day on your entire campaign, 

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:45.812
 Affecting your ad impressions. 

00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:49.713
 As it turns out, Brenda's ad appears on the Owen search results page. 

00:02:49.713 --> 00:02:51.878
 This is the impression. 

00:02:51.878 --> 00:02:55.312
 Owen clicks on Brenda's ad to find out more on her website. 

00:02:55.312 --> 00:02:57.198
 This is the click. 

00:02:57.198 --> 00:02:59.340
 Owen admires what he sees on Brenda's website 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.104
 He uses it to film his wedding. 

00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:05.746
 Thus, Brenda's announcement enabled Owen to take valuable action; 

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:07.214
 Which he used on one occasion. 

00:03:07.214 --> 00:03:09.840
 This is the conversion. 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.554
 Owen satisfied customer. 

00:03:11.554 --> 00:03:14.173
 Brenda is a happy advertiser. 

00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:16.146
 These are the results.
