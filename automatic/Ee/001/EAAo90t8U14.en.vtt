good<00:00:07.319> morning<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:07.919> Steve<00:00:08.250> ball<00:00:08.490> from<00:00:08.700> Peavy

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
good morning I'm Steve ball from Peavy

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.520 
good morning I'm Steve ball from Peavy
bicycle<00:00:09.480> center<00:00:09.750> today<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.050> want<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.320> talk<00:00:10.469> a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
bicycle center today I want to talk a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.820 
bicycle center today I want to talk a
little<00:00:10.830> bit<00:00:11.040> about<00:00:11.070> modern<00:00:11.940> aluminum<00:00:12.450> frames

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
little bit about modern aluminum frames

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.340 
little bit about modern aluminum frames
as<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.950> mentioned<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:14.549> other<00:00:14.730> videos

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
as I mentioned in some other videos

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.689 
as I mentioned in some other videos
aluminum<00:00:16.350> was<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> material<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.160> has<00:00:17.220> been

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
aluminum was a material that has been

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.970 
aluminum was a material that has been
neglected<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.570> while<00:00:18.869> because<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
neglected for a while because of the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.700 
neglected for a while because of the
advent<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.460> carbon<00:00:20.880> fiber<00:00:21.230> usin<00:00:22.230> road<00:00:22.410> bikes

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
advent of carbon fiber usin road bikes

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.130 
advent of carbon fiber usin road bikes
and<00:00:23.189> how<00:00:23.310> popular<00:00:23.519> that's<00:00:24.060> become<00:00:24.480> we're

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
and how popular that's become we're

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.120 
and how popular that's become we're
seeing<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.470> renaissance

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
seeing a renaissance

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.429 
seeing a renaissance
in<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.490> building<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.420> really<00:00:28.199> high<00:00:28.380> quality

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
in the building of really high quality

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.910 
in the building of really high quality
aluminum<00:00:29.279> frames<00:00:29.580> at<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.269> lower<00:00:30.449> price<00:00:30.750> point

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
aluminum frames at a lower price point

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.139 
aluminum frames at a lower price point
so<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.130> talked<00:00:32.250> about<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.550> little<00:00:32.730> bit<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
so we just talked about a little bit the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.740 
so we just talked about a little bit the
history<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.469> use<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.800> aluminum<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.460> bikes

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
history of the use of aluminum in bikes

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.200 
history of the use of aluminum in bikes
originally<00:00:36.750> aluminum<00:00:37.710> came<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.879> being

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
originally aluminum came in to being

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.420 
originally aluminum came in to being
used<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.600> road<00:00:39.780> bikes<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> time<00:00:41.190> when

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
used in road bikes one at a time when

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.450 
used in road bikes one at a time when
steal<00:00:41.790> bikes<00:00:42.090> were<00:00:42.710> ubiquitous<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
steal bikes were ubiquitous and the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.459 
steal bikes were ubiquitous and the
reason<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:44.940> number<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.780> lumen<00:00:46.079> could<00:00:46.350> be

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
reason was number one lumen could be

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.920 
reason was number one lumen could be
made<00:00:46.680> into<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.129> lighter<00:00:47.430> bike<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.780> be

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
made into a lighter bike and can be

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.110 
made into a lighter bike and can be
gained<00:00:49.140> into<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> stiffer<00:00:49.829> bike<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.789> those<00:00:51.000> are

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
gained into a stiffer bike so those are

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.310 
gained into a stiffer bike so those are
things<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.510> were<00:00:51.629> really<00:00:51.780> good<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
things that were really good for the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560 
things that were really good for the
racers<00:00:52.770> racer<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> lightest

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
racers racer is one of the lightest

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.330 
racers racer is one of the lightest
stiffest<00:00:55.320> bike<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:55.680> could<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.219> it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
stiffest bike they could get because it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.779 
stiffest bike they could get because it
may<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.699> faster<00:00:58.039> there<00:00:59.039> wasn't<00:00:59.370> really<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.609> lot

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
may go faster there wasn't really a lot

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.360 
may go faster there wasn't really a lot
of<00:00:59.910> attention<00:01:00.180> paid<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.649> quality<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
of attention paid to the quality of the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.889 
of attention paid to the quality of the
ride<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.850> that's<00:01:03.030> kind<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> we've<00:01:03.570> got<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
ride and that's kind of we've got the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
ride and that's kind of we've got the
disparity<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> early<00:01:05.070> days<00:01:05.280> people

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
disparity in the early days people

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.770 
disparity in the early days people
saying<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.390> steel<00:01:06.689> had<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> better<00:01:07.229> ride

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.539 

a<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:10.110> nice<00:01:10.290> riding<00:01:10.590> bike<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
a really nice riding bike that you

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.050 
a really nice riding bike that you
bought<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.880> steal<00:01:12.150> by<00:01:12.390> way<00:01:12.840> after<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:14.060> advent

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
bought a steal by way after that advent

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.330 
bought a steal by way after that advent
of<00:01:15.150> aluminum<00:01:15.690> we<00:01:16.320> started<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:16.979> some<00:01:17.010> other

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
of aluminum we started to see some other

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.899 
of aluminum we started to see some other
materials<00:01:17.909> being<00:01:18.119> used<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.310> essentially<00:01:20.310> it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
materials being used and essentially it

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.840 
materials being used and essentially it
took<00:01:21.060> away<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:22.049> energy<00:01:22.530> from<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.670> would

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
took away the energy from what would

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.010 
took away the energy from what would
have<00:01:23.940> been<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> more<00:01:24.360> continuous<00:01:24.840> development

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
have been a more continuous development

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.830 
have been a more continuous development
of<00:01:25.500> aluminum<00:01:25.979> process<00:01:26.490> leading<00:01:27.149> up<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.360> carbon

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
of aluminum process leading up to carbon

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.710 
of aluminum process leading up to carbon
fiber<00:01:28.050> bikes<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:29.280> we've<00:01:29.430> had<00:01:29.720> probably

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
fiber bikes so now we've had probably

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.560 
fiber bikes so now we've had probably
about<00:01:30.780> 15<00:01:31.320> years<00:01:31.590> worth<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.299> technology<00:01:33.299> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
about 15 years worth of technology and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.260 
about 15 years worth of technology and
carbon<00:01:33.990> fiber<00:01:34.229> bikes<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.640> lot<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.940> energy

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
carbon fiber bikes and a lot of energy

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.270 
carbon fiber bikes and a lot of energy
in<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:37.080> market<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> lot<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.830> bike<00:01:37.979> sold<00:01:39.320> now<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
cheaper it's easier to make aluminum

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.300 
cheaper it's easier to make aluminum
bike<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:49.050> material<00:01:49.320> cost<00:01:49.770> less<00:01:50.070> the

manufacturing process is less it's just

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.430

you'll<00:01:54.179> need<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.509> much<00:01:54.659> sophisticated

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
you'll need as much sophisticated

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.380 
you'll need as much sophisticated
equipment<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> at<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.909> same<00:01:57.119> time

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.870 
equipment to do it at the same time
there<00:01:58.170> were<00:01:58.259> things<00:01:58.440> that<00:01:58.560> were<00:01:58.740> learned<00:01:59.069> from

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
there were things that were learned from

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.600 
there were things that were learned from
building<00:02:00.330> carbon<00:02:00.990> fiber<00:02:01.229> frames<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:02.340> now

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
building carbon fiber frames but now

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.450 
building carbon fiber frames but now
they're<00:02:03.210> bringing<00:02:03.539> into<00:02:04.020> aluminum<00:02:04.920> some<00:02:05.340> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
they're bringing into aluminum some of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.279 
they're bringing into aluminum some of
the<00:02:05.550> high-tech<00:02:05.729> things<00:02:06.210> instead<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.810> making<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
the high-tech things instead of making a

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.650 
the high-tech things instead of making a
bike<00:02:07.470> where<00:02:07.740> all<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> metal<00:02:08.880> is<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> same<00:02:09.390> all

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
bike where all the metal is the same all

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.120 
bike where all the metal is the same all
the<00:02:09.690> way<00:02:09.810> through<00:02:09.869> or<00:02:10.350> joining<00:02:10.769> tubes

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
the way through or joining tubes

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.770 
the way through or joining tubes
together<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.730> way<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.180> would<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.630> done

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
together the way you would have done

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.710 
together the way you would have done
steel<00:02:13.739> like<00:02:14.040> we're<00:02:14.670> looking<00:02:14.940> at<00:02:15.060> every<00:02:15.450> part

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
steel like we're looking at every part

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.569 
steel like we're looking at every part
of<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> bike<00:02:16.049> and<00:02:16.260> saying<00:02:16.470> okay<00:02:16.739> what<00:02:16.769> does

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
of the bike and saying okay what does

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.890 
of the bike and saying okay what does
this<00:02:17.700> need<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.060> do<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.390> me

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
this need to do to me

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.630 
this need to do to me
do<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:21.330> holy<00:02:21.569> grail<00:02:21.959> for<00:02:22.290> advice<00:02:23.129> is

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
do this so the holy grail for advice is

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.000 
do this so the holy grail for advice is
relate<00:02:23.970> three<00:02:24.269> things<00:02:24.540> one<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.709> want<00:02:25.769> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
relate three things one is you want the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.550 
relate three things one is you want the
bike<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.519> laterally<00:02:27.360> stick<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:28.319> means

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
bike to be laterally stick that means

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.119 
bike to be laterally stick that means
that<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:29.129> doesn't<00:02:29.400> twist<00:02:29.760> or<00:02:30.709> move<00:02:31.709> from<00:02:31.920> side

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
that it doesn't twist or move from side

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.190 
that it doesn't twist or move from side
to<00:02:32.159> side<00:02:32.370> under<00:02:33.120> load<00:02:33.360> because<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.959> wastes

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
to side under load because that wastes

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.369 
to side under load because that wastes
power<00:02:34.970> number<00:02:35.970> two<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.989> want<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.230> be

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
power number two is you want to be

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.380 
power number two is you want to be
relatively<00:02:37.860> lightweight<00:02:38.190> because<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:38.970> lie<00:02:39.209> or

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
relatively lightweight because a lie or

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.149 
relatively lightweight because a lie or
a<00:02:39.420> bike<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.019> less<00:02:40.170> energy<00:02:40.560> takes<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.040> get

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
a bike is the less energy takes to get

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.250 
a bike is the less energy takes to get
it<00:02:41.280> up<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.519> hill<00:02:41.700> particularly<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.049> third

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
it up a hill particularly and the third

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.979 
it up a hill particularly and the third
thing<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:44.250> want<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.489> comfortable<00:02:44.700> ride<00:02:45.150> so

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
thing is you want a comfortable ride so

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.600 
thing is you want a comfortable ride so
in<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.860> sense<00:02:47.099> was<00:02:48.470> characteristics<00:02:49.610> are

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
in a sense was characteristics are

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.640 
in a sense was characteristics are
difficult<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.540> get<00:02:51.690> all<00:02:51.870> three<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.319> without

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
difficult to get all three of without

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.069 
difficult to get all three of without
spending<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.129> lot<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.310> money<00:02:53.750> what<00:02:54.750> we've<00:02:54.900> done

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
spending a lot of money what we've done

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.670 
spending a lot of money what we've done
in<00:02:55.560> aluminum<00:02:56.069> now<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.760> tube<00:02:57.150> shaping<00:02:57.680> which

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
in aluminum now is is tube shaping which

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.170 
in aluminum now is is tube shaping which
is<00:02:58.829> accomplished<00:02:59.489> by<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.670> variety<00:02:59.970> of

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
is accomplished by a variety of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.390 
is accomplished by a variety of
different<00:03:00.329> methods<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.500> lot<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.099> has<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.310> do

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
different methods a lot of it has to do

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.460 
different methods a lot of it has to do
with<00:03:02.459> what's<00:03:02.700> called<00:03:02.819> hydroforming<00:03:03.599> where

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
with what's called hydroforming where

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.830 
with what's called hydroforming where
when<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.250> metal<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.730> actually<00:03:06.209> hot<00:03:06.510> enough<00:03:06.780> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
when the metal is actually hot enough to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.369 
when the metal is actually hot enough to
shake<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:07.950> put<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.519> balloon<00:03:09.090> inside<00:03:09.329> of<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.870> as

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
shake to put a balloon inside of it as

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.490 
shake to put a balloon inside of it as
well<00:03:10.440> with<00:03:10.799> water<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:12.230> creates<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.290> certain

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
well with water and creates a certain

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.899 
well with water and creates a certain
shape<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.129> then<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.250> amount<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.579> hardens

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
shape and then the amount of hardens

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.030 
shape and then the amount of hardens
around<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.750> then<00:03:16.140> they<00:03:16.290> remove<00:03:16.620> them

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
around it and then they remove them

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.759 
around it and then they remove them
before<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:17.970> tubes<00:03:18.390> are<00:03:18.569> welded<00:03:18.900> together<00:03:19.019> so

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
before the tubes are welded together so

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.170 
before the tubes are welded together so
if<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:19.980> look<00:03:20.129> at<00:03:20.220> this<00:03:20.310> bike<00:03:20.579> it's<00:03:20.790> got<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:20.970> very

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
if you look at this bike it's got a very

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.289 
if you look at this bike it's got a very
interesting<00:03:21.720> change<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.620> top<00:03:22.859> tube<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.730> fat

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
interesting change the top tube is fat

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.620 
interesting change the top tube is fat
on<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> top<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:25.400> skinny<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.669> way<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.450> what

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
on the top and skinny this way so what

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.650 
on the top and skinny this way so what
that<00:03:27.750> does<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:29.040> allows<00:03:29.370> us<00:03:29.639> to<00:03:29.940> be<00:03:30.269> stiff

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
that does is it allows us to be stiff

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.680 
that does is it allows us to be stiff
enough<00:03:31.169> so<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.099> bike<00:03:32.280> doesn't<00:03:32.519> twist<00:03:32.910> but<00:03:33.599> it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
enough so the bike doesn't twist but it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.289 
enough so the bike doesn't twist but it
relieves<00:03:34.049> weight<00:03:34.379> it<00:03:35.280> also<00:03:35.430> allows<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.120> bike

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
relieves weight it also allows the bike

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.420 
relieves weight it also allows the bike
to<00:03:36.450> flex<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.870> little<00:03:36.900> bit<00:03:37.290> in<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.980> vertical

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
to flex a little bit in the vertical

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.940 
to flex a little bit in the vertical
plane<00:03:38.959> that<00:03:39.959> gives<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> little<00:03:40.799> more

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
plane that gives you a little more

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.890 
plane that gives you a little more
compliance<00:03:41.700> without<00:03:41.819> wasting<00:03:42.389> power<00:03:42.569> away

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
compliance without wasting power away

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.099 
compliance without wasting power away
look<00:03:43.139> like<00:03:43.169> shift<00:03:44.160> from<00:03:44.280> side<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.609> side<00:03:44.870> if<00:03:45.870> you

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
look like shift from side to side if you

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.629 
look like shift from side to side if you
look<00:03:46.230> at<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.500> rear<00:03:46.680> triangle<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.370> bike

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
look at the rear triangle of the bike

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.550 
look at the rear triangle of the bike
which<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.329> seat<00:03:48.540> stays<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.319> chain

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
which is the seat stays and the chain

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.099 
which is the seat stays and the chain
stays<00:03:49.919> you've<00:03:50.609> got<00:03:50.849> straight<00:03:51.299> round<00:03:51.750> tubes

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
stays you've got straight round tubes

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.439 
stays you've got straight round tubes
that<00:03:52.349> are<00:03:52.410> stiff<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.579> seat<00:03:53.970> stays<00:03:54.209> have<00:03:54.419> a

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
that are stiff the seat stays have a

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.689 
that are stiff the seat stays have a
little<00:03:54.720> curve<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.019> them<00:03:55.349> that<00:03:55.739> helps<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.489> rear

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
little curve to them that helps the rear

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.309 
little curve to them that helps the rear
end<00:03:56.879> compliance<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.599> look<00:03:57.750> like<00:03:57.870> snot<00:03:58.169> so

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
end compliance that look like snot so

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.680 
end compliance that look like snot so
stiff<00:03:58.680> absorbs<00:03:59.609> a<00:03:59.730> little<00:03:59.940> bit<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.180> road<00:04:00.389> shock

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
stiff absorbs a little bit of road shock

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.349 
stiff absorbs a little bit of road shock
so<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.739> only<00:04:01.889> is<00:04:02.069> essentially<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.760> race<00:04:03.060> bike

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
so it only is essentially a race bike

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.789 
so it only is essentially a race bike
and<00:04:04.049> it's<00:04:04.470> meant<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:06.349> maximize<00:04:07.349> your<00:04:07.530> power

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
and it's meant to maximize your power

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.280 
and it's meant to maximize your power
basically<00:04:08.510> forward<00:04:09.510> by<00:04:09.780> still<00:04:10.079> being

basically forward by still being

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.439 
basically forward by still being
comfortable<00:04:10.799> now<00:04:11.730> if<00:04:11.790> we<00:04:11.879> take<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.090> look<00:04:12.269> at<00:04:12.419> a

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
comfortable now if we take a look at a

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.909

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
something like that just for one example

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.890 
something like that just for one example
take<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.289> look<00:04:40.560> at<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.800> seat<00:04:41.010> stays<00:04:41.310> on<00:04:41.550> this

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
take a look at the seat stays on this

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.920 
take a look at the seat stays on this
first<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:43.020> all<00:04:43.140> they're<00:04:43.320> much<00:04:43.500> thinner<00:04:44.930> okay

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
first of all they're much thinner okay

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.209 
first of all they're much thinner okay
but<00:04:46.620> they<00:04:47.310> are<00:04:47.370> thick<00:04:47.820> this<00:04:48.150> way

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:49.219 
but they are thick this way

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.129 
but they are thick this way
let<00:04:50.219> the<00:04:50.340> sides<00:04:50.639> are<00:04:50.880> very<00:04:50.909> thin<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.599> then

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
let the sides are very thin and then

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.860 
let the sides are very thin and then
they're<00:04:52.380> curved<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:53.639> this<00:04:54.330> still<00:04:54.510> keeps<00:04:54.750> the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
they're curved so this still keeps the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.320 
they're curved so this still keeps the
rear<00:04:55.080> end<00:04:55.229> from<00:04:55.440> flexing<00:04:55.950> but<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:56.849> shape<00:04:57.150> of

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
rear end from flexing but the shape of

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330 
rear end from flexing but the shape of
it<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:57.719> the<00:04:58.380> way<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:58.830> thicker<00:04:59.099> and

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
it and the way that it's thicker and

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.240 
it and the way that it's thicker and
thinner<00:04:59.780> absorbs<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.900> lot<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:01.139> roadshop<00:05:01.710> both

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
thinner absorbs a lot of roadshop both

an impact that you might hit a pothole

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.610 
an impact that you might hit a pothole
something<00:05:06.270> like<00:05:06.450> that<00:05:06.690> that<00:05:07.229> will<00:05:07.320> send<00:05:07.530> a

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
something like that that will send a

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.820 
something like that that will send a
shock<00:05:07.830> up<00:05:08.039> into<00:05:08.340> your<00:05:08.430> body<00:05:08.669> and<00:05:09.419> also<00:05:09.830> just

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
shock up into your body and also just

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.760 
shock up into your body and also just
the<00:05:10.950> general<00:05:11.450> uneven<00:05:12.450> surfaces<00:05:12.990> get

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
the general uneven surfaces get

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.190 
the general uneven surfaces get
dissipated<00:05:14.280> by<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.000> shape<00:05:15.360> of<00:05:15.510> this<00:05:15.719> you<00:05:16.080> can

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
dissipated by the shape of this you can

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.350 
dissipated by the shape of this you can
also<00:05:16.349> see<00:05:16.680> that<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.550> chain<00:05:17.789> stays<00:05:18.090> there<00:05:18.300> a

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
also see that the chain stays there a

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.909 
also see that the chain stays there a
little<00:05:18.510> more<00:05:18.599> boat<00:05:18.990> on<00:05:19.169> this<00:05:19.349> bike<00:05:19.590> than<00:05:19.800> the

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
little more boat on this bike than the

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
shock road chatter things like that

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.499 
shock road chatter things like that
makes<00:05:26.370> it<00:05:26.490> like

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
makes it like

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.869 
makes it like
with<00:05:28.349> the<00:05:28.469> least<00:05:28.650> amount<00:05:28.830> of<00:05:29.039> compromise<00:05:29.460> in

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.450 
terms of losing efficiency in the light
we<00:05:32.699> can<00:05:32.849> see<00:05:32.879> that<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.300> top<00:05:33.539> two<00:05:34.129> has<00:05:35.129> a<00:05:35.159> very

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
we can see that the top two has a very

way and it's got a nice bow to it so

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.070 
way and it's got a nice bow to it so
that<00:05:44.789> keeps<00:05:44.939> the<00:05:45.180> bike<00:05:45.300> stiff<00:05:45.629> where<00:05:45.809> it<00:05:45.900> needs

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
that keeps the bike stiff where it needs

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.649 
that keeps the bike stiff where it needs

they<00:05:54.930> learned<00:05:55.110> about<00:05:55.199> carbon-fiber<00:05:55.979> was<00:05:56.370> the

00:05:57.049 --> 00:05:57.059 
they learned about carbon-fiber was the

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:59.659 
they learned about carbon-fiber was the
longer<00:05:57.509> you<00:05:57.749> make<00:05:57.779> the<00:05:58.080> pieces<00:05:58.460> both<00:05:59.460> the

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
longer you make the pieces both the

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.279 
longer you make the pieces both the
stronger<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.569> lighter<00:06:00.839> and<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.110> more

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
stronger the lighter and the more

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.249 
stronger the lighter and the more
compliant<00:06:01.830> compete<00:06:02.189> so<00:06:02.879> if<00:06:03.659> you<00:06:03.779> fall<00:06:03.990> on<00:06:04.139> the

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
compliant compete so if you fall on the

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.089 
compliant compete so if you fall on the
line<00:06:04.499> of<00:06:05.189> from<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.240> rear<00:06:06.419> triangle<00:06:06.949> all<00:06:07.949> the

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
line of from the rear triangle all the

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.070 
line of from the rear triangle all the
way<00:06:08.159> through<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:08.460> head<00:06:08.639> tube<00:06:08.879> is<00:06:09.569> basically

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
way through the head tube is basically

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.760 
way through the head tube is basically
like<00:06:10.409> one<00:06:10.589> continuous<00:06:11.219> curve<00:06:11.719> so<00:06:12.770> that's

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
like one continuous curve so that's

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.790 
like one continuous curve so that's
something<00:06:14.039> that<00:06:14.310> was<00:06:14.460> again<00:06:14.969> learned<00:06:15.270> from

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
something that was again learned from

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.589 
something that was again learned from
carbon-fiber<00:06:16.800> bikes<00:06:17.430> in<00:06:17.849> the<00:06:18.060> past<00:06:18.270> you<00:06:18.479> would

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
carbon-fiber bikes in the past you would

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.659 
carbon-fiber bikes in the past you would
have<00:06:18.779> seen<00:06:18.960> these<00:06:19.740> seat<00:06:20.069> stays<00:06:20.339> being

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
have seen these seat stays being

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.879 
have seen these seat stays being
attached<00:06:20.969> to<00:06:21.180> higher<00:06:21.419> up<00:06:21.689> at<00:06:22.379> a<00:06:22.439> sharper<00:06:22.860> angle

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
attached to higher up at a sharper angle

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.999 
attached to higher up at a sharper angle
and<00:06:23.610> then<00:06:24.089> it<00:06:24.240> completely<00:06:24.479> disconnected<00:06:25.349> top

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
and then it completely disconnected top

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:28.999 
and then it completely disconnected top
to<00:06:26.279> now<00:06:27.089> unless<00:06:27.930> the<00:06:28.259> bike<00:06:28.439> is<00:06:28.649> all<00:06:28.800> welded
