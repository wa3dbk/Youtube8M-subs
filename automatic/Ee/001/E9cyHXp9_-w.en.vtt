00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.670
 Welcome to another producer club now 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.470
 Today we are going to talk to you about the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
 progression techniques with great puts 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.550
 Basic targeting for easy terrain 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.220
 of winter mountain we are talking about 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.220
 flat areas or with slopes as much 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.840
 between 30 and 40 degrees 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.710
 the first thing we have to be clear about 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.480
 is that the binomial ice ax and crampons 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.060
 always goes together and the use of them is 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.700
 a symbiosis therefore can not be 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.329
 you can not think of going to the mountain 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.339
 without any of these elements at once 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.410
 let's see for a moment the parts of a large 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.390
 for a great pon 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 basically it would be the part of the sole 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 is made up of some skewers we are going to 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.500
 call it skewers these skewers are ten 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.810
 tips and two more tips that are in a 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.700
 different position when talking about the rest 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.650
 ones that are in the part of the sole 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.170
 looking towards the ground and another that goes 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.450
 dominating in the forward direction 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.030
 this will allow us a progression not 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.490
 only flat but also in 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.860
 pending since we can use the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.259
 front tips we have a part that 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.690
 are some areas or some parts or some 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.660
 plastic parts that are called anti 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.180
 butt and that will allow us the gaps 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.360
 the snow is caked the bottom part 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.880
 and we do not have slips that we can 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.580
 lead to a fall and then the part of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.270
 above is nothing more than a fixation on 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.399
 this case a typical strap fixation 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.470
 or basic but there may be others like 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.140
 They can be semi-automatic or 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.700
 automatic like the ones I carry 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.830
 The first thing to be clear is that 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.860
 we have to walk in a comfortable position 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.090
 you do not have to carry a great you put 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.300
 it does not mean that we have to go 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.399
 We therefore uncomfortable when we go to 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.319
 move through flat places with a 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.050
 normal stride we should always have 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.280
 all the tips on the ground in 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.280
 bring all the joints on the floor 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.300
 will allow us even on slopes 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.000
 something stronger than 10 15 or 20 degrees 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.400
 have an effective control of our 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.650
 progression to this technique of all the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.920
 tips on the on the ground you will be 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.660
 called French technique in principle in 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.130
 the French technique as always 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.260
 whatever the type of bram little that 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.810
 we are going to try to keep all 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.670
 the tips what would be the whole sole 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:49.480
 of the shoe on snow or ice 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.050
 in this case remember two parts let's go 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.800
 to differentiate 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.210
 to the valley and face the mountain the two 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.630
 cases are pending down and 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.240
 pending upwards while 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.870
 allow the slope and flexibility 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.730
 of ankle we will always descend 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.400
 helped by a bend of knees and 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.350
 a hip flexion in both cases 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.440
 remember that always the center of 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.470
 gravity has to fall between the two 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.830
 feet when the slope is 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.630
 excessively strong that allows us to 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.140
 the lack of effectiveness of ankle 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.020
 keep all the tip over on the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.060
 snow or ice we will have to open the 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.569
 tips on both sides 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.120
 our body will rise in a style 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.940
 that's called duck style every tip 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.410
 towards both sides and how much 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.090
 earring picks up too hard ie 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.150
 is very pronounced we are talking about 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.420
 between 45 and 50 degrees we will have to 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.450
 move to a progression where to nail the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.870
 that is to say, 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.160
 the front tips will be 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.280
 essential to be able to progress 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.239
 on snow there would also be a 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.420
 mixed technique where we alternate and we 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.010
 French technical style with one foot in 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.459
 duck style is to say the tip towards 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.950
 outside and front accounts with the other 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.639
 foot alternating like our twins 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:27.990
 they are getting tired good friends and without more 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.520
 and remembering the binomial unit viole 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.979
 crampons 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.319
 we ask you to help us do the 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.319
 Safer mountains until next time
