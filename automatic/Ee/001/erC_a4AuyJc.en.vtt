00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
one thing i will criticize it for is

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.750 
one thing i will criticize it for is
because<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.600> material<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.380> soft<00:02:41.710> that<00:02:42.010> makes

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
because the material so soft that makes

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.180 
because the material so soft that makes
it<00:02:42.940> quite<00:02:43.240> loose<00:02:43.600> even<00:02:44.050> though<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.200> fit<00:02:44.560> snugly

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
it quite loose even though it fit snugly

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.550 
it quite loose even though it fit snugly
it's<00:02:45.820> not<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.060> very<00:02:46.360> tight<00:02:46.660> fitting<00:02:47.110> case<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:47.530> i

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
it's not a very tight fitting case so i

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.930 
it's not a very tight fitting case so i
found<00:02:47.770> that<00:02:48.010> when<00:02:48.130> i<00:02:48.160> pop<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.550> in<00:02:48.640> my<00:02:48.730> pocket

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
found that when i pop it in my pocket

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.090 
found that when i pop it in my pocket
sometimes<00:02:49.630> something<00:02:50.560> like<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.890> might

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
sometimes something like that might

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.950 
sometimes something like that might
happen<00:02:51.130> inside<00:02:51.880> my<00:02:52.090> pocket<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.540> then<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.780> pull

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
happen inside my pocket and then I pull
