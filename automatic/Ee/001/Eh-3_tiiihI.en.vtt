difficult<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.329> people<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> Ganymede<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
difficult for people to Ganymede on the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.010 
difficult for people to Ganymede on the
time<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.789> intuitive<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.870> like

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
time it's not intuitive it's not like

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.110 
time it's not intuitive it's not like
any<00:01:01.199> other<00:01:01.440> tool<00:01:01.680> out<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.829> once<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.850> figure

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
any other tool out there once you figure

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.820 
any other tool out there once you figure
it<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.539> nice<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.140> takes<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> long<00:01:04.530> time<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
it out it's nice it takes a long time to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
it out it's nice it takes a long time to
figure<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.250> out<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.540> release<00:01:06.869> we

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
figure that out so in this release we

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810 
figure that out so in this release we
really<00:01:07.290> wanted<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> solve<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.100> problem<00:01:08.520> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
really wanted to solve that problem so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.190 
really wanted to solve that problem so
needed<00:01:09.119> users<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.570> actually<00:01:09.810> figure<00:01:10.020> out

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
needed users can actually figure out

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.160 
needed users can actually figure out
handmade<00:01:10.830> flash<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.720> did<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.960> we

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
handmade flash so what we did is we

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.649 
handmade flash so what we did is we
create<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> new<00:01:14.100> animation<00:01:15.530> method<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
create a new animation method that

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.480 
create a new animation method that
motion<00:01:18.659> objects<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
motion objects and so this is the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.719 
motion objects and so this is the
default<00:01:21.090> animation<00:01:21.890> Scott<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.520> right

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
default animation Scott you can right

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.899 
default animation Scott you can right
click<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:25.110> object<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.740> go

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
click on the object we go

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.679 
click on the object we go
insert<00:01:27.840> menu<00:01:28.460> I'd<00:01:29.460> say<00:01:29.670> insert<00:01:30.060> emotionally

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
insert menu I'd say insert emotionally

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.480 
insert menu I'd say insert emotionally
so<00:01:31.200> when<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> said<00:01:31.679> it's<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:31.950> emotions<00:01:32.369> we

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
so when I said it's your emotions we

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.789 
so when I said it's your emotions we
notice<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.909> my<00:01:33.210> time<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.719> added<00:01:34.229> which<00:01:34.439> frames

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
notice that my time I added which frames

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.050 
notice that my time I added which frames
on<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.219> in<00:01:35.520> control<00:01:36.679> it<00:01:37.679> also<00:01:37.909> changed<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
on it in control it also changed that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.919 
on it in control it also changed that
long<00:01:39.359> time<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.259> added<00:01:40.649> in<00:01:40.770> 25<00:01:41.280> frames<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.090> so

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
long time but added in 25 frames and so

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.779 
long time but added in 25 frames and so
now<00:01:43.109> I've<00:01:43.590> got<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:43.920> these<00:01:44.039> frames<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.609> he

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
now I've got all these frames in he

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.520 
now I've got all these frames in he
