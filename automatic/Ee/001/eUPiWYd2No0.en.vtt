their<00:00:26.160> ailments<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> few

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
their ailments so we do that with a few

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.750 
their ailments so we do that with a few
guys<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.949> most<00:00:29.099> part<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.460> don't<00:00:29.609> do

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
guys but for the most part we don't do

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.259 
guys but for the most part we don't do
it<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:31.189> it's<00:00:32.189> tough<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.699> me<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> kind<00:00:33.210> of

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
it and so it's tough for me to kind of

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:35.030 
it and so it's tough for me to kind of
identify<00:00:33.360> who<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:33.930> are<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.230> times<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
identify who they are at times I have a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.320 
identify who they are at times I have a
pretty<00:00:35.160> good<00:00:35.250> ideal<00:00:35.519> for<00:00:35.729> most<00:00:35.909> of<00:00:36.089> them<00:00:36.210> but

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
pretty good ideal for most of them but

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.960 
pretty good ideal for most of them but

in<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.559> first<00:00:55.769> game<00:00:57.110> he<00:00:58.110> said<00:00:58.290> having<00:00:58.830> a<00:00:59.190> tough

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
in the first game he said having a tough

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.009 
in the first game he said having a tough
opener<00:01:00.089> will<00:01:00.299> cause<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.629> pick<00:01:00.869> up<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
opener will cause you to pick up the

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.829 
opener will cause you to pick up the
pace<00:01:01.290> earlier<00:01:02.159> you<00:01:02.970> know<00:01:03.150> like<00:01:03.479> how<00:01:03.689> much

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
pace earlier you know like how much

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.600 
pace earlier you know like how much
earlier<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.470> point<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.129> pick<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
earlier what point you will pick up the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.060 
earlier what point you will pick up the
pace<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.770> think<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:09.200> what<00:01:10.200> forces<00:01:10.560> us<00:01:10.800> to<00:01:10.830> do

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
pace I think that what forces us to do

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.130 
pace I think that what forces us to do
is<00:01:11.190> be<00:01:11.370> more<00:01:11.400> physical<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.150> practice<00:01:12.690> there<00:01:12.990> we

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
is be more physical in practice there we

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.520 
is be more physical in practice there we
would<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:14.450> or<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:16.020> been<00:01:16.230> over<00:01:16.440> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
would be or what we have been over the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.170 
would be or what we have been over the
last<00:01:16.590> few<00:01:16.980> years<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.810> then<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.880> get

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
last few years and then you have to get

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.710 
last few years and then you have to get
a<00:01:21.210> feel<00:01:21.540> for<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:22.080> game<00:01:22.350> plan<00:01:22.380> would<00:01:22.920> be

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
a feel for what your game plan would be

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.030 
a feel for what your game plan would be
more<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.020> than

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
more so than

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.850 
more so than
if<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.820> had<00:01:26.940> a<00:01:26.970> different<00:01:27.150> opponent<00:01:27.860> because

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
if we had a different opponent because

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.880 
if we had a different opponent because
you<00:01:29.820> know<00:01:29.910> whether<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.540> not<00:01:30.890> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
you know whether you like it or not you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.220 
you know whether you like it or not you
know<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.490> ready<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.760> play<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.960> try

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230

mentioned the kicker the kicker will be

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.940 
mentioned the kicker the kicker will be
an<00:01:42.570> important<00:01:42.930> part<00:01:43.050> of<00:01:43.170> our<00:01:43.230> first<00:01:43.470> game<00:01:43.710> go

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
an important part of our first game go

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.550
