00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
challenge actually comes in the form of

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.660 
challenge actually comes in the form of
learning<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.049> pick<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.500> strings<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.189> dozens

learning to pick the strings on dozens

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.280 
learning to pick the strings on dozens
of<00:01:41.790> different<00:01:41.970> positions<00:01:42.540> rather<00:01:42.840> than<00:01:43.079> just

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
of different positions rather than just

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.010 
of different positions rather than just
a<00:01:43.380> limited<00:01:43.740> number<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.130> buttons<00:01:44.610> from<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.780> game

expect<00:03:08.610> because<00:03:08.760> that's<00:03:09.239> how<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.480> songs<00:03:09.870> work

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
expect because that's how the songs work

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.100 
expect because that's how the songs work
so<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:12.150> know<00:03:12.239> at<00:03:12.420> first<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.810> was<00:03:12.930> really

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
so you know at first it was really

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.030 
so you know at first it was really
difficult<00:03:13.260> cuz<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.680> was<00:03:13.800> sitting<00:03:14.010> there

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
difficult cuz I was sitting there

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.650 
difficult cuz I was sitting there
looking<00:03:14.430> at<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.670> strings<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.180> whatnot<00:03:15.450> but

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
looking at the strings and whatnot but

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.810 
looking at the strings and whatnot but
after<00:03:16.110> playing<00:03:16.440> for<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.709> little<00:03:16.920> bit<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.310> start

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
after playing for a little bit you start

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.180 
after playing for a little bit you start
to<00:03:18.030> form<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.170> muscle<00:03:19.470> memory<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.950> stop

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
to form that muscle memory and stop

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.610 
to form that muscle memory and stop
looking<00:03:20.459> at<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.880> guitar<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.540> get<00:03:22.380> better

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
looking at the guitar and you get better

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.860 
looking at the guitar and you get better
and<00:03:22.860> better<00:03:22.920> as<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.640> play<00:03:23.910> now<00:03:24.360> there's<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.660> lot

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
and better as you play now there's a lot

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.300 
and better as you play now there's a lot
of<00:03:24.989> different<00:03:25.320> things<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.799> can<00:03:25.920> do<00:03:26.160> to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
of different things you can do to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.190 
of different things you can do to
actually<00:03:26.610> learn<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.090> songs<00:03:27.330> better<00:03:27.600> as<00:03:27.870> well

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
actually learn the songs better as well

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.729 
actually learn the songs better as well
so<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.190> particular<00:03:29.430> case<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:30.739> just

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
so in this particular case I just

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.350 
so in this particular case I just
finished<00:03:31.980> playing<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.370> song<00:03:32.549> blitzkrieg<00:03:33.060> pop

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
finished playing a song blitzkrieg pop

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.530 
finished playing a song blitzkrieg pop
and<00:03:33.690> it's<00:03:34.620> gonna<00:03:34.769> be<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.160> okay<00:03:35.519> here's<00:03:36.299> some

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
and it's gonna be like okay here's some

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.970 
and it's gonna be like okay here's some
suggestions<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.380> can<00:03:37.410> either<00:03:37.709> do<00:03:37.830> this

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
suggestions you can either do this

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.979 
suggestions you can either do this
lesson<00:03:38.220> or<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:38.940> riff<00:03:39.150> repeat<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.720> verse

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
lesson or you can riff repeat this verse

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.390 
lesson or you can riff repeat this verse
and<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.680> I'm<00:03:40.769> gonna<00:03:40.860> go<00:03:41.010> ahead<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.190> riff

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
and so I'm gonna go ahead and riff

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.820 
and so I'm gonna go ahead and riff
repeat<00:03:41.700> basically<00:03:42.150> it'll<00:03:42.660> let<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.110> try<00:03:43.590> just

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
repeat basically it'll let you try just

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.470 
repeat basically it'll let you try just
a<00:03:43.980> certain<00:03:44.340> section<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.910> song<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.390> you

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
a certain section of the song and you

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.630 
a certain section of the song and you
can<00:03:45.630> play<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.989> at<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.170> certain<00:03:46.739> difficulty<00:03:47.370> or

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
can play it at a certain difficulty or

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.360 
can play it at a certain difficulty or
you<00:03:47.760> play<00:03:47.970> at<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.180> lower<00:03:48.450> speed<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.230> here<00:03:50.160> I'm

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
you play at a lower speed so here I'm

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.070 
you play at a lower speed so here I'm
trying<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.850> learn<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.480> part<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.870> song

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
trying to learn this part of the song

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.560 
trying to learn this part of the song
that<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.290> was<00:03:52.410> having<00:03:52.590> trouble<00:03:52.709> with<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.570> I'm

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
that I was having trouble with and I'm

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.539 
that I was having trouble with and I'm
gonna<00:03:55.019> slow<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.260> down<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.799> can<00:03:55.860> see<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.070> 75

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
gonna slow it down you can see a 75

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.009 
gonna slow it down you can see a 75
percent<00:03:56.670> I'm<00:03:57.150> just<00:03:57.330> trying<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.570> pluck<00:03:57.780> all<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
percent I'm just trying to pluck all the

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.360 
percent I'm just trying to pluck all the
strings<00:03:58.320> we're<00:03:58.500> at<00:03:58.560> about<00:03:58.769> 58<00:03:59.250> percent

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
strings we're at about 58 percent

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.430 
strings we're at about 58 percent
difficulty<00:04:00.330> what<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.720> really<00:04:00.900> means<00:04:01.140> is

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
difficulty what that really means is

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.310 
difficulty what that really means is
they're<00:04:02.280> gonna<00:04:02.400> add<00:04:02.760> more<00:04:03.269> notes<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.810> the

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
they're gonna add more notes in the

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.660 
they're gonna add more notes in the
higher<00:04:04.560> up<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:04.799> go<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.220> once<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.459> get<00:04:05.610> past

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
higher up you go and once you get past

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.360 
higher up you go and once you get past
like<00:04:06.090> 66<00:04:07.049> percent<00:04:07.470> difficulty<00:04:08.010> that's<00:04:08.250> when

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
like 66 percent difficulty that's when

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.500 
like 66 percent difficulty that's when
they<00:04:08.459> start<00:04:08.670> adding<00:04:08.880> in<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> real<00:04:09.239> tough

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
they start adding in the real tough

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.259 
they start adding in the real tough
stuff<00:04:09.720> like<00:04:09.959> chords<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.940> things<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.060> you

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
stuff like chords and things that you

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.390 
stuff like chords and things that you
really<00:04:12.450> need<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.750> learn<00:04:12.989> later<00:04:13.320> on<00:04:13.500> but<00:04:13.860> for

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
really need to learn later on but for

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.130 
really need to learn later on but for
all<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.549> those<00:04:14.760> advanced<00:04:15.209> techniques<00:04:15.780> that

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
all of those advanced techniques that

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.990 
all of those advanced techniques that
you<00:04:16.350> probably<00:04:16.829> don't<00:04:17.160> know<00:04:17.310> how<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.700> right

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
you probably don't know how to do right

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.090 
you probably don't know how to do right

particular case I am learning how to do

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.140 
particular case I am learning how to do
a<00:04:38.389> bend<00:04:39.050> on<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.710> strings<00:04:40.069> and<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.819> cool<00:04:40.969> thing

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
a bend on the strings and the cool thing

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.330

to<00:05:10.639> improve<00:05:11.000> in<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.300> game<00:05:11.569> the<00:05:12.139> thing<00:05:12.289> about

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
to improve in the game the thing about

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.010 
to improve in the game the thing about
this<00:05:12.680> game<00:05:12.979> is<00:05:13.279> that<00:05:13.750> all<00:05:14.750> these<00:05:14.960> little

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
this game is that all these little

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.570 
this game is that all these little
things<00:05:15.259> just<00:05:15.680> kind<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:15.860> add<00:05:16.009> up<00:05:16.039> and<00:05:16.370> I've<00:05:16.430> only

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
things just kind of add up and I've only

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.100 
things just kind of add up and I've only
been<00:05:16.669> playing<00:05:16.879> for<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.240> couple<00:05:17.389> of<00:05:17.599> hours<00:05:17.779> and

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
been playing for a couple of hours and

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.510 
been playing for a couple of hours and
I've<00:05:18.199> already<00:05:18.500> noticed<00:05:18.800> some<00:05:18.949> huge

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
I've already noticed some huge

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.920 
I've already noticed some huge
improvement<00:05:20.060> especially<00:05:20.210> since<00:05:20.569> I've<00:05:20.689> never

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
improvement especially since I've never

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.610 
improvement especially since I've never
actually<00:05:21.110> played<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:21.830> guitar<00:05:22.009> before<00:05:22.460> and

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
actually played a guitar before and

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.829 
actually played a guitar before and
honestly<00:05:24.620> going<00:05:25.189> from<00:05:25.339> zero<00:05:25.610> experience<00:05:26.029> if<00:05:26.479> I

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:26.839 
honestly going from zero experience if I

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:28.480 
honestly going from zero experience if I
spent<00:05:27.379> even<00:05:27.620> half<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:27.889> amount<00:05:28.159> of<00:05:28.339> time

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
spent even half the amount of time

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.579 
spent even half the amount of time
playing<00:05:28.879> this<00:05:29.240> game<00:05:29.539> as<00:05:29.779> I<00:05:29.960> do<00:05:30.020> any<00:05:30.379> other
