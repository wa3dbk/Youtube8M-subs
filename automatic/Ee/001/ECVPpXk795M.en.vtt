apart from our disable resample which

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
apart from our disable resample which
isn't<00:00:51.250> really<00:00:51.340> adding<00:00:51.760> there's<00:00:51.940> just

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
isn't really adding there's just

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.730 
isn't really adding there's just
something<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.420> sony<00:00:52.960> vegas<00:00:53.140> adds<00:00:53.470> when<00:00:53.620> you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
something that sony vegas adds when you

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.230 
something that sony vegas adds when you
put<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.010> in<00:00:54.160> so<00:00:54.400> to<00:00:54.460> make<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:54.760> look<00:00:54.970> a<00:00:55.030> little

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
put it in so to make it look a little

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.730 
put it in so to make it look a little
bit<00:00:55.329> sharper<00:00:55.540> when<00:00:56.170> there's<00:00:56.440> actually

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
bit sharper when there's actually

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.410 
bit sharper when there's actually
movement<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:57.220> these<00:00:57.340> are<00:00:57.550> exactly<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.180> same

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
movement so these are exactly the same

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.960 
movement so these are exactly the same
in<00:00:58.960> every<00:00:59.320> way<00:00:59.680> that<00:00:59.710> I<00:00:59.950> could<00:01:00.190> possibly<00:01:00.550> do<00:01:00.820> it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
in every way that I could possibly do it

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.729 
in every way that I could possibly do it
now<00:01:01.420> what<00:01:01.720> we're<00:01:01.810> gonna<00:01:01.900> do<00:01:02.050> first<00:01:02.260> is<00:01:02.500> look<00:01:02.650> at

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
now what we're gonna do first is look at

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.859 
now what we're gonna do first is look at
a<00:01:02.800> couple<00:01:02.980> of<00:01:03.160> screen<00:01:03.550> shots<00:01:03.579> I<00:01:04.059> took<00:01:04.179> bear<00:01:04.749> in

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
a couple of screen shots I took bear in

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.230 
a couple of screen shots I took bear in
mind<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.140> Xbox<00:01:05.499> one<00:01:05.710> screenshots<00:01:06.340> are<00:01:06.670> during

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
mind the Xbox one screenshots are during

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.569 
mind the Xbox one screenshots are during
movement<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.229> Xbox<00:01:08.649> 360<00:01:09.159> ones<00:01:09.310> are<00:01:09.429> ones

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
movement and the Xbox 360 ones are ones

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.489 
movement and the Xbox 360 ones are ones
from<00:01:09.700> standing<00:01:10.090> still<00:01:10.450> but<00:01:10.929> I<00:01:10.960> still<00:01:11.229> think

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:11.499 
from standing still but I still think

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.109 
from standing still but I still think
the<00:01:11.590> Xbox<00:01:11.920> one<00:01:12.130> version<00:01:12.159> we<00:01:12.579> can<00:01:12.609> still<00:01:12.969> see

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
the Xbox one version we can still see

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.969 
the Xbox one version we can still see
they're<00:01:13.270> significantly<00:01:13.869> better<00:01:14.140> either<00:01:14.560> way

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
they're significantly better either way

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.349 
they're significantly better either way
so<00:01:15.340> we're<00:01:15.429> gonna<00:01:15.549> look<00:01:15.700> at<00:01:15.789> those<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.329> then

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359 
so we're gonna look at those and then

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:17.969 
so we're gonna look at those and then
we're<00:01:16.539> going<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.719> look<00:01:16.810> at<00:01:16.899> some<00:01:17.079> gameplay<00:01:17.710> off

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
we're going to look at some gameplay off

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.950 
we're going to look at some gameplay off
the<00:01:18.100> Xbox<00:01:18.369> one<00:01:18.819> and<00:01:19.090> we're<00:01:19.479> gonna<00:01:19.539> have<00:01:19.780> some

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
the Xbox one and we're gonna have some

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.899 
the Xbox one and we're gonna have some
Xbox<00:01:20.319> 360<00:01:20.859> gameplay<00:01:21.039> of<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.399> same<00:01:21.639> map

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
Xbox 360 gameplay of the same map

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.029 
Xbox 360 gameplay of the same map
similar<00:01:22.329> kind<00:01:22.539> of<00:01:22.600> circumstances<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.530> gun

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
similar kind of circumstances and gun

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.499 
similar kind of circumstances and gun

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
playing of Xbox one and then when I went

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.640 
playing of Xbox one and then when I went
back<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.060> Xbox<00:04:34.450> 360<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.050> did<00:04:35.290> feel<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.560> little
