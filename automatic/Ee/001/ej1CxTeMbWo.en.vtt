00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
mean we can look at last night maybe say

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.109 
mean we can look at last night maybe say
that's<00:01:08.860> an<00:01:09.009> ass<00:01:09.130> Chris<00:01:09.400> but<00:01:09.640> at<00:01:09.820> least<00:01:09.909> through

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
that's an ass Chris but at least through

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.210 
that's an ass Chris but at least through
three<00:01:10.330> of<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.450> first<00:01:10.630> four<00:01:10.869> games<00:01:11.170> yeah<00:01:11.950> um

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
three of the first four games yeah um

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.999 
three of the first four games yeah um
you<00:01:12.970> know<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.119> think<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:14.350> never<00:01:14.500> an<00:01:14.680> excuse

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
you know I think it's never an excuse

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.280 
you know I think it's never an excuse
but<00:01:15.220> you<00:01:15.700> know<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.119> think<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.420> little<00:01:17.020> bit<00:01:17.170> of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
but you know I think a little bit of

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.690 
but you know I think a little bit of
mental<00:01:17.590> fatigue<00:01:17.740> sets<00:01:18.250> in<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:18.610> start

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
mental fatigue sets in and you start

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.429 
mental fatigue sets in and you start
getting<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.270> little<00:01:19.450> sloppy<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.140> you<00:01:20.200> start

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
getting a little sloppy and you start

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.890 
getting a little sloppy and you start
overextend<00:01:20.950> yourself<00:01:21.040> last<00:01:21.490> night<00:01:21.780> but<00:01:22.780> it's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
overextend yourself last night but it's

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.950 
overextend yourself last night but it's
a<00:01:22.990> great<00:01:23.229> way<00:01:23.619> for<00:01:24.310> us<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.520> learn<00:01:24.909> from<00:01:25.450> from

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
a great way for us to learn from from

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.840 
a great way for us to learn from from
that<00:01:26.110> game<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.470> those<00:01:26.560> mistakes<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.189> make

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
that game and those mistakes and make

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.999 
that game and those mistakes and make
sure<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.270> we<00:01:29.140> simplify<00:01:29.590> things<00:01:29.649> when

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
sure that that we simplify things when

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.380 
sure that that we simplify things when
we're<00:01:30.130> playing<00:01:30.250> back-to-back<00:01:30.549> games<00:01:31.090> or

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390

three<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.720> four<00:01:31.899> whatnot<00:01:32.290> so<00:01:33.090> yeah<00:01:34.090> but

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
three and four whatnot so yeah but

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.340 
three and four whatnot so yeah but
there's<00:01:34.450> still<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.630> lot<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.780> good<00:01:34.930> things<00:01:35.200> that

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
there's still a lot of good things that

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
there's still a lot of good things that
we<00:01:35.500> want<00:01:35.649> to<00:01:35.710> build<00:01:35.890> on<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.189> continue<00:01:36.549> on

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
we want to build on and continue on

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
be done inside the defensive zone I

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.070 
be done inside the defensive zone I
guess<00:02:06.789> maybe<00:02:07.000> in<00:02:07.180> terms<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.539> communication

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
guess maybe in terms of communication

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.330 
guess maybe in terms of communication
that<00:02:08.230> you<00:02:08.440> guys<00:02:08.590> were<00:02:08.770> all<00:02:08.860> on<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:08.980> same<00:02:09.040> page

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
that you guys were all on the same page

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.890 
that you guys were all on the same page
so<00:02:09.400> at<00:02:09.610> least<00:02:09.730> maybe<00:02:10.000> contain<00:02:10.540> what<00:02:10.750> those

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
so at least maybe contain what those

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.130 
so at least maybe contain what those
guys<00:02:11.080> can<00:02:11.380> do<00:02:11.500> yeah

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
guys can do yeah

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.900 
guys can do yeah
not<00:02:12.319> spreading<00:02:12.800> ourselves<00:02:12.980> out<00:02:13.460> obviously

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
not spreading ourselves out obviously

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.630

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
it a lot easier you know and there's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.610 
it a lot easier you know and there's
good<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.270> you're<00:02:38.480> sort<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.989> position<00:02:39.290> to

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
good and you're sort of in a position to

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.190 
good and you're sort of in a position to
to<00:02:39.860> jump<00:02:40.610> if<00:02:40.790> there<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.300> any<00:02:41.569> any<00:02:41.989> break

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.470 
little little bit of time to get that
puck<00:03:13.190> out<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.610> make<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.850> play<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.300> gotta

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
puck out you make the play and you gotta

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.790 
puck out you make the play and you gotta
take<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.690> hit<00:03:14.840> winning<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.380> little<00:03:15.590> broccoli

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
take the hit winning a little broccoli

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.470 
take the hit winning a little broccoli
but<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.280> think<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.610> looked<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.120> lot<00:03:17.239> worse<00:03:17.299> than

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
but I think it looked a lot worse than

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.630 
but I think it looked a lot worse than
it<00:03:17.720> was<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.950> bounced<00:03:19.130> back<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.519> mean

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
it was you bounced back I mean

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.460 
it was you bounced back I mean
everything<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:20.000> fine<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.989> happens<00:03:21.350> it's

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
everything is fine so it happens it's

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.950 
everything is fine so it happens it's
part<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.829> game
