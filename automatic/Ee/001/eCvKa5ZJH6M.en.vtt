into<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:11.159> Ayla<00:01:11.640> Monroe<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.780> Isla<00:01:13.140> Monroe<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
into a Ayla Monroe or Isla Monroe and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.820 
into a Ayla Monroe or Isla Monroe and
she's<00:01:14.610> super<00:01:14.880> popular<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.840> beautiful<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
she's super popular and beautiful and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.240 
she's super popular and beautiful and
amazing<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.659> it's<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.869> parallel<00:01:19.350> universe<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
amazing and it's a parallel universe and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.240 
amazing and it's a parallel universe and
she<00:01:20.820> eventually<00:01:21.030> has<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.630> decide<00:01:21.930> which<00:01:22.290> side

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
she wants to stay on and I think this is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
she wants to stay on and I think this is
going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.409> really<00:01:25.619> thought-provoking<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
going to be really thought-provoking and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.850 
going to be really thought-provoking and
fun<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.119> light<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> same<00:01:28.619> time

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
fun and light but at the same time

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
fun and light but at the same time
really<00:01:29.220> give<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.729> sense<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.780> know

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
really give you a sense of you know

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.080 
really give you a sense of you know
what's<00:01:31.110> what's<00:01:31.680> good<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.130> true<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> world

what's what's good and true in the world
so<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.600> thought<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.869> might<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.200> interesting

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
so I thought that might be interesting

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.830 
so I thought that might be interesting
