young<00:00:46.020> people<00:00:46.440> today<00:00:46.590> really<00:00:47.460> thought<00:00:47.789> that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
young people today really thought that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.410 
young people today really thought that
today's<00:00:49.079> living<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.739> normal<00:00:50.190> right<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and they actually thought that they

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.119 
and they actually thought that they
could<00:00:53.690> kind<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.809> sail<00:00:55.079> off<00:00:55.320> into<00:00:55.350> some<00:00:55.800> sort<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
could kind of sail off into some sort of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.240 
could kind of sail off into some sort of
a<00:00:56.250> Star<00:00:56.550> Trek<00:00:57.050> cosmic<00:00:58.050> Nirvana<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.710> know<00:00:58.859> and

so it just struck me how how
historically<00:02:26.230> abnormal<00:02:27.230> our<00:02:27.830> current<00:02:28.340> you

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
historically abnormal our current you

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.960 
historically abnormal our current you

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
it how to acquire it how to participate

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.550 
it how to acquire it how to participate
in<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.150> even<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.660> know<00:02:44.810> how<00:02:45.500> the
