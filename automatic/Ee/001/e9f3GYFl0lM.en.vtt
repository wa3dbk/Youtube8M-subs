00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.170
 so much 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.760
 to an alienated million 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.850
 if there was a game that championed 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.650
 launch of kinect that was' dance 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.650
 central 'which took full advantage 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.080
 The unique qualities of the accessory 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.760
 microsoft after no other 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.700
 game compatible with the peripheral 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.280
 could cope with it harmonix pretend 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.030
 repeat the play by launching its 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.309
 second part central dance 2 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.289
 the title that we are dealing with is based on the 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.510
 formula of the first installment taking 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.430
 have to dance about 40 songs while 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.710
 we follow the choreography that we 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.170
 shows on screen in this way 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.390
 we found a very varied soundtrack 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.479
 and complete composed of famous themes 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.149
 like sexy satellite chic venus o 'bad 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.460
 romance 'to name a few 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.470
 It should be noted that we can import all 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.750
 the themes of the first game if we have 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.970
 of him with a small amount of 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.399
 microsoft points can reach in 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.399
 total a whopping about 80 songs 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.870
 then enter the 2 we see new faces and 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.120
 old acquaintances the dancers have 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.040
 grouped in defined bands each of 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.980
 them with a way of dressing a 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.620
 own musical style some characters 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.680
 as obvious or mccoy have been lost by the 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.290
 way and others like vujovic have come to 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.720
 replace them this new approach that 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.360
 divide the characters into pairs is the 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.670
 basis of a peculiar story mode one of 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.740
 the great novelties of the straight game and 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.750
 the rest of the groups will challenge us to 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.630
 dance with them a selection of 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.180
 themes we use subject we'll get 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.010
 the approval and admiration the goal 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.990
 final is to defeat the 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.610
 sinister glitter to you although I do not know 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.920
 expect some surprise 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.840
 one of the great deficiencies of the first 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.240
 central dash was the lack of a way 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.150
 simultaneous multiplayer having the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.250
 players who take turns playing 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.950
 the sequel has remedied this problem 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.650
 allowing players to operate or 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.780
 confront each other at the same time 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.850
 We are playing alone of a friend 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.010
 wants to enter to play just has to 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.200
 stand in front of kinect and lift the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.780
 hand and you can join the game in 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.000
 real time leaving it is just as 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.300
 easy having to take off from the front 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.640
 of the apparatus to leave the game 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.020
 we can play story mode way 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.030
 cooperative but the authentic 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.910
 protagonist of the games to the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.040
 players is our battle mode 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.840
 goal will be to make more points than rival 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.820
 sometimes having to dance in 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.950
 solitary where our movements 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.960
 they will be worth double 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.420
 the free battle is the event to have in 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.700
 account and is very decisive for the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.220
 course of the confrontation during 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.800
 the songs the choreography will stop 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.900
 at certain points and on the screen 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.940
 will offer us to make four possible 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.370
 movements having to execute 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.760
 The more the better before they are done 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.950
 this rival as can be seen is a way 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.000
 multiplayer much more attractive than the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.710
 of the previous delivery 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.560
 but still it sins of a great 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.510
 inconvenience does not have online mode 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.550
 so we'll have to have a 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.030
 great free space if we want to enjoy 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.560
 of this mode the menu system is 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.540
 has kept very similar to that of the 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.820
 previous delivery but the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.770
 stopping voice commands what we 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.010
 will allow you to pause the game with a 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.439
 simple xbox pause for example 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.629
 the function little by little also has 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.790
 of improvements being able to practice only the 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.920
 steps that interest us and not the song 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.629
 whole we can also record the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.030
 dancing with the goal of power 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.980
 find faults more quickly 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.769
 that we have in the execution of that 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.659
 movement another little novelty is the 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.610
 introduction of different lists of 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.769
 reproduction to perform exercise 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.659
 while we dance the counter 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.790
 calories still present in this delivery 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.290
 so we can know how many we have 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.630
 taken in each session 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.280
 the detection of kinect movements to 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.530
 same as in the first part is 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.320
 practically perfect recognizing 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.600
 our body very accurately already 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.250
 be moving your arms your hips or 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.650
 the legs the game will be 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.270
 identify us correctly whenever 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.880
 the distance to the device is adequate 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.910
 and there are no objects clogging through 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.070
 the graphic section has received a slight 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.830
 improves as the light effects that 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.420
 appear in the hands of dancers 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.420
 fulfilling more than correct 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.639
 dance central 2 has no changes 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.439
 revolutionary but if enough 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.199
 so as not to look like a mere 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:02.810
 update would be the first part was 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.180
 a recommendable title this sequel polished 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.009
 many of its flaws turning it into 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.169
 Obligatory purchase for everyone who 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.960
 possess kinect its varied selection 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.939
 musical and its adaptive difficulty what 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.800
 they make an attractive and easy title 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.080
 dance for any type of player 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.789
 but that also enjoys a great 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.319
 complexity for those who want 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.319
 enjoy a good challenge 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.250
