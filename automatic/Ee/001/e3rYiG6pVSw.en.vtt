00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.129
 who are days and friends 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.129
 we are again in family with God 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.919
 How nice to enter your home 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.019
 get to where you are in front of your TV screen 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.199
 and talk about some things of the spirit 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:28.319
 we have started the path of Lent 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.390
 i have to ask ourselves many things 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.530
 let's play today with two words 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.710
 the arrogance 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.670
 and the fragility 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.710
 let's think 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.860
 if we are arrogant 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 remember that in the dominance of his domain 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.950
 that self-sufficiency 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.240
 that abuse 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.730
 it's pride 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.940
 it's distance 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 is a lie 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 because we remember that the fragility of that opening 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 is to be waiting for a meeting 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.700
 is to be affected by resources 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.810
 and the pains 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.870
 of others 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.510
 of people 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.030
 the frailties 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.030
 open space for others 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.350
 the fragility of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.090
 What is it 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.390
 allow me 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 to the other an Indian penny corner of my life 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.370
 a little corner is enough 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.340
 to be comfortable 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.870
 visualize 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.270
 and visualize that to see if you are an accurate and powerful 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.590
 if you're 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.630
 a person 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.630
 exploited a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.240
 if you are a violent person 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.419
 if he abuses the authorities 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.419
 if you have an interest in exhibiting tea 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.339
 if you have insulting attitudes 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.339
 civil one miles to us 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.199
 all at times we are arrogant 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.589
 and we are arrogant with whom we can 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.339
 with the weakest 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.339
 with those who are inferior to us 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.760
 but also visualize the image of fragility 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.509
 the fragility is a smile 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.509
 that's where it does to people on the street 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.499
 it's the kiss that will be those who do 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.109
 are the hands of solidarity 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.499
 are 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.909
 the seed of goodness 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.909
 that you are delivering along the way 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.569
 a drop of dew in the morning 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.149
 a blade of grass 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.149
 everything speaks to us of fragility 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:16.819
 God 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.259
 It's fragile 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.239
 I would be fragile 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.379
 and that's why it was done with a hand 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.379
 Jesus became visible 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.449
 fragile 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:31.789
 in a child 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.789
 the little boy 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.160
 we are already just received 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.889
 the ash 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.699
 ic that starts 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.789
 the dust indices 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.789
 that the wind takes 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.019
 excellence does not remember 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.019
 that the flame has darkened 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:00.749
 that the heat has gone 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:03.619
 that the embers 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.209
 they have turned off 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.209
 nothing is left 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:12.179
 and you have to ask 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.429
 if at this time of your life spiritually 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.279
 I had ash 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.229
 If life rules you from the wind 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.229
 if you are full of pessimism and darkness 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:29.370
 if you do not have human warmth 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.930
 if they do not have light 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.930
 Why are you sad 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.629
 how important 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
 become aware 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.219
 that you have to leave the massive 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.300
 that you have to leave 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.629
 of the caduco of the cubes 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.770
 and you need 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.770
 someone turn on your light 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.379
 what do you need 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.719
 someone put inside you 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:04.719
 the heat of love 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.930
 if you look inside 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.939
 in this beautiful time of Lent 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.969
 you are going to discover 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.069
 what do you need from god 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.110
 that these need 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.110
 in need of god 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.409
 because 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.479
 go to the gospel 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.699
 from those again you enlighten life 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.009
 with the word 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.159
 claude puel dialog 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:39.589
 tells a very beautiful story 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.349
 when leprosy was 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.460
 an incurable disease 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.029
 they took 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:48.689
 a man porous 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:50.050
 and they locked him 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.050
 in a village in a leprocomio 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.800
 And his wife 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.969
 He also went on his way 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.969
 and went to live next to that town 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.110
 and everyone called his attention 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.110
 that this group of sick all sad came 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.839
 aching 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.139
 and depressed 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.139
 there was a man who smiled 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.909
 and they realized watching it 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.900
 that every morning 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.900
 his wife already old 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.439
 also ill but without leprosy 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:30.330
 he looked 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.689
 still small hill 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:36.479
 and over the high walls of the depro ate 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.189
 saluted 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:42.869
 with a smile her husband 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.869
 and I sent him a kiss 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.139
 and he confessed 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.699
 that that smile and that kiss 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.509
 they were the bread 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:55.089
 of its existence 

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:58.089
 and the bread of his joy every day 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.999
 let it 

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:03.999
 look 

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:08.409
 may God look at you every day 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:11.229
 from here God will smile at you 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:13.240
 and go back to savor 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.979
 the bread of strength and joy 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:18.389
 and renew your spirit 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:19.870
 in this time he admitted
