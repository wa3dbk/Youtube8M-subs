00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.560
 video about more mysteries today 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.779
 I will talk about the deleted mods 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
 future motorcycles that could appear in 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.670
 a future version of minecraft the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.769
 zombies the witches the quiver and the meter 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.780
 well we will start with the first 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.910
 mystery first mystery the mods 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.890
 eliminated I will start talking to you about 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.800
 the first many that were created 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.530
 we'll start with the frog this was the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.510
 first mmo created in main craft was a 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.239
 little girl disguised as a frog 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.070
 it was test doc he created it before to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.739
 a project and when he entered the world 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.840
 minecraft created it again not to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.000
 great thing since I was just testing 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.520
 only European goes an apple and did not have 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.380
 animation when walking is also known that 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.119
 it was the first way to have the sound of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.880
 pain of a human when you hit him 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.679
 He had 6 hearts and a half of life and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.250
 Spain goes in any place of the 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.890
 world 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.810
 the next month steve but it's not the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.870
 steve of the mini craft that we all know 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.550
 today it was only test 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.770
 he said he would look like a steve 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.320
 future although with a hat and a fur 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.360
 different in the period that was not 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.210
 European goes nothing but they had planned that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.430
 drop was one or two ropes one or two 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.130
 one or two pens of gunpowder or a lighter 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.280
 The next mobile that I will speak to you will be 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.710
 about ideas I'll see I was a way 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.600
 human that was tested was also 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.180
 created by doc and removed when it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.460
 he marched in the short time he was in 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.040
 the non-European game goes nothing but they had 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.920
 expected that drop was one or two strings 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.590
 one or two pens one or two of gunpowder a 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.270
 lighter this mode received the name veas 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.190
 I go by the great resemblance to the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.470
 character of the same name of the series 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.509
 cartoon young titans 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.929
 and this is the last mobile which is 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.910
 called black steve black steve was the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.130
 supposed name of the avatar that would be used 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.380
 in minecraft he was in the project in 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.540
 epc from minecraft this character is a 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.490
 of the works created by doc which is a 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.680
 ex artist of minecraft 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.540
 black steve was rejected from minecraft and 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.730
 now it is only remembered as another mode 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.120
 removed first mystery the mobs 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.820
 eliminated true second mystery 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.560
 future mobs in mini craft with the first 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.050
 move that I will start talking to you will be 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.780
 about the guardian elder the guardian 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.060
 Elder is a hostile mode only appears in 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.430
 water monuments your eye always 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.650
 will follow the player is stronger than the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.780
 normal guardian appears in the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.120
 Water monuments only appear three 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.880
 one in the center and the other two in the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.890
 sides can infect the player with 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.960
 fatigue when mining 3 and when it does 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.660
 his face appears on the screen 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.550
 next way will be the guardian the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.710
 guardian is very similar to the guardian 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.020
 helder only that the helper guardian is 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.670
 stronger than the normal guardian the 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.080
 behavior of the guardian is that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.810
 when they swim in the water like 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.730
 squid attack players and squid 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.130
 close do not drown out of the water 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.350
 they are also immune to fire and lava 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.360
 You can also find it in the 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.300
 underwater monuments just like the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.340
 guardian seeing the next move to him 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.569
 in der mitte el en der mitte is a new 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.579
 snapshot model 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.170
 probably added in 1.8 the in 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.450
 der mitte can be generated from three 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.370
 different ways the most common is that it 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.709
 unite derman teleports or makes 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.750
 damage there is probability that the 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.969
 second and less common when you throw 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.040
 a pearl in there and the third and more 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:48.069
 rare is when we open a chest in there 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.430
 its characteristics are the in der mitte 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.590
 disappears every 120 seconds despite 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.569
 be very similar to piece ma 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.180
 can hide in the blocks like them 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.579
 the next and last moves was the 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.290
 rabbit is an animal mode like the rest 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.659
 I could not find much information 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.760
 about this mode but if I found how 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.919
 domesticate it I know how to tame it 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.439
 like putting a sword in his neck 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.659
 and tell him if you do not come with me to 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.879
 home you will become the dinner of this 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.459
 night that jejejejeje gea do not wait 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.500
 it's wow ha ha ha ha ha ha ha good for 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.169
 tame a rabbit we should give it 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.080
 carrots the process to tame 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.639
 rabbits is the same as that of the ocelots 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.580
 to learn how to tame there is 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.770
 follow these steps step 1 the rabbit 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.300
 will look at the player and approach slowly 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.849
 for rabbit into 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.159
 of domestication we should be from 7 to 10 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.710
 blocks away from the rabbit 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.889
 step 2 the rabbit has to be 3 blocks 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.479
 of the player and step 3 the player must 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.610
 give it carrots until it is 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.530
 domesticated like the ocelot at 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.780
 kill a rabbit what will drop will be 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.699
 three possible objects that are skin of 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.580
 rabbit rabbit raw and rabbit paw 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.039
 the latter is a weird drone when killing a 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.470
 rabbit with fire will release cooked rabbit 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.620
 second future mysteries moves in 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.690
 minecraft true third mystery the 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.490
 zombies I already know that zombies are not there 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.169
 a lot to tell about them but if we 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.270
 we think about the world of 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.639
 minecraft we will find many things 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.860
 mysterious one of them for me are the 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.840
 zombies because if we look at them well 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.849
 They have the same clothes that we use 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.949
 in survival mode this comes to say 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.719
 that maybe there were other players before 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.330
 that we came to the world of 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:30.550
 minecraft some will have wondered 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.620
 why there will be zombies there has been a 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.229
 zombie infection something that contagious 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.330
 how the villagers get infected when 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.789
 a zombie has contact with him he calls 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.110
 by phone no idiot I mean 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.170
 when he touches it 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.230
 this mystery qualified him as third 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.420
 mystery the zombies possible or not x 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.730
 of fourth mystery the witches 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.710
 previously the witches just 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.350
 appeared in the swamp biome in some 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.930
 wooden cabins these could contain 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.240
 a portion support or a cauldron or 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.610
 a worktable and even from 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.170
 of version 1.7 may appear in 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.660
 any part with a level of 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.480
 lighting lower than 8 the witch was 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.180
 introduced in update 1.4 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.400
 point 2 wear a black hat with a 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.650
 crystal in the center a comical wart 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.110
 in the nose x once I got one 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.330
 wart asia on the back x of shut up 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.670
 and do not interrupt, wear violet clothes and 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.860
 has all the white skin strangely 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.170
 gev I use the form of the 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.170
 villager to do the quarter witch 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.600
 mystery the witches real fifth 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.340
 mystery the quiver the quiver was a 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.320
 object previously used by the 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.930
 skeletons and to contain the arrows 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.820
 this object was removed from the game 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.430
 probably due to the fact that 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.740
 arrows can be accumulated to 64 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.460
 for inventory space doing 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.560
 unnecessary fifth mystery the quiver 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.530
 true sixth mystery the enigma of 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.780
 ether the ether is a representation of 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.970
 hell in minecraft in which they live 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.430
 the zombie pig the magma covers the 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:06.250
 skeleton abyssal spending and the blade 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.889
 but the mysterious thing here is if this is the 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.080
 hell where is the devil there is a 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.060
 theory that is the winter which is 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.460
 summon with soul sand and heads of 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.990
 abyssal skeletons according to a story 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.430
 they realize that the devil 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.039
 will rise to destroy humanity 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.590
 refers to the winter because when 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:25.419
 invokes it begins to attack you at 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.300
 villagers and any way you do not 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:30.180
 belong to the race of the living dead 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.919
 sixth mystery the enigma of the ether 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.169
 true well up here we have arrived 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:37.030
 but do not worry I'll look for more things 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:40.150
 about the mini kraft and I'll do more parts 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:42.009
 just have patience good xd us 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.870
 we will see in the next one and also 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:45.639
 dismisses its future ruler of 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.620
 minecraft do not forget to make a 

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:50.860
 reverence before his god before 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.300
 finish the video vga do not wait is wow 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.639
 Hahaha 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.440
 and now the video question how do you 

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:59.530
 would like it to appear in the version 

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.949
 1.8 I wish there were more animals 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.949
 marine
