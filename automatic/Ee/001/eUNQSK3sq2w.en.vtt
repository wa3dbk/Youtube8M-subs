hello this is dr. Janet Bruno and today
I<00:00:08.790> want<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.389> talk<00:00:09.599> about<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.410> question<00:00:10.860> that's

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
I want to talk about a question that's

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.280 
I want to talk about a question that's
been<00:00:11.519> quite<00:00:11.820> controversial<00:00:12.389> for<00:00:12.660> some<00:00:12.929> time

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
been quite controversial for some time

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.790 
been quite controversial for some time
and<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.759> which<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.599> better<00:00:16.109> plant

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
and that is which is better plant

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.210 
and that is which is better plant
protein<00:00:17.490> or<00:00:17.789> animal<00:00:18.570> protein<00:00:19.039> now<00:00:20.039> there's

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
protein or animal protein now there's

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.189 
protein or animal protein now there's
been<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.400> lot<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.760> research<00:00:21.300> recently<00:00:21.660> that's

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
been a lot of research recently that's

been a lot of research recently that's
been<00:00:22.500> addressing<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.519> question<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:25.140> all

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
been addressing this question and in all

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.769 
been addressing this question and in all
reality<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.250> supporters<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.300> animal

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779

protein<00:00:28.289> diet<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.949> having<00:00:29.490> an<00:00:29.609> increasingly

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
protein diet are having an increasingly

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.470 
protein diet are having an increasingly
difficult<00:00:30.990> time<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.610> talk<00:00:32.850> about<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
difficult time to talk about the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.049 
difficult time to talk about the

benefits of animal protein / plant

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.690 
benefits of animal protein / plant
protein<00:00:36.630> because<00:00:37.410> all<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.040> new<00:00:38.160> studies<00:00:38.550> are

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
protein because all the new studies are

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.900 
protein because all the new studies are
truly<00:00:39.420> showing<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.530> plant<00:00:41.070> protein<00:00:41.670> is

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
truly showing that plant protein is

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.900 
truly showing that plant protein is

protein intake the lower the blood

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.389 
protein intake the lower the blood
pressure<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:55.980> further

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
pressure is and this is further

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.119 
pressure is and this is further
supported<00:00:56.760> by<00:00:57.300> supplementary<00:00:58.079> studies<00:00:58.500> which

of the blood pressure in humans and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.800 
of the blood pressure in humans and
going<00:01:10.380> further<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:11.070> readily<00:01:12.030> apparent<00:01:12.510> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
going further it's readily apparent that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.929 
going further it's readily apparent that
vegans<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.710> whole<00:01:14.280> when<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.790> do

vegans as a whole when you do

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.660 
vegans as a whole when you do
demographic<00:01:15.810> studies<00:01:16.259> vegans<00:01:17.100> are<00:01:17.280> lighter

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
demographic studies vegans are lighter

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.940 
demographic studies vegans are lighter
in<00:01:18.000> weight<00:01:18.030> than<00:01:19.020> meat-eaters<00:01:19.409> that's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
in weight than meat-eaters that's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.249 
in weight than meat-eaters that's
well-documented<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:22.049> further

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
well-documented and going further

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.080 
well-documented and going further
there's<00:01:22.920> many<00:01:23.220> studies<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.060> shown

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
there's many studies that have shown

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.140 
there's many studies that have shown
that<00:01:24.420> plant<00:01:25.200> protein<00:01:25.770> has<00:01:26.100> some<00:01:26.460> beneficial

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that plant protein has some beneficial

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.749 
that plant protein has some beneficial
components<00:01:27.509> that's<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.770> found<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.400> animal

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
components that's not found in animal

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.270 
components that's not found in animal
protein<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:31.110> really<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.560> result<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:32.220> all

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
protein so really the result of all

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.969 
protein so really the result of all
these<00:01:32.640> studies<00:01:32.970> provides<00:01:33.600> quite<00:01:33.990> solid<00:01:34.619> proof

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
these studies provides quite solid proof

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.810 
these studies provides quite solid proof
that<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> plant-based<00:01:36.390> diet<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.409> truly<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> wiser

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that a plant-based diet is truly a wiser

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.999 
that a plant-based diet is truly a wiser
choice<00:01:39.090> than<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.020> diet<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.409> depends<00:01:40.920> on

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
choice than a diet that depends on

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.850 
choice than a diet that depends on
animal<00:01:41.430> protein<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> let's<00:01:43.350> address<00:01:43.590> this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
animal protein so let's address this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.429 
animal protein so let's address this
question<00:01:44.040> why<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:45.030> plant-based<00:01:45.600> protein<00:01:46.259> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
question why is plant-based protein so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.190 
question why is plant-based protein so
important<00:01:46.920> well<00:01:47.759> protein<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.509> an<00:01:48.720> essential

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
important well protein is an essential

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
important well protein is an essential
component<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.950> muscle<00:01:50.399> growth<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
component of muscle growth and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.840 
component of muscle growth and
development<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:52.049> well<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.130> mechanism

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
development as well as the mechanism

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.330 
development as well as the mechanism
which<00:01:54.060> slows<00:01:54.420> down<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.110> aging<00:01:55.140> process<00:01:55.710> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
which slows down the aging process of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.910 
which slows down the aging process of
muscles<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.329> very<00:01:57.479> important<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.200> it's

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
muscles so it's very important and it's

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.280 
muscles so it's very important and it's
also<00:01:59.189> vital<00:01:59.640> for<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.030> optimal<00:02:00.540> operation<00:02:00.990> of

so it's an important distinction to make

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.770 
so it's an important distinction to make
of<00:03:26.200> plant<00:03:26.680> protein<00:03:27.190> /<00:03:27.670> animal<00:03:28.120> protein<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.720> the

increased calcium loss from the body and

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.000 
increased calcium loss from the body and
this<00:03:40.570> can<00:03:40.780> actually<00:03:40.930> increase<00:03:41.410> your<00:03:41.650> risk<00:03:41.799> of

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
this can actually increase your risk of

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.259 
this can actually increase your risk of
osteoporosis<00:03:43.530> now<00:03:44.530> plant-based<00:03:45.160> protein<00:03:45.820> has

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.000 
osteoporosis now plant-based protein has
a<00:03:46.600> very<00:03:46.870> different<00:03:47.140> effect<00:03:47.620> on<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.860> body

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
a very different effect on the body

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.160 
a very different effect on the body
which<00:03:48.730> once<00:03:49.030> again<00:03:49.209> underlines<00:03:49.900> the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
which once again underlines the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.150 
which once again underlines the
importance<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:51.010> where<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.820> get<00:03:52.000> your<00:03:52.120> protein

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
importance of where you get your protein

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.300 
importance of where you get your protein
so<00:03:53.790> some<00:03:54.540> additional<00:03:55.230> advantages<00:03:55.920> between

so some additional advantages between

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.280 
so some additional advantages between
animal<00:03:56.790> protein<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.390> plant<00:03:57.600> protein<00:03:57.990> I<00:03:58.080> think

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
animal protein and plant protein I think

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.530 
animal protein and plant protein I think
is<00:03:58.380> important<00:03:58.830> for<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.070> understand<00:03:59.640> plant

the risk of colon problems because

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.300 
the risk of colon problems because
there's<00:04:09.150> very<00:04:09.540> much<00:04:09.810> fiber<00:04:10.500> in<00:04:10.860> the

there's very much fiber in the
plant-based<00:04:11.610> protein<00:04:12.210> and<00:04:12.480> plant<00:04:13.290> protein<00:04:13.740> is

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920
