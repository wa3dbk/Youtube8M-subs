00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
out little more than that it looks like

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.319 
out little more than that it looks like
enough<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.969> twice<00:00:54.270> as

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
enough because it's going to be twice as

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.439 
enough because it's going to be twice as
melt<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.870> Part<00:00:55.079> B<00:00:55.110> added<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.180> okay<00:00:57.180> and

then Part B this is yellow you just

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.710 
then Part B this is yellow you just
scoop<00:01:03.629> some<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.430> about<00:01:05.430> equal<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> white

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
scoop some up about equal to the white

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
scoop some up about equal to the white
doesn't<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.740> exact<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:09.060> best<00:01:09.299> as

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
doesn't have to be exact just as best as

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.740 
doesn't have to be exact just as best as
you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:13.130> I'm<00:01:14.130> also<00:01:14.760> pretty<00:01:15.360> equal<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you can get it I'm also pretty equal to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.950 
you can get it I'm also pretty equal to
me

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
me

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.140 
me
so<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> seal<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.670> back<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.930> put<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.560> side<00:01:20.150> so

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
so to seal that back and put a side so

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.149 
so to seal that back and put a side so
now<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.659> need<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.650> you're<00:01:22.830> needing

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
now just need this as if you're needing

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.249 
now just need this as if you're needing
polymer<00:01:23.549> clay<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:24.360> you're<00:01:24.570> mixing<00:01:24.900> colors

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
polymer clay like you're mixing colors

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.460 
polymer clay like you're mixing colors
or<00:01:25.409> something<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.490> very<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.210> soft<00:01:27.600> but

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
or something and it's very very soft but

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.219 
or something and it's very very soft but
it<00:01:28.590> will<00:01:28.650> dry<00:01:30.049> flexible<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:33.229> not

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it will dry flexible not in a like not

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.440 
it will dry flexible not in a like not
in<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> clay<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:35.610> but

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
in the clay kind of like it is now but

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.649 
in the clay kind of like it is now but
it'll<00:01:37.439> be<00:01:37.470> hard<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.640> flexible<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.479> makes

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it'll be hard but flexible if that makes

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.670 
it'll be hard but flexible if that makes
sense

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.950 

there<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:44.040> keep<00:01:44.399> kneading<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.270> kneading

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
there we go keep kneading and kneading

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.359 
there we go keep kneading and kneading
and<00:01:46.140> kneading<00:01:46.530> until<00:01:48.020> it's<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.259> solid<00:01:49.829> pale

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
and kneading until it's one solid pale

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.240 
and kneading until it's one solid pale
yellow<00:01:50.820> color<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:54.860> I'm<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.159> using

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
yellow color and I'm going to be using

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.249 
yellow color and I'm going to be using
this<00:01:56.460> cupcake<00:01:56.700> baseball<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.570> making<00:01:57.899> lots<00:01:58.140> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
know because it's hard to make cupcake

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.030 
know because it's hard to make cupcake
faces<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.790> find<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.990> now<00:02:04.200> you're<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.409> going<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
faces I find so now you're just going to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.940 
faces I find so now you're just going to
roll<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:05.729> until<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.479> smooth<00:02:07.350> because

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
roll this out until it's smooth because

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.290 
roll this out until it's smooth because
you<00:02:08.160> don't<00:02:08.280> want<00:02:08.399> any<00:02:08.550> creases<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.030> mold

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
you don't want any creases in your mold

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.460 
you don't want any creases in your mold
because<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.470> would<00:02:10.619> distort<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> image<00:02:11.300> so

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
because that would distort the image so

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.550 
because that would distort the image so
a little<00:02:13.100> ball<00:02:13.280> here<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.200> I'm<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:15.230> going<00:02:15.470> to

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
a little ball here and I'm just going to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.010 
a little ball here and I'm just going to

we go I think that looks pretty good and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.610 
we go I think that looks pretty good and
I<00:02:53.209> hope<00:02:53.330> it's<00:02:53.570> thick<00:02:53.870> enough<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:54.230> bottom<00:02:54.530> you

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
I hope it's thick enough on bottom you

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.230 
I hope it's thick enough on bottom you
want<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.830> make<00:02:54.920> sure<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.790> bottom<00:02:56.209> part

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
want to make sure that the bottom part

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.840 
want to make sure that the bottom part
is<00:02:56.540> thick<00:02:56.780> enough<00:02:57.020> or<00:02:57.260> else<00:02:57.470> it'll<00:02:58.100> be<00:02:58.490> really

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
is thick enough or else it'll be really

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.480 
is thick enough or else it'll be really
hard<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.330> make<00:02:59.990> your<00:03:00.709> casting<00:03:01.160> because<00:03:01.400> it
