yep I got him in a package deal with

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.839 
yep I got him in a package deal with
bats<00:00:24.230> which<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.529> will<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.920> reviewing<00:00:26.369> after

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
bats which I will be reviewing after

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.659 
bats which I will be reviewing after
this<00:00:28.429> so<00:00:29.429> I'll<00:00:29.880> give<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.359> close<00:00:30.869> look<00:00:31.199> he<00:00:32.189> is

this so I'll give you a close look he is
identical<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.809> normal<00:00:34.380> salty<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.730> I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
identical to a normal salty because I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.799 
identical to a normal salty because I
checked<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.480> before<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:38.300> can't<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.510> any

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
checked just before I can't see any

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.709 
checked just before I can't see any
other<00:00:40.079> differences

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.049 

underneath<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.769> says<00:00:51.980> which<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.190> tray<00:00:53.610> in

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
underneath that says which is a tray in

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.170 
underneath that says which is a tray in
which<00:00:57.059> I'm<00:00:57.239> associate<00:00:57.839> a<00:01:00.980> little<00:01:01.980> bit<00:01:02.190> since

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
which I'm associate a little bit since

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.130 
which I'm associate a little bit since
2009<00:01:04.040> which<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.070> obviously<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.880> casting<00:01:06.479> time

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
2009 which is obviously the casting time

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.940 
2009 which is obviously the casting time
or<00:01:07.590> I'm<00:01:08.549> talking<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.630> cast<00:01:09.930> fear<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
or I'm talking and I cast fear that the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.660 
or I'm talking and I cast fear that the
production<00:01:11.490> run<00:01:12.890> we've<00:01:13.890> obviously<00:01:14.070> just

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
production run we've obviously just

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.410 
production run we've obviously just
changed<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.330> color<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.080> shell<00:01:16.320> paste<00:01:17.420> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.249 
changed the color of the shell paste to
make<00:01:18.600> him<00:01:18.869> green<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.940> let's<00:01:21.390> put<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.690> battery<00:01:22.050> in

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
make him green so let's put a battery in

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.100 
make him green so let's put a battery in
him<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> give<00:01:23.250> him<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.490> run<00:01:23.759> there<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.929> that

there's such huge differences in the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.139 
there's such huge differences in the
drive<00:01:57.460> units<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.890> about<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.520> we're<00:02:03.729> about<00:02:03.820> to

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
drive units so about that we're about to

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.440 
drive units so about that we're about to
have<00:02:04.299> an<00:02:04.570> accident<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.640> same<00:02:06.880> section<00:02:07.240> of

are empty so this is his first one and
it'll<00:02:26.440> be<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> nice<00:02:26.890> test<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.550> power<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:30.180> we'll

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
it'll be a nice test of power and we'll

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.440 
it'll be a nice test of power and we'll
show<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.540> what<00:02:31.840> happens<00:02:32.200> here<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.209> same

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450

spot again back to Sookie I think it'd

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.590 
spot again back to Sookie I think it'd
be<00:02:44.739> lay<00:02:45.130> out<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.340> bit<00:02:45.519> of<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.700> tidy<00:02:45.910> up<00:02:46.090> near<00:02:46.480> the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
the railway I mean

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:21.110 
the railway I mean
the<00:03:10.950> car<00:03:11.160> was<00:03:11.370> fine<00:03:11.640> when<00:03:11.880> we<00:03:11.940> fixed<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:20.120> salty

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
the car was fine when we fixed it salty

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.950 
the car was fine when we fixed it salty
looking<00:03:21.570> fantastic

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.250 

I'm<00:03:24.470> not<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.680> big<00:03:24.920> fan<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.360> recolors<00:03:26.360> just<00:03:27.020> for

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
I'm not a big fan of recolors just for

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.030 
I'm not a big fan of recolors just for
the<00:03:27.410> sake<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.680> recolor<00:03:29.020> I'm<00:03:30.020> sure<00:03:30.350> there's<00:03:30.680> a

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
the sake of recolor I'm sure there's a

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.810 
the sake of recolor I'm sure there's a
story<00:03:31.550> behind<00:03:31.640> why<00:03:32.270> he<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:32.600> green<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:37.670> I

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
story behind why he is green and I

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.550 
story behind why he is green and I
didn't<00:03:38.090> think<00:03:38.270> I<00:03:38.570> would<00:03:38.720> like<00:03:39.050> him<00:03:39.260> very<00:03:39.320> much

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
didn't think I would like him very much

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.800 
didn't think I would like him very much
but<00:03:40.370> then<00:03:40.610> when<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.910> arrived<00:03:41.240> and<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.600> had<00:03:41.780> a

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
but then when it arrived and I had a

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.360 
but then when it arrived and I had a
good<00:03:41.990> look<00:03:42.200> at<00:03:42.320> it<00:03:42.350> I<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:44.390> say<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:46.220> actually

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
good look at it I to say it actually

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.290 
good look at it I to say it actually
looks<00:03:46.820> quite<00:03:46.940> good<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:48.940> think<00:03:49.940> they<00:03:50.060> could<00:03:50.270> have

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
looks quite good I think they could have

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.950 
looks quite good I think they could have
left<00:03:50.570> this<00:03:50.720> rice<00:03:51.050> yellow<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.250> black<00:03:52.490> there<00:03:52.960> at

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
left this rice yellow and black there at

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.680 
left this rice yellow and black there at
my<00:03:54.320> arm<00:03:54.650> is<00:03:54.860> criticism

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.680 

so<00:04:01.620> strain<00:04:02.010> warning<00:04:02.460> shots<00:04:02.820> don't<00:04:03.210> really

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
so strain warning shots don't really

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
so strain warning shots don't really
give<00:04:04.230> much<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:05.040> warning<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.940> my<00:04:06.210> book<00:04:06.480> anyway

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.430 

and<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:23.789> these<00:04:23.970> come<00:04:24.210> up<00:04:24.330> again<00:04:24.690> in<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.139> sand

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
and so these come up again in the sand

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.790 
and so these come up again in the sand
but<00:04:26.479> I'm<00:04:27.479> just<00:04:27.600> going<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.870> put<00:04:28.050> him<00:04:28.199> applaud

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:55.189 

yes<00:06:49.090> so<00:06:50.090> the<00:06:50.630> brain<00:06:51.080> salty<00:06:51.650> from<00:06:51.920> chuck<00:06:52.280> master

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.670 

I<00:06:55.229> think<00:06:56.039> if<00:06:56.639> you<00:06:56.849> don't<00:06:57.060> already<00:06:57.389> own<00:06:57.749> a<00:06:58.050> salty

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
I think if you don't already own a salty

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.189 
I think if you don't already own a salty
or<00:06:58.889> several<00:06:59.639> salty<00:07:00.300> because<00:07:00.779> they've<00:07:00.990> been<00:07:01.139> a

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
or several salty because they've been a

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.659 
or several salty because they've been a
few<00:07:01.529> so<00:07:01.710> far<00:07:02.270> then<00:07:03.270> go<00:07:03.629> for<00:07:03.930> it<00:07:04.430> if<00:07:05.430> you<00:07:05.550> decide

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
few so far then go for it if you decide

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.950 
few so far then go for it if you decide
a<00:07:05.909> collector<00:07:06.449> here<00:07:06.599> stabbed<00:07:06.990> everything<00:07:08.960> then

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
a collector here stabbed everything then

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.360 
a collector here stabbed everything then
go<00:07:10.259> for<00:07:10.590> it<00:07:10.680> as<00:07:10.830> well<00:07:12.020> otherwise<00:07:13.020> well<00:07:14.009> there's

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
go for it as well otherwise well there's

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.309 
go for it as well otherwise well there's
not<00:07:14.580> too<00:07:14.759> much<00:07:14.939> different<00:07:15.419> from<00:07:15.749> the<00:07:15.960> normal

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 
not too much different from the normal

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:22.550 
not too much different from the normal
salty<00:07:17.779> this<00:07:18.779> one<00:07:19.050> does<00:07:19.289> run<00:07:19.590> very<00:07:19.919> well<00:07:21.560> but

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
salty this one does run very well but

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.760 
salty this one does run very well but
salty<00:07:23.099> always<00:07:23.460> did<00:07:24.050> even<00:07:25.050> when<00:07:25.199> your<00:07:25.319> is<00:07:25.499> red

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
salty always did even when your is red

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.769 
salty always did even when your is red
and<00:07:25.979> yellow<00:07:27.830> but<00:07:28.830> overall<00:07:29.699> I<00:07:29.999> think<00:07:30.060> it<00:07:30.539> looks

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:30.779 
and yellow but overall I think it looks

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:33.019 
and yellow but overall I think it looks
a<00:07:30.930> lot<00:07:31.050> better<00:07:31.289> in<00:07:31.499> person<00:07:31.740> and<00:07:32.099> it<00:07:32.219> can<00:07:32.879> on

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:33.029 
a lot better in person and it can on

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:38.149 
a lot better in person and it can on
video<00:07:33.800> or<00:07:34.800> in<00:07:34.919> photos<00:07:36.560> so<00:07:37.560> it's<00:07:37.710> really<00:07:37.860> hard

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:38.159 
video or in photos so it's really hard

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:44.689
