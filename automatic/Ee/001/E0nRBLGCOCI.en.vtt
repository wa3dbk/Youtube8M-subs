00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.510
 and I delved into kids I'll teach them how to do 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.220
 an icon 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.550
 in this basic way 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.700
 The first thing we have to do is go 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.219
 archive 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.139
 new 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.339
 and we give it a width value of 60 pixels 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.449
 height 60 pixels 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.019
 the resolution 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.599
 we could 300 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.599
 and in transparent background content 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.500
 to be bigger 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.690
 to see 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.780
 now we are going to go to the tools 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.450
 of rectangle 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.520
 we choose rounded rectangle 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.440
 if not at the same time 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.140
 fans on 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.270
 this triangle and touches here so you can options 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.540
 then we choose rounded rectangle 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.810
 we give you radio 8 vic 6 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.810
 50 who is on top 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.210
 now inside him 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.380
 our layer 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.380
 let's do 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.540
 our rectangle 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.130
 we go to the layers palette 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.370
 we say rastelli zarca 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.860
 we see that it was set to white but it does not matter 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.240
 since we are going to give you other colors 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.070
 now we open 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.880
 the lapel d add cappa style that is here 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.350
 and we choose 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.350
 Gradient Overlay 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.490
 now we are choosing the colors here there are several colors that you can 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.180
 this crop and sar 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.610
 some of us can you 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.770
 you have to download the install 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.010
 but we are going to create some workers 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.390
 so 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.390
 black color still assume a color 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.590
 the white color we are going to put another blue color 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.590
 more clarito 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.729
 Beijing plus one month 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.749
 we hope what there is 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.409
 here we give 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.409
 now we're going alizegui 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.159
 and relief 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.889
 who says and raised 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.329
 of quito is to use 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.200
 the global 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.139
 you take that little popcorn 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.139
 and you position 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.789
 how do you want me to come to light 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.689
 the depth of the sector is accurate 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.689
 the size 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:54.179
 let's put in counter no 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.519
 in rounded or you choose yourself 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.839
 your type of outline that 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:03.839
 what do you need? 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.919
 we will also give 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.489
 radiance 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.549
 inside 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.549
 let's put in black 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:20.739
 and here 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.469
 they came in we can 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.489
 normal 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.579
 with the 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.389
 opacity that you want 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.339
 you can move the controls 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:34.339
 according to what you need 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.049
 let's leave like this 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.419
 eye here there is an effect 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.809
 Gradient Overlay 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.229
 we are going to put 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.229
 in super 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.349
 and in superposition of reasons we choose some reason that has 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.699
 that you like for example 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.579
 let's put this 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.579
 navas done this let's see 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:08.789
 let's make the window smaller 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.359
 to 100% 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.359
 that way it would be explained not 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.900
 now then only until he had 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.900
 you want to create 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.740
 some figure inside 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.379
 in the forms 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:27.449
 remember 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.449
 where are the rectangle tools this one 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.300
 the option of twigs form 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.559
 who forms we choose 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.449
 for example let's put this 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.020
 when igniting occurs 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.099
 our white color 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.099
 whichever you want 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.740
 again we go to the layer palette we put 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:55.180
 rastelli za 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.809
 me about this image 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:58.029
 of the breath 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:01.270
 if you want to give it a dust effect in 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.360
 remember that you can go here this option 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.830
 just like we did with the icon add a layer style 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.959
 where you can change the colors put a bevel for example 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.279
 percentage modifying 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.199
 suppose so 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.680
 let's see what there is 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.680
 can you passiega bird 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.270
 or leave it as it was 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.719
 or you can open some other icon that want to mount lenses 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.979
 for example 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.979
 I do not know what happens to them not so much to open this debate 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.279
 and with a tool to move 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.279
 the poplars towards our 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.680
 of a we are forming a dry no 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.700
 this alien 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.189
 we are not going to erase 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.129
 oo 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.059
 take away the option 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:11.239
 of visual to visualize quintín in quito 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.199
 press the chip 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.199
 the cables to make it smaller so that it does not deform 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.860
 and in opposition 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.110
 this way we have 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.779
 the unmik with 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.809
 as soon as you can 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:39.279
 modify it 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.130
 we find the palette of 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.009
 color show 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.059
 I dressed the 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:47.729
 where you can apply 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.419
 some style 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:53.729
 of those who come here 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:56.729
 this fact depends on what you like 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.879
 my biggest 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.879
 but I think it's better 

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:09.069
 his style 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:10.650
 to save it we go 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.629
 archive 

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:15.189
 in save as 

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:17.439
 and we choose format 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:20.439
 p ng 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.490
 the waiter of a title 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:28.039
 click or not 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:29.680
 known 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.050
 the one that is sold for example 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.119
 I'm going to 

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.119
 borodavkin of the writer 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:42.889
 and ready we have our icon 

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:49.159
 ready for you to continue modifying 

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:52.529
 I have a medium sale but good 

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:53.139
