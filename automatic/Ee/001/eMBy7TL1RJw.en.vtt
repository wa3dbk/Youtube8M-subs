00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
mp3 or something of the sort in our case

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.300 
mp3 or something of the sort in our case
we<00:02:03.430> are<00:02:03.550> going<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.729> use<00:02:03.850> Bluetooth<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.890> one

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
we are going to use Bluetooth but one

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.920 
we are going to use Bluetooth but one
thing<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:06.580> wanted<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.060> draw<00:02:07.270> your<00:02:07.300> attention<00:02:07.899> to

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
thing I wanted to draw your attention to

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.260 
thing I wanted to draw your attention to
is<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.709> option<00:02:09.009> right<00:02:09.160> below<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.550> which<00:02:10.060> is

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
is the option right below that which is

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.810 
is the option right below that which is
drag<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.110> remote<00:02:11.500> microphone<00:02:11.920> application

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
drag and remote microphone application

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.970 
drag and remote microphone application
so<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.080> actually<00:02:14.410> something<00:02:14.560> I'm<00:02:14.830> going

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
so this is actually something I'm going

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.780 
so this is actually something I'm going
to<00:02:15.040> show<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.489> one<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.760> my<00:02:15.910> other<00:02:16.360> videos

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
to show you in one of my other videos

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.560 
to show you in one of my other videos
where<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.120> can<00:02:19.330> use<00:02:19.570> your<00:02:19.930> iPhone<00:02:21.090> or<00:02:22.090> a

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
where you can use your iPhone or a

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.520 
where you can use your iPhone or a
Android<00:02:23.320> based<00:02:24.150> telephone<00:02:25.150> or<00:02:25.390> cell<00:02:25.540> phone<00:02:25.750> to

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
Android based telephone or cell phone to

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.330 
Android based telephone or cell phone to
dictate<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.940> your<00:02:28.150> computer<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.890> basically<00:02:30.190> I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
dictate to your computer so basically I

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.310 
dictate to your computer so basically I
would<00:02:30.489> use<00:02:30.640> Wi-Fi<00:02:31.180> or<00:02:31.360> Bluetooth<00:02:31.780> about<00:02:32.049> sure

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
would use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth about sure

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.800 
would use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth about sure
exactly<00:02:32.560> which<00:02:32.920> one<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:33.700> I'm<00:02:33.820> pretty<00:02:34.480> sure<00:02:34.690> it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
exactly which one but I'm pretty sure it

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.430 
exactly which one but I'm pretty sure it
would<00:02:34.959> be<00:02:35.250> Bluetooth<00:02:36.420> where<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:38.260> would

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
would be Bluetooth where you would

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.289 
would be Bluetooth where you would
dictate<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:39.250> your<00:02:39.430> phone<00:02:39.670> as<00:02:39.940> if<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.209> were

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
dictate to your phone as if you were

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.330 
dictate to your phone as if you were
talking<00:02:40.540> on<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.019> phone<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.500> would

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
talking on the phone and that would

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.880 
talking on the phone and that would
communicate<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.600> your<00:02:43.810> desktop<00:02:44.709> computer

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
communicate to your desktop computer

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.350 
communicate to your desktop computer
your<00:02:45.430> laptop<00:02:45.580> whatever<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.209> might<00:02:46.330> be<00:02:46.390> and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
your laptop whatever it might be and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.270 
your laptop whatever it might be and
take<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.510> as<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> dictation<00:02:50.079> as<00:02:50.410> another

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
take that as a dictation as another

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.770 
take that as a dictation as another
source<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:53.040> sound<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:55.120> instead<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.420> using<00:02:55.570> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
source of sound so instead of using the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.020 
source of sound so instead of using the
Bluetooth<00:02:56.140> or<00:02:56.350> using<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:57.220> USB<00:02:57.730> or<00:02:57.880> the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
Bluetooth or using the the USB or the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.940 
Bluetooth or using the the USB or the
mic<00:02:58.209> you're<00:02:58.780> basically<00:02:59.170> using<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> mic<00:02:59.709> on

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
mic you're basically using the mic on

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.370 
mic you're basically using the mic on
your<00:03:00.160> phone<00:03:00.630> that's<00:03:01.630> built<00:03:01.840> into<00:03:02.049> your<00:03:02.140> phone

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
your phone that's built into your phone

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.350 
your phone that's built into your phone
so<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:03.220> don't<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.730> have<00:03:03.940> one<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.269> those

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
so you don't have to have one of those

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.890 
so you don't have to have one of those
types<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:05.730> over<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.820> ear<00:03:08.640> mics<00:03:09.640> or<00:03:10.060> even<00:03:10.810> a

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
types of over the ear mics or even a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.840 
types of over the ear mics or even a
microphone<00:03:11.350> built<00:03:11.560> into<00:03:11.769> your<00:03:11.980> laptop<00:03:12.160> or

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
microphone built into your laptop or

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.410 
microphone built into your laptop or
desktop<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.989> can<00:03:14.019> use<00:03:14.290> your<00:03:14.410> cell<00:03:14.590> phone

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
desktop you can use your cell phone

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.789 
desktop you can use your cell phone
immediately<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:17.019> typically<00:03:17.350> have<00:03:17.590> that

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
immediately and you typically have that

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.710 
immediately and you typically have that
with<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.070> all<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.340> time<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:18.820> that's<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.540> nice

Bluetooth here I'm gonna click on next
I<00:03:25.100> then<00:03:25.670> have<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:25.940> summary<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> profile<00:03:27.320> I'm

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
I then have a summary of the profile I'm

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.020 
I then have a summary of the profile I'm
good<00:03:27.740> to<00:03:27.890> there's<00:03:28.430> an<00:03:28.550> option<00:03:28.850> here<00:03:28.880> for

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
good to there's an option here for

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.580 
good to there's an option here for
advanced<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:29.870> want<00:03:30.050> to<00:03:30.110> have<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.260> look<00:03:30.410> at

advanced to just want to have a look at

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.930 
advanced to just want to have a look at
what<00:03:30.740> that's<00:03:30.950> in<00:03:31.190> there<00:03:36.550> okay<00:03:37.550> so<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:37.790> gives

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
English type which is general speech

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.000 
English type which is general speech
module<00:03:44.050> which<00:03:45.050> you<00:03:45.260> can<00:03:45.440> choose<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.710> whole

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
module which you can choose a whole

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.860 
module which you can choose a whole
bunch<00:03:46.340> different<00:03:46.820> modules<00:03:49.720> interesting<00:03:50.720> it's

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
bunch different modules interesting it's

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.350 
bunch different modules interesting it's
actually<00:03:51.170> pretty<00:03:51.320> extensive<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:53.120> then<00:03:53.240> you

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
actually pretty extensive and then you

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.650 
actually pretty extensive and then you
have<00:03:53.630> vocabulary<00:03:54.530> type<00:03:55.160> so<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.430> have<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:56.060> large

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
have vocabulary type so you have a large

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.870 
have vocabulary type so you have a large
vocabulary<00:03:56.840> or<00:03:57.650> a<00:03:57.800> medium<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:59.510> then<00:04:00.670> this<00:04:01.670> is

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
vocabulary or a medium and then this is

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.080 
vocabulary or a medium and then this is
recommended<00:04:02.240> so<00:04:02.720> I<00:04:03.680> guess<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.460> vocabulary

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
recommended so I guess the vocabulary

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.860 
recommended so I guess the vocabulary
type<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.960> depends<00:04:06.560> on<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:07.610> resources<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.690> your

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
type it depends on the resources of your

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.730 
type it depends on the resources of your
computer<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.090> has<00:04:11.270> two<00:04:11.450> I'm<00:04:11.840> assuming<00:04:12.350> load

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
computer so it has two I'm assuming load

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.180 
computer so it has two I'm assuming load
up<00:04:12.950> more<00:04:13.370> data<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:15.230> be<00:04:15.320> able<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.560> keep<00:04:15.770> track<00:04:15.920> of

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
up more data to be able to keep track of

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.670 
up more data to be able to keep track of
of<00:04:16.400> what<00:04:17.120> you're<00:04:17.299> saying<00:04:17.540> so<00:04:18.200> on<00:04:18.470> this

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
of what you're saying so on this

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.090 
of what you're saying so on this
computer<00:04:19.120> it's<00:04:20.120> suggesting<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:21.049> use<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.650> large

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
computer it's suggesting to use a large

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.010 
computer it's suggesting to use a large
vocabulary<00:04:22.340> type<00:04:23.030> I'm<00:04:23.450> assuming<00:04:23.870> that's

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
vocabulary type I'm assuming that's

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.110 
vocabulary type I'm assuming that's
because<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.530> disk<00:04:24.830> or<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:25.910> hard

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
because of the disk or the the hard

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.180 
because of the disk or the the hard
drive<00:04:26.300> has<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.540> lot<00:04:26.750> more<00:04:26.930> space<00:04:27.230> on<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.620> so<00:04:28.100> I'm

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
drive has a lot more space on it so I'm

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.220 
drive has a lot more space on it so I'm
gonna<00:04:28.340> choose<00:04:28.640> large<00:04:29.090> leave<00:04:29.690> it<00:04:29.810> as<00:04:29.900> default

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
gonna choose large leave it as default

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.470 
gonna choose large leave it as default
basically<00:04:31.040> click<00:04:31.580> on<00:04:31.730> next<00:04:32.120> I'm<00:04:32.270> going<00:04:32.390> to

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
basically click on next I'm going to

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.050 
basically click on next I'm going to
select<00:04:32.660> create<00:04:33.370> it's<00:04:34.370> now<00:04:34.520> that<00:04:34.640> I'm<00:04:34.790> gonna<00:04:34.850> go

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
select create it's now that I'm gonna go

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.390 
select create it's now that I'm gonna go
to<00:04:35.120> it's<00:04:35.600> now<00:04:35.840> going<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.620> create<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.920> profile

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
to it's now going to create a profile

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.150 
to it's now going to create a profile
for<00:04:37.430> me<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:41.570> then<00:04:42.350> it<00:04:42.470> gives<00:04:42.710> me<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:43.010> option

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
for me and then it gives me the option

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.670 
for me and then it gives me the option
of<00:04:43.400> choosing<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:44.000> device<00:04:44.450> so<00:04:45.260> we<00:04:45.380> have<00:04:45.530> the

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
of choosing a device so we have the

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.800 
of choosing a device so we have the
microphone<00:04:46.220> built<00:04:46.670> into<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.120> into<00:04:47.690> the
