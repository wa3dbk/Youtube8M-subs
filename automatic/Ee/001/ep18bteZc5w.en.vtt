00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.770
 on the other side an apparition told me 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.770
 a great warrior a spirit who walk 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:22.789
 will help you in his quest a man gone from 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:25.669
 the other side then back I would have 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:33.020
 favorite someone back but i do not have 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:35.830
 doubted the great spirit very well but if 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.940

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.800
 moussa b 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.010
 imagine a whole continent connected by the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.010
 rail 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.629
 whoever will become master will be master 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.309
 of the future in the face of such power 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.970
 emperors and kings will pass for 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.580
 idiots 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:04.080
 you have a problem with the Indians 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:07.500

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.800
 we do nothing without sacrifice we can 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.610
 avoid war stop this train nothing 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.610

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.850
 represent the law I prefer to be out 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.850
 the law 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.210
 when the iron horse is launched 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.600

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.970
 1 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.600
 we went astray that's what I suspected 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.310
 it could be worse and worse 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.310
