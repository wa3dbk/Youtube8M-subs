00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that five throws a good defense to run

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.730 
that five throws a good defense to run
against<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> team<00:02:05.790> who<00:02:06.329> has<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> strong<00:02:07.290> running

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
against a team who has a strong running

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.089 
against a team who has a strong running
game<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.640> decent<00:02:08.940> passing<00:02:09.599> game<00:02:09.890> it's<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
game and a decent passing game it's a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.470 
game and a decent passing game it's a
it's<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.459> decent<00:02:12.000> defense<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.569> run<00:02:12.780> on

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
it's a decent defense to run on

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.660 
it's a decent defense to run on
team<00:02:13.659> that<00:02:13.900> throws<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.440> ball<00:02:14.590> I'd<00:02:15.040> recommend

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
team that throws the ball I'd recommend

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.190 
team that throws the ball I'd recommend
it<00:02:15.849> in<00:02:16.150> conjunction<00:02:16.450> with<00:02:16.810> some<00:02:17.080> other

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
it in conjunction with some other

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.600 
it in conjunction with some other
defenses<00:02:19.290> for<00:02:20.290> team<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.769> primarily<00:02:21.310> throws

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
defenses for team that primarily throws

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.160 
defenses for team that primarily throws
the<00:02:21.760> ball<00:02:21.909> five<00:02:22.420> throughs<00:02:22.659> not<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.989> best

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
the ball five throughs not the best

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.140 
the ball five throughs not the best
defense<00:02:23.560> but<00:02:24.040> four<00:02:24.340> team<00:02:24.519> that<00:02:24.670> mixes<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.060> up

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
defense but four team that mixes it up

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.530 
defense but four team that mixes it up
it's<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.720> one<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.019> want<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.230> go<00:02:26.349> with
