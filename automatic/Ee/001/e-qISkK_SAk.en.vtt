things to remember the watch comes with
this<00:00:30.779> heart<00:00:31.050> rate<00:00:31.199> monitor<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.859> goes<00:00:32.009> around

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
this heart rate monitor that goes around

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.670 
this heart rate monitor that goes around
your<00:00:32.430> chest<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.570> has<00:00:33.600> two<00:00:33.960> sensors<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.649> the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
push it some also the heart rate monitor

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.889 
push it some also the heart rate monitor
itself<00:01:37.490> i<00:01:37.759> was<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:37.939> little<00:01:38.149> bit<00:01:38.330> worried<00:01:38.630> if<00:01:38.750> it

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
itself i was a little bit worried if it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.210 
itself i was a little bit worried if it
would<00:01:39.020> be<00:01:39.140> really<00:01:39.320> uncomfortable<00:01:39.530> or

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
anything but it's totally fine you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.230 
anything but it's totally fine you
barely<00:01:42.110> notice<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.590> at<00:01:42.740> all<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.179> next

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
barely notice it at all so the next

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.789 
barely notice it at all so the next
thing<00:01:44.450> i<00:01:44.659> want<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:44.869> try<00:01:45.049> out<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.530> stopwatch

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
thing i want to try out is the stopwatch

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.160

it takes me okay so I just go back from
my<00:01:50.780> ride<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.860> watch<00:01:52.039> told<00:01:52.369> me<00:01:52.459> it<00:01:52.580> took<00:01:52.759> me
