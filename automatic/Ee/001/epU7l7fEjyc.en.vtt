hockey it's really opened up everything

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.839 
hockey it's really opened up everything
you<00:00:14.559> know<00:00:14.710> people<00:00:14.980> always<00:00:15.070> ask<00:00:15.400> me<00:00:15.490> one<00:00:15.700> of<00:00:15.730> the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
you know people always ask me one of the

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.070 
you know people always ask me one of the
new<00:00:15.910> generation<00:00:16.029> consoles<00:00:16.630> get<00:00:16.750> us<00:00:16.869> and<00:00:17.020> the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
new generation consoles get us and the

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.510 
new generation consoles get us and the
answer<00:00:17.290> is<00:00:17.320> more<00:00:17.560> we<00:00:17.740> can<00:00:17.890> do<00:00:18.010> more<00:00:18.130> things<00:00:18.189> on

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
answer is more we can do more things on

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.190 
answer is more we can do more things on
the<00:00:18.640> third<00:00:18.760> we<00:00:18.910> can<00:00:19.029> run<00:00:19.390> more<00:00:19.540> math<00:00:19.750> run<00:00:20.080> more

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
the third we can run more math run more

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.810 
the third we can run more math run more
calculations<00:00:20.800> have<00:00:20.950> more<00:00:21.189> physics<00:00:21.669> have

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
calculations have more physics have

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.429 
calculations have more physics have
higher<00:00:21.970> resolution<00:00:22.480> textures<00:00:22.840> have<00:00:23.290> more

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
higher resolution textures have more

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.290 
higher resolution textures have more
animation<00:00:23.919> so<00:00:24.040> with<00:00:24.160> NHL<00:00:24.579> 15<00:00:24.759> we<00:00:25.060> really

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
animation so with NHL 15 we really

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.780 
animation so with NHL 15 we really
changed<00:00:25.630> everything<00:00:26.430> let's<00:00:27.430> break<00:00:27.610> it<00:00:27.759> down

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
gonna flow like it doesn't real-life the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.880 
gonna flow like it doesn't real-life the
ice<00:00:49.000> talk<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.630> about<00:00:49.750> what<00:00:50.230> next-gen<00:00:50.560> means

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
ice talk to about what next-gen means

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.220 
ice talk to about what next-gen means
for<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.220> are<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:52.420> know<00:00:52.540> up<00:00:52.690> here<00:00:52.840> in<00:00:52.930> Canada

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
for that are you know up here in Canada

for that are you know up here in Canada
ice<00:00:53.380> is<00:00:53.500> a<00:00:53.560> big<00:00:53.710> thing<00:00:53.890> obviously<00:00:54.310> for<00:00:54.430> hockey

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
ice is a big thing obviously for hockey

ice is a big thing obviously for hockey
it's<00:00:54.820> a<00:00:54.850> big<00:00:55.000> thing<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.630> loaded<00:00:55.900> with<00:00:55.990> rice

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
it's a big thing and loaded with rice

it's a big thing and loaded with rice
this<00:00:56.350> year<00:00:56.650> you<00:00:57.310> can<00:00:57.430> actually<00:00:57.550> see<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:57.970> depth

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
this year you can actually see the depth

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.730 
this year you can actually see the depth
of<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.390> ice<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.660> paint<00:00:58.900> under<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.380> ice<00:00:59.500> you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
of the ice the paint under the ice you

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.990 
of the ice the paint under the ice you
know<00:00:59.770> entry<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.220> underneath<00:01:00.490> it<00:01:00.700> as<00:01:00.850> you're

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
know entry to underneath it as you're

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.610 
know entry to underneath it as you're
skating<00:01:01.300> along<00:01:01.540> real<00:01:01.840> time<00:01:02.050> carving<00:01:02.380> of<00:01:02.590> the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
skating along real time carving of the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.319 
skating along real time carving of the
ice<00:01:02.800> so<00:01:03.340> if<00:01:03.430> you're<00:01:03.550> controlling<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.059> play<00:01:04.239> in

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
ice so if you're controlling the play in

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:05.760 
ice so if you're controlling the play in
the<00:01:04.390> offensive<00:01:04.689> zone<00:01:04.869> you<00:01:05.170> see<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.379> office<00:01:05.500> is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
the offensive zone you see the office is

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.109 
the offensive zone you see the office is
all<00:01:05.890> scuffed<00:01:06.189> up<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:06.490> your<00:01:06.579> defense<00:01:06.909> is<00:01:07.030> so

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
all scuffed up and your defense is so

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.609 
all scuffed up and your defense is so
nice<00:01:07.329> and<00:01:07.450> clean<00:01:07.689> you<00:01:08.140> think<00:01:08.320> what<00:01:08.470> that's

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
nice and clean you think what that's

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.050 
nice and clean you think what that's
going<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.799> look<00:01:08.859> like<00:01:08.979> for<00:01:09.340> shootouts<00:01:09.729> things

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
going to look like for shootouts things

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.279 
going to look like for shootouts things
like<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.359> where<00:01:10.539> the<00:01:10.600> middle<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.109> strip

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
like that where the middle the to strip

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:12.690 
like that where the middle the to strip
down<00:01:11.319> the<00:01:11.499> middle<00:01:11.619> so<00:01:12.219> really<00:01:12.429> lots<00:01:12.579> of

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
down the middle so really lots of

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.190 
down the middle so really lots of
variety<00:01:12.939> of<00:01:12.999> the<00:01:13.090> ice<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.420> end<00:01:13.569> it<00:01:13.990> was<00:01:14.079> our

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
variety of the ice and end it was our

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.480 
variety of the ice and end it was our
multiplayer<00:01:14.560> collision<00:01:14.920> physics<00:01:15.069> when<00:01:15.460> a

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
multiplayer collision physics when a

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.649 
multiplayer collision physics when a
player<00:01:15.729> gets<00:01:15.759> knocked<00:01:16.090> over<00:01:16.359> on<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.539> ice

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
player gets knocked over on the ice

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.209 
player gets knocked over on the ice
slides<00:01:17.079> along<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.409> ice<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.710> seem<00:01:17.979> clear<00:01:18.189> a

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
slides along the ice you seem clear a

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:19.770 
slides along the ice you seem clear a
path<00:01:18.460> on<00:01:18.640> there<00:01:18.789> so<00:01:18.939> really<00:01:19.149> lots<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.539> working

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
path on there so really lots of working

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.059 
path on there so really lots of working

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
rice just to make it more realistic and

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.010 
rice just to make it more realistic and
really<00:01:21.579> represent<00:01:21.969> with<00:01:22.060> Jen<00:01:22.270> for<00:01:22.450> ice<00:01:22.600> don't

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
really represent with Jen for ice don't

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.169 
really represent with Jen for ice don't
look<00:01:23.079> like<00:01:23.200> for<00:01:23.409> us<00:01:23.490> talk<00:01:24.490> about<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.850> rest<00:01:25.060> of

look like for us talk about the rest of

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:26.429 
look like for us talk about the rest of
the<00:01:25.299> arenas<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.840> how<00:01:25.899> you<00:01:25.960> guys<00:01:26.200> are

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
the arenas and how you guys are

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.830 
the arenas and how you guys are
improving<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.920> actual<00:01:27.249> crowds<00:01:27.549> yeah<00:01:28.539> with

that brings up two other new aspects
that<00:02:05.469> start<00:02:05.950> with<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.189> puck<00:02:06.369> in<00:02:06.579> physics<00:02:07.140> yeah

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
that start with the puck in physics yeah

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.719 
that start with the puck in physics yeah

brand new puck physics overhauled from
the<00:02:09.819> ground<00:02:10.000> up<00:02:10.119> for<00:02:10.300> us<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.569> know<00:02:10.599> we<00:02:10.720> talked

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
the ground up for us you know we talked

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.089 
the ground up for us you know we talked
about<00:02:10.929> changing<00:02:11.410> everything<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.860> leverage

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
about changing everything and leverage

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.140 
about changing everything and leverage
the<00:02:12.220> power<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.520> console<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:12.970> pucks

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
the power of the console the pucks

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.820 
the power of the console the pucks
another<00:02:13.390> area<00:02:13.720> we<00:02:14.440> haven't<00:02:14.620> should<00:02:14.710> have<00:02:14.800> a

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
another area we haven't should have a

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.080 
another area we haven't should have a
guy<00:02:14.980> who<00:02:15.040> worked<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.490> Hadron<00:02:15.790> Collider

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
guy who worked on the Hadron Collider

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.309 
guy who worked on the Hadron Collider
coming<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.570> work<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:16.780> our<00:02:16.870> puck

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
coming it to work on our puck

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.899 
coming it to work on our puck
for<00:02:17.469> us<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.129> really<00:02:18.280> what<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.489> does<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.700> it

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
for us and really what that does is it

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.009 
for us and really what that does is it
really<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.120> replicates<00:02:19.599> what<00:02:19.659> would<00:02:19.810> happen

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
really just replicates what would happen

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.479 
really just replicates what would happen
the<00:02:20.109> real<00:02:20.230> world<00:02:20.469> with<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.859> modeling

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the real world with the modeling

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.250 
the real world with the modeling
the<00:02:21.609> pump<00:02:21.819> properly<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:22.480> getting<00:02:22.930> these<00:02:23.019> you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
the pump properly and getting these you

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.920 
the pump properly and getting these you
know<00:02:23.379> awesome<00:02:24.159> balances<00:02:24.549> based<00:02:24.760> on<00:02:24.939> modeling

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
know awesome balances based on modeling

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.300 
know awesome balances based on modeling
the<00:02:26.139> players<00:02:26.409> and<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.769> equipment<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.249> the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the players and the equipment and the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.679 
the players and the equipment and the
jersey<00:02:27.489> so<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.879> puck<00:02:28.060> hitting<00:02:28.269> those<00:02:28.420> players

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
jersey so the puck hitting those players

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:29.789 
jersey so the puck hitting those players
and<00:02:28.900> we're<00:02:28.989> seeing<00:02:29.200> goals<00:02:29.379> right<00:02:29.560> now<00:02:29.680> that

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
and we're seeing goals right now that

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.229 
and we're seeing goals right now that
we've<00:02:29.889> never<00:02:30.040> seen<00:02:30.340> before<00:02:30.400> because<00:02:30.790> the

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
we've never seen before because the

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.819 
we've never seen before because the
is<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.810> know<00:02:31.900> squeaking<00:02:32.290> through<00:02:32.409> areas<00:02:32.739> has

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
is you know squeaking through areas has

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:33.750 
is you know squeaking through areas has
never<00:02:32.980> been<00:02:33.099> able<00:02:33.189> to<00:02:33.340> squeak<00:02:33.489> through<00:02:33.609> before

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
never been able to squeak through before

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.250 
never been able to squeak through before
because<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.150> puck<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.629> bottled<00:02:34.900> correctly<00:02:35.200> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
because the puck is bottled correctly it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.929 
because the puck is bottled correctly it
has<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.500> proper<00:02:35.739> physics<00:02:36.040> on<00:02:36.159> it<00:02:36.280> and

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
has the proper physics on it and

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.490 
has the proper physics on it and
speaking<00:02:37.329> of<00:02:37.420> physics<00:02:37.810> talk<00:02:38.079> a<00:02:38.109> little<00:02:38.349> about

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
speaking of physics talk a little about

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.069 
speaking of physics talk a little about
having<00:02:39.129> 12<00:02:39.459> men<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:39.760> ice<00:02:40.060> now<00:02:40.090> with<00:02:40.719> complete

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
having 12 men on ice now with complete

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.140 
having 12 men on ice now with complete
physics<00:02:41.469> yeah<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.340> know<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.700> physics<00:02:42.969> for<00:02:43.090> us

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
physics yeah you know the physics for us

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.699 
physics yeah you know the physics for us
at<00:02:43.329> any<00:02:43.450> shell<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:44.079> know<00:02:44.169> previous<00:02:44.500> versions

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
at any shell you know previous versions

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.649 
at any shell you know previous versions
of<00:02:44.739> any<00:02:44.889> challenge<00:02:45.250> entry<00:02:45.569> physical<00:02:46.569> is<00:02:46.629> a

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
of any challenge entry physical is a

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.059 
of any challenge entry physical is a
great<00:02:46.810> story<00:02:47.049> for<00:02:47.139> us<00:02:47.290> one<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.650> first<00:02:47.859> team

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
great story for us one of the first team

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.559 
great story for us one of the first team
sports<00:02:48.280> actually<00:02:48.639> have<00:02:48.790> physics<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.389> game

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
sports actually have physics in the game

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.990 
sports actually have physics in the game
and<00:02:50.500> moving<00:02:50.799> forward<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:51.189> Jen<00:02:51.459> for<00:02:51.669> for<00:02:51.909> us

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
and moving forward to Jen for for us

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.159 
and moving forward to Jen for for us
we're<00:02:52.120> going<00:02:52.239> from<00:02:52.329> two<00:02:52.510> players<00:02:52.750> being<00:02:52.959> able

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
we're going from two players being able

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.080 
we're going from two players being able
to<00:02:53.680> be<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:53.859> physics<00:02:54.159> any<00:02:54.280> one<00:02:54.430> time<00:02:54.579> to<00:02:54.760> all<00:02:54.879> 12

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
to be in physics any one time to all 12

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.819 
to be in physics any one time to all 12
players<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:55.780> what<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.319> means<00:02:56.620> is<00:02:56.709> the

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
players so what that means is the

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.020 
players so what that means is the
incredible<00:02:57.099> moments<00:02:57.669> where<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.849> can<00:02:57.939> have

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
incredible moments where you can have

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.729 
incredible moments where you can have
polyps<00:02:58.389> in<00:02:58.510> front<00:02:58.719> of<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.840> Nets<00:02:58.959> guys<00:02:59.169> driving

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
people be in physics any one time we

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.369 
people be in physics any one time we
could<00:03:10.389> have<00:03:10.540> those<00:03:10.689> situations<00:03:11.139> play<00:03:11.290> on

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
could have those situations play on

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.050 
could have those situations play on
their<00:03:11.469> game<00:03:11.620> we've<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.549> talked<00:03:12.699> about<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.909> lot

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
their game we've just talked about a lot

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.119 
their game we've just talked about a lot
of<00:03:13.120> really<00:03:13.449> complex<00:03:13.780> sounding<00:03:14.199> things<00:03:14.439> how

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
of really complex sounding things how

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.189 
of really complex sounding things how
simple<00:03:15.519> is<00:03:15.819> the<00:03:16.060> actual<00:03:16.299> gameplay<00:03:16.540> experience

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:17.199 
simple is the actual gameplay experience

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.289 
simple is the actual gameplay experience
yeah<00:03:17.980> gameplay<00:03:18.370> for<00:03:18.549> us<00:03:18.669> you<00:03:18.879> know<00:03:18.909> is<00:03:19.030> always

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
yeah gameplay for us you know is always

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.789 
yeah gameplay for us you know is always
king<00:03:19.540> it's<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.810> core<00:03:20.079> focus<00:03:20.260> works<00:03:20.590> every

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
king it's a core focus works every

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.229 
king it's a core focus works every
single<00:03:20.859> year<00:03:21.129> without<00:03:21.280> breaking<00:03:22.000> play<00:03:22.180> you

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
single year without breaking play you

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.969 
single year without breaking play you
don't<00:03:22.449> have<00:03:22.599> a<00:03:22.629> great<00:03:22.870> game<00:03:23.049> this<00:03:23.919> year

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:23.979 
don't have a great game this year

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:25.559 
don't have a great game this year
overhauling<00:03:24.729> you<00:03:25.000> know<00:03:25.090> almost<00:03:25.269> all<00:03:25.449> the

overhauling you know almost all the

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.939 
overhauling you know almost all the
animations<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.169> game<00:03:26.349> the<00:03:26.650> probably

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
animations of the game the probably

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.289 
animations of the game the probably
consoles<00:03:27.340> looking<00:03:27.489> at<00:03:27.609> you<00:03:27.819> know<00:03:27.879> almost<00:03:28.150> as

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
consoles looking at you know almost as

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.420 
consoles looking at you know almost as
much<00:03:28.419> animations<00:03:28.959> we<00:03:29.049> want<00:03:29.259> to<00:03:29.409> our<00:03:29.979> new<00:03:30.129> skill

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
much animations we want to our new skill

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.069 
much animations we want to our new skill
stick<00:03:30.639> and<00:03:30.790> revamping<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.299> skill<00:03:31.540> stick<00:03:31.780> and

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
stick and revamping the skill stick and

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.539 
stick and revamping the skill stick and
all<00:03:32.259> the<00:03:32.379> animations<00:03:32.620> within<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.129> really<00:03:33.459> gave

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
all the animations within it really gave

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.999 
all the animations within it really gave
me<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:33.669> users<00:03:33.970> more<00:03:34.239> control<00:03:34.569> more<00:03:34.599> tools<00:03:35.009> and

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:36.009 
me the users more control more tools and

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:37.439 
me the users more control more tools and
really<00:03:36.310> focus<00:03:36.609> on<00:03:36.669> the<00:03:36.729> accessibility<00:03:37.269> piece

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
really focus on the accessibility piece

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.789 
really focus on the accessibility piece
again<00:03:37.599> so<00:03:37.989> Larry<00:03:38.229> just<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.500> left<00:03:38.680> stick

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
again so Larry just the left stick

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.740 
again so Larry just the left stick
