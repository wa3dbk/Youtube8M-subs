way to make the fan quieter was to use a

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.709 
way to make the fan quieter was to use a
larger<00:00:33.489> fan<00:00:33.760> so<00:00:34.360> what<00:00:34.480> I've<00:00:34.570> got<00:00:34.690> planned

with and here's a tip for you run the
bit<00:01:55.590> backwards<00:01:56.590> on<00:01:56.919> this<00:01:56.979> plastic<00:01:57.819> the<00:01:58.689> teeth

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
bit backwards on this plastic the teeth

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.569 
bit backwards on this plastic the teeth
are<00:01:59.020> too<00:01:59.259> aggressive<00:01:59.739> on<00:01:59.829> the<00:01:59.889> plastic<00:02:00.369> and

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
are too aggressive on the plastic and

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.339 
are too aggressive on the plastic and
it's<00:02:00.729> going<00:02:00.969> to<00:02:01.029> bite<00:02:01.419> in<00:02:01.630> there<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.049> buck<00:02:02.319> and

it's going to bite in there and buck and
fight<00:02:02.739> you<00:02:02.950> running<00:02:03.549> backwards<00:02:03.579> it<00:02:04.179> actually

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
fight you running backwards it actually

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.430 
fight you running backwards it actually
goes<00:02:04.779> smoother<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.590> faster<00:02:06.069> so<00:02:07.060> now<00:02:07.989> the<00:02:08.050> plan

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
goes smoother and faster so now the plan

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.499 
goes smoother and faster so now the plan
I've<00:02:08.920> wrapped<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.910> little<00:02:10.149> bit<00:02:10.239> of<00:02:10.330> packing

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
I've wrapped a little bit of packing

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.770 
I've wrapped a little bit of packing
tape<00:02:10.869> our<00:02:11.290> packing<00:02:11.740> foam<00:02:12.010> around<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.610> fan<00:02:12.850> so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
tape our packing foam around the fan so

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.430 
tape our packing foam around the fan so
i'll<00:02:13.900> drop<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.200> wire<00:02:14.530> through

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
i'll drop the wire through

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.740 
i'll drop the wire through
insert<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.550> fan<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:17.030> there<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.510> makes<00:02:17.660> a

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
insert the fan in there and it makes a

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.990 
insert the fan in there and it makes a
nice<00:02:17.900> tight<00:02:18.800> enough<00:02:19.070> fit<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.550> it's<00:02:19.700> going<00:02:19.940> to

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
nice tight enough fit that it's going to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.260 
nice tight enough fit that it's going to
be<00:02:21.460> channel<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.550> air<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.880> right<00:02:23.030> place

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
be channel the air in the right place

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.150 
be channel the air in the right place
and<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.930> should<00:02:24.080> provide<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.410> little<00:02:24.680> vibration

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
and it should provide a little vibration

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.540 
and it should provide a little vibration
dampening<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.930> lid<00:02:27.140> goes<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.370> whole

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
dampening the lid goes on and the whole

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.320 
dampening the lid goes on and the whole
unit<00:02:29.210> will<00:02:29.360> plug<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.140> mount<00:02:30.800> over<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
unit will plug in and mount over the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.970 
unit will plug in and mount over the
existing<00:02:32.720> pipe<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.440> pokes<00:02:33.680> through<00:02:33.770> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
existing pipe that pokes through the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.730 
existing pipe that pokes through the
back<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.510> bottom<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.720> floor<00:02:35.900> there's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
back of the bottom of the floor there's

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.880 
back of the bottom of the floor there's
a<00:02:36.800> couple<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.100> tabs<00:02:37.310> for<00:02:37.520> screwing<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.940> on<00:02:38.090> so

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
a couple of tabs for screwing it on so

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.290 
a couple of tabs for screwing it on so
I'm<00:02:39.890> going<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.130> install<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.820> then<00:02:41.210> we'll

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
I'm going to install it and then we'll

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.870 
I'm going to install it and then we'll
see<00:02:41.480> how<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.630> works<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:43.160> here's<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.610> finished

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
see how it works so here's the finished

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.280 
see how it works so here's the finished
and<00:02:44.690> mount<00:02:45.260> installed<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:47.180> clean<00:02:48.310> quiet<00:02:49.310> and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
and mount installed it's clean quiet and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.230 
and mount installed it's clean quiet and
securely<00:02:51.290> fashioned<00:02:51.770> under<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.130> house<00:02:52.310> where

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
securely fashioned under the house where

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.110 
securely fashioned under the house where
the<00:02:53.390> noise<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.920> discharge<00:02:54.920> will<00:02:55.190> not<00:02:55.940> be

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
the noise and discharge will not be

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.640 
the noise and discharge will not be
noticeable<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:59.330> new<00:02:59.480> fan<00:02:59.810> box<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.380> much

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
noticeable the new fan box is much

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.100 
noticeable the new fan box is much
quieter<00:03:00.920> than<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.400> first<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:02.570> get<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.750> tip

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
quieter than the first and get a tip

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.470 
quieter than the first and get a tip
from<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.410> reader<00:03:03.620> suggested<00:03:04.610> that<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.820> larger

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
from a reader suggested that a larger

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.080 
from a reader suggested that a larger
diameter<00:03:06.020> fan<00:03:06.290> moving<00:03:07.070> at<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.310> slower<00:03:07.550> rpm

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
diameter fan moving at a slower rpm

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.080 
diameter fan moving at a slower rpm
would<00:03:08.660> be<00:03:08.810> quiet<00:03:09.140> quieter<00:03:09.770> by<00:03:09.950> nature<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.850> he

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
would be quiet quieter by nature and he

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.300 
would be quiet quieter by nature and he
was<00:03:11.210> right<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:11.960> band<00:03:12.230> isn't<00:03:12.530> much<00:03:12.800> quieter

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
was right this band isn't much quieter

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.690 
was right this band isn't much quieter
so<00:03:14.060> if<00:03:14.180> you'll<00:03:14.330> excuse<00:03:14.690> me<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:15.550> have<00:03:16.550> some

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700
