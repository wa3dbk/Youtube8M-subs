00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
simple survival crossbow first we sawed

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.970 
simple survival crossbow first we sawed
off<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.669> piece<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.660> about<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.200> long<00:00:34.500> as<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
off a piece that's about as long as the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.549 
off a piece that's about as long as the
arm<00:00:35.309> span<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.840> course<00:00:37.079> there<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.410> be<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
arm span and of course there will be a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.950 
arm span and of course there will be a
smaller<00:00:38.040> piece<00:00:38.340> left<00:00:38.550> over<00:00:38.730> we'll<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.690> some

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
smaller piece left over we'll have some

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.250 
smaller piece left over we'll have some
good<00:00:40.140> use<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.829> too<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.750> are

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
good use for that too and now we are

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.850 
good use for that too and now we are
cutting<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:44.420> some<00:00:45.420> parts<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> shooting

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
cutting out some parts for the shooting

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.490 
cutting out some parts for the shooting
levers<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:48.660> will<00:00:48.809> later<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.050> see<00:00:49.200> how

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
levers and you will later on see how

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:59.590 
levers and you will later on see how
that<00:00:49.920> works

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.120 

okay<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.990> how<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.290> now<00:01:01.410> looks<00:01:01.650> like<00:01:01.740> and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
okay this is how it now looks like and

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.420 
okay this is how it now looks like and
this<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.210> will<00:01:03.510> later<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:04.080> our<00:01:05.010> little

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this here will later on be our little

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.820 
this here will later on be our little
trigger<00:01:05.670> device<00:01:06.110> because<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.620> don't

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
trigger device because if you don't

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.490 
trigger device because if you don't
press<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.250> trigger<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.360> lift<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:10.290> ball

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
press the trigger it will lift the ball

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.290 
press the trigger it will lift the ball
and<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.220> pouch<00:01:11.400> upwards<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:15.030> now

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
and the pouch upwards like this and now

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.120 
and the pouch upwards like this and now
are<00:01:15.480> we<00:01:15.630> making<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> bit<00:01:16.380> thinner<00:01:16.650> because

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
are we making this a bit thinner because

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.510 
are we making this a bit thinner because
it's<00:01:17.340> too<00:01:17.550> big<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.000> Polly<00:01:18.270> too<00:01:18.750> heavy<00:01:18.960> our

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.340 

next<00:01:26.520> step<00:01:26.730> is<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:26.970> make<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.480> joint<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.230> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
next step is to make the joint for the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.470 
next step is to make the joint for the
trigger<00:01:28.620> so<00:01:29.370> that<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.640> trigger<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.150> actually

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
trigger so that the trigger can actually

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:46.969 
trigger so that the trigger can actually
move<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.960> down<00:01:45.320> okay<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.500> works<00:01:46.710> quite

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
move up and down okay this works quite

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.810 
move up and down okay this works quite
good<00:01:48.140> at<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.350> nice<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.550> tight

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.260 

now<00:01:53.820> we'll<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.330> round<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.990> sit<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:56.270> this

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
now we'll have to round and sit out this

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:07.010 
now we'll have to round and sit out this
whole<00:01:58.140> back<00:01:58.380> piece<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:59.010> bit<00:02:05.840> okay<00:02:06.840> this

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
whole back piece a little bit okay this

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.070 
whole back piece a little bit okay this
is<00:02:07.170> nice<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.560> functional<00:02:08.570> note<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.869> also

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
is nice and functional note that I also

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.450 
is nice and functional note that I also
carved<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.460> little<00:02:12.120> notch<00:02:12.390> here<00:02:13.220> for<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
carved in a little notch here for the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.270 
carved in a little notch here for the
steel<00:02:14.700> ball<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.120> sit<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.860> put<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.160> in

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
steel ball to sit in so I can put it in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280 
steel ball to sit in so I can put it in
it<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.550> automatically<00:02:18.120> comes<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.540> rest<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
it it automatically comes to rest and

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.350 
it it automatically comes to rest and
later<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.650> when<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:19.920> press<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.460> trigger<00:02:21.380> fine

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
later on when I press the trigger fine

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.360 
later on when I press the trigger fine
as<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.600> see<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> rounded<00:02:25.320> everything<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.860> bit<00:02:26.040> so

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
as you see I rounded everything a bit so

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.700 
as you see I rounded everything a bit so
that<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.850> really<00:02:27.240> comfortable<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.500> pull

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
that it is really comfortable to pull

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.580 
that it is really comfortable to pull
the<00:02:28.860> trigger<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.630> now<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:30.870> time<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.140> solve

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the trigger and now it's time to solve

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.580 
the trigger and now it's time to solve
out<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.980> fork<00:02:32.250> with<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.240> included<00:02:33.780> foot

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
out the fork with the included foot

00:02:34.590 --> 00:03:06.210 
out the fork with the included foot
pedal

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.420 

now<00:03:07.000> we<00:03:07.060> are<00:03:07.330> attaching<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:08.200> band's<00:03:08.440> note

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
now we are attaching the band's note

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.640 
now we are attaching the band's note
that<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.000> pouch<00:03:10.240> is<00:03:10.480> really<00:03:10.780> small<00:03:10.990> it's<00:03:11.440> just

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
that the pouch is really small it's just

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:37.930 
that the pouch is really small it's just
large<00:03:11.950> enough<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.550> cover<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:14.200> not<00:03:14.410> sure

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.540 

ready<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.780> here<00:03:40.290> now<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.560> can<00:03:40.800> see<00:03:40.980> how<00:03:41.160> you

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
ready in here now you can see how you

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.730 
ready in here now you can see how you
aim<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.510> take<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.780> tip<00:03:42.990> off<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.140> forks<00:03:43.560> and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
aim you take the tip off the forks and

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.680 
aim you take the tip off the forks and
then<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.220> align<00:03:44.580> them<00:03:44.850> with<00:03:44.880> markers<00:03:45.510> that

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
then you align them with markers that
