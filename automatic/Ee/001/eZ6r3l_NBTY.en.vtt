so i'll go for a man i will be making a

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.080 
so i'll go for a man i will be making a
multi<00:01:09.909> code<00:01:10.150> minute<00:01:10.600> ash<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.280> hopefully<00:01:12.580> in

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
multi code minute ash so hopefully in

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.270 
multi code minute ash so hopefully in
the<00:01:13.150> next<00:01:13.360> few<00:01:13.570> weeks<00:01:13.780> when<00:01:14.170> PS<00:01:14.680> ends<00:01:14.890> back<00:01:15.100> up

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
the next few weeks when PS ends back up

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.320 
the next few weeks when PS ends back up
and<00:01:16.050> if<00:01:17.050> this<00:01:17.890> geometry<00:01:18.340> is<00:01:18.640> all<00:01:18.730> right<00:01:18.880> then<00:01:19.120> I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
and if this geometry is all right then I

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.060 
and if this geometry is all right then I
guess<00:01:19.480> we<00:01:19.810> do<00:01:19.930> some<00:01:20.110> more<00:01:20.230> of<00:01:20.350> these<00:01:20.470> right

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
guess we do some more of these right

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.980 
guess we do some more of these right
yeah<00:01:21.580> leave<00:01:21.820> a<00:01:21.850> like<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.180> give<00:01:22.780> us<00:01:22.870> some

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
yeah leave a like and give us some

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.520 
yeah leave a like and give us some
feedback<00:01:23.020> on<00:01:23.380> that<00:01:23.970> mm-hmm<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.780> what<00:01:26.410> about
