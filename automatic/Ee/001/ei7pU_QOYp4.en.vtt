it's<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.940> herbivore<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.690> its<00:00:18.810> temperament<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
it's a herbivore and its temperament is

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.250 
it's a herbivore and its temperament is
loyal<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.699> i'm<00:00:20.910> guessing<00:00:21.090> loyal<00:00:21.660> means<00:00:22.020> it's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
loyal so i'm guessing loyal means it's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.080 
loyal so i'm guessing loyal means it's
more<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.769> companion<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.490> well<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:23.910> more

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
more of a companion as well it's more

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.929 
more of a companion as well it's more
like<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.300> dog<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.410> prehistoric<00:00:25.680> doggish<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
like a dog it's prehistoric doggish it

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.390 
like a dog it's prehistoric doggish it
doesn't<00:00:27.240> look<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.570> dog<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.050> much<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:29.039> I

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
doesn't look like a dog that much but I

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.820 
doesn't look like a dog that much but I
think<00:00:29.820> that's<00:00:29.970> what<00:00:30.119> they<00:00:30.240> want<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.619> say<00:00:31.619> with

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
chain and eat small bland life the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310

poisonous<00:00:47.789> insects<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> island<00:00:48.809> seem<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
poisonous insects of the island seem to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.220 
poisonous insects of the island seem to
have<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.770> effect<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.550> tres<00:00:50.820> horas<00:00:51.230> ok

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
have little effect on this tres horas ok

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
have little effect on this tres horas ok
so<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.770> thing<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.100> not<00:00:53.370> really<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> be

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120

which<00:01:17.670> makes<00:01:17.939> rendering<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.659> list<00:01:18.869> resource

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
which makes rendering a list resource

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.690 
which makes rendering a list resource
unconscious<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.189> rather<00:01:20.490> difficult<00:01:20.970> affair

a herbivore that regenerates health fast
I<00:01:27.299> don't<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:27.570> there's<00:01:27.869> any<00:01:28.140> herbivore<00:01:28.860> yet

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
I don't think there's any herbivore yet

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.039 
I don't think there's any herbivore yet
in<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> game<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.460> does<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.299> don't

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
in the game that does that I don't

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.230 
in the game that does that I don't
really<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.189> fighting<00:01:32.729> dinosaur

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
really see this as a fighting dinosaur

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780 
really see this as a fighting dinosaur
that<00:01:33.390> since<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.720> not<00:01:33.960> too<00:01:34.170> big<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:35.250> won't<00:01:35.610> be

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that since it's not too big you won't be

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.990 
that since it's not too big you won't be
writing<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.400> probably<00:01:38.400> there's<00:01:38.820> gonna

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
writing this so probably there's gonna

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.819 
writing this so probably there's gonna
be<00:01:39.180> something<00:01:39.450> about<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
be something about that in the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.230 
be something about that in the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
functionality of this thing is but it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.600 
functionality of this thing is but it
looks<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.970> cool<00:01:45.270> actually<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.170> I

looks really cool actually it's like I

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.670 
looks really cool actually it's like I
know<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.329> looks<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.990> honest<00:01:49.320> has

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
commands and the front but it looks like

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.789 
commands and the front but it looks like
like<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.610> lizard<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.630> more<00:01:58.140> heavy<00:01:58.469> it

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
leveling some dinosaurs when you just

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.250 
leveling some dinosaurs when you just
tamed<00:03:06.160> them<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.390> hope<00:03:07.660> one<00:03:07.870> thing<00:03:08.110> and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
tamed them and I just hope one thing and

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.810 
tamed them and I just hope one thing and
this<00:03:08.320> is<00:03:08.500> going<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.739> be<00:03:08.860> able<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.400> keep<00:03:09.580> up

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
this is going to be able to keep up

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.910 
this is going to be able to keep up
because<00:03:10.270> it<00:03:10.570> doesn't<00:03:10.959> look<00:03:11.140> like<00:03:11.200> it's<00:03:11.680> got

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
because it doesn't look like it's got

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.680 
because it doesn't look like it's got
that<00:03:12.160> much<00:03:12.340> speed<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.150> think<00:03:13.540> they're

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
that much speed but I think they're

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.540 
that much speed but I think they're
going<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.870> surprise<00:03:14.050> us<00:03:14.470> with<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:15.190> speed<00:03:15.430> on

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
going to surprise us with the speed on

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
going to surprise us with the speed on
this<00:03:15.700> thing<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:16.000> hope<00:03:16.120> it's<00:03:16.270> going<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.480> be

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
this thing I hope it's going to be

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.720 
this thing I hope it's going to be
something<00:03:17.500> decent<00:03:17.830> something<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.459> really

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
something decent something that really

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.199 
something decent something that really
keeps<00:03:19.420> pace<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:21.340> course<00:03:21.580> I<00:03:21.700> already<00:03:21.850> said

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
keeps pace and of course I already said

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.699 
keeps pace and of course I already said
they're<00:03:22.390> not<00:03:22.420> going<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.720> be<00:03:22.840> writable<00:03:23.200> but

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
they're not going to be writable but

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.560 
they're not going to be writable but
they're<00:03:23.890> going<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.070> be<00:03:24.160> fast<00:03:24.519> learners<00:03:25.090> fast

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
they're going to be fast learners fast
