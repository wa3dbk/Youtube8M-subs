00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello girls guys welcome one day 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.460
 more and today I bring you a new video of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.709
 makeup is a request that I 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.719
 they did a long time ago they left me 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.850
 comment in which they made a 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.550
 makeup tutorial with a delineated 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.800
 very marked in which was let's say the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.080
 highlight of makeup 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.329
 and good as you can see is a makeup 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.769
 quite daring because good I know that 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.399
 not everyone dares with this guy 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.399
 of outlined as you see is a delineated 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.909
 quite marked very very very striking 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.210
 because I've done quite a bit for 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:44.730
 give it a touch although it is a very eye 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.339
 subtle as to what is shadow like that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.110
 that I have taken a wee bit of glitter not 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.839
 often appreciate 'aces' here in what is 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.670
 the mobile eyelid and I have marked what is 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.960
 the eye socket to give a touch of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.989
 depth 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.079
 so if you like it and want to know how 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.090
 I've done it because I was still there because we're going 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.260
 to start first I'm going to apply the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.770
 test will be mix in skin tone 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.790
 all over the mobile eyelid and the arch 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.810
 of the eyebrow 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.270
 then I will apply a very natural tone 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.480
 a skin tone actually this of the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.620
 naked paddle I'm going to apply for everything 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.620
 the mobile eyelid 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.340
 and I'm going to go up to the arch of the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.190
 eyebrow is to say for everything for all the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.250
 eyelid 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.000
 then I'm going to apply this shadow as 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.190
 in art deco cream has a tad of 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.930
 glitter for a touch if you do not want 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.790
 litter what you could do is apply 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.130
 a neutral shadow like I applied 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.810
 directly I will go through the outline 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.600
 I'm going to give a touch of glitter or because 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.030
 I love the glitter and then a little bit 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.860
 of depth in the eye socket like this 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.850
 I'm going to apply it to touches 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.630
 on the entire mobile eyelid although it carries 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.450
 glitter is a tone we say very natural 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.789
 that there is not left either how it can be another 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.900
 glitter what I loose that much remains 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.400
 more prominent this being a cream what 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.450
 it has a few small flashes 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.640
 but that is not at all flashy and 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.800
 now with my favorite palette I make a 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 lot of makeups with them with 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.510
 these shadows I will deepen a tad 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.510
 in the eye socket 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.380
 I will not mark it much because once 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.990
 I do the outlined then I'm going to 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.570
 retouch only a tad faded 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.090
 now it comes to the most complicated part 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.460
 which is the delineated you have several 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.470
 ways to do the outline and you can 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.260
 do with pencil what could also be done 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.939
 with one with a gel 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.099
 what works pretty well and I 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.569
 I think it's the simplest and then with 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.640
 the eyeliner that is the one I'm going with 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.680
 to do I will give a little trick that 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.000
 it is sure that it is there we go that he has 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.360
 seen a lot so that in videos of 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.230
 youtube and it's directly start 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.170
 draw the line 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.230
 radio lower tabs the layouts 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.569
 and you are going to try to unite with what is 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.650
 the peak of the end of the eyebrows 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.650
 in that direction 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.930
 Oh 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.980
 It is so awful that of tried but 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.750
 good is for you to know in what 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.870
 address you have to do the outlined 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.830
 because it's very common and it's one of the me 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.570
 I think it's the failures that are most 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.330
 they commit with is not higher than another 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.820
 then to avoid that always throw 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.430
 towards what is the tip of the end of 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.490
 the eyebrow begins to trace little by little 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.650
 delineated 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:57.640
 and what I 'm going to do is join the point 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.640
 outlined that I have drawn 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.760
 Now we come back with the pencil and we join 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.030
 the inner corner of the eye with the 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.180
 lower delineation 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.180
 and we have already drawn the water line 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.000
 here the moment that good civic has 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.060
 been a tad longer one than another 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.800
 Well, simply with the video, then 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.980
 applies the concealer will come out very 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.510
 well we would have already drawn the outline 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.640
 superior and inferior and now what I'm going to 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.100
 do with a black shadow that also 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.120
 is in this same palette and a brush 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.030
 beveled 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.030
 I'm going to apply a little shadow 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.490
 over 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.849
 above the lower eyeliner 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.309
 and this is going to make the pencil 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.550
 we can hold on more and well, I do not know 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:02.370
 drain 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.940
 good to be as more fixed time we go 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.350
 with the mascara 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.430
 and the ideal would be to put false eyelash 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.320
 but 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.320
 I do not have them so I'm going to work it 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.889
 because this type of makeup 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.870
 requires a 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.560
 I will return with the same shadow that 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.699
 I used in the eye socket and I'm going to 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.699
 mark it a tad more 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.430
 As you can see, I have not used any shadow 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.169
 to illuminate the arch of the eyebrow because 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.750
 What I want to emphasize is the eyeliner 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:43.050
 and give the touch of light to the mobile eyelid 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.719
 sightly with glitter now with 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.390
 the corrector we finished already to correct 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:51.120
 forgive the redundancy 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:55.160
 the possible errors that we have been able to 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.160
 have with the delineated 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:03.360
 we apply the rouge I have chosen one 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.360
 darkish that 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.370
 and finally a touch of illuminator 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:24.860
 and good in the mouth I used 3 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.360
 lipsticks good this first 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.139
 orange 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.139
 from kiko 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.360
 tone 79 then used this other one 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.360
 essence 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.729
 I think to bring more brightness than 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.729
 tone 35 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.340
 this union with reality of your face 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:56.949
 it's cruel pop this would be the result 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:00.889
 end as you see an eye is pretty 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:03.199
 marked very striking if you fancy 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.509
 You can also use a mouth too 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:07.250
 marked that leads to each one's taste 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:10.099
 there are people who like eye all mouth 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:13.729
 all mouth all day or day mouth 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:15.530
 nothing etc. gives every taste of each 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.539
 one as I said and well I have 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:22.210
 been by a mouth more user more 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:25.690
 subtle and the eye more here 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:28.240
 for nothing so I hope you have 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.550
 I remind you how good you can 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.789
 go through my blog because I'm going to leave 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:36.130
 the post of makeup is look at a 

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:38.560
 I also tend to follow the 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.240
 social networks twitter facebook e 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.500
 instagram all the links I'm going to 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.050
 leave it down here in the little box 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.750
 information and nothing that that I hope 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.630
 that you liked it is worth and I send you a 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.450
 Little kiss
