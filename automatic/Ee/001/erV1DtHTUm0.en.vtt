00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:23.820
 Something is also going on people here and me 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.990
 today with a relatively short video 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.000
 i just want to visit this place 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.680
 again something to clarify what in mine 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.369
 eyes had always been clear 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.059
 but apparently there is this topic 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.760
 pent-up demand there again and again 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.660
 the same questions get on instagram 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.809
 and among the youtube videos and that 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:47.429
 Vizier travel before or after cooking 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.850
 actually a very very banal one 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.350
 but she definitely has his 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.769
 authority for what I've noticed 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.379
 I am as you know mine 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.739
 fitness follows a flexible riding 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.170
 advocates so I work for four 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.530
 years with epo mikros with the principles 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.770
 I'm talking about flexible reining 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.540
 me my plan every day myself steve in 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.800
 In this regard , no plan at all 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.250
 That's what I mean, too 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.750
 in the limbic teach so if you 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.370
 you really are interested in how 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.960
 That's how you do yours 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.510
 your own plan can be done just like you 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.550
 Cares how to do the whole in detail 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.440
 then it definitely suits you 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.880
 a pure person and for all those who 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.770
 now just a few boards drill the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.960
 you are already sure about the topic 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.540
 as I said the topic print volumes and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.370
 so if you wet now 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.920
 Now a pack of rice buys such a 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.810
 pack never done before 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.880
 Half a kilo of rice is dry 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.580
 So I bought that in dry 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.470
 amount and that's why you stand here too 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.630
 always print the added value amount there 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.180
 you understand when you buy a pack 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 with dry rice trainers will be there 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.740
 never any other nutrition 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.320
 stand as those of the front of the bag 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.789
 content also shows there are yes 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.239
 for example , this before cooked rice 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.519
 from uncle dance and that is 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.379
 logically with other macros 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.819
 labeled because that's already water 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.690
 that's the name of this trip 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.060
 circle cooked and logically 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.740
 100 grams no longer the usual 80 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.570
 gram basket but maybe even 20 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.460
 or 30, I honestly do not know 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.830
 I have never been there in my whole life 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.350
 Life like cooking rice bought 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.960
 but to say here now at this 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.740
 basmati therefore always very clear on it 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.600
 and I've heard people like that then 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.390
 he said yes there you have seen 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.520
 the ice there has less corps 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.770
 of there then I told him peep 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.540
 already cooked rice exactly the same 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.900
 is for example also with tchibo and the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.930
 case 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.670
 so if you are dry fresh in 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.560
 quotes kidney beans buys 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.080
 and logically they have a lot too 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.200
 much more cups in it like much more protein 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.240
 in it as such from the dose the first 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.580
 can already be cooked and 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.040
 carry water with it 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.620
 means first of all, I'll say it now 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.160
 so if you have bock on instagram 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.700
 to show a photo or show first 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.670
 but what you request then post 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.290
 purely usual purely usual, there is really 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.630
 getting the amount of drug to box is as 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.820
 if I cook 200 grams then rice 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.110
 he is usually so 500 grams heavy 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.700
 I always get that double the amount 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.860
 only know twice the amount of water 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.900
 Add 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.239
 By the way, nobody wears me 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.010
 Patrick, for example, the film always 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.780
 too much pure water and must the 1 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.750
 because I always pour it down 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.430
 personally not so optimal and looks 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.100
 always take the same amount of water 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.980
 to rises it is always so on 600 grams 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.110
 I'm always doing that to me 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.030
 13 to 15 liters of water purely he would 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.420
 really perfect so a little tip of 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.920
 me 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.019
 and that is what I am called myself 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.670
 really always needed the dry 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.440
 in addition to that means if somebody times 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.300
 ask again is a drip or after 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.250
 are you the question also for 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.820
 answer me 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.650
 and if she was like that now you 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.299
 Pitt live off the can in the salad 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.890
 Of course you can and can you 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.130
 write down 120 grams of kidney beans 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.250
 or to a gram but important for 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.200
 you know you know like that 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.479
 Product is purchased as well as the product 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.650
 is in the packaging refers precisely to the 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.330
 the more 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:38.780
 it is always the same and yes there are 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.930
 also cases of turkey and turkey weighs 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.240
 Always fry it when you get it 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.830
 I really do that right 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.690
 usually not at all if I'm good 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.400
 Currently I am at my shelf 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.750
 month but when I buy with turkey 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.789
 I usually buy exactly that 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.220
 right 250 gram packs I like that 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.770
 that's why it's necessary for people 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.960
 to count the really good billing 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.880
 want the best before the 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.620
 roast and if it is after the 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.289
 It's not that hard to fry 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.630
 now you can easily do that 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.800
 look what was on the pack 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.330
 wet amount then dry then hang 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.550
 is not enough 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.710
 I've already done great things 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.550
 the competition goes and with the vegetables 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.440
 is exactly the same 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.240
 especially vegetables also lose a 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.720
 a little weight when you cook it and 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.370
 yes i hope i could ask the question 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.680
 Clarify as I said not now for everyone 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.289
 blatant new video but I thought so yes 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.270
 I clarified the matter for one 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.680
 is settled once for all , hope you 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.810
 drove this video 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.729
 Thanks for watching give the thumb 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.729
 high and see you next time
