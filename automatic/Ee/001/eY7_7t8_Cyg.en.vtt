00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
there I took my grinder which has a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.410 
there I took my grinder which has a
metal<00:00:33.780> blade<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.610> hacked<00:00:35.880> off<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.030 

all<00:00:51.220> right<00:00:51.400> so<00:00:51.760> I<00:00:52.150> just<00:00:52.840> got<00:00:53.200> done<00:00:53.410> cutting<00:00:53.800> the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
all right so I just got done cutting the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.570 
all right so I just got done cutting the
shovel

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
shovel

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.250 
shovel
I<00:00:54.780> use<00:00:55.780> my<00:00:56.080> Makita<00:00:56.680> grinder<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.960> I<00:00:59.020> just

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
I use my Makita grinder and I just

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.360 
I use my Makita grinder and I just
chopped<00:00:59.500> off<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.890> end

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
chopped off the end

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.110 
chopped off the end
ten<00:01:00.820> ten<00:01:01.330> inches<00:01:01.600> from<00:01:01.810> the<00:01:01.900> top<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:04.000> then

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
ten ten inches from the top and then

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.120 
ten ten inches from the top and then
rather<00:01:04.300> than<00:01:04.479> mark<00:01:04.870> it<00:01:05.019> up<00:01:05.110> with<00:01:05.290> my<00:01:05.500> permanent

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
rather than mark it up with my permanent

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.910 
rather than mark it up with my permanent
marker<00:01:06.580> use<00:01:07.479> some<00:01:07.690> duct<00:01:07.960> tape<00:01:08.229> so<00:01:08.470> I<00:01:08.500> can<00:01:08.680> kind

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
marker use some duct tape so I can kind

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.690 
marker use some duct tape so I can kind
of<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:10.510> a<00:01:10.540> visual<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.979> this<00:01:12.160> is<00:01:12.280> gonna<00:01:12.490> look

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
of get a visual what this is gonna look

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.420 
of get a visual what this is gonna look
like<00:01:13.410> so<00:01:14.410> I<00:01:14.440> think<00:01:14.590> that's<00:01:14.950> what<00:01:15.130> I'm<00:01:15.190> gonna<00:01:15.280> do

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
like so I think that's what I'm gonna do

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.060 
like so I think that's what I'm gonna do
right<00:01:15.460> there<00:01:15.940> I<00:01:16.200> measured<00:01:17.200> up<00:01:17.350> two<00:01:17.740> and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
right there I measured up two and

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.719 
right there I measured up two and
three-quarter<00:01:18.940> inches<00:01:19.270> from<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.690> bottom<00:01:19.869> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
three-quarter inches from the bottom and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.900 
three-quarter inches from the bottom and
just<00:01:21.729> did<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.000> nice<00:01:22.300> angle<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:24.430> then<00:01:24.820> I'm

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
just did a nice angle and then I'm

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.310 
just did a nice angle and then I'm
probably<00:01:25.119> gonna<00:01:25.300> put<00:01:25.479> some<00:01:25.630> notches<00:01:25.899> on<00:01:26.290> the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
probably gonna put some notches on the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.760 
probably gonna put some notches on the
side<00:01:26.440> for<00:01:27.130> ripping<00:01:28.119> through<00:01:28.330> roots<00:01:31.740> also<00:01:32.740> I

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
side for ripping through roots also I

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:43.040 
side for ripping through roots also I
have<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.070> handle<00:01:33.490> turned<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:35.560> really<00:01:35.800> sure

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050
