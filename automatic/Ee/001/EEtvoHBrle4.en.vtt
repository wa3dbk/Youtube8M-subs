00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.600 

I'm<00:00:02.580> always<00:00:03.240> thinking<00:00:03.780> about<00:00:04.620> it<00:00:07.400> okay<00:00:08.400> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
I'm always thinking about it okay the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.339 
I'm always thinking about it okay the
next<00:00:08.849> step<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.630> fourth<00:00:09.840> step<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.260> solving

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
next step and the fourth step in solving

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.860 
next step and the fourth step in solving
the<00:00:10.559> Rubik's<00:00:10.800> Cube<00:00:10.980> after<00:00:11.250> you've<00:00:11.370> got<00:00:11.870> cross

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the Rubik's Cube after you've got cross

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.490 
the Rubik's Cube after you've got cross
corners<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.860> first<00:00:14.130> two<00:00:14.280> layers<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:15.500> oll

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.910 
corners and first two layers is oll
Orient<00:00:17.400> last<00:00:17.580> layer<00:00:17.869> Orient<00:00:18.869> means<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.590> flip

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
Orient last layer Orient means to flip

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.460 
Orient last layer Orient means to flip
edges<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:20.580> turn<00:00:21.240> corners<00:00:21.570> you're<00:00:22.350> not

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
edges or turn corners you're not

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.470 
edges or turn corners you're not
literally<00:00:22.920> turning<00:00:23.189> them<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:23.970> through<00:00:24.269> an

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
literally turning them but through an

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.279 
literally turning them but through an
algorithm<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:26.010> are<00:00:26.630> turning<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.960> corners

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
algorithm you are turning the corners

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.640 
algorithm you are turning the corners
and<00:00:28.470> flipping<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.830> edges<00:00:29.929> the<00:00:30.929> first<00:00:31.170> part<00:00:31.439> of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and flipping the edges the first part of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.110 
and flipping the edges the first part of
this<00:00:31.830> step<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.790> solve<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.239> cross<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.110> top

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
this step is to solve a cross on the top

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.600 
this step is to solve a cross on the top
like<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:38.059> across<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> top<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
like this across on the top this is the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.180 
like this across on the top this is the
bottom<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> top<00:00:43.760> now<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.030> have

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
bottom this is the top now you can have

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.450 
bottom this is the top now you can have
any<00:00:47.190> number<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.610> corners<00:00:49.129> along<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.280> this

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
any number of corners along with this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.920 
any number of corners along with this
cross<00:00:51.620> but<00:00:52.620> they<00:00:52.980> don't<00:00:53.160> matter<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.930> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
cross but they don't matter at the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.720 
cross but they don't matter at the
moment<00:00:55.219> they<00:00:56.219> won't<00:00:56.370> matter<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:57.590> part<00:00:58.590> b<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.100> 0

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
moment they won't matter in part b of 0

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.910 
moment they won't matter in part b of 0
ll<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.870> they<00:01:01.230> don't<00:01:01.379> matter<00:01:01.500> right<00:01:01.620> now<00:01:02.239> so

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
ll but they don't matter right now so

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.710 
ll but they don't matter right now so
I'm<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.250> there<00:01:05.610> are<00:01:07.220> 1

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.200 

two

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.350 

and<00:01:14.299> three<00:01:15.229> different<00:01:15.920> cases<00:01:16.720> for<00:01:17.720> part<00:01:18.440> a<00:01:18.590> of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
and three different cases for part a of

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:28.020 
and three different cases for part a of
olo<00:01:21.640> first<00:01:22.640> one<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:25.070> center<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.659> no<00:01:26.659> edges

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
olo first one is the center and no edges

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.120 
olo first one is the center and no edges
the<00:01:29.030> next<00:01:29.270> one<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.920> in<00:01:30.979> center<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:33.009> excuse<00:01:34.009> me

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
the next one is in center and excuse me

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.340 
the next one is in center and excuse me
is<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:35.030> little<00:01:35.810> l<00:01:36.110> here<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.759> backwards<00:01:38.119> L<00:01:38.270> but<00:01:39.170> I

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
is a little l here the backwards L but I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.330 
is a little l here the backwards L but I
call<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.680> an<00:01:39.770> L<00:01:41.080> next<00:01:42.080> one<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.979> last<00:01:43.009> one

call it an L next one and the last one
is<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:44.479> bar<00:01:45.110> across<00:01:45.970> now<00:01:46.970> again<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.420> can<00:01:47.630> have

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
is a bar across now again you can have

00:01:47.750 --> 00:02:03.300 
is a bar across now again you can have
any<00:01:48.020> number<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:50.750> have<00:01:50.899> any<00:01:51.050> number<00:01:51.380> of

you can have any number of corners along

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.220 
you can have any number of corners along
with<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:07.319> the<00:02:08.319> right<00:02:09.190> one<00:02:09.280> has<00:02:09.489> none<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.230> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
with this the right one has none and the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.710 
with this the right one has none and the
left<00:02:11.440> one<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:12.250> corner<00:02:12.580> solved<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.390> doesn't

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
left one is to corner solved it doesn't

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.210 
left one is to corner solved it doesn't
really<00:02:13.840> matter<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:16.330> as<00:02:16.450> long<00:02:16.599> as<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.980> get<00:02:18.099> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
really matter so as long as you get the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:27.470 
really matter so as long as you get the
cross<00:02:18.489> in<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.849> end<00:02:23.099> okay<00:02:24.360> now

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.050 

for<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.200> one<00:02:28.349> with<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.500> with<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.129> one<00:02:29.940> with

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
for the one with the with the one with

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.770 
for the one with the with the one with
none<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:31.709> will<00:02:31.860> go<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.129> algorithm<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
none you will go the algorithm for the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.160 
none you will go the algorithm for the
bar<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.310> then<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.400> will<00:02:35.519> do<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> algorithm

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
bar and then you will do the algorithm

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.460 
bar and then you will do the algorithm
for<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:38.519> out<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:41.030> do<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> bar<00:02:42.299> one<00:02:42.480> first<00:02:42.720> for

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
for the out so do the bar one first for

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.920 
for the out so do the bar one first for
the<00:02:43.530> bar<00:02:44.269> you<00:02:45.269> going<00:02:45.330> out<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.569> borrow<00:02:45.780> any

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
the bar you going out to borrow any

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.420 
the bar you going out to borrow any
which<00:02:46.110> way<00:02:46.910> like<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.150> or<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.500> looks

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
which way like this or like this looks

00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:00.110 
which way like this or like this looks
the<00:02:50.580> same<00:02:50.760> but<00:02:51.060> if<00:02:51.720> you've<00:02:51.840> got<00:02:52.049> corner<00:02:52.799> saw<00:02:59.120> if

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the same but if you've got corner saw if

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.400 
the same but if you've got corner saw if
you've<00:03:00.299> got<00:03:00.480> corner<00:03:00.780> solve<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.260> their

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
you've got corner solve to their

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.339 
you've got corner solve to their
different<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:02.370> get<00:03:02.519> it's<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.060> this<00:03:03.299> or<00:03:04.290> like

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
different you get it's like this or like

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.869 
different you get it's like this or like
this<00:03:06.049> now<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:08.640> L<00:03:08.819> can<00:03:09.480> only<00:03:09.690> be<00:03:09.930> like<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.879> not

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
this now the L can only be like that not

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.099 
this now the L can only be like that not
like<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.950> not<00:03:13.950> like<00:03:14.129> that<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.519> like<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.390> only

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
like that not like that I like that only

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.710 
like that not like that I like that only
like<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.859> only<00:03:17.129> it's<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.849> only<00:03:17.879> way<00:03:18.239> only

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
like that only it's the only way only

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:28.400 
like that only it's the only way only
only<00:03:19.019> only<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:20.459> for<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.510> bar<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:22.560> do<00:03:22.790> F<00:03:23.790> R<00:03:25.970> u<00:03:27.410> RI

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
only only so for the bar you do F R u RI
