00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 because if you keep it 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.340
 Y 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.980
 good morning we are here of 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.900
 tunic makers 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.750
 10.26 of 2012 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.610
 We are showing the clock machine 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.130
 from the tower of the church of San Pedro 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.630
 in the main square of the touch of 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.060
 nariño 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.460
 this is a machine that work by 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.740
 gravity and we also manufacture someone the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.290
 piro de mutuales de españa 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.390
 It consists of three weights, three three 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.090
 stages 1 2 and 3 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.340
 the central stage of this computer network 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.910
 of the computer machine has to be here 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.460
 since it orders all the operation of 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.590
 here is that the pendulum moves the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.140
 Needles commands the movement each of 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.880
 the spheres 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.270
 the transmission system moves away from 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.460
 wait has four sphere in total 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.330
 besides sending the movement to 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.309
 spheres he has a system of levers 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.470
 who sends the order first on this side 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.990
 that this the system of the bells every 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.530
 quarter of an hour here sends for the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.750
 levers activates the system and this side 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.820
 from here since the bells of 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.580
 the rooms and now has two bells 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.340
 that sound the pim pam every quarter of 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.350
 time a big band is a quarter of the two 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.560
 rooms so on until the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.380
 four quarters of the hour 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.960
 and this additionally sends the order to 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.810
 bell system this watch has 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.170
 some particular situation that over the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.049
 half an hour twice the big band and 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.899
 additionally activates a bell in the 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.780
 half an hour the same is when elaborated 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.060
 four quarters and send the order here to 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.930
 give the number of bells 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.800
 corresponding to the time 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:00.160
 and let's see the exhaust system by 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.380
 here is an exhaust system system 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.270
 swing pendulum 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.880
 but it has a system and in particular 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.599
 those of you have this flame system of 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.319
 constant force escape every 15 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.069
 seconds 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:20.019
 you see this cam there is going to release it 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.019
 15 seconds here this dam rises 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.360
 this visit which always keeps 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.380
 making the force for the swing 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.720
 of the pendulum 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.030
 the system of weights that are what 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.400
 do is every 15 seconds of the release to 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.160
 gear to the faces and moves the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.620
 grandfather minutes every 15 seconds and this 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.660
 system this weight is always there this 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.660
 it is the call of constant force 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.500
 here for the back of the clock 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.500
 we can see the whole system the pendulum 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.260
 the pendulum system this area the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.880
 Ailerons the double 20 which are the ones 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.710
 regulate the speed of movement of 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.930
 the bells in these systems and a 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.820
 particular situation of this machine that 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.620
 we had to restore is because the pine nuts 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.650
 they were already worn out these pinion that 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.300
 wear are very worn 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.240
 had rectified in a very 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.770
 craft, so we had to go back to 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.340
 endorse in a technical manner 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.250
 using lathes and milling machines 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.410
 and here the system of many years ago 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.989
 according to the history and background 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.239
 do not talk about this machine the system 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.730
 the paddles of l'alcora was wrong 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.050
 cut off is the drive angle was 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.740
 badly badly traced 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.380
 here we can see 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.760
 this palette is the first here 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.340
 they rest, they call those who just arrive 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.060
 to the drive angle drives it then the 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.700
 another palette receives and drives remained with 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.190
 a perfect escape very nice escape 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:11.410
 wide that is releasing quietly 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:14.680
 the two between 14 98 and 15 15 13 seconds 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.630
 in the in the palette that inclusion 15.13 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.880
 seconds 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.160
 1498 an optimal variation for a 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.360
 accuracy of plus or minus 8 seconds 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.360
 daily that this watch
