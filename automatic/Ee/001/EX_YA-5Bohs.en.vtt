tighten this down just enough to secure

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.440 
tighten this down just enough to secure
it<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:20.150> place

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
it in place

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.059 
it in place
mm-hm<00:02:21.200> flip<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.830> forward

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
mm-hm flip this forward

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.459 
mm-hm flip this forward
this<00:02:23.730> bolt<00:02:24.030> goes<00:02:24.299> behind<00:02:24.719> here<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.230> keeps

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
this bolt goes behind here that keeps

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.740 
this bolt goes behind here that keeps
this<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:25.890> vertical<00:02:26.010> position<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.000> then

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
this in the vertical position and then

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.740 
this in the vertical position and then
this<00:02:27.930> bearing<00:02:28.439> is<00:02:29.120> pushing<00:02:30.120> down<00:02:30.269> on<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.510> tire

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
this bearing is pushing down on the tire

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.539 
this bearing is pushing down on the tire
so<00:02:31.379> that's<00:02:31.530> how<00:02:31.680> you're<00:02:31.829> breaking<00:02:32.159> that<00:02:32.189> seal

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
so that's how you're breaking that seal

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.610 
so that's how you're breaking that seal
sure<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.920> gonna<00:02:35.099> be<00:02:35.159> that<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:36.379> if<00:02:37.379> we

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
sure and this is gonna be that and if we

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.649 
sure and this is gonna be that and if we
were<00:02:37.769> actually<00:02:38.549> taking<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.359> could<00:02:45.540> at

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
were actually taking and you could at

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.819 
were actually taking and you could at
this<00:02:45.810> point<00:02:46.049> also<00:02:46.459> just<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:48.269> know<00:02:48.829> lubricate

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
this point also just you know lubricate

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.190 
this point also just you know lubricate
the<00:02:49.980> bead<00:02:50.189> with<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.849> little<00:02:51.120> armor<00:02:51.420> all<00:02:51.450> use<00:02:52.170> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
the bead with a little armor all use a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.339 
the bead with a little armor all use a
little<00:02:52.819> Murphy's<00:02:53.819> Oil<00:02:54.000> Soap<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.569> water<00:02:54.810> will

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
little Murphy's Oil Soap and water will

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.009 
little Murphy's Oil Soap and water will
do<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> trick<00:02:55.829> as<00:02:56.010> well<00:02:56.209> but<00:02:57.209> yeah<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.870> just

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
do the trick as well but yeah that just

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:12.069 
do the trick as well but yeah that just
helps<00:02:58.349> sure<00:02:59.599> but<00:03:00.599> once<00:03:01.169> that<00:03:01.290> sports<00:03:01.950> villain

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.000 

so<00:03:13.939> basically<00:03:14.939> we<00:03:15.150> have<00:03:15.269> two<00:03:16.169> tire<00:03:16.439> iron<00:03:16.709> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
so basically we have two tire iron a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.789 
so basically we have two tire iron a
little<00:03:17.400> small<00:03:17.669> one<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.870> giant<00:03:19.290> one<00:03:19.439> here

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
little small one and this giant one here

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.119 
little small one and this giant one here
and<00:03:20.659> you<00:03:21.659> want<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.900> get<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.109> valve<00:03:22.319> stem<00:03:22.620> out

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
and you want to get the valve stem out

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.199 
and you want to get the valve stem out
of<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.400> way<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> little<00:03:23.849> bit

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
of the way a little bit

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.699 
of the way a little bit
mm-hmm<00:03:25.159> smaller<00:03:26.159> tire<00:03:26.459> iron<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.709> our

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
mm-hmm smaller tire iron and our

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.159 
mm-hmm smaller tire iron and our
instructions<00:03:29.280> say<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.579> go<00:03:30.090> ahead<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.479> crank

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169

didn't yeah if you didn't inflate it as
all<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.710> really<00:04:34.920> talked<00:04:35.190> maybe<00:04:35.490> no<00:04:35.730> way<00:04:35.850> to

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
all of you really talked maybe no way to

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.640 
all of you really talked maybe no way to
do<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.240> yeah<00:04:36.540> it's<00:04:37.050> just<00:04:37.170> like<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.410> road

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
do that yeah it's just like a road

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.380 
do that yeah it's just like a road
terrorism<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.580> just<00:04:38.760> helps<00:04:38.970> keep<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.270> out

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
terrorism and it just helps keep it out

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.140 
terrorism and it just helps keep it out
of<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.570> way<00:04:39.720> yep<00:04:40.490> so<00:04:41.490> we<00:04:41.580> got<00:04:41.700> a<00:04:41.730> little<00:04:41.940> bit<00:04:42.060> of

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
of the way yep so we got a little bit of

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.880 
of the way yep so we got a little bit of
road<00:04:42.300> tire<00:04:42.570> here<00:04:43.080> we<00:04:43.290> got<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.470> little<00:04:43.590> bit<00:04:43.800> of

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
road tire here we got a little bit of

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.730 
road tire here we got a little bit of
mountain<00:04:44.420> tubeless<00:04:45.420> tire<00:04:45.740> mounting

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
mountain tubeless tire mounting

everything<00:04:48.780> unique<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.440> roller-skate<00:04:50.510> it's<00:04:51.510> a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
everything unique to roller-skate it's a

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.100 
everything unique to roller-skate it's a
three-way<00:04:52.560> deal<00:04:53.480> again<00:04:54.480> putting<00:04:54.780> on<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.990> baby

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
three-way deal again putting on the baby

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.580 
three-way deal again putting on the baby
powder<00:04:56.210> make<00:04:57.210> sure<00:04:57.390> I'm<00:04:57.480> recording<00:04:57.960> here<00:04:57.990> yep

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
powder make sure I'm recording here yep

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.830 
powder make sure I'm recording here yep
we're<00:04:58.860> recording<00:04:59.190> get<00:04:59.910> my<00:05:00.030> ugly<00:05:00.360> mug<00:05:00.390> in<00:05:00.690> there

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
we're recording get my ugly mug in there

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.130 
we're recording get my ugly mug in there
for<00:05:00.990> one<00:05:01.110> shot<00:05:04.910> in<00:05:05.910> my<00:05:06.090> disorganized<00:05:06.810> garage

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
for one shot in my disorganized garage

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.380 
for one shot in my disorganized garage
it's<00:05:07.890> alright<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.460> depth<00:05:08.760> of<00:05:08.910> field<00:05:09.090> on<00:05:09.240> this

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
it's alright the depth of field on this

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.330 
it's alright the depth of field on this
is<00:05:09.540> brought<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.290> you<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.620> maybe<00:05:10.770> another<00:05:11.010> flip

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
is brought to you and maybe another flip

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.659 
is brought to you and maybe another flip
so<00:05:11.930> you<00:05:12.930> know<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.260> get<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.650> baby<00:05:14.070> powder<00:05:14.370> up

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
so you know you get the baby powder up

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.000 
so you know you get the baby powder up
the<00:05:14.910> tube<00:05:15.150> insert<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.900> tube<00:05:16.050> in<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.440> tire<00:05:16.650> and

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
the tube insert the tube in the tire and

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.820 
the tube insert the tube in the tire and
then<00:05:17.190> you<00:05:17.310> slip<00:05:17.550> that<00:05:17.820> baby<00:05:18.260> with<00:05:19.260> some<00:05:19.530> armor

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
then you slip that baby with some armor

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.570 
then you slip that baby with some armor
all<00:05:19.950> on<00:05:20.160> the<00:05:20.340> bead<00:05:20.640> get<00:05:21.480> it<00:05:21.600> set<00:05:21.870> in<00:05:22.050> there<00:05:22.580> so

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
all on the bead get it set in there so

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.220 
all on the bead get it set in there so
that's<00:05:23.790> this<00:05:24.060> is<00:05:24.120> probably<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.720> hardest<00:05:24.840> part

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
that's this is probably the hardest part

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.690 
that's this is probably the hardest part
right<00:05:25.350> here<00:05:25.590> right<00:05:25.770> this<00:05:26.010> is<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.310> whole<00:05:26.460> key

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
right here right this is the whole key

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.820 
right here right this is the whole key
to<00:05:26.730> it<00:05:26.940> is<00:05:27.060> this<00:05:27.270> is<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.720> I<00:05:27.990> was<00:05:28.350> getting<00:05:28.710> it

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
to it is this is the I was getting it

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.130 
to it is this is the I was getting it
set<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.340> first<00:05:29.610> first<00:05:30.150> spot<00:05:30.450> yeah<00:05:30.900> especially

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
set the first first spot yeah especially

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.560 
set the first first spot yeah especially
a<00:05:31.440> new<00:05:31.590> tube<00:05:31.830> that<00:05:32.040> hasn't<00:05:32.220> been<00:05:32.580> put<00:05:33.090> on<00:05:33.240> or

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
a new tube that hasn't been put on or

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.540 
a new tube that hasn't been put on or
come<00:05:33.810> off<00:05:33.840> of<00:05:34.169> a<00:05:34.290> rim<00:05:34.500> so<00:05:34.800> far<00:05:35.010> cuz<00:05:35.280> that's<00:05:35.430> a

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
come off of a rim so far cuz that's a

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.210 
come off of a rim so far cuz that's a
steel<00:05:35.940> bead<00:05:36.570> correct<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.620> that's<00:05:37.740> what<00:05:38.040> makes

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
steel bead correct and that's what makes

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.880 
steel bead correct and that's what makes
it<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:38.550> tough<00:05:38.580> yeah<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:40.169> just<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.500> nature<00:05:40.680> of

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
it so tough yeah and just the nature of

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.850 
it so tough yeah and just the nature of
the<00:05:41.010> diameter

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.770 

so<00:05:46.860> you're<00:05:47.040> actually<00:05:47.220> fooling<00:05:48.030> both<00:05:48.450> of<00:05:48.660> those

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
so you're actually fooling both of those

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.340 
so you're actually fooling both of those
beads<00:05:49.170> at<00:05:49.440> one<00:05:49.770> time<00:05:50.070> around<00:05:50.640> that<00:05:50.970> RIM<00:05:51.210> yep<00:05:51.810> it

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
beads at one time around that RIM yep it

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.930 
beads at one time around that RIM yep it
wasn't<00:05:52.680> like<00:05:52.770> you<00:05:52.800> put<00:05:53.100> on<00:05:53.130> one<00:05:53.520> like<00:05:53.760> you

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
wasn't like you put on one like you

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.630 
wasn't like you put on one like you
would<00:05:54.060> do<00:05:54.210> a<00:05:54.240> long<00:05:54.510> tire<00:05:54.840> no<00:05:55.290> so<00:05:56.100> it's<00:05:56.280> two

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
would do a long tire no so it's two

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.360 
would do a long tire no so it's two
beads<00:05:57.240> on<00:05:57.600> in<00:05:58.350> one<00:05:58.620> fell<00:05:58.920> swoop

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
beads on in one fell swoop

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.510 
beads on in one fell swoop
correct<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.120> the<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.660> bottom<00:06:01.050> one<00:06:01.260> will<00:06:02.250> pop

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
correct and the the bottom one will pop

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.040 
correct and the the bottom one will pop
into<00:06:02.760> place<00:06:03.000> first<00:06:03.800> but<00:06:04.800> still<00:06:05.220> yeah<00:06:05.640> it's

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
into place first but still yeah it's

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.660 
into place first but still yeah it's
that's<00:06:07.050> what's<00:06:07.230> hard<00:06:07.380> is<00:06:07.560> it's<00:06:07.800> uh<00:06:07.860> you<00:06:08.550> know

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
that's what's hard is it's uh you know

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.250 
that's what's hard is it's uh you know
without<00:06:08.940> this<00:06:09.180> station<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.750> without<00:06:09.960> really

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
without this station and without really
