-<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.850> only<00:01:48.060> question<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.540> always

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
- just one my only question as always

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.170 
- just one my only question as always
why<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.920> line<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.460> low<00:01:50.670> what<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
why then is the line so low what do you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.300 
why then is the line so low what do you
like<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.420> Troy<00:01:51.630> West<00:01:51.840> man<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> am<00:01:53.130> gonna

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
actually go with the hole monitor dog in

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.690 
actually go with the hole monitor dog in
the<00:01:55.079> Washington<00:01:55.710> Redskins<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.340> week<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the Washington Redskins this week I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.609 
the Washington Redskins this week I
think<00:01:56.909> RG<00:01:57.420> 3<00:01:57.659> everything<00:01:57.960> I've<00:01:58.079> read<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> seen

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
think RG 3 everything I've read and seen

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.429 
think RG 3 everything I've read and seen
is<00:01:59.189> he's<00:01:59.490> gonna<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.880> ok<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.200> team

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
is he's gonna be ok I think this team

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.959 
is he's gonna be ok I think this team
played<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:01.979> better<00:02:02.009> against<00:02:02.640> Denver<00:02:02.850> I

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
played much better against Denver I

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.520 
played much better against Denver I
don't<00:02:03.210> think<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.509> score<00:02:03.810> reflected<00:02:04.380> their

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
don't think that score reflected their

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.319 
don't think that score reflected their
performance<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:05.340> played<00:02:05.549> Denver's<00:02:05.969> strong

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
performance they played Denver's strong

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.059 
performance they played Denver's strong
for<00:02:06.570> three<00:02:06.810> three<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.229> half<00:02:07.350> quarters<00:02:07.680> I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
for three three and a half quarters I

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.499 
for three three and a half quarters I
thought<00:02:08.580> their<00:02:08.729> offense<00:02:09.090> moved<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.360> ball

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
thought their offense moved the ball

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.210 
thought their offense moved the ball
pretty<00:02:09.720> methodically<00:02:10.410> their<00:02:10.590> defense<00:02:10.979> played

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
pretty methodically their defense played

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.979 
pretty methodically their defense played
pretty<00:02:11.459> well<00:02:11.580> they<00:02:11.940> caused<00:02:12.450> turnovers

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
pretty well they caused turnovers

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.790 
pretty well they caused turnovers
against<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.379> Denver

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
against the Denver

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.410 
against the Denver
who<00:02:14.070> typically<00:02:14.430> does<00:02:14.700> not<00:02:14.850> turn<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.240> ball

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
who typically does not turn the ball

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.750 
who typically does not turn the ball
over<00:02:15.450> they're<00:02:16.260> finally<00:02:16.650> coming<00:02:16.830> home<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.460> think

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
over they're finally coming home I think

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.130 
over they're finally coming home I think
there's<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.060> team<00:02:18.270> that's<00:02:18.480> got<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.690> chip<00:02:18.990> on

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
there's a team that's got a chip on

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
there's a team that's got a chip on
their<00:02:19.290> shoulder<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.650> don't<00:02:19.830> think<00:02:20.010> they've

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
their shoulder I don't think they've

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.950 
their shoulder I don't think they've
thrown<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.670> towel<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.060> their<00:02:21.180> season<00:02:21.600> just

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
thrown in the towel on their season just

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.220 
thrown in the towel on their season just
yet

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
yet

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.350 
yet
I<00:02:22.440> think<00:02:23.040> head<00:02:23.400> /<00:02:23.580> head<00:02:23.730> these<00:02:23.940> teams<00:02:24.210> are

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
I think head / head these teams are

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.090 
I think head / head these teams are
pretty<00:02:24.570> evenly<00:02:24.930> matched<00:02:25.020> talent<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.770> talent

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
pretty evenly matched talent for talent

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.710 
pretty evenly matched talent for talent
they're<00:02:26.190> immediately<00:02:26.460> matched<00:02:26.820> but<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.480> like

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
they're immediately matched but I like

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.330 
they're immediately matched but I like
the<00:02:27.870> home<00:02:28.020> dog<00:02:28.260> here<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.800> NF<00:02:29.040> though<00:02:29.190> I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the home dog here in the NF though I

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.040 
the home dog here in the NF though I
know<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:29.520> kind<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.180> went<00:02:30.300> devil's<00:02:30.630> advocate

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
know we kind of went devil's advocate

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.110 
know we kind of went devil's advocate
there<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.440> took<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.800> road<00:02:32.520> favorite<00:02:33.000> with

know they have to travel and everything
the<00:02:48.900> only<00:02:49.200> question<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.710> you<00:02:49.830> know<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.400> was

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
the only question is you know if it was

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.130 
the only question is you know if it was
this<00:02:50.640> line<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.000> they<00:02:51.090> weren't<00:02:51.360> off<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.720> buy<00:02:51.870> I

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
this line and they weren't off the buy I

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.840 
this line and they weren't off the buy I
probably<00:02:52.560> would<00:02:52.770> be<00:02:52.800> agreeing<00:02:53.400> with<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.640> very

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
probably would be agreeing with you very

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.580 
probably would be agreeing with you very
strongly<00:02:54.210> it<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.780> makes<00:02:55.170> me<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> little<00:02:55.470> bit

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
strongly it just makes me a little bit

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.050 
strongly it just makes me a little bit
nervous<00:02:55.770> considering<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.520> bunch<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.940> fake

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
nervous considering a bunch of fake

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.270 
nervous considering a bunch of fake
factors<00:02:57.510> right<00:02:57.660> how<00:02:58.050> well<00:02:58.320> Rivers<00:02:58.710> has<00:02:58.950> played

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
factors right how well Rivers has played

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.130 
factors right how well Rivers has played

injuries and depth you know if there's
ever<00:03:14.940> gonna<00:03:15.060> be<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.300> spot<00:03:15.630> where<00:03:15.900> they<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.530> a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
ever gonna be a spot where they get a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.960 
ever gonna be a spot where they get a
little<00:03:16.770> bit<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.040> break<00:03:17.280> from<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.580> it's

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
little bit of a break from that it's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.640 
little bit of a break from that it's
gonna<00:03:18.150> be<00:03:18.360> here<00:03:18.630> but<00:03:18.810> none<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.320> those<00:03:19.410> factors

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
gonna be here but none of those factors

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.400 
gonna be here but none of those factors
want<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.489> swing<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.820> off<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.120> Washington<00:03:21.630> they

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
don't I just think Washington's starting

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.460 
don't I just think Washington's starting
to<00:03:24.000> play<00:03:24.150> better<00:03:24.180> football<00:03:24.840> they<00:03:25.110> got<00:03:25.260> that

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
to play better football they got that

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.320 
to play better football they got that
big<00:03:25.709> win<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.220> couple<00:03:26.489> weeks<00:03:26.760> ago<00:03:26.880> at<00:03:27.150> home

big win a couple weeks ago at home
against<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.750> Bears<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.320> thought<00:03:28.890> they<00:03:29.070> liked

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
against the Bears I thought they liked

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.100 
against the Bears I thought they liked
it<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.550> thought<00:03:29.580> they<00:03:30.030> played<00:03:30.330> better<00:03:30.600> against

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
it I thought they played better against

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.930 
it I thought they played better against
against<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.650> Denver<00:03:31.800> Broncos<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.489> really<00:03:32.790> did

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
against the Denver Broncos I really did

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.340 
against the Denver Broncos I really did
you<00:03:33.090> looked<00:03:33.300> at<00:03:33.420> what<00:03:33.540> they<00:03:33.690> did<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.989> Manning

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
you looked at what they did to Manning

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.020 
you looked at what they did to Manning
make<00:03:34.500> they<00:03:34.920> caused<00:03:35.160> Manning<00:03:35.520> all<00:03:35.610> sorts<00:03:35.940> of

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
make they caused Manning all sorts of

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.490 
make they caused Manning all sorts of
chaos<00:03:36.390> there<00:03:36.630> for<00:03:36.870> for<00:03:37.140> three<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.470> half

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
chaos there for for three and a half

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.890 
chaos there for for three and a half
quarters<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.489> think<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.150> home<00:03:39.360> now<00:03:39.600> a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
quarters so I think that home now a

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.420 
quarters so I think that home now a
little<00:03:40.170> bit<00:03:40.350> more<00:03:40.410> inspired<00:03:40.920> they<00:03:41.130> know<00:03:41.250> that

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
little bit more inspired they know that

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.770 
little bit more inspired they know that
you<00:03:41.580> can<00:03:41.700> play<00:03:41.850> with<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> top<00:03:42.239> teams<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.630> the

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
you can play with the top teams in the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.560 
you can play with the top teams in the
NFL<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.410> think<00:03:43.830> rg3<00:03:44.489> has<00:03:44.580> really<00:03:44.910> got<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> chip<00:03:45.390> on

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
NFL I think rg3 has really got a chip on

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.610 
NFL I think rg3 has really got a chip on
his<00:03:45.660> shoulder<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:46.020> think<00:03:46.200> he's<00:03:46.320> gonna<00:03:46.440> have<00:03:46.560> a

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
his shoulder I think he's gonna have a

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.199 
his shoulder I think he's gonna have a
good<00:03:46.770> performance<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:48.030> like<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209
