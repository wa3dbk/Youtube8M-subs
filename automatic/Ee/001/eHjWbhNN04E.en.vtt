00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
going to work in the first try if it

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.750 
going to work in the first try if it
does<00:01:12.030> then<00:01:12.740> if<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> does<00:01:14.010> work<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.490> first

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
does then if it does work in your first

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.789 
does then if it does work in your first
try<00:01:15.030> um<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:17.030> think<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:19.110> need<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.590> like

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
try um I think that you need to be like

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.830 
try um I think that you need to be like
in<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> museum<00:01:20.189> or<00:01:20.670> something<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
in a museum or something because that is

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.429 
in a museum or something because that is
impossible<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:24.420> always<00:01:24.780> need<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> practice

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
impossible you always need to practice

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.469 
impossible you always need to practice
things<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.100> because<00:01:26.850> or<00:01:27.299> else

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
things like this because or else

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.200 
things like this because or else
otherwise<00:01:27.960> freaking<00:01:28.680> little<00:01:29.549> babies<00:01:29.909> will<00:01:30.180> be

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
otherwise freaking little babies will be

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
otherwise freaking little babies will be
doing<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.229> you'll<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.710> seeing

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
doing this and you'll just be seeing

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.249 
doing this and you'll just be seeing
little<00:01:32.220> kids<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> street<00:01:33.000> moving<00:01:33.810> cars

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
little kids on the street moving cars

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.929 
little kids on the street moving cars
and<00:01:34.530> stuff<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.130> does<00:01:35.310> take<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.579> lot<00:01:35.880> of

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939

simple innocent cups so let's get

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:26.449 
simple innocent cups so let's get
started<00:03:20.989> breathe<00:03:24.080> breathe<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.440> connect<00:03:25.800> as<00:03:26.430> a

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
started breathe breathe and connect as a

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.270 
started breathe breathe and connect as a
matter<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.700> fact<00:03:26.910> I'm<00:03:27.120> just<00:03:27.330> gonna<00:03:27.540> separate

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
matter of fact I'm just gonna separate

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.670 
matter of fact I'm just gonna separate
these<00:03:29.280> two<00:03:29.610> cups<00:03:30.510> from<00:03:30.720> each<00:03:30.900> other<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:31.350> so

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
these two cups from each other just so

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.150 
these two cups from each other just so
that<00:03:31.860> there's<00:03:32.130> no<00:03:32.280> question<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.980> keep<00:03:34.980> them

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
that there's no question and keep them

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.229 
that there's no question and keep them
both<00:03:35.340> in<00:03:35.489> view<00:03:35.670> so<00:03:37.160> connect<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.370> breeze<00:03:38.610> try

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
both in view so connect that breeze try

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.640 
both in view so connect that breeze try
to<00:03:39.300> get<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.600> energy<00:03:39.750> flowing<00:03:40.200> through<00:03:40.320> your

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
to get the energy flowing through your

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.280 
to get the energy flowing through your
heart<00:03:40.860> chakra<00:03:44.300> into<00:03:45.300> your<00:03:45.420> hand<00:03:45.660> connect<00:03:46.170> the

heart chakra into your hand connect the
bridge<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.800> green<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.459> should<00:03:47.640> feel<00:03:47.850> he's

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
bridge the green you should feel he's

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.000 
bridge the green you should feel he's
still<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:48.959> like<00:03:49.050> I<00:03:49.200> mentioned<00:03:49.530> before<00:03:49.560> the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
still just like I mentioned before the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.589 
still just like I mentioned before the
heat

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.899 

and<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:55.409> first<00:03:55.650> few<00:03:55.860> times<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.489> don't<00:03:56.730> have

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
and the first few times you don't have

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.670 
and the first few times you don't have
to<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.540> could<00:03:58.049> always<00:03:58.200> just

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
to like you could always just

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.320 
to like you could always just
double-check<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.430> say<00:03:59.549> oppa<00:03:59.879> didn't<00:04:00.150> work

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
double-check and say oppa didn't work

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.180 
double-check and say oppa didn't work
and<00:04:00.900> keep<00:04:01.170> going<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.709> don't<00:04:01.830> have<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.040> like

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
and keep going you don't have to like

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.640 
and keep going you don't have to like
try<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.610> make<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.599> wild<00:04:03.780> guess<00:04:04.140> if<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.470> worked

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
try to make it wild guess if it worked

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.140 
try to make it wild guess if it worked
or<00:04:04.830> not<00:04:04.890> but<00:04:05.640> usually<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.269> do<00:04:06.450> feel<00:04:06.840> the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
or not but usually you do feel the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.569 
or not but usually you do feel the
success<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.390> feel<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.930> gone<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.769> can<00:04:11.069> pretty

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
success you feel it gone you can pretty

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.360 
success you feel it gone you can pretty
much<00:04:11.670> know<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.390> don't<00:04:13.260> know<00:04:13.349> how<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:14.190> best

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
much know I don't know how to the best

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.250 
much know I don't know how to the best
way<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.519> explain<00:04:14.849> this<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.239> probably<00:04:16.169> just

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
way to explain this is probably just

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.800 
way to explain this is probably just
your<00:04:16.709> intuition<00:04:17.340> or<00:04:17.519> just<00:04:17.810> your

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
your intuition or just your

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.930 
your intuition or just your
consciousness<00:04:19.709> just<00:04:19.919> telling<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.609> that<00:04:20.790> it

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
consciousness just telling you that it

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.100 
consciousness just telling you that it
that<00:04:21.389> it<00:04:21.540> worked<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.340> anyways<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:23.930> you<00:04:24.930> just

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
that it worked so anyways so you just

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.740 
that it worked so anyways so you just
deeply<00:04:25.740> breathe<00:04:26.030> breathe<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.270> into<00:04:27.419> these<00:04:27.690> two

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
deeply breathe breathe it into these two

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.870 
deeply breathe breathe it into these two
cups<00:04:29.030> there's<00:04:30.030> nothing<00:04:30.360> my<00:04:30.510> hands<00:04:31.789> other<00:04:32.789> than

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
cups there's nothing my hands other than

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.870 
cups there's nothing my hands other than
bringing<00:04:33.630> energy<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:35.010> hopefully<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:35.760> guys

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
bringing energy and hopefully you guys

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.960 
bringing energy and hopefully you guys
could<00:04:36.090> comment<00:04:36.750> about<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.260> help<00:04:37.919> me<00:04:38.100> realize

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
could comment about and help me realize

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.680 
could comment about and help me realize
what<00:04:39.240> type<00:04:39.389> of<00:04:39.419> energy<00:04:39.630> this<00:04:40.020> is<00:04:40.430> um<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:42.090> haven't

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
what type of energy this is um I haven't

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.860 
what type of energy this is um I haven't
really<00:04:42.900> gone<00:04:43.760> into<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.880> research<00:04:45.270> into<00:04:45.720> it

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
really gone into the research into it

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.740 
really gone into the research into it
but<00:04:46.190> choose<00:04:47.190> kind<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.490> what<00:04:47.699> helps<00:04:48.060> work<00:04:48.449> for

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
but choose kind of what helps work for

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.010 
but choose kind of what helps work for
me

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020
