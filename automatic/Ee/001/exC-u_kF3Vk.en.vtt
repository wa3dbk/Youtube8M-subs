 recognize this advantage 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.200
 In the west, a hole in the wall breaks free in the middle of the wall 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.289
 but drill 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.429
 then the war already 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.750
 a completely different caliber than he is here 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.290
 he eats through the hardest rock 20 meters a day and manages to do so 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.770
 Tubes of almost ten meters in diameter this choir is currently in use at 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.250

 Gotthard base tunnel for many involved 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.760
 a life task 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.400
 to tell annually how big and heavy an elephant is but what I am 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.579
 maybe do not know 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.110
 the pachyderms have namesake more in terms of body fullness 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.300
 in no way inferior have visited one of them for them in the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.410
 hard on 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.570
 You can win this very Chur if you can answer the following question 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.570
 are they all found mammals three years or b 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.370
 if they know it 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.039
 Just call 0137 9 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.889

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:04.889
 I'm keeping my fingers crossed for him and she's the same with Galileo 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 do you know this sound 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.570
 So a lot of luck Volker this noise 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.800
 the 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.210
 the risk of attack 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.120
 An "army of the clean" is possible 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.300
 which mechanism actually decides luck independently everywhere 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.420
 the meeting inside Galileo unlocks the secret right in 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.780
 Mecca of slot machines unrecognized by Las Vegas 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.890
 I players among them quite comfortably from the living room armchair 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.080
 want to win here again our Galileo raffle 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.360
 With a bit of luck you might soon have this one on it 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.990

 and they easily see that 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.470
 Welcome back to Galileo 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.360
 An old rule in the cold season is yes if you have cold feet 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.060
 you get a cold 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.679
 I also fight my children in the age of 18, but that's really what I mean 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.679
