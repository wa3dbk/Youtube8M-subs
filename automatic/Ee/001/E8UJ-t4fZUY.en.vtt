run into an overly pimped out car that I
can't<00:04:35.560> outrace<00:04:36.930> there<00:04:37.930> is<00:04:38.080> one<00:04:38.349> thing<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:38.620> want

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.770 
can't outrace there is one thing I want
to<00:04:38.860> complain<00:04:39.099> about<00:04:39.159> though<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:40.509> certainly

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
to complain about though it certainly

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.480 
to complain about though it certainly
could<00:04:41.080> be<00:04:41.199> worse<00:04:41.409> but<00:04:41.680> basically<00:04:42.039> certain

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
could be worse but basically certain

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.520 
could be worse but basically certain
paint<00:04:42.699> jobs<00:04:43.000> neon<00:04:43.330> lights<00:04:43.599> spoilers<00:04:44.259> and

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
paint jobs neon lights spoilers and

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.860 
paint jobs neon lights spoilers and
other<00:04:44.800> features<00:04:45.069> are<00:04:45.370> kind<00:04:45.669> meaning<00:04:46.629> you<00:04:46.750> will

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
other features are kind meaning you will

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.390 
other features are kind meaning you will
have<00:04:47.139> them<00:04:47.349> for<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:47.590> week<00:04:47.620> and<00:04:48.069> then<00:04:48.129> they

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
have them for a week and then they

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.860 
have them for a week and then they
expire<00:04:48.729> and<00:04:48.909> you<00:04:49.000> got<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.150> repurchase<00:04:49.539> them

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
expire and you got to repurchase them

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.029 
expire and you got to repurchase them
it's<00:04:50.259> annoying<00:04:50.590> because<00:04:50.770> they're<00:04:50.949> not

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
it's annoying because they're not

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.520 
it's annoying because they're not
exactly<00:04:51.250> cheap<00:04:51.629> but<00:04:52.629> you<00:04:52.900> can<00:04:53.080> play<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.379> game

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
exactly cheap but you can play the game

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.990 
exactly cheap but you can play the game
without<00:04:53.680> them<00:04:54.069> so<00:04:54.219> they<00:04:54.310> don't<00:04:54.400> exactly<00:04:54.639> ruin

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
without them so they don't exactly ruin

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.570 
without them so they don't exactly ruin
the<00:04:55.090> experience<00:04:55.360> if<00:04:55.539> you<00:04:55.629> can't<00:04:55.840> afford<00:04:55.990> them

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
the experience if you can't afford them

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.580 
the experience if you can't afford them
but<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.879> game<00:04:58.060> is<00:04:58.270> far<00:04:58.689> far<00:04:59.229> more<00:04:59.289> satisfying

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
but the game is far far more satisfying

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.529 
but the game is far far more satisfying
when<00:05:00.039> your<00:05:00.159> car<00:05:00.310> looks<00:05:00.490> pimp<00:05:00.699> so<00:05:01.060> keep<00:05:01.360> that<00:05:01.389> in

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
when your car looks pimp so keep that in

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.350
