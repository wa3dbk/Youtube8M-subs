00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
okay so today we're going to make some

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.370 
okay so today we're going to make some
spaghetti<00:00:03.000> squash<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.110> lot<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.290> people

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
spaghetti squash and a lot of people

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.440 
spaghetti squash and a lot of people
avoid<00:00:04.830> doing<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.339> just<00:00:05.700> because<00:00:05.759> it's

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
avoid doing this just because it's

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.629 
avoid doing this just because it's
really<00:00:06.960> difficult<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.470> cut<00:00:07.649> into<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.429> it

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
really difficult to cut into and it

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.669 
really difficult to cut into and it
takes<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.940> really<00:00:09.090> long<00:00:09.179> time<00:00:09.330> so<00:00:09.960> one<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.530> the

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
takes a really long time so one of the

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.080 
takes a really long time so one of the
things<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.099> like<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.820> make<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
things that I like to do to make the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.270 
things that I like to do to make the
process<00:00:12.300> easier<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:13.349> I'll<00:00:13.620> take<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> fork<00:00:14.219> and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
process easier is I'll take a fork and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.480 
process easier is I'll take a fork and
just<00:00:14.639> stab<00:00:15.529> around<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.680> spaghetti<00:00:17.010> squash<00:00:17.160> in

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
just stab around the spaghetti squash in

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.400 
just stab around the spaghetti squash in
multiple<00:00:17.910> places<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.539> then<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:18.990> stick<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.260> in

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
multiple places and then I stick it in

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.200 
multiple places and then I stick it in
the<00:00:19.500> microwave<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:19.949> about<00:00:20.220> four<00:00:20.609> minutes<00:00:20.760> and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
the microwave for about four minutes and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.109 
the microwave for about four minutes and
that<00:00:21.930> will<00:00:22.109> allow<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.160> spaghetti<00:00:23.670> squash<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
that will allow the spaghetti squash to

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.750 
that will allow the spaghetti squash to
cook<00:00:24.480> just<00:00:24.720> partially<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.590> like<00:00:26.039> mine<00:00:26.310> roasted

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
cook just partially I like mine roasted

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.859 
cook just partially I like mine roasted
you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.090> cook<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.449> all<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.570> way<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
you can cook it all the way in the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.839 
you can cook it all the way in the
microwave<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.470> want<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.099> don't<00:00:29.429> want<00:00:29.609> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
microwave if you want to I don't want to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.510 
microwave if you want to I don't want to
so<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:31.380> let<00:00:31.529> us<00:00:31.650> sit<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> counter<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
so you let us sit on the counter for a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760 
so you let us sit on the counter for a
few<00:00:32.730> minutes<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.239> starts<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.380> you

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
few minutes and it starts to see you you

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.470 
few minutes and it starts to see you you
can<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.160> I've<00:00:35.340> had<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.670> sitting<00:00:35.880> here<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
can see I've had this sitting here and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
can see I've had this sitting here and
it's<00:00:36.989> gotten<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.500> bit<00:00:37.739> soft<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.370> that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
it's gotten a little bit soft here that

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.990 
it's gotten a little bit soft here that
makes<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.180> much<00:00:39.360> easier<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.870> cut<00:00:40.260> into<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.430> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
makes it much easier to cut into so you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790 
makes it much easier to cut into so you
just<00:00:42.030> you're<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> cut<00:00:43.050> off<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.410> ends

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
just you're going to cut off the ends

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.709 
just you're going to cut off the ends
here<00:00:44.660> cut<00:00:45.660> off<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:46.020> side<00:00:46.260> turn<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.250> around

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
here cut off one side turn it around

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.760 
here cut off one side turn it around
we'll<00:00:48.719> cut<00:00:48.870> off<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> other<00:00:49.170> side<00:00:50.390> garbage<00:00:51.770> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
we'll cut off the other side garbage and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:05.770 
we'll cut off the other side garbage and
then<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.219> cut<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.670> down<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> center

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.660 

and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.049> snaps<00:01:07.409> right<00:01:07.560> open<00:01:08.009> that's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
and then it just snaps right open that's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.249 
and then it just snaps right open that's
much<00:01:08.939> easier<00:01:08.970> than<00:01:09.600> trying<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.960> cut<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
much easier than trying to cut it

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.380 
much easier than trying to cut it
without<00:01:10.470> having<00:01:10.820> steamed<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.180> bit

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390
