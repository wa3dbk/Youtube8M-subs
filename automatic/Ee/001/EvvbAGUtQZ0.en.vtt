picture<00:01:45.509> hook<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:46.110> comes<00:01:46.350> built<00:01:46.680> into<00:01:47.009> TV<00:01:47.250> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
picture hook that comes built into TV so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.850 
picture hook that comes built into TV so
you<00:01:48.119> basically<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.079> hang<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
you basically be like and hang it on the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.530 
you basically be like and hang it on the
hook<00:01:50.040> because<00:01:50.430> normally<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> bracket<00:01:51.420> goes

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
hook because normally a bracket goes

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.929 
hook because normally a bracket goes
behind<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> TV<00:01:52.259> yeah<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:53.070> bracket<00:01:53.579> actually

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
behind the TV yeah this bracket actually

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.330 
behind the TV yeah this bracket actually
does<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> TV<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.680> pushed<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> wall

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
does not so the TV is pushed to the wall

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.999 
does not so the TV is pushed to the wall
so<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> TV<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.630> may<00:01:57.810> gonna<00:01:58.020> hide<00:01:58.200> my<00:01:58.380> ports<00:01:58.740> not

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
so the TV is may gonna hide my ports not

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.770 
so the TV is may gonna hide my ports not
gonna<00:01:59.159> hide<00:01:59.340> reports<00:01:59.850> everything<00:02:00.149> has<00:02:00.360> access

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
gonna hide reports everything has access

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.840 
gonna hide reports everything has access
to<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> TV<00:02:01.920> hanging<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.460> wall<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
to it so the TV hanging on the wall is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.139 
to it so the TV hanging on the wall is
about<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.270> thing<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:03.960> awesome<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.189> what

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
about this thing that's awesome so what

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.570 
about this thing that's awesome so what
all<00:02:06.329> describes<00:02:06.990> flow

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
all describes flow

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.300 
all describes flow
okay<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:08.690> building<00:02:08.990> design<00:02:09.320> is<00:02:09.590> basically

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
okay so building design is basically

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.510 
okay so building design is basically
three<00:02:10.880> things<00:02:10.910> how<00:02:11.660> thin<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.980> ultra

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
three things how thin it is the ultra

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.450 
three things how thin it is the ultra
flushmount<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:15.020> we<00:02:15.140> created<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.830> then<00:02:16.220> also

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
flushmount that we created and then also

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.790 
flushmount that we created and then also
the<00:02:17.180> way<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.480> screen<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.990> designed<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
the way the screen is designed it the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.400 
the way the screen is designed it the
image<00:02:19.130> kind<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.400> floats<00:02:19.880> on<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.240> front<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
image kind of floats on the front of the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.020 
image kind of floats on the front of the
of<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.040> screen<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.580> almost<00:02:22.670> seems<00:02:22.970> like

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
of the screen so it almost seems like

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.580 
of the screen so it almost seems like
it's<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.330> window<00:02:23.720> instead<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.260> television

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
it's a window instead of a television

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.000 
it's a window instead of a television
set<00:02:24.860> what<00:02:25.610> how<00:02:26.570> does<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:26.840> work<00:02:27.020> well<00:02:27.560> well

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
set what how does that work well well

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.140 
set what how does that work well well
the<00:02:28.070> first<00:02:28.310> thing<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.550> there's<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.880> layer<00:02:29.120> of

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
the first thing is there's a layer of

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.090 
the first thing is there's a layer of
glass<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.510> goes<00:02:29.840> from<00:02:29.960> edge<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.290> edge<00:02:30.500> and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
glass that goes from edge to edge and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.490 
glass that goes from edge to edge and
then<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.850> bezel<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.420> incredibly<00:02:32.990> narrow<00:02:33.260> so

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
then the bezel is incredibly narrow so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.160 
then the bezel is incredibly narrow so
that<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:34.460> looks<00:02:34.580> like<00:02:34.730> it's<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.540> picture

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
that it looks like it's just a picture

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.840 
that it looks like it's just a picture
just<00:02:36.410> floating<00:02:37.160> there<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.520> looks<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.820> a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
just floating there it looks like a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.160 
just floating there it looks like a
picture<00:02:38.000> yeah<00:02:38.330> well<00:02:38.690> I'll<00:02:38.750> be<00:02:38.870> honest

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
picture yeah well I'll be honest

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.620 
picture yeah well I'll be honest
sometimes<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:39.950> see<00:02:40.370> really<00:02:40.700> cool<00:02:41.090> new<00:02:41.360> things

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
sometimes I I see really cool new things

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.840 
sometimes I I see really cool new things
like<00:02:41.870> this<00:02:42.020> but<00:02:42.230> it's<00:02:42.830> sometimes<00:02:43.280> it's<00:02:43.610> just<00:02:43.670> a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
like this but it's sometimes it's just a

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.240 
like this but it's sometimes it's just a
gimmick<00:02:44.030> am<00:02:44.330> I<00:02:44.420> gonna<00:02:44.570> end<00:02:44.810> up<00:02:45.250> just

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
gimmick am I gonna end up just

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.190 
gimmick am I gonna end up just
sacrificing<00:02:47.090> my<00:02:47.330> image<00:02:47.570> quality<00:02:47.720> because

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
sacrificing my image quality because

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.870 
sacrificing my image quality because
it's<00:02:48.410> super<00:02:48.530> thin<00:02:48.860> well<00:02:49.310> we've<00:02:49.430> always<00:02:49.610> said

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
it's super thin well we've always said

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.330 
it's super thin well we've always said
there's<00:02:50.090> more<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.540> 4k<00:02:51.110> than<00:02:51.709> just<00:02:52.010> resolution

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
there's more to 4k than just resolution

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.210 
there's more to 4k than just resolution
we<00:02:52.760> did<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.120> three<00:02:53.330> years<00:02:53.510> ago<00:02:53.950> we<00:02:54.950> know<00:02:55.070> that

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
we did that three years ago we know that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.440 
we did that three years ago we know that
when<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.340> look<00:02:55.490> outside<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.820> window<00:02:56.060> supposed

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
when you look outside a window supposed

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.850 
when you look outside a window supposed
to<00:02:56.510> look<00:02:56.600> like<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.810> window<00:02:57.170> there's<00:02:57.440> more<00:02:57.590> color

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
to look like a window there's more color

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.740 
to look like a window there's more color
and<00:02:58.070> there's<00:02:58.610> more<00:02:58.760> contrast<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.540> there's

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
and there's more contrast and there's

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.240 
and there's more contrast and there's
more<00:02:59.930> details<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:00.620> it's<00:03:00.740> gonna<00:03:00.830> look<00:03:00.920> more

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
more details so it's gonna look more

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.220 
more details so it's gonna look more
like<00:03:01.430> real<00:03:01.640> life<00:03:01.670> more<00:03:02.060> like<00:03:02.270> real<00:03:02.480> life<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:03.080> we

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
like real life more like real life so we

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.800 
like real life more like real life so we
have<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.410> new<00:03:03.620> processor<00:03:04.340> called<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.700> x1<00:03:05.240> or<00:03:05.450> 4k

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
have a new processor called the x1 or 4k

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.770 
have a new processor called the x1 or 4k
processor<00:03:06.590> x1<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.610> what<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.240> does<00:03:08.480> is<00:03:08.540> that

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
processor x1 and what that does is that

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.320 
processor x1 and what that does is that
actually<00:03:09.140> makes<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.070> bigger<00:03:10.370> box<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:10.910> crayons

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
actually makes the bigger box of crayons

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.600 
actually makes the bigger box of crayons
from<00:03:11.570> triluminos<00:03:11.930> even<00:03:12.410> bigger<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.920> the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
from triluminos even bigger and the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.240 
from triluminos even bigger and the
incredible<00:03:14.209> brightness<00:03:14.900> range<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.380> XD<00:03:16.070> are

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
incredible brightness range of XD are

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.060 
incredible brightness range of XD are
even<00:03:16.910> brighter<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.810> no<00:03:17.989> am<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.530> just<00:03:18.590> gonna<00:03:18.830> see

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
even brighter and no am I just gonna see

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.490 
even brighter and no am I just gonna see
this<00:03:19.220> x1<00:03:19.670> processor<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.600> one<00:03:20.750> or<00:03:21.080> is<00:03:21.380> it

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
this x1 processor and this one or is it

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.720 
this x1 processor and this one or is it
across<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.769> board<00:03:22.010> what<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.160> nice<00:03:22.340> thing<00:03:22.580> is

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
across the board what a nice thing is

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.300

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.560 
available in all these different
settings<00:06:16.010> but<00:06:16.370> it's<00:06:16.490> always<00:06:16.669> very<00:06:16.940> difficult

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
settings but it's always very difficult

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.610 
settings but it's always very difficult
to<00:06:17.630> operate<00:06:17.720> it<00:06:17.960> could<00:06:18.110> be<00:06:18.169> very<00:06:18.199> intimidating

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620
