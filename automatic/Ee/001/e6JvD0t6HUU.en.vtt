00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
got to lip colors because recently i've

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.949 
got to lip colors because recently i've
just<00:03:16.790> been<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.060> obsessed<00:03:17.209> with<00:03:17.540> bright<00:03:17.750> lips

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
just been so obsessed with bright lips

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.449 
just been so obsessed with bright lips
although<00:03:18.260> i<00:03:18.290> do<00:03:18.410> have<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.620> nude<00:03:18.799> lip<00:03:18.829> on<00:03:19.100> today

although i do have a nude lip on today

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.640 
although i do have a nude lip on today
so<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.120> first<00:03:20.299> lip<00:03:20.690> color<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.109> I<00:03:21.140> got<00:03:21.380> is

one of the new colors and this is an
juicy<00:03:26.299> papaya<00:03:26.690> which<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.290> actually<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.829> a

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
juicy papaya which is actually just a

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.090 
juicy papaya which is actually just a
really<00:03:28.310> pretty<00:03:28.579> light<00:03:29.480> coral<00:03:29.930> color<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.560> it's

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
really pretty light coral color and it's

really pretty light coral color and it's
just<00:03:31.280> really<00:03:31.430> really<00:03:31.549> nice<00:03:31.940> it's<00:03:32.209> not<00:03:32.359> a<00:03:32.390> map

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
just really really nice it's not a map

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.449 
just really really nice it's not a map
but<00:03:32.989> it<00:03:33.079> goes<00:03:33.200> on<00:03:33.320> really<00:03:33.380> silky<00:03:33.829> smooth<00:03:34.190> and

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
but it goes on really silky smooth and

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.830 
but it goes on really silky smooth and
you<00:03:34.730> can<00:03:34.880> build<00:03:35.060> up<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.299> color<00:03:35.450> which<00:03:35.720> is

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
you can build up the color which is

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.940 
you can build up the color which is
something<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.200> really<00:03:36.230> like<00:03:36.440> about<00:03:36.590> these

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
something I really like about these

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.319
