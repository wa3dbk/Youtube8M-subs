the<00:01:06.570> tank<00:01:06.840> gets<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.260> debuff<00:01:07.740> which<00:01:07.920> makes<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the tank gets a debuff which makes to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.969 
the tank gets a debuff which makes to
avoid<00:01:08.400> zone<00:01:08.670> hurt<00:01:08.909> more<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:10.200> people<00:01:10.799> are

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
avoid zone hurt more and more people are

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.550 
avoid zone hurt more and more people are
taking<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.790> avoid<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.659> don't<00:01:13.260> know<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
taking this to avoid that I don't know I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
taking this to avoid that I don't know I
guess<00:01:13.680> maybe<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.250> I'm<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.430> pally<00:01:14.640> tank<00:01:14.939> or

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
guess maybe because I'm a pally tank or

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.910 
guess maybe because I'm a pally tank or
any<00:01:15.600> other<00:01:15.780> tank<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.110> has<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> lot<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.470> magic

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
any other tank that has a lot of magic

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.770 
any other tank that has a lot of magic
mitigation<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.580> no<00:01:17.700> big<00:01:17.850> deal<00:01:17.880> should<00:01:18.659> be

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
mitigation it's no big deal should be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
mitigation it's no big deal should be
able<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> move<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.590> only<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.220> tick<00:01:20.460> of

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
able to move and only get one tick of

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.850 
able to move and only get one tick of
this<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.060> by<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> end<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.229> mean<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.710> really

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
this and by the end I mean it really

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.280 
this and by the end I mean it really
hurts<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:23.790> worth<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.479> tanking<00:01:25.049> for

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
hurts but it's not worth to tanking for

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
hurts but it's not worth to tanking for
it<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.770> did<00:01:25.979> hit<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.159> enrage<00:01:26.490> timer<00:01:26.729> once

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
it we did hit the enrage timer once

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.880 
it we did hit the enrage timer once
maybe<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.420> we're<00:01:27.570> 3<00:01:27.780> healing<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.619> maybe<00:01:28.770> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
maybe because we're 3 healing so maybe a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.219 
maybe because we're 3 healing so maybe a
to<00:01:29.159> heal<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.820> tank<00:01:30.060> situation<00:01:30.630> works<00:01:31.020> just

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
to heal to tank situation works just

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.260 
to heal to tank situation works just
fine<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:31.979> felt<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.430> tank<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.090> fine

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
fine but we felt one tank was just fine

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
fine but we felt one tank was just fine
when<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.900> these<00:01:34.020> void<00:01:34.259> zones<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.829> put

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
when you do these void zones just put

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.170 
when you do these void zones just put
them<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> nice<00:01:35.369> big<00:01:35.520> circle<00:01:35.880> around<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
them in a nice big circle around the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.609 
them in a nice big circle around the
room<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.509> let's<00:01:36.930> move<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> next<00:01:37.439> thing

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
room and let's move on to the next thing

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.859 
room and let's move on to the next thing
ok<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.970> now<00:01:39.030> we're<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.329> about<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> kill

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
ok so right now we're just about to kill

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.499 
ok so right now we're just about to kill
water<00:01:40.140> guy<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.070> move<00:01:41.310> mr.<00:01:41.820> void<00:01:42.030> zone<00:01:42.299> guy

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
water guy so we move mr. void zone guy

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.819 
water guy so we move mr. void zone guy
way<00:01:42.840> out<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.320> he's<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.710> do

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
way out here because he's going to do

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.120 
way out here because he's going to do
this<00:01:43.920> huge<00:01:44.430> radius<00:01:45.329> don't<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.799> wind

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
this huge radius don't be in this wind

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.969 
this huge radius don't be in this wind
 there<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.770> use

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
 there it is you see it so you use

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
 there it is you see it so you use
your<00:01:50.130> speed<00:01:50.340> boost<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.360> then

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
your speed boost you get out and then

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.090 
your speed boost you get out and then
you<00:01:51.780> take<00:01:51.960> him<00:01:52.140> right<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> edge<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
you take him right on the edge of it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.590 
you take him right on the edge of it
he's<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> drop<00:01:53.610> about<00:01:53.790> 3<00:01:54.149> void<00:01:54.329> zones

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
he's going to drop about 3 void zones

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.289 
he's going to drop about 3 void zones
which<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.350> should<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.740> laterally<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
which you should do laterally and then I

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.670 
which you should do laterally and then I
kind<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.020> up<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.200> little<00:01:58.320> bit<00:01:58.500> but

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
kind of it up a little bit but

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.929 
kind of it up a little bit but
that's<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.009> way<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.159> want<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> show<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.700> want

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
that's the way you want to show you want

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.219 
that's the way you want to show you want
to<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.210> around<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.570> edge<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.930> other<00:02:01.049> one

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
to do it around the edge the other one

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
to do it around the edge the other one
basically<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.159> soft<00:02:02.399> enrage<00:02:02.790> you're

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
basically it's a soft enrage you're

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.789 
basically it's a soft enrage you're
going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> run<00:02:03.659> out<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.780> space<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.649> don't

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
going to run out of space if you don't

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.590 
going to run out of space if you don't
kill<00:02:05.009> them<00:02:05.189> before<00:02:05.520> he<00:02:05.759> does<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.360> huge

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
kill them before he does all this huge

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.359 
kill them before he does all this huge
