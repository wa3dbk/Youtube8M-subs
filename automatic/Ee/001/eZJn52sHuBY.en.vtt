00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
what you guys will be waiting for how to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.029 
what you guys will be waiting for how to
breathe<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.520> evil<00:00:44.940> fish<00:00:45.410> firstly<00:00:46.410> since<00:00:46.920> this

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
breathe the evil fish firstly since this

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.490 
breathe the evil fish firstly since this
is<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.219> permanent<00:00:47.700> fish<00:00:47.969> isn't<00:00:48.329> limited<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
is a permanent fish isn't limited the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.220 
is a permanent fish isn't limited the
evil<00:00:49.770> fish<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.219> bred<00:00:50.460> using<00:00:50.850> any

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
evil fish can be bred using any

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.630 
evil fish can be bred using any
combination<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.350> fish<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.399> these

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
combination of fish that have these

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.510 
combination of fish that have these
traits<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:55.320> are<00:00:55.350> countless<00:00:55.980> amounts<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
traits so there are countless amounts of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.700 
traits so there are countless amounts of
ways<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.149> breathe<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.750> fish<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.620> I've

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
ways to breathe this fish but I've

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.260 
ways to breathe this fish but I've
compiled<00:00:59.190> some<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> simplest

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
compiled some of the simplest

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.869 
compiled some of the simplest
combinations<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.320> these<00:01:01.859> include<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.520> mean

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
combinations and these include the mean

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.990 
combinations and these include the mean
and<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> dreamy<00:01:03.750> fish<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.769> shy<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> tough

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and the dreamy fish be shy and the tough

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
and the dreamy fish be shy and the tough
fish<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.540> finally<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> brave<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.430> rebel

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
fish and finally the brave and the rebel

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420 
fish and finally the brave and the rebel
fish<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.530> guys<00:01:10.740> those<00:01:11.159> are<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
fish so that's right guys those are the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.120 
fish so that's right guys those are the
simplest<00:01:12.119> possible<00:01:12.500> combinations<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.710> you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
simplest possible combinations that you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
simplest possible combinations that you
need<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.580> breathe<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> evil<00:01:15.360> fish<00:01:15.630> keep<00:01:16.259> in

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
need to breathe the evil fish keep in

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.289 
need to breathe the evil fish keep in
mind<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.009> possible<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> breed<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.000> fish

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
mind it is possible to breed these fish

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.990 
mind it is possible to breed these fish
using<00:01:18.810> tons<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.590> other<00:01:19.710> combinations<00:01:20.460> but

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
using tons of other combinations but

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.730 
using tons of other combinations but
look<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.390> time<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.810> three<00:01:22.080> hours<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
look for the time of three hours and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.090 
look for the time of three hours and
you'll<00:01:23.130> most<00:01:23.400> likely<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.270> evil<00:01:24.840> fish<00:01:25.100> so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you'll most likely have the evil fish so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.859 
you'll most likely have the evil fish so
there<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.520> guys<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.060> always<00:01:27.119> make

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
there you have a guys as always make

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
there you have a guys as always make
sure<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.170> keep<00:01:28.380> trying<00:01:28.710> you'll<00:01:29.220> rarely<00:01:29.520> get

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
sure you keep trying you'll rarely get

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.060 
sure you keep trying you'll rarely get
it<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.299> time<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.869> keep<00:01:31.590> trying<00:01:31.799> with

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
it the first time but keep trying with

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
it the first time but keep trying with
those<00:01:32.250> simple<00:01:32.700> combinations<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.780> will

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
those simple combinations and you will

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
those simple combinations and you will
eventually<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.159> evil<00:01:35.460> fish<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:36.119> you

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
eventually get the evil fish if you

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.490 
eventually get the evil fish if you
would<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.810> how<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.049> breed<00:01:37.259> any

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
would like to know how to breed any

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.859 
would like to know how to breed any
other<00:01:37.890> fish<00:01:38.220> there<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> link<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> both<00:01:39.540> might
