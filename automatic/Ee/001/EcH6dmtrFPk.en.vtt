00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.350 
subjects under its care let me ask you
through<00:03:25.830> zemeckis<00:03:26.250> do<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:26.940> think<00:03:27.180> that

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
through zemeckis do you think that

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.750

rulers in the true sense really want to
rule<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.240> don't<00:03:30.750> think<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.530> know<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.280> very
