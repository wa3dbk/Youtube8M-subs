the punch connects there's the
clothesline

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.460 

one<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:38.940> two<00:00:39.180> big<00:00:39.450> moves<00:00:39.720> at<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> crucial<00:00:40.230> point

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
one or two big moves at a crucial point

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.710 
one or two big moves at a crucial point
could<00:00:41.280> change<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.970> direction<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
could change the direction of it

00:00:42.720 --> 00:01:02.000 
could change the direction of it
completely

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.429 

but<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.370> certainly<00:01:02.879> effective<00:01:03.629> he<00:01:04.320> had

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
but it's certainly effective he had

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:13.480 
but it's certainly effective he had
dissipated<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.129> move<00:01:05.339> perfectly

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.690 

seeing<00:01:14.119> a<00:01:14.210> match<00:01:14.390> like<00:01:14.420> this

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.300 

it<00:01:19.210> just<00:01:19.509> can't<00:01:19.780> experience<00:01:20.259> a<00:01:20.619> thrill<00:01:21.070> like

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
it just can't experience a thrill like

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.969 
it just can't experience a thrill like
this<00:01:21.600> anywhere<00:01:22.600> else<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.140> that's<00:01:23.799> because

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
this anywhere else and that's because

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.440 
this anywhere else and that's because
you're<00:01:24.219> not<00:01:24.340> going<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.520> see<00:01:24.700> athletes<00:01:25.000> like

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
you're not going to see athletes like

you're not going to see athletes like
the<00:01:25.570> WV<00:01:26.049> superstars<00:01:26.649> anywhere<00:01:27.250> else<00:01:27.460> you

the WV superstars anywhere else you

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.330 
the WV superstars anywhere else you
certainly<00:01:28.780> aren't<00:01:29.049> they're<00:01:29.829> the<00:01:29.979> greatest

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
certainly aren't they're the greatest

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.550 
certainly aren't they're the greatest
athletes<00:01:30.969> in<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.149> world<00:01:31.329> and<00:01:31.659> this<00:01:32.229> is<00:01:32.409> the

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
athletes in the world and this is the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.169 
athletes in the world and this is the
only<00:01:32.590> place<00:01:33.130> you'll<00:01:33.399> see<00:01:33.610> them<00:01:33.789> doing<00:01:33.820> what

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
only place you'll see them doing what

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:56.100 
only place you'll see them doing what
they<00:01:34.390> do<00:01:34.720> best

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.070 

he's<00:01:56.650> taking<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.250> little<00:01:57.430> time<00:01:57.700> begins<00:01:58.270> upon<00:01:58.630> he

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
he's taking a little time begins upon he

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:14.180 
he's taking a little time begins upon he
said

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.910 

so<00:02:14.760> if<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.750> certainly<00:02:16.350> been<00:02:16.590> one<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.860> the
