this is very important for me to see how

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.520 
this is very important for me to see how
we<00:02:02.250> connect<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.940> each<00:02:03.240> other<00:02:03.570> right<00:02:03.870> now<00:02:04.140> in

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
we connect with each other right now in

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.010 
we connect with each other right now in
the<00:02:04.680> program<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.850> very<00:02:05.970> nice<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.720> have

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the program it's it's very nice to have

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.050 
the program it's it's very nice to have
this<00:02:07.260> social<00:02:07.500> connection<00:02:08.250> we're<00:02:08.490> building<00:02:08.880> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
this social connection we're building a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.210 
this social connection we're building a
strong<00:02:09.360> community<00:02:09.540> and<00:02:10.229> we're<00:02:10.890> supporting

strong community and we're supporting

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.900 
strong community and we're supporting
each<00:02:11.490> other<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:12.180> think<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:13.350> is<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:14.010> small

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
each other I think this is a small

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.720 
each other I think this is a small
example<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.780> how<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.580> whole

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
example of how we would like the whole

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.090 
example of how we would like the whole
