this statue is called the kelpies it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.760 
this statue is called the kelpies it's
you<00:03:11.120> know<00:03:11.270> it<00:03:11.390> exists<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:11.900> real<00:03:12.080> life<00:03:12.290> too<00:03:12.620> go

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
you know it exists in real life too go

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.290 
you know it exists in real life too go
check<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.130> out<00:03:13.250> but<00:03:13.670> yeah<00:03:13.850> why<00:03:14.030> would<00:03:14.180> they

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
check it out but yeah why would they

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.970 
check it out but yeah why would they
choose<00:03:14.570> something<00:03:14.720> with<00:03:14.989> two<00:03:15.170> horses<00:03:15.500> in<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.830> I

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
choose something with two horses in it I

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.710 
choose something with two horses in it I
think<00:03:16.040> that's<00:03:16.430> quite<00:03:16.760> an<00:03:16.880> obvious<00:03:17.060> hint<00:03:17.510> there

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
think that's quite an obvious hint there

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.300 
think that's quite an obvious hint there
that<00:03:17.870> they're<00:03:18.020> robbing<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.350> our<00:03:18.470> faces<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.130> I

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
that they're robbing in our faces and I

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.310 
that they're robbing in our faces and I
think<00:03:19.610> that<00:03:19.820> they're<00:03:20.030> definitely<00:03:20.320> there's

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
think that they're definitely there's

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.530 
think that they're definitely there's
something<00:03:21.770> bubbling<00:03:22.310> under<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.700> surface<00:03:22.790> and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
something bubbling under the surface and

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.240 
something bubbling under the surface and
I<00:03:23.660> think<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.080> horses<00:03:24.260> are<00:03:24.680> going<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:24.980> emerge

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
I think that horses are going to emerge

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.300 
I think that horses are going to emerge

middle sent a spotlight you know I'm
saying<00:03:54.350> I<00:03:54.680> think<00:03:54.890> they're<00:03:55.010> just<00:03:55.130> trying<00:03:55.220> to

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
saying I think they're just trying to

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.010 
saying I think they're just trying to
make<00:03:55.550> it<00:03:55.700> obvious<00:03:55.820> and<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.660> think<00:03:56.900> that's

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
make it obvious and I think that's

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.720 
make it obvious and I think that's
another<00:03:57.230> subtle<00:03:57.650> hint<00:03:57.830> there<00:03:58.040> but<00:03:58.370> not<00:03:58.520> just

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730

I'm<00:05:12.560> not<00:05:12.740> sure<00:05:12.800> about<00:05:13.009> this<00:05:13.279> but<00:05:13.490> I've<00:05:13.580> looked

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
I'm not sure about this but I've looked

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.209 
I'm not sure about this but I've looked
through<00:05:13.939> 4j<00:05:14.509> Studios<00:05:14.569> timeline<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:15.740> that

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
through 4j Studios timeline and that

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.129 
through 4j Studios timeline and that
tweet<00:05:16.460> is<00:05:16.639> no<00:05:16.849> longer<00:05:17.120> those

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
tweet is no longer those

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.730 
tweet is no longer those
tweeted<00:05:18.650> on<00:05:18.800> like<00:05:19.009> the<00:05:19.189> 17th<00:05:19.789> of<00:05:20.080> July<00:05:21.080> I<00:05:21.379> think

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
tweeted on like the 17th of July I think

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.290 
tweeted on like the 17th of July I think
I<00:05:22.009> think<00:05:22.400> it<00:05:22.460> was<00:05:22.550> some<00:05:22.699> time<00:05:22.939> but<00:05:23.090> it<00:05:23.180> was

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
I think it was some time but it was

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.480 
I think it was some time but it was
quite<00:05:23.509> recently<00:05:23.990> I<00:05:24.289> can't<00:05:24.889> find<00:05:25.099> that<00:05:25.250> tweet

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
quite recently I can't find that tweet

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.399 
quite recently I can't find that tweet
anymore<00:05:25.849> so<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.180> think<00:05:26.330> that<00:05:26.779> they've<00:05:26.930> deleted

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
anymore so I think that they've deleted

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.019 
anymore so I think that they've deleted
it<00:05:27.529> so<00:05:27.800> yeah<00:05:28.009> that's<00:05:28.279> just<00:05:28.370> a<00:05:28.580> bit<00:05:28.729> suspicious

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
it so yeah that's just a bit suspicious

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.119 
it so yeah that's just a bit suspicious
while<00:05:29.419> they<00:05:29.599> tweet<00:05:29.870> about<00:05:30.020> this<00:05:30.440> horse<00:05:30.710> mashup

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
while they tweet about this horse mashup

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.070 
while they tweet about this horse mashup
pack<00:05:31.339> and<00:05:31.699> then<00:05:31.940> delete<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.419> tweet<00:05:32.690> so<00:05:32.930> that's

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
pack and then delete the tweet so that's

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.570 
pack and then delete the tweet so that's
another<00:05:33.319> hint<00:05:33.589> now<00:05:33.800> I've<00:05:33.889> got<00:05:34.069> one<00:05:34.219> more<00:05:34.400> hint

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
another hint now I've got one more hint

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.399 
another hint now I've got one more hint
before<00:05:34.759> the<00:05:35.060> end<00:05:35.150> of<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.360> video<00:05:35.599> and<00:05:35.870> this<00:05:36.229> was

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
before the end of the video and this was

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.439 
before the end of the video and this was
absolutely<00:05:36.979> ages<00:05:37.279> ago<00:05:37.580> so<00:05:38.089> this<00:05:38.210> one's

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
absolutely ages ago so this one's

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.390 
absolutely ages ago so this one's
probably<00:05:38.690> like<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.199> least<00:05:39.409> relevant<00:05:39.889> hint<00:05:40.250> of

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
probably like the least relevant hint of

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.070 
probably like the least relevant hint of
all<00:05:40.669> it<00:05:41.300> was<00:05:41.509> on<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:41.779> 20th<00:05:42.349> of<00:05:42.379> May<00:05:43.060> 2013

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000

big updates ignoring the bug fixes
so<00:06:06.919> surely<00:06:07.669> horses<00:06:08.539> should<00:06:08.990> be<00:06:09.139> on<00:06:09.259> their<00:06:09.409> way

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:09.439

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
a year and we know that in a year's time

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.659 
a year and we know that in a year's time

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.399 
surely they can produce some horses
they've<00:06:28.879> done<00:06:29.449> the<00:06:29.599> coding<00:06:29.779> of<00:06:30.139> it

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:30.409 
they've done the coding of it

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:31.809 
they've done the coding of it
I<00:06:30.440> don't<00:06:30.830> know<00:06:30.889> they've<00:06:31.099> fiddled<00:06:31.459> around<00:06:31.550> with

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:31.819 
I don't know they've fiddled around with

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:32.900 
I don't know they've fiddled around with
the<00:06:31.969> programming

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
the programming

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.520 
the programming
they<00:06:33.000> must<00:06:33.180> have<00:06:33.270> got<00:06:33.420> it<00:06:33.510> perfect<00:06:33.930> by<00:06:34.050> now<00:06:34.260> and

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
they must have got it perfect by now and

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.410 
they must have got it perfect by now and
maybe<00:06:34.770> they're<00:06:35.460> ready<00:06:35.610> to<00:06:35.670> release<00:06:36.030> it<00:06:36.060> in

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
maybe they're ready to release it in

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.420 
maybe they're ready to release it in
this<00:06:36.690> update<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:37.320> also<00:06:37.530> all<00:06:37.890> these<00:06:38.040> subtle

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
this update and also all these subtle

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.740 
this update and also all these subtle
hints<00:06:38.730> that<00:06:38.820> they're<00:06:39.000> suddenly<00:06:39.510> dropping

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
hints that they're suddenly dropping

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.990 
hints that they're suddenly dropping
surely<00:06:40.650> it<00:06:40.740> means<00:06:40.950> that<00:06:41.340> they're<00:06:41.550> trying<00:06:41.850> to

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
surely it means that they're trying to

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.840 
surely it means that they're trying to
build<00:06:42.420> us<00:06:42.540> up<00:06:42.720> to<00:06:43.020> the<00:06:43.290> release<00:06:43.590> of<00:06:43.830> 2:17<00:06:44.610> and

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
build us up to the release of 2:17 and

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.000 
build us up to the release of 2:17 and
horses<00:06:45.300> being<00:06:45.540> in<00:06:45.750> it<00:06:45.900> so<00:06:46.200> that's<00:06:46.650> the<00:06:46.800> end<00:06:46.920> of

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
horses being in it so that's the end of

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.350 
horses being in it so that's the end of

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
enjoyed it and if you did make sure to

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.950 
enjoyed it and if you did make sure to
slap<00:06:50.580> that<00:06:50.640> like<00:06:50.790> button<00:06:50.970> I<00:06:51.510> had<00:06:51.630> to<00:06:51.780> really

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
slap that like button I had to really

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.420 
slap that like button I had to really
investigate<00:06:52.440> to<00:06:52.710> find<00:06:52.860> all<00:06:53.010> these<00:06:53.130> little

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
investigate to find all these little

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.580 
investigate to find all these little
hints<00:06:53.610> everywhere<00:06:54.120> and<00:06:54.360> also<00:06:55.020> I<00:06:55.050> hope<00:06:55.410> I've

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
hints everywhere and also I hope I've

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.040 
hints everywhere and also I hope I've
persuaded<00:06:55.920> you<00:06:56.310> that<00:06:56.340> forces<00:06:56.880> will<00:06:57.090> be<00:06:57.210> in<00:06:57.240> 217

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
persuaded you that forces will be in 217

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.660 
persuaded you that forces will be in 217
because<00:06:58.380> I<00:06:58.470> really<00:06:58.770> believe<00:06:59.010> that<00:06:59.040> they<00:06:59.310> do<00:06:59.370> I

00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.670 
because I really believe that they do I

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.760 
because I really believe that they do I
know<00:06:59.760> it's<00:07:00.030> a<00:07:00.090> very<00:07:00.330> big<00:07:00.690> feature<00:07:01.020> but<00:07:01.500> to<00:07:01.650> you

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
know it's a very big feature but to you

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.890 
know it's a very big feature but to you
17<00:07:02.340> you<00:07:02.700> know<00:07:02.730> we<00:07:03.150> don't<00:07:03.270> even<00:07:03.510> know<00:07:03.630> when<00:07:03.780> it's

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
17 you know we don't even know when it's

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.000 
17 you know we don't even know when it's
going<00:07:03.990> to<00:07:04.050> be<00:07:04.170> released<00:07:04.470> it<00:07:04.620> might<00:07:04.800> not<00:07:04.980> even

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
going to be released it might not even

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.800 
going to be released it might not even
be<00:07:05.220> released<00:07:05.610> in<00:07:05.880> August<00:07:06.030> it<00:07:06.480> might<00:07:06.660> be

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
be released in August it might be

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.990 
be released in August it might be
released<00:07:07.110> in<00:07:07.410> September<00:07:07.650> or<00:07:08.250> even<00:07:08.490> October

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
released in September or even October

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.180 
released in September or even October
but<00:07:09.390> when<00:07:09.570> it<00:07:09.660> does<00:07:09.810> release<00:07:10.170> I<00:07:10.440> think<00:07:10.950> horses

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
but when it does release I think horses

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.890 
but when it does release I think horses
will<00:07:11.640> be<00:07:11.670> in<00:07:11.880> it<00:07:12.030> so<00:07:12.270> if<00:07:12.480> you<00:07:12.600> haven't<00:07:12.780> already
