they came up with is
mangalore's<00:01:42.040> blade<00:01:42.660> so<00:01:43.660> what<00:01:43.810> we've<00:01:43.960> done<00:01:44.140> is

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
mangalore's blade so what we've done is

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.450 
mangalore's blade so what we've done is
we've<00:01:44.470> designed<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.980> so<00:01:45.160> that<00:01:45.190> you've

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
we've designed it so that you've

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.060 
we've designed it so that you've
effectively<00:01:45.970> got<00:01:46.120> full<00:01:46.510> shape<00:01:46.780> charges<00:01:47.290> which

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
effectively got full shape charges which

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.610 
effectively got full shape charges which
fly<00:01:48.460> off<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.880> each<00:01:49.810> one<00:01:50.050> of<00:01:50.080> those<00:01:50.260> is<00:01:50.470> like<00:01:50.590> a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
fly off and each one of those is like a

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.860 
fly off and each one of those is like a
blade<00:01:51.460> or<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.700> sword<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.240> just<00:01:52.450> chopped

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
blade or a sword that just chopped

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.380 
blade or a sword that just chopped
straight<00:01:53.170> through<00:01:53.410> this<00:01:53.590> in<00:01:54.040> all<00:01:54.160> directions

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
straight through this in all directions

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.330 
straight through this in all directions
so<00:01:55.390> first<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.080> all<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.290> you<00:01:56.590> cut<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:57.010> and<00:01:57.160> then

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
so first of all you you cut it and then

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.640 
so first of all you you cut it and then
the<00:01:57.580> blast<00:01:57.820> effect<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.479> explosive<00:01:59.350> itself

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
the blast effect of the explosive itself

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.830 
the blast effect of the explosive itself
will<00:01:59.890> then<00:02:00.040> blow<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.550> out<00:02:00.790> of<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.030> way<00:02:01.180> so<00:02:01.690> it's

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
will then blow it out of the way so it's

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.290 
will then blow it out of the way so it's
a<00:02:01.900> two<00:02:02.110> two-stage<00:02:02.950> approach<00:02:03.280> it's<00:02:03.550> cut<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:04.090> and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
a two two-stage approach it's cut it and

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.410 
a two two-stage approach it's cut it and
then<00:02:04.390> blast<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:04.869> out<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.170> way<00:02:05.970> step<00:02:06.970> one<00:02:07.240> is

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
then blast it out of the way step one is

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.570 
then blast it out of the way step one is
to<00:02:07.540> pack<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.960> tube<00:02:08.170> with<00:02:08.410> plastic<00:02:08.950> explosive

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
to pack the tube with plastic explosive

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.630 
to pack the tube with plastic explosive
the<00:02:10.360> old<00:02:10.570> version<00:02:11.050> had<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.380> steel<00:02:11.770> body<00:02:12.040> but

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
the old version had a steel body but

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.060 
the old version had a steel body but
aluminum<00:02:12.910> makes<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.660> lighter<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.320> easier<00:02:14.770> to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
aluminum makes it lighter and easier to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.070 
aluminum makes it lighter and easier to
carry<00:02:15.750> perfect<00:02:16.750> for<00:02:16.959> special<00:02:17.380> operations<00:02:19.080> but

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
carry perfect for special operations but

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.960 
carry perfect for special operations but
the<00:02:20.230> real<00:02:20.500> design<00:02:20.920> breakthrough<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.820> that

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
the real design breakthrough is that

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.720 
the real design breakthrough is that
unlike<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.570> old<00:02:22.959> Bangalore<00:02:23.709> torpedo<00:02:24.220> version

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
unlike the old Bangalore torpedo version

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.449 
unlike the old Bangalore torpedo version
it<00:02:25.330> doesn't<00:02:25.660> rely<00:02:26.080> on<00:02:26.110> blast<00:02:26.620> alone<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.220> clear

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
it doesn't rely on blast alone to clear

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.820 
it doesn't rely on blast alone to clear
the<00:02:27.610> wire<00:02:27.820> instead<00:02:28.600> this<00:02:29.200> one<00:02:29.440> produces

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
the wire instead this one produces

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.640 
the wire instead this one produces
cutting<00:02:30.400> blades<00:02:30.730> which<00:02:31.300> shred<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.050> wire<00:02:32.290> into

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
cutting blades which shred the wire into

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.760 
cutting blades which shred the wire into
pieces<00:02:33.370> when<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.390> goes<00:02:34.630> off<00:02:34.870> what<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.620> does

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
pieces when that goes off what it does

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.800 
pieces when that goes off what it does
to<00:02:35.980> these<00:02:36.100> sides<00:02:36.430> as<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.790> starts<00:02:37.180> forming

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
to these sides as it starts forming

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.830 
to these sides as it starts forming
these<00:02:37.989> into<00:02:38.650> mini<00:02:39.130> projectiles<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.970> each<00:02:40.630> one

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
these into mini projectiles and each one

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.180 
these into mini projectiles and each one
of<00:02:40.930> these<00:02:41.020> will<00:02:41.260> come<00:02:41.380> out<00:02:41.530> as<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.709> blade<00:02:41.980> it's

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
of these will come out as a blade it's

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.490 
of these will come out as a blade it's
being<00:02:42.400> blown<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:43.390> way<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:43.989> socially<00:02:44.380> you've

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
being blown this way so socially you've

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.259 
being blown this way so socially you've
got<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> shape<00:02:45.190> charge<00:02:45.430> going<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.820> way<00:02:46.030> going

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
got a shape charge going this way going

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.080 
got a shape charge going this way going
down<00:02:46.750> out<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.650> sides<00:02:47.920> exactly<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:48.970> you're

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
down out to the sides exactly so you're

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.740 
down out to the sides exactly so you're
cutting<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:49.510> four<00:02:49.720> directions<00:02:49.860> absolutely

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
cutting in four directions absolutely

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.720 
cutting in four directions absolutely
next<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.020> fit<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> detonator<00:02:53.980> which<00:02:54.430> only

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
next you fit the detonator which only

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.610 
next you fit the detonator which only
takes<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.240> few<00:02:55.270> seconds<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:59.380> put<00:02:59.530> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
takes a few seconds you put the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.710 
takes a few seconds you put the
detonator<00:02:59.770> in<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.090> close<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.570> and

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
detonator in that and you close it and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.360 
detonator in that and you close it and
you<00:03:01.900> take<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.290> leads<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.010> wrap<00:03:03.190> them

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
you take the leads and you wrap them

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.830 
you take the leads and you wrap them
around<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.700> it's<00:03:04.030> perfect<00:03:04.360> for<00:03:04.390> electronic

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840

technician exactly then all you have to

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.380 
technician exactly then all you have to
do<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:09.310> place<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.790> blade<00:03:10.090> where<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.690> want<00:03:10.990> it

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
do is place the blade where you want it

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.270 
do is place the blade where you want it
picture<00:03:13.390> yourself<00:03:13.840> under<00:03:14.380> cover<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.770> night<00:03:14.890> in

picture yourself under cover of night in

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.880 
picture yourself under cover of night in
enemy<00:03:16.180> territory<00:03:16.210> and<00:03:16.960> then<00:03:17.170> imagine<00:03:17.709> how

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
enemy territory and then imagine how

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.949 
enemy territory and then imagine how
much<00:03:18.070> longer<00:03:18.550> it<00:03:18.730> will<00:03:18.760> take<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.150> cut<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:19.750> way

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
much longer it will take to cut your way

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.430 
much longer it will take to cut your way
through<00:03:20.200> with<00:03:21.010> wire<00:03:21.310> cutters<00:03:22.140> no<00:03:23.140> contest<00:03:25.440> ok

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
through with wire cutters no contest ok

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.530 
through with wire cutters no contest ok
it's<00:03:26.920> time<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.400> put<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.700> Bangalore<00:03:28.240> blade

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
it's time to put the Bangalore blade

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.479 
it's time to put the Bangalore blade
through<00:03:29.200> its<00:03:29.380> first<00:03:29.709> ever<00:03:29.920> test<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:33.220> best

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
through its first ever test the best

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.550 
through its first ever test the best
part<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:33.970> they're<00:03:34.540> letting<00:03:34.870> me<00:03:34.900> press<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
part is they're letting me press the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:55.290 
part is they're letting me press the
button<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:52.320> love<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.440> when<00:03:53.709> things<00:03:53.980> go<00:03:54.340> boom<00:03:54.790> but

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
button I love it when things go boom but

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.750 
button I love it when things go boom but
remember<00:03:55.720> blast<00:03:56.049> alone<00:03:56.440> won't<00:03:57.010> make<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.340> dent

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
remember blast alone won't make a dent

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.449 
remember blast alone won't make a dent
on<00:03:58.030> this<00:03:58.299> high-tensile<00:03:58.930> room<00:03:59.320> for<00:03:59.590> steel

on this high-tensile room for steel

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.920 
on this high-tensile room for steel
now<00:04:02.459> we<00:04:02.519> get<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.819> see<00:04:03.000> just<00:04:03.030> how<00:04:03.480> much<00:04:03.719> of<00:04:03.780> that

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
now we get to see just how much of that

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.910 
now we get to see just how much of that
Constantine<00:04:04.500> wire

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
Constantine wire

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.130 
Constantine wire
we've<00:04:05.069> moved<00:04:05.250> out<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.700> way<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:07.019> can

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
we've moved out of the way you can

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.869 
we've moved out of the way you can
definitely<00:04:07.319> see<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.159> it's<00:04:08.280> chopped<00:04:08.579> in

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
definitely see it that it's chopped in

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:15.219 
definitely see it that it's chopped in
it<00:04:11.329> it's<00:04:12.469> shredded<00:04:13.469> I<00:04:14.010> take<00:04:14.549> one<00:04:14.760> step<00:04:14.790> over

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
it it's shredded I take one step over

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:19.279 
it it's shredded I take one step over
it's<00:04:16.229> free<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.709> clear<00:04:17.239> nothing's<00:04:18.239> around<00:04:18.389> the

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
it's free and clear nothing's around the

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.749 
it's free and clear nothing's around the
trench<00:04:19.620> you<00:04:19.709> would<00:04:19.889> have<00:04:20.009> cleared<00:04:20.340> out<00:04:20.400> here

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
trench you would have cleared out here

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.879 
trench you would have cleared out here
anti-personnel<00:04:21.449> mines<00:04:21.840> if<00:04:22.079> they<00:04:22.229> were<00:04:22.289> embed

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
anti-personnel mines if they were embed

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.200 
anti-personnel mines if they were embed
in<00:04:23.009> there<00:04:23.100> anything<00:04:23.250> wire<00:04:23.520> yeah

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
in there anything wire yeah

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.730 
in there anything wire yeah
but<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.720> big<00:04:24.870> thing<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.080> means<00:04:25.350> just<00:04:25.560> look

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
but the big thing that means just look

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.450 
but the big thing that means just look
how<00:04:25.889> much<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.280> area<00:04:26.490> was<00:04:26.729> cleared<00:04:27.060> out

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
how much of this area was cleared out

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.400 
how much of this area was cleared out
and<00:04:29.460> you're<00:04:29.940> thinking<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.419> yourself<00:04:30.810> hold<00:04:31.259> on

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
and you're thinking to yourself hold on

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.090 
and you're thinking to yourself hold on
a<00:04:31.440> minute

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
a minute
