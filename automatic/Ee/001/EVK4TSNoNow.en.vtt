00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.539 
nothing about that
so<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:27.660> stuff<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.260> definitely<00:03:29.100> seems<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.459> help

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
so this stuff I definitely seems to help

so this stuff I definitely seems to help
it's<00:03:30.180> better<00:03:30.450> than<00:03:30.750> when<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:30.989> just<00:03:31.290> let<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.560> dry

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
it's better than when I just let it dry

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.860 
it's better than when I just let it dry
by<00:03:31.890> itself<00:03:32.060> mind<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:33.299> have<00:03:33.510> been<00:03:33.660> playing

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
by itself mind you I have been playing

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.720 
by itself mind you I have been playing
with<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> little<00:03:34.920> bit<00:03:35.100> fuzzy<00:03:35.310> I

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
with it so it is a little bit fuzzy I

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.849 
with it so it is a little bit fuzzy I
guess<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.510> little<00:03:36.720> bit<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.019> fuzz<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.350> expected

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
guess a little bit of fuzz is expected

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.699 
guess a little bit of fuzz is expected
because<00:03:38.010> not<00:03:38.220> all<00:03:38.340> your<00:03:38.519> curls<00:03:38.760> are<00:03:39.030> uniform

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
because not all your curls are uniform

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.199 
because not all your curls are uniform
but<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:41.489> seems<00:03:41.790> good<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.829> definitely<00:03:43.829> better

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
but it seems good and definitely better

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.090 
but it seems good and definitely better
the<00:03:45.209> mousse<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.810> definitely<00:03:46.799> better<00:03:46.950> than

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
the mousse and definitely better than

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.720 
the mousse and definitely better than
nothing<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.120> at<00:03:48.299> all<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:49.380> it's<00:03:50.130> not<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.340> miracle

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730
