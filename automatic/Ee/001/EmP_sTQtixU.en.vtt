and<00:02:57.590> it's<00:02:57.980> not<00:02:58.130> super<00:02:58.640> dense<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.600> find<00:02:59.900> that

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
and it's not super dense and I find that

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.440 
and it's not super dense and I find that
brushes<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.620> are<00:03:00.680> super<00:03:01.580> dense<00:03:01.820> for<00:03:02.090> packing

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
brushes that are super dense for packing

brushes that are super dense for packing
on<00:03:02.540> color<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:03.530> get<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.710> little<00:03:03.920> bit<00:03:04.100> of<00:03:04.220> fallout

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
on color can get a little bit of fallout

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.470 
on color can get a little bit of fallout
but<00:03:04.820> this<00:03:05.030> one<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:05.480> like<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:06.050> perfect<00:03:07.480> my

three-one-seven from zoeva i like this

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.200 
three-one-seven from zoeva i like this
because<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:14.030> lot<00:03:14.270> thinner<00:03:14.540> than<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:15.380> Mac

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.130 
for getting color really close to the
lower<00:03:36.770> lash<00:03:37.130> line<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.730> making<00:03:38.390> sure<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.870> it

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
lower lash line and making sure that it

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.770 
lower lash line and making sure that it
has<00:03:39.320> that<00:03:39.470> kind<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.770> nice<00:03:40.070> gradient<00:03:40.580> effect<00:03:40.970> we

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
has that kind of nice gradient effect we

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.510 
has that kind of nice gradient effect we
are<00:03:41.870> moving<00:03:42.020> on<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.410> another<00:03:42.530> blending<00:03:43.280> brush

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
are moving on to another blending brush

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.200 
are moving on to another blending brush
and<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.180> morphe<00:03:44.680> m200<00:03:45.710> brush<00:03:46.100> now<00:03:46.820> as

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
and this is the morphe m200 brush now as

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.510 
and this is the morphe m200 brush now as
you<00:03:47.480> can<00:03:47.630> see<00:03:47.810> this<00:03:47.960> is<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.260> 224<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.340> is

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
you can see this is the 224 and this is

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.820 
you can see this is the 224 and this is
the<00:03:49.760> morphe<00:03:50.120> one<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.570> is<00:03:51.080> slightly<00:03:51.560> more

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
the morphe one it is slightly more

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.490 
the morphe one it is slightly more
tapered<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:52.880> not<00:03:53.030> as<00:03:53.210> fluffy<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:54.260> this

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
tapered and it's not as fluffy so this

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.920 
tapered and it's not as fluffy so this
means<00:03:54.830> that<00:03:55.070> you<00:03:55.190> can<00:03:55.400> really<00:03:55.730> have<00:03:56.270> precise

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
means that you can really have precise

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.410 
means that you can really have precise
control<00:03:57.860> over<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.460> color<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:58.970> where<00:03:59.240> it<00:03:59.390> goes

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
control over the color and where it goes

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.440 
control over the color and where it goes
I<00:03:59.840> like<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.680> use<00:04:00.830> this<00:04:01.010> if<00:04:01.250> I<00:04:01.520> want<00:04:01.820> more<00:04:02.300> of<00:04:02.390> a
