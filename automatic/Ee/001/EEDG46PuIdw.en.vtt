00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.610 
here it's this little flat contact
button<00:02:17.209> right<00:02:17.390> here<00:02:17.420> if<00:02:18.170> you're<00:02:18.349> teeing<00:02:18.560> up

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
button right here if you're teeing up

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.050 
button right here if you're teeing up
our<00:02:18.799> calculator<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.459> looks<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:19.879> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
our calculator it looks just like the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.449 
our calculator it looks just like the
buttons<00:02:20.629> ninth<00:02:20.810> calculator<00:02:21.410> there<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:21.830> we're

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
buttons ninth calculator there so we're

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.039 
buttons ninth calculator there so we're
going<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.670> push<00:02:22.879> you<00:02:22.970> hold<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.239> down<00:02:25.840> now<00:02:26.840> it

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
going to push you hold that down now it

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.900 
going to push you hold that down now it
causes<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.590> from<00:02:28.010> what<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.190> understand<00:02:28.670> is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
causes this from what I understand is

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.449 
causes this from what I understand is
the<00:02:29.480> battery<00:02:30.319> will<00:02:30.410> be<00:02:30.500> run<00:02:30.650> down<00:02:30.799> will<00:02:31.280> have<00:02:31.430> a

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
the battery will be run down will have a

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.940 
the battery will be run down will have a
lower<00:02:31.700> charge<00:02:32.060> than<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.870> residual<00:02:33.349> charge<00:02:33.650> in

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
lower charge than the residual charge in

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.920 
lower charge than the residual charge in
the<00:02:34.250> motherboard<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:35.330> motherboard<00:02:35.720> won't

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
the motherboard the motherboard won't

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.089 
the motherboard the motherboard won't
allow<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.140> battery<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.560> charge<00:02:36.620> in<00:02:36.980> that

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
allow the battery to charge in that

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.860 
allow the battery to charge in that
instance<00:02:37.489> so<00:02:37.940> what<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.299> got<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.540> do<00:02:38.629> is

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
instance so what you got to do is

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.330 
instance so what you got to do is
discharge<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:41.150> battery<00:02:41.629> in<00:02:42.200> there<00:02:42.349> here<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.220> a

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
discharge the battery in there here in a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.550 
discharge the battery in there here in a
motherboard<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.480> by<00:02:45.079> holding<00:02:45.200> down<00:02:45.379> the<00:02:45.530> power

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
motherboard so by holding down the power

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.240 
motherboard so by holding down the power
button<00:02:45.769> with<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.640> battery<00:02:46.910> disconnected

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
button with the battery disconnected

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.449 
button with the battery disconnected
okay

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
okay

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.520 
okay
we're<00:02:50.299> discharging<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.989> motherboard<00:02:51.410> to

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
we're discharging the motherboard to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.600 
we're discharging the motherboard to
make<00:02:51.650> sure<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:51.890> doesn't<00:02:52.010> have<00:02:52.190> any<00:02:52.340> power<00:02:52.549> left

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
make sure it doesn't have any power left

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.750 
make sure it doesn't have any power left
in<00:02:52.879> it<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:54.769> order<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.010> plug<00:02:55.129> this<00:02:55.280> back<00:02:55.519> in

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
in it in order to plug this back in

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.890 
in it in order to plug this back in
we're<00:02:56.420> just<00:02:56.450> going<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.690> simply<00:02:56.840> bend<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.709> down

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
we're just going to simply bend it down

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.270 
we're just going to simply bend it down
and<00:02:59.900> push<00:03:00.049> straight<00:03:00.230> down<00:03:00.470> on<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.769> till<00:03:01.190> it

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
and push straight down on it till it

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.110 
and push straight down on it till it
clicks<00:03:01.459> okay<00:03:03.459> we<00:03:04.459> should<00:03:04.519> be<00:03:04.790> able<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:07.120> plug

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
clicks okay we should be able to plug

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.900 
clicks okay we should be able to plug
this<00:03:08.269> guy<00:03:08.359> in<00:03:14.769> use<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:16.310> power<00:03:16.519> button<00:03:16.790> once

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
this guy in use the power button once

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.690 
this guy in use the power button once
and<00:03:19.510> get<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.569> battery<00:03:20.840> logo<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:22.489> should

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
and get the battery logo you should

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.580 
and get the battery logo you should
switch<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.090> second<00:03:23.450> logo<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.049> then<00:03:24.470> it

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
switch the second logo and then it

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.770 
switch the second logo and then it
should<00:03:24.829> start<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.370> charge<00:03:28.419> all<00:03:29.419> right<00:03:29.599> it's

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
should start to charge all right it's

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.400 
should start to charge all right it's
charging<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:30.620> try<00:03:31.579> that<00:03:31.609> out<00:03:31.870> it's<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.989> fast<00:03:33.230> and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
charging so try that out it's a fast and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.319 
charging so try that out it's a fast and
easy<00:03:33.440> way<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.709> do<00:03:33.919> it<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.310> main<00:03:34.880> thing<00:03:34.910> is
