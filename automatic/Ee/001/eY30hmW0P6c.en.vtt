00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.250
 I 'm just saying this, do not you make a spokesperson 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.250
 she using poc of conserves that paa 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.740
 that normal pot of preserves until what 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.910
 I did I took written letter that has the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.510
 front right 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.849
 I cleaned with writing alcohol right 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:33.030
 For that we will need the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:36.329
 Double-sided tape pot scissors one 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.059
 old sponge cause of dishwasher even 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.740
 a brush 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.740
 but she 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.360
 of things the paint if you do here 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.820
 I'm going to make a gradient of blue then 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:55.180
 I got a very strong blue 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:57.160
 a medium blue and white and then in 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.900
 materials, we will pick up the 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.710
 double sided tape 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.470
 could have done in getting sticker and 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.330
 place to put the training wheels adhesive 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.370
 to make the detail then is that 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.240
 comment sticker I got the double tape 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.750
 face 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.820
 I cut pieces like that and put 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.770
 I did not lose random or anything I went 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.979
 putting random is not only putting 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:26.650
 here and it will stay put so the 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.190
 sea turtle that will do 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.240
 little star baby there is your 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.680
 creativity 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:40.330
 So, after that , we'll get the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.650
 inks open you separate the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.650
 inks will use 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:01.380
 there, as the sponge in the ink is like 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:10.670
 a sponge will start with those of the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.670
 strong and put it here in the glass 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.410
 There you go and do it with all the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.950
 paints after this time a more blue 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.630
 of course the white as I go 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.100
 Swapping, decorating, coming back to show. 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.250
 for you 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.380
 so it has already made almost the strongest 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.739
 the light blue and now I'll do with the 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:40.770
 white is the same process 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:49.080
 caught here that improves ink takes five 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:52.050
 I'll do it for a month. 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.560
 when the color lighter as the color of 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.560
 low 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.319
 arriving just a little 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:15.010
 and will hit with expands very light with 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:22.680
 very light sponge to be able to stay all 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.680
 scattered dinho doing with the local 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.390
 Do it there until you end up up until 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.190
 here on the edge 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.820
 after that only one of the 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.820
 goals 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.590
 he is already like the three with the 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.090
 three colors 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:50.200
 Now I'll get the brush in white paint. 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:53.440
 to do the retouching here teaching goes 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.230
 passing thus is not that I was cool 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.570
 if you are in a place to put 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.370
 ink not to be in the lid 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.710
 better but how am I doing here in the 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.690
 where I do not have space and I do not 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.830
 I have where to put another by picking it straight 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.190
 the same buffer would be easier 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.989
 practical if you had the ink 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:21.880
 born within the campaign is not only 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:28.090
 to spend here on the final touches 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:30.540
 here wait to dry 15 minutes in ink 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.730
 dry the paint dry very quickly 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:39.760
 then let it dry 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:42.910
 I'll come back to finish with you later. 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:48.070
 of dry it is only removing the small pieces of 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:57.670
 tape only get the episode yes 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:05:03.190
 and removing it is quite easy to remove the 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:06.700
 press dinho so he will withdraw 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.800
 stay so it is with these details the 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.610
 works spruce with something apart 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.300
 from above 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.580
 I'm going to wear this little ribbon so here 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.300
 I already arrived here even then I 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:25.380
 I'm going to double it here so I can 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.380
 fit positions here on earth 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.430
 The chubby girl is about a third of you. 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.040
 wants to put a tape but with the fall 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.890
 what do you want to do like you want to do? 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.120
 I will be and so this is the result 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.040
 Last 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:47.910
 we get old lady put it in here 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.910
