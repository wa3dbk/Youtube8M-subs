00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.379
 Welcome to a new video in the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.179
 I want to show you today as he is 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.639
 behind the keyboard and that is 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.990
 now practically a keyboard without oil 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.330
 so if you wanted oil now 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.119
 he would have to hold down here like this 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.250
 go over there 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.390
 There is also a function by euro 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:30.539
 it's just the keyboard 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.219
 in that could be the oil and also 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.600
 to be displayed is easy 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.790
 in the exhibition then general 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.460
 Scroll down pretty far then find 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.219
 you here 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.570
 keyboard then you can open here 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.039
 2d keyboard I still have this 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.680
 symbols still taken and hans 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.170
 to have meyers but for the general 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.699
 German keyboard you can easily here 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.730
 stop there just click on german 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.559
 So every hook made away and there 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.750
 then have one her when her now 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.770
 memory holds so briefly applies and 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:17.100
 he is going back here now 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 then you see here you see practically 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.700
 now you see here and if you 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.680
 now consider wrong then you have the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.740
 that's why it's unfamiliar 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.619
 now here the keys exactly on top of each other 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.560
 are parallel for people who are now on 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.060
 It is the old keyboard that has got used to it 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.619
 probably cumbersome belongs to the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.520
 People then always write that way too 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.850
 if more skew so write it is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.759
 I am often mistyped 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.009
 stop as before but for the people the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.740
 only now just been to change with 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.799
 the stop is easier than the commune 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.360
 German language pretty much before and wants 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.250
 I also enroll and is depressed 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.570
 have it stupid if he says then he 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.549
 It may not work then again 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.579
 on the scu wrt z this is the normal one 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.700
 order simple 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:11.830
 That's why I hope so 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.599
 i like the video below 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.959
