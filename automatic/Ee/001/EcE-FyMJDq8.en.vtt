and I took very good care of it but

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.330 
and I took very good care of it but
eventually<00:00:18.150> broke<00:00:18.359> off<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.230> decided<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.189> go

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
eventually broke off so I decided to go

before<00:01:34.060> I<00:01:34.300> decided<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.780> lock<00:01:34.930> my<00:01:35.140> hair<00:01:35.380> I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
before I decided to lock my hair I

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.260 
before I decided to lock my hair I
wanted<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.890> get<00:01:36.070> some<00:01:36.370> length<00:01:36.580> because<00:01:37.030> my

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
wanted to get some length because my

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.220 
wanted to get some length because my
other<00:01:37.450> my<00:01:38.080> first<00:01:38.320> two<00:01:38.560> journeys<00:01:39.340> were<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:40.750> lot

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
other my first two journeys were a lot

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.810 
other my first two journeys were a lot
harder<00:01:41.440> because<00:01:41.650> my<00:01:41.950> hair<00:01:42.100> was<00:01:42.130> so<00:01:42.370> short<00:01:42.700> and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
harder because my hair was so short and

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.310 
harder because my hair was so short and
it<00:01:42.910> was<00:01:43.030> really<00:01:43.270> hard<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.570> tame<00:01:43.780> them<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.080> have

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
it was really hard to tame them and have

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.800 
it was really hard to tame them and have
a<00:01:44.350> somewhat<00:01:45.250> neat<00:01:45.790> professional<00:01:46.030> look<00:01:46.600> for

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
a somewhat neat professional look for

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.260 
a somewhat neat professional look for
work<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.800> I<00:01:47.830> wore<00:01:48.190> braids<00:01:48.550> for<00:01:48.790> about<00:01:49.030> two

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
work so I wore braids for about two

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.160 
work so I wore braids for about two
months<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:50.100> achieve<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.550> growth<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.810> this<00:01:53.020> is

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
months to achieve the growth so this is

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.060 
months to achieve the growth so this is
my<00:01:53.380> length<00:01:54.040> after<00:01:54.720> about<00:01:55.720> one<00:01:56.380> year<00:01:56.410> being<00:01:56.950> a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
my length after about one year being a

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.320 
my length after about one year being a
natural<00:01:57.880> or<00:01:58.750> one<00:01:59.170> year<00:01:59.580> post<00:02:00.580> big<00:02:01.060> chop

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
because I've been natural for about four

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.090 
that's steam and that water is really
good<00:04:45.640> to<00:04:45.790> help<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.060> hair<00:04:46.360> lock<00:04:46.860> because<00:04:47.860> it

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
good to help the hair lock because it

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.909 
good to help the hair lock because it
causes<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.490> hair<00:04:48.640> to<00:04:48.669> swell<00:04:49.060> so<00:04:49.770> with<00:04:50.770> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
causes the hair to swell so with the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.780 
causes the hair to swell so with the
swelling<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.930> know<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:54.400> shedded

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
swelling and the you know the shedded

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.190 
swelling and the you know the shedded
hair<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.270> lock<00:04:55.450> it<00:04:55.660> will<00:04:55.750> cause<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.169> to

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
hair and the lock it will cause it to

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.130 
hair and the lock it will cause it to
it'll<00:04:57.130> help<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.400> process<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.600> use<00:04:58.810> a<00:04:58.840> spray

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
it'll help the process so I use a spray

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.290 
it'll help the process so I use a spray
bottle<00:04:59.320> I<00:04:59.560> spray<00:04:59.800> my<00:04:59.830> scalp<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.640> rub<00:05:01.090> my

rinse the hair and through the rinsing

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.290 
rinse the hair and through the rinsing
process<00:05:11.349> it<00:05:11.620> cleans<00:05:12.039> the<00:05:12.250> body<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.639> there<00:05:12.879> so
