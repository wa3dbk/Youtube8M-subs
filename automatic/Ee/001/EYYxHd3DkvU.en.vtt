00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
this knife I believe is 1/8 of an inch

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.890 
this knife I believe is 1/8 of an inch
thick<00:01:03.199> it<00:01:04.199> has<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> full<00:01:04.830> flat<00:01:05.250> grind<00:01:05.570> which<00:01:06.570> is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
thick it has a full flat grind which is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.719 
thick it has a full flat grind which is
uh<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.770> pretty<00:01:07.920> good<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.310> working<00:01:08.610> with

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
uh it's pretty good for working with

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.120 
uh it's pretty good for working with
wood<00:01:09.000> compared<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> Scandi<00:01:10.500> grind<00:01:10.530> because

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
wood compared to a Scandi grind because

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
wood compared to a Scandi grind because
it's<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.490> thinner<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.689> lot<00:01:12.869> longer

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
it's a lot thinner and it's a lot longer

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
it's a lot thinner and it's a lot longer
of<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> grind<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.460> into

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of a grind so you can really get into

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.370 
of a grind so you can really get into
the<00:01:14.760> wood<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.390> some<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.750> fine<00:01:15.990> feathers

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the wood get some really fine feathers

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.590 
the wood get some really fine feathers
with<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.369> has<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> coating<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.270> but

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
with this it has a coating on it but

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
with this it has a coating on it but
it's<00:01:18.720> not<00:01:18.840> an<00:01:19.140> actual<00:01:19.380> coating<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.250> patina

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it's not an actual coating it's a patina

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.660 
it's not an actual coating it's a patina
it's<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.630> blued<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.159> still<00:01:23.400> strike

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it's just blued so you can still strike

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.359

carbon<00:01:29.400> steel<00:01:29.670> compared<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.659> 1095<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.770> won't

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
carbon steel compared to 1095 it won't

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.700 
carbon steel compared to 1095 it won't
throw<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.850> great<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.210> sparks<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.439> still

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710

let's get right into it alright guys so
I'm<00:02:02.780> gonna<00:02:02.870> do<00:02:03.290> some<00:02:03.470> boat<00:02:03.590> awning<00:02:04.010> first<00:02:05.650> it's

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
I'm gonna do some boat awning first it's

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.600 
I'm gonna do some boat awning first it's
going<00:02:06.830> through<00:02:06.980> there<00:02:07.100> pretty<00:02:07.250> well<00:02:07.340> let's

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
going through there pretty well let's

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.450 
going through there pretty well let's
check<00:02:07.850> on<00:02:08.150> the<00:02:08.600> wedge<00:02:09.130> peel<00:02:10.130> away<00:02:10.220> some<00:02:10.310> of

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
check on the wedge peel away some of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.290 
check on the wedge peel away some of
this<00:02:10.550> bark<00:02:10.850> here<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:15.770> can<00:02:15.860> see<00:02:16.040> there<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
this bark here you can see there the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.360 
this bark here you can see there the
knife<00:02:17.540> creates<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.320> wedge<00:02:18.560> ahead<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.100> blade

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
knife creates a wedge ahead of the blade

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.190 
knife creates a wedge ahead of the blade
which<00:02:20.120> prevents<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.600> blade<00:02:20.810> from<00:02:20.900> getting

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
which prevents the blade from getting

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.570 
which prevents the blade from getting
damaged<00:02:21.560> wellbut<00:02:21.860> awning<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:22.400> knife

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
damaged wellbut awning and this knife

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.490 
damaged wellbut awning and this knife
does<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:22.970> pretty<00:02:23.750> well<00:02:23.990> I<00:02:24.050> don't<00:02:24.260> know<00:02:24.320> if<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
does it pretty well I don't know if the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.490 
does it pretty well I don't know if the
camera<00:02:24.770> can<00:02:24.860> pick<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.220> up<00:02:26.200> but<00:02:27.200> there<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.470> a

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
camera can pick that up but there is a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.020 
camera can pick that up but there is a
pretty<00:02:27.770> nice<00:02:27.950> wedge<00:02:28.220> there<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.850> blade

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
pretty nice wedge there so the blade

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:37.770 
pretty nice wedge there so the blade
only<00:02:29.270> hits<00:02:29.510> before<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.650> first<00:02:30.860> strike<00:02:31.780> so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.070 

alright<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.930> went<00:02:39.050> through<00:02:39.170> pretty<00:02:39.350> easily

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
alright that went through pretty easily

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.230 
alright that went through pretty easily
kind<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.370> really<00:02:43.370> dry<00:02:43.580> piece<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:43.970> wood<00:02:44.090> this

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
kind of a really dry piece of wood this

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.860 
kind of a really dry piece of wood this
would<00:02:44.360> be<00:02:44.450> good<00:02:44.570> for<00:02:46.120> some<00:02:47.120> finer<00:02:47.360> carving<00:02:47.780> as

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
would be good for some finer carving as

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.800 
would be good for some finer carving as
well<00:02:51.670> didn't<00:02:52.670> split<00:02:52.880> evenly<00:02:53.239> there<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.690> was

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
well didn't split evenly there that was

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.890 
well didn't split evenly there that was
