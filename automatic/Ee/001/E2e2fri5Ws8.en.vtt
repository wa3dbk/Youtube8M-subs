a<00:02:01.460> little<00:02:01.580> bit<00:02:01.760> of<00:02:01.880> harder<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.479> we<00:02:03.050> end<00:02:03.440> up<00:02:03.620> in

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
a little bit of harder and we end up in

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.620 
a little bit of harder and we end up in
the<00:02:04.010> later<00:02:04.520> levels<00:02:04.850> though<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.510> I've

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
the later levels though that I've

already<00:02:05.840> played<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.470> if<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.430> starts<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.820> get

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
already played it if it starts to get

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.059 
already played it if it starts to get
way<00:02:08.390> harder<00:02:09.140> way<00:02:09.170> more<00:02:09.950> like<00:02:10.159> happy<00:02:10.399> wheels

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
