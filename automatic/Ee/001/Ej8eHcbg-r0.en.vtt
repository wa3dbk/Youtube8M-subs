end<00:04:08.440> of<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.709> monitor<00:04:09.330> again<00:04:10.330> they're<00:04:10.510> just

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
end of the monitor again they're just

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:36.490 
end of the monitor again they're just
standard<00:04:10.959> Phillips<00:04:11.319> screws<00:04:13.260> remove<00:04:14.260> those

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.700 

okay

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
okay

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.200 
okay
and<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.220> last<00:04:38.430> thing<00:04:38.820> is<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:40.850> panel<00:04:41.850> control

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
and the last thing is the panel control

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.870 
and the last thing is the panel control
it's<00:04:43.050> just<00:04:43.350> held<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.770> monitor<00:04:44.250> with

it's just held to the monitor with

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.780 
it's just held to the monitor with
double-sided<00:04:45.510> tape<00:04:45.720> if<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:47.010> gently<00:04:47.430> lift

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
double-sided tape if you gently lift

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
double-sided tape if you gently lift
wind<00:04:48.830> it<00:04:49.830> will<00:04:49.979> disconnect<00:04:50.460> from<00:04:50.699> the<00:04:50.970> panel

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
wind it will disconnect from the panel

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.870 
wind it will disconnect from the panel
itself<00:04:52.169> so<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:53.190> we<00:04:53.340> can<00:04:53.580> remove<00:04:53.729> the

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
itself so that we can remove the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.719 
itself so that we can remove the
electronics<00:04:54.360> from<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.720> panel<00:04:55.430> now<00:04:56.430> if<00:04:56.580> you

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
electronics from the panel now if you

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.150 
electronics from the panel now if you
kind<00:04:56.940> of<00:04:56.970> tilt<00:04:57.210> it<00:04:57.360> forward<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:58.500> two<00:04:58.680> halves

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
kind of tilt it forward the two halves

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.450 
kind of tilt it forward the two halves
will<00:04:59.460> separate<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.210> then<00:05:01.199> you<00:05:01.320> have<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:02.280> two

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
will separate and then you have the two

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.760 
will separate and then you have the two
pieces<00:05:02.630> we'll<00:05:03.630> set<00:05:03.840> our<00:05:03.930> monitor<00:05:04.290> panel<00:05:04.500> to
