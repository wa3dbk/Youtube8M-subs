00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
well it looks like it's shooting about

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.580 
well it looks like it's shooting about
an<00:01:42.430> inch<00:01:42.520> inch<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:42.820> a<00:01:42.940> half<00:01:42.970> long<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.300> got<00:01:43.590> two

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
an inch inch and a half long I got two

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.200 
an inch inch and a half long I got two
of<00:01:44.710> them<00:01:44.770> going<00:01:44.950> into<00:01:45.160> that<00:01:45.340> same<00:01:45.610> top<00:01:45.910> hole

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
of them going into that same top hole

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.700 
of them going into that same top hole
and<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:46.570> got<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.810> one<00:01:46.960> on<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.140> bottom<00:01:47.350> but<00:01:47.620> it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
and I got the one on the bottom but it

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.070 
and I got the one on the bottom but it
is<00:01:47.830> directly<00:01:48.729> perfect<00:01:49.240> for<00:01:49.390> up<00:01:49.510> and<00:01:49.660> down<00:01:49.720> or

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
is directly perfect for up and down or

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.500 
is directly perfect for up and down or
side<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.530> side<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.670> I'll<00:01:51.760> probably<00:01:51.910> give<00:01:52.210> it<00:01:52.240> I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
side to side so I'll probably give it I

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.420 
side to side so I'll probably give it I
don't<00:01:52.660> know<00:01:52.720> three<00:01:53.020> clicks<00:01:53.320> up<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:54.100> we<00:01:54.220> should

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
don't know three clicks up and we should

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.870 
don't know three clicks up and we should
be<00:01:54.580> looking<00:01:54.820> pretty<00:01:55.030> good<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:57.400> sculpt<00:01:57.700> that

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
be looking pretty good the sculpt that

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.850 
be looking pretty good the sculpt that
it's<00:01:58.000> on<00:01:58.120> this<00:01:58.300> gun<00:01:58.510> is<00:01:58.660> a<00:01:58.690> Weber<00:01:58.960> 3<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.680> 10

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
it's on this gun is a Weber 3 to 10

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.890 
it's on this gun is a Weber 3 to 10
power<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.120> looks<00:02:01.330> like<00:02:01.479> we<00:02:01.600> had<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:01.780> go

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
power and that looks like we had to go

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.490 
power and that looks like we had to go
up<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.410> we'll<00:02:02.530> go<00:02:02.680> up<00:02:03.990> we'll<00:02:04.990> give<00:02:05.140> her<00:02:05.229> three

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
up so we'll go up we'll give her three

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.990 
up so we'll go up we'll give her three

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
was above that first one so we'll shoot

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.660 
was above that first one so we'll shoot
