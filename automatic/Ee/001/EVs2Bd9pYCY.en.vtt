new class of robot and that's the class

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.050 
new class of robot and that's the class
that<00:00:16.830> we're<00:00:17.010> bringing<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.490> market<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
that we're bringing it to market and

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.500 
that we're bringing it to market and
that<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.960> robots<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.590> are<00:00:19.650> simple<00:00:20.550> easy<00:00:21.270> to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
that is robots that are simple easy to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.220 
that is robots that are simple easy to
use<00:00:22.070> inexpensive<00:00:23.150> it<00:00:24.150> could<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> broad<00:00:24.869> set

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
use inexpensive it could do a broad set

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.950 
use inexpensive it could do a broad set
of<00:00:25.260> manufacturing<00:00:25.980> tasks<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.810> going

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
of manufacturing tasks and that is going

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.259 
of manufacturing tasks and that is going
to<00:00:28.050> bring<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.470> much<00:00:28.859> much<00:00:29.099> bigger<00:00:29.160> robot<00:00:29.880> market

long<00:01:12.900> Scott<00:01:15.619> well<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.070> technology<00:01:17.790> has

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
long Scott well the technology has

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.300 
long Scott well the technology has
changed<00:01:17.970> quite<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.100> had

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
changed quite a bit so what we had

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.649 
changed quite a bit so what we had
before<00:01:20.780> were<00:01:21.780> essentially<00:01:22.470> expensive<00:01:23.659> very

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
before were essentially expensive very

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
before were essentially expensive very
precise<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.229> inflexible<00:01:25.890> machines<00:01:26.549> because

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
precise and inflexible machines because

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.420 
precise and inflexible machines because
that<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> state<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.780> Technology<00:01:28.430> they

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that was the state of Technology they

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.090 
that was the state of Technology they
were<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.880> class<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.409> mainframes<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:31.920> the

were a class of mainframes when the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.910 
were a class of mainframes when the
market<00:01:32.400> really<00:01:32.579> wanted<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.119> Mac<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.409> what

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
our office and you program it by just

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.840 
our office and you program it by just
moving<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:15.069> arms<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.370> don't<00:03:15.519> use<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.670> keyboard

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
moving the arms you don't use a keyboard

moving the arms you don't use a keyboard
you<00:03:16.180> don't<00:03:16.329> code<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.720> just<00:03:16.900> say<00:03:17.819> arm<00:03:18.819> goes

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
you don't code you just say arm goes

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.729 
you don't code you just say arm goes
here<00:03:19.180> grabs<00:03:19.480> cup<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:20.170> know<00:03:20.200> or<00:03:20.319> rather<00:03:20.560> you

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
here grabs cup you know or rather you

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.289 
here grabs cup you know or rather you
move<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.069> so<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.250> teach<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.940> tactile

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
move it so you teach it to tactile

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.789 
move it so you teach it to tactile
motion<00:03:22.690> which<00:03:22.810> anyone<00:03:23.049> can<00:03:23.230> do<00:03:23.350> without<00:03:23.530> any

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
motion which anyone can do without any

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.370 
motion which anyone can do without any
training<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:24.609> that<00:03:25.329> just<00:03:26.079> makes<00:03:26.230> it

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
training and so that just makes it

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.770 
training and so that just makes it
incredibly<00:03:26.680> easy<00:03:27.269> for<00:03:28.269> any<00:03:28.389> business<00:03:28.569> to

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
incredibly easy for any business to

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.330 
incredibly easy for any business to
consider<00:03:29.079> take<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:29.530> out<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.709> box<00:03:29.859> plug<00:03:30.220> it

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
consider take it out of the box plug it

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.099 
consider take it out of the box plug it
in<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.549> 110<00:03:30.819> outlet<00:03:30.910> get<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.359> work<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.720> I'm

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109

but it's a you know what they often say
about<00:06:08.120> robots<00:06:08.509> is<00:06:08.780> once<00:06:09.020> you<00:06:09.110> stop<00:06:09.349> calling<00:06:09.590> it

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
about robots is once you stop calling it

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.290 
about robots is once you stop calling it
a<00:06:09.889> robot<00:06:10.219> and<00:06:10.370> you<00:06:10.580> start<00:06:10.819> calling<00:06:10.969> it<00:06:11.240> a

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
a robot and you start calling it a

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.839 
a robot and you start calling it a
vacuum<00:06:11.629> cleaner<00:06:12.069> or<00:06:13.069> whatever<00:06:13.639> it<00:06:13.699> might<00:06:13.789> be

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
vacuum cleaner or whatever it might be

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.260 
vacuum cleaner or whatever it might be
then<00:06:14.360> it's<00:06:14.539> successful<00:06:15.050> because<00:06:15.620> the<00:06:16.189> idea<00:06:16.729> of

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
then it's successful because the idea of

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.969 
then it's successful because the idea of
it<00:06:17.629> being<00:06:17.779> something<00:06:18.169> different<00:06:18.650> is<00:06:18.800> out<00:06:18.949> of
