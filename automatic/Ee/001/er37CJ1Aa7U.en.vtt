like<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> old-school<00:00:50.820> Batman<00:00:51.270> maybe<00:00:51.480> we

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
like the old-school Batman maybe we

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.729 
like the old-school Batman maybe we
should<00:00:51.719> build<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> old-school<00:00:52.469> black

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739

and<00:00:52.980> yellow<00:00:53.070> Batman<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.760> think<00:00:53.940> that's<00:00:54.360> what

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and yellow Batman I think that's what

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.360 
and yellow Batman I think that's what
we're<00:00:54.629> gonna<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.129> need<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
we're gonna do and I know we need to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610 
we're gonna do and I know we need to
let's<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.640> build<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> head<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.780> for

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
let's just build the head like this for

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
let's just build the head like this for
now<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.430> we'll<00:00:59.550> put<00:00:59.730> his<00:00:59.820> mask<00:01:00.120> on

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
now and then we'll put his mask on

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.450 
now and then we'll put his mask on
because<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.199> know<00:01:01.320> he's<00:01:01.500> got<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> mask<00:01:01.920> obviously

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
because I know he's got a mask obviously

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.030 
because I know he's got a mask obviously
a<00:01:02.640> three<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> head<00:01:04.680> comes<00:01:04.920> up

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
a three and I think the head comes up

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.740 
a three and I think the head comes up
like<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.640> think<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> heads<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
like this I think I do the heads like a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.200 
like this I think I do the heads like a
slightly<00:01:07.170> odd<00:01:07.470> shape<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.909> why

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
slightly odd shape and I don't know why

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.210 
slightly odd shape and I don't know why
it's<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:09.900> something<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.290> happened<00:01:10.860> his

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
it's just something that happened his

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.429 
it's just something that happened his
head<00:01:11.490> went<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:11.909> being<00:01:12.060> square<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.110> being<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
head went from being square to being a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.609 
head went from being square to being a
rectangle<00:01:14.159> no<00:01:15.090> idea<00:01:15.479> why<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.409> what

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
rectangle no idea why but you know what

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.710 
rectangle no idea why but you know what
it<00:01:16.799> doesn't<00:01:17.310> matter<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.729> doesn't<00:01:17.759> matter<00:01:18.299> so

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.420 
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter so
right<00:01:18.900> let's<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.680> then<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.280> could

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
right let's do this and then we could

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.399 
right let's do this and then we could
get<00:01:20.640> his<00:01:20.759> mask<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.630> his<00:01:21.750> eyes<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.170> gonna<00:01:22.259> be

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
get his mask on so his eyes are gonna be

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.190 
get his mask on so his eyes are gonna be
