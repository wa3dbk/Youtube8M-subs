00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.080
 the guilietta and the compact of alfa romeo 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.170
 only proposed in 5 doors is 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.610
 competing peugeot 308 or audi a3 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.560
 launched in 2010 to the right eye a slight 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.449
 restyling at the end of 2013 which slightly 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.250
 modified the grille and add chrome 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.900
 around the fog lights the restylage 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.699
 was also an opportunity to make 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.949
 evolve the engines to a little 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.300
 less consumption the diesel engine 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.060
 the most powerful has also gone from 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.640
 170 to 175 horses when associated 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.380
 at the double clutch box tct while 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 lowering CO2 consumption 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.399
 3 grams per kilometer always good 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.870
 to take 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.250
 inside the restyling has changed 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.640
 several elements including the steering wheel or 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 seating 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 but the biggest change comes from 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.770
 the central screen now integrated into the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.690
 dashboard below the aerators 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.329
 whereas he was previously at the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.770
 alpha top took the opportunity to recast 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.000
 fully the interface that becomes 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.649
 faster and intuitive 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.910
 the leather upholstery is standard on the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.829
 exclusive high-end finish 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.059
 our test car at the back 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.469
 space is ok for two adults 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.570
 but disappointing given the size of the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.420
 car it's the same for the volume 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.979
 rather weak chest in the category 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.510
 at startup the sound of the engine is 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.010
 a little too much to hear especially 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.710
 given the positioning will 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.939
 premium of duration and want 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.229
 to hear some boondoggles from the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.970
 double clutch box but nothing 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.650
 very serious on the road if you want 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.720
 enjoy all the power it will take 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.159
 switch to dynamic mode from then on 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.299
 the mechanical approval is present with 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.380
 easy raises even at high 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.890
 speed is in the mean of the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.500
 category 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.000
 but without more chassis side 7 violetta 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 only rather comfortable in driving 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.759
 normal but not enough dynamic 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.380
 to redheads the pace the restyling did 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.729
 not upset this hard step which the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.170
 bigger change in the right direction 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.180
 comes from this new central screen more 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.229
 easy to use 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.880
 for the rest this alpha is not 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.110
 pretty well presented and lack of content 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.390
 to conclude and the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.890
 premium like the audi a3 his report 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.600
 consumption performance is nevertheless 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.149
 worthy of the best with 116 grams per 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 km of co2 for this version tested at 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.159
 only 6 grams of an audi a3 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.869
 sportback tdi 184 remains the price of 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.399
 almost thirty five thousand euros to swallow 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.689
 not obvious given the level of equipment 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.049
 certainly correct is not either 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.049
 oversized
