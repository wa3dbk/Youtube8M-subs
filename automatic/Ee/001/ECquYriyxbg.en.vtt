employee at us inspect today we're going
to<00:00:14.040> learn<00:00:14.160> all<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.490> main<00:00:15.210> shutoff<00:00:15.570> valves

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
to learn all about main shutoff valves

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.300 
to learn all about main shutoff valves
here<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> electrical<00:00:18.359> panel

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
here in the electrical panel

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.859 
here in the electrical panel
you<00:00:20.310> had<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.550> main<00:00:20.760> breaker<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.480> actually

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
you had the main breaker you actually

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.720 
you had the main breaker you actually
have<00:00:22.020> two<00:00:22.199> panels<00:00:22.680> they're<00:00:22.859> both<00:00:23.010> 200<00:00:23.550> amp

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
have two panels they're both 200 amp

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.089 
have two panels they're both 200 amp
panels<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.080> main<00:00:25.380> breaker<00:00:25.710> here

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
panels and you have a main breaker here

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.290 
panels and you have a main breaker here
and<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.369> another<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.119> in

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
and you have another one like that in

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.710 
and you have another one like that in
the<00:00:27.390> other<00:00:27.510> panel<00:00:27.930> sometimes<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:29.340> will<00:00:29.640> see

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
the other panel sometimes you will see

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.630 
the other panel sometimes you will see
next<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.019> meter<00:00:31.230> another<00:00:31.920> switch<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
next to the meter another switch and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.350 
next to the meter another switch and
that<00:00:32.700> one<00:00:33.270> would<00:00:33.480> then<00:00:33.719> be<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.890> main<00:00:35.610> break

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
that one would then be the main break

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.760 
that one would then be the main break
the<00:00:36.570> main<00:00:36.899> disconnect<00:00:38.960> this<00:00:39.960> top<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.530> right

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the main disconnect this top one right

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.979 
the main disconnect this top one right
here<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.340> shut<00:00:41.579> off<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.540> electricity

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
here will shut off all the electricity

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.420 
here will shut off all the electricity
that's<00:00:43.440> controlled<00:00:43.890> by<00:00:44.040> all<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.340> these

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that's controlled by all of these

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.920 
that's controlled by all of these
circuit<00:00:44.820> breakers<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.329> were<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.570> turn<00:00:45.750> off

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
circuit breakers if you were to turn off

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.440 
circuit breakers if you were to turn off
both<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.350> these<00:00:46.800> top<00:00:47.129> breakers<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
both of these top breakers all the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.940 
both of these top breakers all the
electricity<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:49.170> house<00:00:49.410> would<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.770> going

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
electricity in your house would be going

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.340 
electricity in your house would be going
there's<00:00:50.489> no<00:00:50.610> off<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.120> then<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> need<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
there's no off and then if you need to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.959 
there's no off and then if you need to
for<00:00:52.500> some<00:00:52.710> reason<00:00:52.739> turn<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.520> again<00:00:53.789> it's

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
for some reason turn it on again it's

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.700 
for some reason turn it on again it's
usually<00:00:54.120> best<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.719> turn<00:00:54.870> off<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> breakers

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
usually best to turn off the breakers

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160 
usually best to turn off the breakers
then<00:00:56.399> turn<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> main<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.510> start<00:00:57.960> turning

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
then turn on the main and start turning

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.979 
then turn on the main and start turning
them<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.859> few<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.789> time<00:00:59.820> not<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.809> turn

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
them on a few at a time not just turn

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.650 
them on a few at a time not just turn
everything<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.829> once<00:01:02.090> now<00:01:03.090> your<00:01:03.390> water

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
everything on at once now your water

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.600 
everything on at once now your water
that's<00:01:04.470> actually<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> most

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that's actually one of the most

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.070 
that's actually one of the most
important<00:01:06.060> things<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.420> want<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.720> know<00:01:06.810> over

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
important things you want to know over

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.660 
important things you want to know over
here<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:10.250> properly<00:01:11.250> marked

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
here you see they very properly marked

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.030 
here you see they very properly marked
this<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.240> main<00:01:12.479> water<00:01:12.869> valve<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.710> kind

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
this for you main water valve this kind

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.780 
this for you main water valve this kind
of<00:01:14.159> valve<00:01:14.400> only<00:01:15.390> turns<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.710> direction<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
of valve only turns in one direction and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760 
of valve only turns in one direction and
it<00:01:18.000> only<00:01:18.119> turns<00:01:18.509> 90<00:01:18.960> degrees<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.439> other<00:01:19.560> words

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it only turns 90 degrees in other words

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.010 
it only turns 90 degrees in other words
it's<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.270> turns<00:01:21.479> off<00:01:21.780> it's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it's on here and when it turns off it's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
it's on here and when it turns off it's
like<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.560> it'll<00:01:22.890> turn<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.460> case

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
like that and it'll turn in this case

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.160 
like that and it'll turn in this case
like<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:23.970> some<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.750> them<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:24.900> regular

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
like that some of them are regular

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.920 
like that some of them are regular
valves<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.009> these<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.520> here<00:01:26.820> usually<00:01:27.600> shut

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
valves like these up here usually shut

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.319 
valves like these up here usually shut
them<00:01:28.140> off<00:01:28.320> by<00:01:28.530> turning<00:01:28.590> them<00:01:28.979> clockwise<00:01:29.520> it's

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
them off by turning them clockwise it's

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.480 
them off by turning them clockwise it's
important<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.840> know<00:01:30.990> where<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:32.340> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
important to know where this is if you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.569 
important to know where this is if you
have<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> weak<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.450> somewhere<00:01:34.340> maybe<00:01:35.340> you

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
have a weak going on somewhere maybe you

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.340 
have a weak going on somewhere maybe you
can<00:01:35.820> get<00:01:36.060> underneath<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.630> sink<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.020> turn<00:01:37.200> off

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
can get underneath the sink to turn off

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.069 
can get underneath the sink to turn off
that<00:01:37.560> faucet<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.700> local<00:01:39.180> valve<00:01:39.450> but

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that faucet that the local valve but

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.780 
that faucet that the local valve but
it's<00:01:40.229> always<00:01:40.619> best<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.070> head<00:01:41.310> towards<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
it's always best to head towards the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.460 
it's always best to head towards the
main<00:01:41.820> valve<00:01:42.329> if<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.720> ever<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.079> any<00:01:43.259> doubt

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
main valve if you ever have any doubt

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.170 
main valve if you ever have any doubt
it's<00:01:43.740> gonna<00:01:43.799> take<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> lot<00:01:44.490> less<00:01:44.729> time<00:01:45.000> to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
it's gonna take you a lot less time to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969 
it's gonna take you a lot less time to
run<00:01:45.360> down<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.899> valve<00:01:46.200> turn<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> thing

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
run down to this valve turn that thing

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.950 
run down to this valve turn that thing
off<00:01:47.159> shut<00:01:47.430> off<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.880> water<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> house
