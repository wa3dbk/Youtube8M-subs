00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.279
 celebrated but today we will do 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.430
 cheese this recipe is quite simple 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.010
 so before we start naturally 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.890
 I want to tell you no, not on the go 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.529
 the season is over but it's soon 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.640
 will be but I do not know how soon but 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.360
 will be but still yesterday on the white channel 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.239
 archive 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.730
 came out the second issue of the cave is this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.920
 small serials so look 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.039
 subscribe can credit at the bottom but we 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.899
 Begin to use lessar 200 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.539
 a gram of curd icing sugar 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.910
 Butter Chocolate Milk and 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.980
 vanillin first thing a water bath or in 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.140
 microwave we melt chocolate 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.410
 after that we take a brush and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.300
 lubricate her bottom and sides of the form I took here 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.400
 such a big shape because I have 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.430
 no little ones you can take a few 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.939
 small all this is carefully lubricated 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.210
 then 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.640
 put in the freezer for 5 minutes but for now 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.920
 let's do the stuffing put in a plate 200 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
 grams of cottage cheese to vanilla 2 tablespoons 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.860
 powdered sugar and 30 grams creamy 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.049
 oils 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.210
 all this is thoroughly mixed and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.100
 set aside I would like to do 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.170
 a little memory if you want to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.900
 your term was with a different taste for example 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.939
 condensed milk or strawberries throw it here and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.720
 just mix everything up but i'm this 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.430
 I will not do 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.409
 get the mold out of the freezer and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.600
 We coat the places that are not 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.369
 it turned out to miss the mark and then put in 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.189
 freezer for another 5 minutes lay out 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.229
 our stuffing form and align set 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.180
 freezer for another 5 minutes and then 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.460
 naturally remaining chocolate we 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.020
 lubricate the top layer and put in 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.149
 freezer for about ten minutes 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.310
 We take out the term from the form of the house with our own 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.509
 with chocolate, not missed 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.860
 go try and here's the long-awaited 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:07.890
 long-awaited long-awaited lesson 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.050
 more often I decided not to cut it, but because 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.850
 what 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.860
 but I didnâ€™t want to cut it 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.650
 can cut but 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.630
 go want well that's all i just don't want 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.510
 I just love doing something like this 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.190
 enormous, that is, we have a curd 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.670
 but a long time so you can 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.400
 to name 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:31.460
 40 cake 40 here, but such a cinema 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.690
 also yes and yours bought the usual term to 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:41.290
 curd ordinary naturally let's 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.750
 open it and try it first 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.470
 if you expect it from me 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.000
 I'll try it all so cool then rather 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.160
 all this will not be well and so in color one 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.450
 same thing 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.280
 try the usual term the color of the entrails 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.990
 exactly the same 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.290
 so the usual term we put off in 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.990
 side and try our cheese I will take 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.580
 knife still decided to cut take 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.320
 our little shirt is here 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.670
 white things because not until the end 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.100
 chocolate missed but oh well so 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.870
 turned out try you know what I do 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.300
 it seemed that our period is even tastier 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.250
 It turned out I do not know how it is possible but 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.800
 I like him more 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.450
 but I will talk about the differences as we 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.420
 did it yourself deadline then naturally I go there 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.590
 just a huge layer of chocolate made for 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:43.160
 figachil and this is a plus because there with elk 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.150
 colada less secondly this chocolate 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.450
 here is milk and there is usual therefore 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.280
 still milk tip delicious 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.220
 common yet in that church which of 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.310
 store more vanilla 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.900
 but I would not say that this is a plus but not 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.390
 He said that it is a minus because I have to 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.560
 vanillin'm okay okay that is 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.660
 there he is good no him too good you 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:16.069
 did our term understand something first 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:19.069
 less vanilla cocktail and more 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:23.400
 glazed meaning more like 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:26.129
 cottage cheese but he is very delicious that is if 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.259
 I would eat that cheese and did not know that he 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:31.560
 cottage cheese I would not have thought that he 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:34.050
 cottage cheese and then immediately less 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.220
 it is noticeable that he cottage cheese yes yes I put 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.940
 Like this recipe 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.930
 he's cool don't take long this 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.659
 the second is what products 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.699
 natural well as natural in the usual 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.669
 product as i like to say there 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:54.449
 all kinds of preservatives it's all in our 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:57.750
 all this is not just a natural product but to 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:01.229
 Unfortunately, the shelf life of our cheese 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.150
 maybe maybe a day maybe two so 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.729
 how cottage cheese very quickly deteriorates and 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.000
 so if you do such a term was 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.830
 make it out right away and give but 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.840
 actually all that is required of me I 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.509
 today did all that is required of you 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.120
 Like this but not required 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.460
 it is advisable to subscribe to the channel write 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.740
 comment 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.409
 then what then write to the group 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.110
 convictions in the discussion VKontakte 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.340
 idea for randomness because it is from there it 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.680
 and take 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.219
 but don't write ideas like making a computer 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.710
 ps4 plane and ixbox you damn 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.810
 you understand that I just do not have so much 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.870
 time and so would I certainly did in 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:47.340
 easy well seriously considering the plane there 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.080
