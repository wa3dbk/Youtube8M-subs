youtuber asked me how to upload video

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:18.070 
youtuber asked me how to upload video
from<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:11.150> canon<00:00:12.980> hf<00:00:14.059> r200<00:00:15.059> camera<00:00:16.250> to<00:00:17.250> youtube

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
from the canon hf r200 camera to youtube

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.310 
from the canon hf r200 camera to youtube
so<00:00:20.060> yeah<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.330> here<00:00:21.480> he<00:00:21.570> goes<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:22.170> are

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
so yeah so here he goes there are

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.019 
so yeah so here he goes there are
basically<00:00:22.710> two<00:00:22.859> ways<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.490> deal<00:00:23.640> with<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
basically two ways to deal with the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.560 
basically two ways to deal with the
video<00:00:24.240> fire<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:26.369> camera<00:00:26.789> well<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
video fire of the the camera well of

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.230 
video fire of the the camera well of
course<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.930> camera<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.240> driver

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
course the camera can with the driver

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.569 
course the camera can with the driver
software<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.080> data<00:00:31.500> transfer<00:00:31.830> software<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
software and data transfer software and

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.000 
software and data transfer software and
stuff<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.989> then<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.860> more

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
stuff at that but then the more

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.740 
stuff at that but then the more
Universal<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.700> better<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.120> easier<00:00:36.690> that

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
Universal the better is just easier that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.319 
Universal the better is just easier that
way<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.680> camera<00:00:38.070> itself<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.610> capable<00:00:39.270> for

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
way and the camera itself is capable for

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.470 
way and the camera itself is capable for
that<00:00:39.710> it's<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:41.070> required<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that it's not required to have the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.779 
that it's not required to have the
software<00:00:42.870> installed<00:00:43.370> that<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.579> sometimes

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
software installed that that sometimes

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.790 
software installed that that sometimes
can<00:00:45.149> confuse<00:00:45.539> people<00:00:45.780> sometimes<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.530> makes<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
can confuse people sometimes it makes it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.529 
can confuse people sometimes it makes it
easier<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.399> that's<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> software

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
easier because that's what the software

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.779 
easier because that's what the software
is<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:49.829> easily

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
is for but they can really easily

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.410 
is for but they can really easily
confuse<00:00:51.390> people<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:52.850> if<00:00:53.850> you're<00:00:54.090> not<00:00:54.239> familiar

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
confuse people if if you're not familiar

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.069 
confuse people if if you're not familiar
with<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:55.590> basically<00:00:56.309> how<00:00:56.750> these<00:00:57.750> type<00:00:58.050> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
with what basically how these type of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.819 
with what basically how these type of
things<00:00:58.350> works<00:00:58.739> so<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:01.410> here<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.649> goes

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
things works so so here it goes

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.429 
things works so so here it goes
so<00:01:02.550> first<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.239> guess<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.899> need<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.140> record

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
so first of all I guess I need to record

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.130 
so first of all I guess I need to record
something<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> file<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
something to that I have a file in it so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.230 
something to that I have a file in it so
that<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.500> press<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> record<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:09.119> two

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that you press the record for two

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.260 
that you press the record for two
seconds<00:01:09.720> against<00:01:12.650> okay<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.430> that's<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.909> let

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
seconds against okay so that's that let

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.289 
seconds against okay so that's that let
me<00:01:15.299> clear<00:01:15.570> another<00:01:15.810> file<00:01:18.200> okay<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> now<00:01:21.240> we

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
me clear another file okay so now we

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.910 
me clear another file okay so now we
have<00:01:21.390> two<00:01:21.659> recordings<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> camera

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
have two recordings in the camera

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.550 
have two recordings in the camera
there's<00:01:23.909> two<00:01:24.090> ways<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.450> deal<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.170> files

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
there's two ways to deal with the files

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.569 
there's two ways to deal with the files
that<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.060> one<00:01:27.060> way<00:01:27.270> will<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.720> from<00:01:28.579> the

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
a the bottom one would be B so then

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.680 
a the bottom one would be B so then
after<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.849> dip<00:02:36.120> then<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:39.150> should<00:02:39.360> just<00:02:39.540> pop

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
after you dip then you should just pop

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.410 
after you dip then you should just pop
up<00:02:39.980> your<00:02:40.980> install<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.489> driver<00:02:41.730> automatically

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
up your install the driver automatically

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.410 
up your install the driver automatically
and<00:02:42.569> pop<00:02:42.750> out<00:02:42.959> because<00:02:43.110> it's<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.379> universal

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
and pop out because it's a universal

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.530 
and pop out because it's a universal
function<00:02:45.420> your<00:02:46.319> camera<00:02:46.650> would<00:02:46.829> become<00:02:47.130> say

and simply just plop that to your
computer<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.380> rest<00:03:58.590> will<00:03:58.770> be<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.980> same

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
computer and the rest will be the same

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.720 
computer and the rest will be the same
thing<00:03:59.430> as<00:03:59.550> earlier<00:04:00.170> but<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.560> advantage<00:04:02.489> of

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
thing as earlier but the advantage of

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.630 
thing as earlier but the advantage of
using<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.330> carry<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.950> faster

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
using the carry that is it is faster

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.770 
using the carry that is it is faster
than<00:04:06.570> using<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.230> USB<00:04:07.380> cord<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.980> machines<00:04:11.780> so

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
than using a USB cord to machines so

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.720 
than using a USB cord to machines so
there<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:12.989> go

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.000 

it<00:04:18.270> works<00:04:18.480> exactly<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:19.080> same<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.680> folder

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
it works exactly the same the folder

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.720 
it works exactly the same the folder
name<00:04:20.160> is<00:04:20.340> exactly<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.090> same<00:04:21.980> just<00:04:22.980> go<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.580> the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
name is exactly the same just go to the

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.260 
name is exactly the same just go to the
same<00:04:23.910> folder<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.570> find<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.050> that's<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:26.270> copy

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
same folder and find it that's it copy

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.290 
same folder and find it that's it copy
to<00:04:27.540> your<00:04:27.630> computer<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.200> upload

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.339 

there<00:04:34.870> we<00:04:34.990> have<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.319> for<00:04:35.530> two<00:04:35.770> files<00:04:37.229> it'd<00:04:38.229> be

there we have it for two files it'd be

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.399 
there we have it for two files it'd be
difficult<00:04:38.830> for<00:04:38.949> me<00:04:39.099> to<00:04:39.280> explain<00:04:40.090> how<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.409> edit

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
difficult for me to explain how to edit

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
should recommend that would be maybe

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.010 
should recommend that would be maybe
easier<00:04:50.620> or<00:04:51.009> better<00:04:51.310> on<00:04:52.030> video<00:04:52.539> recording

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
easier or better on video recording

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.350 
easier or better on video recording
because<00:04:53.289> I'm<00:04:53.590> sorry<00:04:53.770> video<00:04:54.099> editing<00:04:54.520> because

there's<00:04:55.599> always<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.050> issue<00:04:56.620> with<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.669> file

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
there's always the issue with the file

there's always the issue with the file
type<00:04:58.479> the<00:04:58.750> code<00:04:58.930> I<00:04:59.110> can<00:04:59.259> stop<00:04:59.650> at<00:04:59.800> that<00:05:00.180> for

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
type the code I can stop at that for

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.719 
type the code I can stop at that for
example<00:05:01.659> I<00:05:01.930> was<00:05:02.139> about<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.830> suggest<00:05:03.009> Windows

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729

example I was about to suggest Windows
Movie<00:05:03.909> Maker<00:05:04.090> because<00:05:05.080> that<00:05:05.289> is<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.680> easiest

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
Movie Maker because that is the easiest

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.709 
Movie Maker because that is the easiest
and<00:05:06.340> smallest<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:06.819> download<00:05:07.240> for<00:05:07.419> video

can take much longer time and sometimes

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.430 
can take much longer time and sometimes
it's<00:06:30.000> almost<00:06:30.270> instant<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:30.900> have<00:06:31.020> to<00:06:31.140> complete

here you can see the process right now
it's<00:06:34.710> only<00:06:34.920> 23%<00:06:35.480> process<00:06:36.480> so<00:06:36.780> you're<00:06:37.440> going<00:06:37.590> to
