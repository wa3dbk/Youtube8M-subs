00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.960
 Please forgive me for wearing this now. 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.380
 Because I just finished the game 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.440
 It's really hot! 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.040
 Many people find it very strange 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.500
 My fireproof underwear, how to be different from others 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.060
 Plus there are some pipes here. 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.290
 In fact, it is ice, that is, there is a small ice bucket on the car. 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.910
 Inside with ice cubes 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.810
 It will cycle during the game 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.140
 Let the driver's physical strength consume a little less 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170
 Can be a little more comfortable 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.480
 This game, the sharp-eyed reader 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.310
 Even often there is concern whether it is 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.110
 GO Che Chi GP team or my FB 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.650
 Or a friend of GO Chezhi, I should know that I changed the car. 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.650
 N group from the original FD2 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.190
 Switch to group A of DC5 now 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.820
 My biggest feeling is 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.800
 Although I want to support Taiwan's motorsports 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.360
 But on the rules, let me have a little regret. 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.720
 The previous FD2 is N group, the displacement is 2.0 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.810
 Original engine, just the chassis is unlimited 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.340
 Then right drive, and now 350hp horsepower 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.060
 The interior of the engine is all forged 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.660
 Even including his pneumatic jack 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.610
 Plus the left-hand drive I am used to. 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.260
 But actually still in the same group 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.060
 You can imagine how much I have been bored before. 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.800
 I am very happy about this game, I am not only finishing the game. 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.510
 Also stood on the podium 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.020
 The lap result also reached my goal. 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.170
 I only contacted this car for three days. 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.980
 But these three days I keep practicing. 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.270
 Slowly get familiar with the condition of this car. 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.950
 I will tell you a little bit about it. 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.710
 DC5 and FD2 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.010
 After all, one is the chassis of the seven generations. 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.810
 One is the eight generations of chassis 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.130
 The difference between the two, at high speed corners 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.280
 FD2 is relatively stable, especially the rear wheel 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.820
 But at low speed corners, flexibility 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.300
 DC5 is very flexible 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.070
 It can be said to be a very good teaching car 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.470
 The so-called teaching car is 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.200
 If you want to learn racing 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.510
 That car will be your good friend. 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.840
 Because it allows you to grow and make you progress 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.550
 Sitting in the car can feel it is 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.680
 After all, this car is a group A. 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.920
 In addition to the appearance of a wide body 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.000
 Competitive shock absorber 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.410
 There are three points like this 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.360
 These three points are the pressure jacks. 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.960
 Inside the car, the first one has a quick-release steering wheel 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.690
 If the steering wheel is not unplugged 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.820
 I have no way to get inside the car. 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.120
 After the steering wheel is mounted 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.610
 The first one can be seen, the sitting position of the racer 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.070
 Because on both sides, we have Hans 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.270
 Plus the relationship of the helmet 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.050
 So when the vehicle hit some hits today 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.470
 There is some protection, plus Hans 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.500
 Look at my hand, this angle 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.310
 This is the fastest response angle 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.620
 So driving on a normal road 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.150
 Of course, everyone can't drive like this. 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.850
 Because driving like this is actually full of hardships. 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.180
 But if you have a chance to try this drive 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.690
 The left and right reactions will be the fastest 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.290
 Because if you are a little farther 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.420
 Although you have a bend on your hand 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.100
 But when you turn the steering wheel today 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.310
 The hand will straighten, and the distance will be straighter 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.770
 So remember, let your hands bend as much as possible 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.700
 That car many thought it was a sequence 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.910
 Actually not, it is still a traditional six-speed hand row. 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.720
 Just have some changes, fisheye bearings 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.250
 So it's a short trip to shift. 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.980
 The second is that the mistake of shifting will be reduced. 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.580
 Then I have considered it, I want to change to the sequence. 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.720
 But currently see some serial gearbox DC5 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.910
 The lap is not fast 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.460
 So I still maintain such a gearbox. 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.830
 There are some buttons on it 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.660
 There are three main 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.640
 First gasoline pump 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.560
 Second fan 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.360
 The third is the oil pump, the oil pump is very important. 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.710
 Because DC5 is easy to get warm up 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.920
 Because of this car, its compression ratio 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.520
 Its ignition is different from the average commercial car. 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.140
 So we have no way to add 98 unleaded petrol competition. 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.880
 I have to add 103 105 racing gasoline. 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.580
 Must be 100% racing gasoline 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.020
 One liter is about two hundred or so 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.810
 So itâ€™s very expensive than a game. 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.910
 There is a screen below 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.850
 This screen is to look at the back 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.060
 There is a lens behind 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.760
 Can you see if the car behind you catches up with you? 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.660
 Or is there anyone who wants to overtake your car? 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.670
 You can see the car behind through this screen. 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.110
 There is a water jet below 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.520
 Water jet it has a bottle 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.230
 When the temperature of the vehicle is too high today 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.110
 There is also a way to save it, that is, water jet 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.270
 If you turn the petrol pump fan and the oil pump open 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.980
 If there is this water jet 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.050
 Can cool down a little 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.810
 If the water jet is sprayed, there is no way to cool down. 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.610
 Probably you have to retire, there may be some problems 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.710
 Dashboard Haltech 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.150
 The computer is also Haltech Super2000 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.080
 There is a lot of information on the dashboard 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.390
 Including your oil pressure, your oil temperature 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.990
 The highest speed gear of your game 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.310
 Many, the above information is very, very complicated 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.130
 The other is the OMP racing chair, which is made of carbon fiber. 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.010
 And standard anti-roll cage 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.270
 This is probably some standard competitive interiors for this car. 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.410
 Of course there will be no air conditioning and no satellite navigation. 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.380
 There are no leather chairs and no electric chairs. 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.510
 And only one chair 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.700
 But this car has spot welding all the cars. 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.250
 Full car spot welding plus vehicle settings 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.050
 Is very suitable for the Dapeng Bay Circuit 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.180
 Especially in some low speed corners 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.490
 His front wheel is very flexible 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.520
 The FD2 is also flexible on the front wheels. 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.010
 But because its rear axle is relatively stable 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.960
 So when you are cornering 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.740
 Actually at low speed 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.450
 Your car's tail is a bit slippery, it will be more conducive to your cornering. 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.200
 DC5 performs very well at this point 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.400
 If the chassis is set well 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.110
 Itâ€™s a great car. 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.620
 However, if you are using FD2, you should do more chassis settings. 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.540
 Plus these two cars because this one is wide 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.980
 Therefore, this car is also better at high speed driving stability. 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.010
 Although the specifications of the tire rims are exactly the same 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.900
 However, its stability is better at high speeds. 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.350
 it is good! We are four drivers in this game. 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.060
 There are three drivers on the podium 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.590
 Congratulations to my second brother, congratulations to Cai Weijie and myself. 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.020
 Hard work about 3/3 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.230
 Finally at the third stop, stand on the podium 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.150
 I hope that more friends from the fourth station will come to the Dapeng Bay Circuit. 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.170
 Look at the Option cup, a lot of support for domestic motorsports 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.170
 See you next time!
