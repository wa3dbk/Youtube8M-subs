00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.149
 hello to all so I find a 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.490
 new video to do like it's 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.290
 written in the title but small tips 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.160
 to have pretty hair in good 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.529
 shiny health really pretty so this 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.720
 are really rules I can say of 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.029
 basis that I think you all know 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.619
 but I found that good of them 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.539
 group a little in a video 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.580
 so we will start right away with 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.789
 the first advice and it would be to 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.140
 not tie to hair often I 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.989
 think the night is good they 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.150
 be detached that obvious more than your 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.010
 hair take the brand flavors 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.720
 of elastics when this awakening is 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 really ugly or need to breathe 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.140
 all this so it's really something 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.339
 essential thing 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.470
 then if I were asked to give a 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.430
 other advice it would be to cut them 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.890
 regularly 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.239
 so I know it's mostly scary at 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.470
 some who want to let themselves 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.580
 to grow hair I'm in this case 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.559
 I let myself grow hair so 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.110
 here but I think it's really 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.909
 they are six to outsmart voice tests 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.890
 forks at the end of my hair I 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.939
 find it really not pretty and I think 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.979
 we have a little bit of everything in the same case 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.870
 so do not hesitate to cut even one 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.880
 centimeter it will not show and I'm in 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.410
 healthy 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.790
 if it will not grow faster I do not know 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.260
 who is it who says that when we cut 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.240
 hair grows faster but just 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.440
 they will be prettier and hair without 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.970
 fork is still a lot I'm 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.230
 besides, I could tell you that 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.780
 avoid shampoos with sulfate it 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.100
 really has your hair after I 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.540
 I'm not even though I do not know 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.210
 exactly but I think it takes 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.100
 really special shampoos without 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.930
 all the chemical components there can 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 to have two in the most shampoos 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.330
 basic I think really 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.080
 best for our hair and the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.110
 assault - then have brushes 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.850
 suited to your hair type so I 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.650
 know that I have curly hair and 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.060
 I do not brush them in the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.800
 day I brush them that when I 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.270
 am in the shower or if I want 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.150
 really the headdresses and I do not take a 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.860
 wide comb in I know that the 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.750
 to peel brush with wild boar bristles 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.670
 really good for the hair 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.560
 also smooth so it really finds him 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.380
 your brush to you that suits your 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.209
 type of hair and jeans back suddenly 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.950
 to another board it would be not 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.780
 the brushes and too often really 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.630
 you want to break you break your 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.810
 hair when you brush them 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.270
 the hours frankly sealed free 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.040
 if I can say brush them in the morning if 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.140
 you want but not all day 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.520
 these really salty planes breaks when 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.210
 you to brush your hair and you see 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.710
 you have lots of hair on the floor or 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.160
 on the brush frankly it's not good 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.530
 sign 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.390
 so do not brush your hair 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.890
 all the time I see quite a challenge to 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.090
 high school who are with gold for the center 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.190
 the races really do not understand 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.630
 why does France really have the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.460
 girls avoid brushing them 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.380
 hair too often so then we 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.120
 go on to my last two tips and I 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.010
 think the most important this would be 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.230
 to avoid the heat so it's obvious 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.550
 but I know it's hard to do because 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.350
 that I read my hair 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.850
 regularly so now I have 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.230
 tried to me levy it's once a 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.800
 week and I find that it's already 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.810
 a lot 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.450
 so use a heat protector 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.430
 before going to the hair dryer and 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.140
 before the straightener will make it looped and all 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.020
 that's me now I'm reading them 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.070
 hair once a week and I see 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.330
 really the difference on my hair 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.060
 I have fewer fossils are more 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.970
 shiny more flexible so they are 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.340
 will miss but advises so it would 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.900
 silks cvo shampoo i think that 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.820
 it's not necessary to know the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.420
 hair every day will spoil your 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.350
 hair and that makes them fatter so 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.720
 really i think two shampoos 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.360
 per week so it's fine once a 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.340
 week make a shampoo after 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.930
 shampoo and mask is really there 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.730
 it's the same 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.010
 do not put 40 thousand tons of 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.180
 products on your different hair do not 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.680
 do not put 5.6 product as a result like 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.810
 that on your hair really that's them 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.000
 aggress and you will not really see 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.380
 our results they may be more 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.520
 nice sweeter on the way out of the shower 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.890
 but that's not why they are 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.450
 really more fed up so here it was 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.780
 that I hope this video will have you 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.190
 enjoyed 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.840
 so that's really my little advice 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.090
 to have a prettier hair more 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.830
 softer soft is really prettier 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.570
 for the summer so do not hesitate to me 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.370
