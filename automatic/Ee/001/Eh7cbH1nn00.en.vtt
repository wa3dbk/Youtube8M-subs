00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
high-powered that can chop up dry

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.930 
high-powered that can chop up dry
ingredients<00:00:56.410> if<00:00:56.560> you<00:00:56.739> however<00:00:56.950> don't<00:00:57.670> have<00:00:57.910> a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
ingredients if you however don't have a

ingredients if you however don't have a
budget<00:00:58.450> for<00:00:58.860> a<00:00:59.860> little<00:01:00.850> bit<00:01:00.940> more<00:01:01.090> expensive

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
budget for a little bit more expensive

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.780 
budget for a little bit more expensive
blender<00:01:01.899> then<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.590> can<00:01:02.800> get<00:01:03.040> a<00:01:03.250> food<00:01:03.520> chopper

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
blender then you can get a food chopper

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.649 
blender then you can get a food chopper
which<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.360> what<00:01:04.869> I<00:01:04.989> also<00:01:05.229> have<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:07.390> looks<00:01:07.510> just

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
which is what I also have it looks just

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.620 
which is what I also have it looks just
like<00:01:07.810> this<00:01:08.050> I'll<00:01:08.470> link<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.430> below<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:10.390> was

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
like this I'll link to it below it was

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.620 
like this I'll link to it below it was
probably<00:01:11.050> about<00:01:11.320> I<00:01:11.650> don't<00:01:12.310> know<00:01:12.460> eight<00:01:13.270> nine

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
probably about I don't know eight nine

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.250 
probably about I don't know eight nine
dollars<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.470> wasn't<00:01:14.740> really<00:01:15.010> expensive<00:01:15.670> but

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
dollars it wasn't really expensive but

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.780 
dollars it wasn't really expensive but
you<00:01:17.260> just<00:01:17.440> put<00:01:17.650> your<00:01:17.740> ingredients<00:01:18.340> in<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.610> and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
you just put your ingredients in it and

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.640 
you just put your ingredients in it and
you<00:01:19.210> press<00:01:19.450> this<00:01:19.600> button<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.140> it<00:01:20.409> spins

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
you press this button and it spins

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.289 
you press this button and it spins
around<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.040> chops<00:01:21.280> them<00:01:21.460> up<00:01:21.549> it<00:01:21.790> does<00:01:22.000> take<00:01:22.270> a

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
around and chops them up it does take a

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.060 
around and chops them up it does take a
little<00:01:22.510> bit<00:01:22.630> longer<00:01:22.960> because<00:01:23.590> it's<00:01:23.860> really

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
little bit longer because it's really

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.670 
little bit longer because it's really
meant<00:01:24.370> for<00:01:24.460> things<00:01:24.820> like<00:01:25.350> vegetables<00:01:26.350> and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
meant for things like vegetables and

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.760 
meant for things like vegetables and
fruit<00:01:26.979> something<00:01:27.850> more<00:01:28.060> soft<00:01:28.650> softer<00:01:29.650> than

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
fruit something more soft softer than

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.510 
fruit something more soft softer than
hard<00:01:30.720> hard<00:01:31.720> dry<00:01:31.990> foods<00:01:32.320> but<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.100> does<00:01:33.280> work

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
hard hard dry foods but it does work

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.620 
hard hard dry foods but it does work
I've<00:01:33.790> tried<00:01:34.150> it<00:01:34.799> however<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:36.220> nutribullet

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
I've tried it however the nutribullet

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.270 
I've tried it however the nutribullet
works<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.810> lot<00:01:37.960> faster<00:01:39.060> than<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.510> food<00:01:40.750> chopper

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
works a lot faster than the food chopper

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.969 
works a lot faster than the food chopper
then<00:01:42.280> you'll<00:01:42.700> need<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:43.030> 1/3<00:01:43.540> cup<00:01:43.830> measuring<00:01:44.830> cup

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
then you'll need a 1/3 cup measuring cup

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.100 
then you'll need a 1/3 cup measuring cup
because<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:45.909> do<00:01:46.060> equal<00:01:46.450> parts<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.960> each

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
because I do equal parts of each

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.990 
because I do equal parts of each
ingredient<00:01:47.409> except<00:01:48.100> for<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.369> cinnamon<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:48.939> do

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
ingredient except for the cinnamon I do

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.289 
ingredient except for the cinnamon I do
add<00:01:49.240> cinnamon<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.350> do<00:01:50.409> two<00:01:51.090> teaspoons<00:01:52.090> of

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
add cinnamon and I do two teaspoons of

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.200 
add cinnamon and I do two teaspoons of
cinnamon<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:52.869> you'll<00:01:53.049> need<00:01:53.229> some<00:01:54.210> measuring

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
cinnamon so you'll need some measuring

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.039 
cinnamon so you'll need some measuring
spoons<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:56.290> measure<00:01:56.500> out<00:01:56.710> your<00:01:56.890> cinnamon<00:01:57.340> and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
spoons to measure out your cinnamon and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.820 
spoons to measure out your cinnamon and
a<00:01:59.490> container<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:01.180> put<00:02:01.420> your<00:02:01.689> powder<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.439> with<00:02:02.799> a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
with your tissue repair and growth

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.750 
with your tissue repair and growth
they're<00:04:35.960> full<00:04:36.200> of<00:04:36.320> protein<00:04:36.350> about<00:04:37.010> 9<00:04:37.340> grams<00:04:37.640> of

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
they're full of protein about 9 grams of

they're full of protein about 9 grams of
protein<00:04:38.210> 5<00:04:39.080> grams<00:04:39.410> of<00:04:39.590> fiber<00:04:40.480> so<00:04:41.480> we<00:04:41.600> got<00:04:41.890> 1/3

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
protein 5 grams of fiber so we got 1/3

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.000 
protein 5 grams of fiber so we got 1/3
of<00:04:42.980> a<00:04:43.070> cup<00:04:43.100> in<00:04:43.520> there<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:45.200> just<00:04:45.530> put<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:45.740> in

of antioxidants it's anti-inflammatory

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.120 
of antioxidants it's anti-inflammatory
it<00:04:57.650> reduces<00:04:58.580> insulin<00:04:58.970> resistance<00:04:59.690> and<00:04:59.990> it<00:05:00.740> can

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
it reduces insulin resistance and it can

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.970 
it reduces insulin resistance and it can
help<00:05:01.370> lower<00:05:01.730> blood<00:05:02.270> sugar<00:05:02.330> levels<00:05:03.140> so<00:05:03.800> you're

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
going to you're going to go ahead and

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.730 
going to you're going to go ahead and
blend<00:05:34.490> it<00:05:34.760> up<00:05:34.970> you're<00:05:35.390> going<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.570> however<00:05:35.870> want

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
blend it up you're going to however want

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.060 
blend it up you're going to however want
to<00:05:37.210> watch<00:05:38.210> it<00:05:38.540> because<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.170> will<00:05:39.260> heat<00:05:39.590> up<00:05:39.800> and

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
to watch it because it will heat up and

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.280 
to watch it because it will heat up and
then<00:05:40.310> it'll<00:05:40.520> start<00:05:40.760> to<00:05:40.790> clump<00:05:41.060> together<00:05:41.300> so<00:05:42.110> it

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
then it'll start to clump together so it

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.810 
then it'll start to clump together so it
starts<00:05:42.560> to<00:05:42.680> like<00:05:42.830> kind<00:05:43.130> of<00:05:43.190> release<00:05:43.610> some

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
starts to like kind of release some

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.420 
starts to like kind of release some
moisture<00:05:44.330> so<00:05:45.050> I'm<00:05:45.110> gonna<00:05:45.200> go<00:05:45.320> ahead<00:05:45.350> and<00:05:45.710> turn

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
moisture so I'm gonna go ahead and turn

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.420 
moisture so I'm gonna go ahead and turn
that<00:05:46.490> on<00:05:46.790> now<00:05:47.030> you<00:05:47.090> just<00:05:47.450> push<00:05:47.690> down<00:05:48.160> right<00:05:49.160> now

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
that on now you just push down right now

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.160 
that on now you just push down right now
if<00:05:49.640> you<00:05:49.850> look<00:05:50.030> at<00:05:50.150> this<00:05:50.360> you<00:05:50.570> can<00:05:50.720> kind<00:05:50.870> of<00:05:51.020> see

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
if you look at this you can kind of see

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.830 
if you look at this you can kind of see
the<00:05:51.320> moisture<00:05:51.830> in<00:05:52.040> it<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:53.120> moisture<00:05:53.330> kind<00:05:53.720> of

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
the moisture in it the moisture kind of

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.870 
the moisture in it the moisture kind of
releases<00:05:54.410> when<00:05:54.860> you<00:05:54.980> start<00:05:55.250> chopping<00:05:55.670> it<00:05:55.790> up

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
releases when you start chopping it up

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.790 
releases when you start chopping it up
so<00:05:56.540> you<00:05:56.600> might<00:05:56.780> have<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:57.050> stop<00:05:57.350> it<00:05:57.560> a<00:05:57.620> little

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
so you might have to stop it a little

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.400 
so you might have to stop it a little
bit<00:05:58.010> and<00:05:58.220> shake<00:05:59.000> it<00:05:59.150> up<00:05:59.300> so<00:05:59.840> that<00:05:59.870> it<00:06:00.110> kind<00:06:00.320> of

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
bit and shake it up so that it kind of

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.790 
bit and shake it up so that it kind of
doesn't<00:06:01.340> get<00:06:01.460> too<00:06:01.670> clumped<00:06:02.090> together<00:06:02.800> and

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
doesn't get too clumped together and

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.450 
doesn't get too clumped together and
then<00:06:04.610> just<00:06:04.790> start<00:06:05.060> it<00:06:05.150> again

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
then just start it again

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.280 
then just start it again
all<00:06:07.460> right<00:06:07.700> I<00:06:07.880> think<00:06:08.240> that<00:06:08.390> it's<00:06:08.660> good<00:06:08.930> I'm

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
all right I think that it's good I'm

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.830 
all right I think that it's good I'm
going<00:06:09.440> to<00:06:09.530> just<00:06:10.030> kind<00:06:11.030> of<00:06:11.090> hit<00:06:11.330> it<00:06:11.450> on<00:06:11.570> the<00:06:11.660> side

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
going to just kind of hit it on the side

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.690 
going to just kind of hit it on the side
to<00:06:12.380> make<00:06:12.410> sure<00:06:12.560> it<00:06:12.860> gets<00:06:12.980> out<00:06:13.190> of<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:13.430> blade

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
to make sure it gets out of the blade

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.180 
to make sure it gets out of the blade
and<00:06:14.110> you<00:06:15.110> can<00:06:15.260> see<00:06:15.470> kind<00:06:15.680> of<00:06:15.710> where<00:06:15.860> it's<00:06:16.010> get

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
and you can see kind of where it's get
