00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.880
 before the break we leave you with some 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:08.320
 interesting tips from our friends 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.320
 of autorex 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.720
 hello friends and welcome to a new 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.730
 sequence of the expert in your car today we 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.189
 We found in auto center in forest 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:35.180
 through that is on the street of 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:37.280
 the business in surquillo and before 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.430
 talk about our subject I would like to leave you 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.320
 a riddle what thing is what 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.620
 during the first three years we 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.330
 let's do and then we'll do it every 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.030
 year or every six months they guessed it then 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.040
 if it's about the technical review and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.640
 when we talk about technical revision to 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.769
 Many people are afraid because because 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.510
 they think that when they go to one of the 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.780
 technical inspection centers in our 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.780
 country 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.180
 what better would it be then to be able 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.060
 make sure before taking your car to the 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.550
 technical review of the vehicle 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.500
 really be in excellent condition and is 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.050
 that here in auto center can be 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.670
 perform the main tests such 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.270
 as in the revision plants 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.500
 techniques a part we have the review 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.030
 the alignment direction that is 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.910
 yes our suspension our address 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.520
 is in the correct state on the other hand 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.860
 we have the suspension bank where we go 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.650
 to be able to check if the shock absorbers 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.520
 and the springs of our car are 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.400
 They are in good condition and finally 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.230
 we have the brake tester with the 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.420
 which will we verify the correct 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.970
 Brake performance status 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.100
 main and also the brake 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.660
 parking of our vehicle 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:06.190
 that's how in a very few minutes we can 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:09.100
 check suspension alignment and 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.200
 Brakes on the same equipment 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.390
 another test that was analyzed here in 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.000
 other centers is the analysis of 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.790
 gases that is one of the main 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.030
 Rejection causes in reviews 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.010
 techniques and although you do not believe it 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.890
 finally if we are polluting more 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.500
 of what we owe we are not only 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.990
 harming our health but what 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.500
 are offering is bouncing money to 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.240
 air because we are bouncing 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.660
 unburned fuels with our tube 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.480
 of escape and as our lukewarm and when 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.640
 we drive at night we get the light of 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.880
 the headlights that a vehicle remains in 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.210
 our against also this we are going to 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.570
 be able to control and regulate here in another 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.260
 center through an aligner team 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.110
 of lights 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.159
 through this team we make sure 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:08.090
 that we will not return to anyone about 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:12.709
 tracks and on the other hand we will ensure that 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.230
 we are always lighting the way like this 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.629
 who already know friends the next time 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.310
 they touch the technical review come 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.040
 before to other centers 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.730
 oscar services and make sure 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.250
 in the revision with 20 we see ourselves in a 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.390
 next sequence of the expert in your car 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.390
 until then
