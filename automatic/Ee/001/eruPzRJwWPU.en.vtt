00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.900 

so<00:00:01.469> here<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.920> cable<00:00:02.490> extension<00:00:04.730> it's<00:00:05.730> a

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
so here is a cable extension it's a

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.430 
so here is a cable extension it's a
headphone<00:00:06.299> extension<00:00:06.810> cable<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:08.840> it<00:00:09.840> didn't

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
headphone extension cable and it didn't

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.620 
headphone extension cable and it didn't
even<00:00:10.590> work<00:00:10.769> right<00:00:11.250> out<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.639> package<00:00:11.849> it

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
even work right out of the package it

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.080 
even work right out of the package it
was<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:14.549> end<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.360> if<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.760> touched<00:00:17.760> it

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
was this end here if you just touched it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.870 
was this end here if you just touched it
like<00:00:18.680> this<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.189> move<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.520> cord<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
like this like just move the cord a

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.720 
like this like just move the cord a
little<00:00:21.119> bit<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.900> would<00:00:22.170> crackle<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.100> also<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
little bit it would crackle and also the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.200 
little bit it would crackle and also the
volume<00:00:24.320> lowered<00:00:25.320> as<00:00:25.619> opposed<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.699> just<00:00:26.730> using

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
volume lowered as opposed to just using

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.189 
volume lowered as opposed to just using
the<00:00:27.300> headphones<00:00:27.750> normally<00:00:29.060> so<00:00:30.060> since<00:00:31.019> it

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the headphones normally so since it

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.190 
the headphones normally so since it
didn't<00:00:31.500> work<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.160> junkie<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:33.050> took<00:00:34.050> it

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
didn't work and it was junkie I took it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.229 
didn't work and it was junkie I took it
apart<00:00:34.790> and<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.960> that's<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
apart and you can see here that's the

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.119 
apart and you can see here that's the
black<00:00:39.239> plastic<00:00:39.600> stuff<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.559> glue<00:00:40.829> that

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
black plastic stuff and the glue that

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.290 
black plastic stuff and the glue that
was<00:00:41.870> all<00:00:42.870> around<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.430> solder<00:00:44.670> points<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
was all around the the solder points and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.779 
was all around the the solder points and
stuff<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.780> here's<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.340> female<00:00:47.340> barrel

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
stuff like here's the female barrel

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.500 
stuff like here's the female barrel
section<00:00:48.860> and<00:00:49.860> here's<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> male<00:00:50.520> part<00:00:51.360> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
section and here's the male part you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.290 
section and here's the male part you
plug<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.670> I've<00:00:53.789> SAT<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.210> on

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
plug in and you can see I've SAT it on

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.040 
plug in and you can see I've SAT it on
my<00:00:54.539> own<00:00:54.570> wires<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.699> here's<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> old<00:00:57.000> cable

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.429 

it's<00:01:01.050> stranded<00:01:02.359> stranded<00:01:03.359> wire<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.080> you

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
it's stranded stranded wire and you

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.560 
it's stranded stranded wire and you
probably<00:01:04.650> can't<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.360> red

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
probably can't see it but the the red

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.929 
probably can't see it but the the red
and<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.720> white<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.680> thin<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.700> just

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and the white it's so thin it's just

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
and the white it's so thin it's just
something<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.689> stranded<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> red

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
something and it's stranded in the red

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.070 
something and it's stranded in the red
the<00:01:10.740> white<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.100> well<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.810> surprising

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the white as well so it's not surprising

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.710 
the white as well so it's not surprising
that<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> cold<00:01:14.460> solder<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.299> poor

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that they have a cold solder or a poor

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.820 
that they have a cold solder or a poor
sadder<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.990> know<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.229> cable<00:01:19.650> just

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
sadder and you know this cable just

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.490 
sadder and you know this cable just
wasn't<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> took<00:01:22.320> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
wasn't good at all and so I took it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.899 
wasn't good at all and so I took it
apart<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:25.009> again<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.420> said<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> am<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.909> hooked

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
apart and again I said I am I hooked

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.249 
apart and again I said I am I hooked
these<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.650> multimeter<00:01:32.520> I

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
these on and now with the multimeter I

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.120 
these on and now with the multimeter I
tested<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> continuity<00:01:36.560> hook<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.770> real

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
tested the continuity hook that up real

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.910 
tested the continuity hook that up real
quick<00:01:38.430> here

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.500 

so<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.040> cool<00:01:46.280> part<00:01:46.580> is<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:47.000> there's<00:01:47.270> like

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
so the cool part is is there's like

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.860 
so the cool part is is there's like
three<00:01:47.840> different<00:01:48.050> sections<00:01:48.470> for<00:01:49.870> headphone

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
three different sections for headphone

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.930 
three different sections for headphone
cable<00:01:51.170> there's<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.310> right<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.580> left<00:01:52.610> channel

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
cable there's the right and left channel

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.170 
cable there's the right and left channel
and<00:01:53.150> then<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.420> microphone<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:55.610> put

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
and then the microphone so you can put

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.270 
and then the microphone so you can put
your<00:01:56.470> let's<00:01:57.470> see<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:57.680> don't<00:01:57.770> remember<00:01:57.950> which<00:01:58.220> is

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
your let's see I don't remember which is

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.050 
your let's see I don't remember which is
which<00:01:58.460> but<00:02:00.010> we'll<00:02:01.010> find<00:02:01.310> out<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.610> second

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
which but we'll find out in a second

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.040 
which but we'll find out in a second
we'll<00:02:02.180> do<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.450> continuity<00:02:03.050> test<00:02:03.350> here<00:02:03.940> and

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
we'll do the continuity test here and

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.830 
we'll do the continuity test here and
for<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.110> barrel<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.500> put<00:02:06.710> inside<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:08.330> see

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
for the barrel you put inside and see

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.550 
for the barrel you put inside and see
heard<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.440> squeaky<00:02:09.950> sound<00:02:11.200> there<00:02:12.200> that

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
heard that squeaky sound there that

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.860 
heard that squeaky sound there that
means<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:12.800> have<00:02:12.830> continuity<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:14.300> tested<00:02:14.750> all

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
means I have continuity so I tested all

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.210 
means I have continuity so I tested all
these<00:02:15.100> connections<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:18.220> hopefully

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
these connections and you can hopefully

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.190 
these connections and you can hopefully
take<00:02:19.430> my<00:02:19.790> word<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.510> they<00:02:20.780> all<00:02:20.900> worked

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
take my word for it that they all worked

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.100 
take my word for it that they all worked
fine<00:02:21.560> but<00:02:22.490> we'll<00:02:22.580> do<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> audio<00:02:23.450> test<00:02:23.750> here<00:02:23.960> in<00:02:24.050> a

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
fine but we'll do a audio test here in a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.590 
fine but we'll do a audio test here in a
second<00:02:24.500> but<00:02:25.340> what<00:02:25.520> was<00:02:25.700> interesting<00:02:25.730> was<00:02:26.270> i

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
second but what was interesting was i

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.560 
second but what was interesting was i
don't<00:02:26.780> sattar<00:02:27.080> very<00:02:27.440> often<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.420> we're<00:02:29.420> going

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
don't sattar very often and we're going

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.650 
don't sattar very often and we're going
to<00:02:29.600> see<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:29.990> let's<00:02:30.260> see<00:02:30.530> i<00:02:31.120> melted<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.300> crap

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
to see this let's see i melted the crap

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.910 
to see this let's see i melted the crap
out<00:02:32.990> of<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.830> bottom<00:02:34.220> here<00:02:34.550> oops<00:02:35.530> fact<00:02:36.530> I

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
out of the bottom here oops fact I

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.890 
out of the bottom here oops fact I
thought<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:37.580> wasn't<00:02:37.730> gonna<00:02:37.880> work<00:02:38.000> anymore<00:02:38.270> but

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
thought it wasn't gonna work anymore but

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.560 
thought it wasn't gonna work anymore but
it<00:02:39.020> did<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:43.220> can<00:02:43.430> kind<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.700> see<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:44.390> really

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
it did and you can kind of see it really

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.220 
it did and you can kind of see it really
melted<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:46.150> yeah<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.480> don't<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.900> secret

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
melted it so yeah I don't have a secret

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.460 
melted it so yeah I don't have a secret
to<00:02:48.530> soldering<00:02:48.980> down<00:02:49.280> yet<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.270> that<00:02:50.450> was<00:02:50.600> kind

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
to soldering down yet so that was kind

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.710 
to soldering down yet so that was kind
of<00:02:51.560> interesting<00:02:51.680> how<00:02:52.630> everything<00:02:53.630> was

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
of interesting how everything was

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.720 
of interesting how everything was
melting<00:02:54.140> down<00:02:54.290> but<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.530> kind<00:02:54.800> of<00:02:54.890> put<00:02:55.550> some

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
melting down but I kind of put some

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.699 
melting down but I kind of put some
sattar<00:02:56.000> on<00:02:56.209> these<00:02:56.360> wires<00:02:56.630> tinned<00:02:57.110> them<00:02:57.380> and

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
sattar on these wires tinned them and

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.400 
sattar on these wires tinned them and
then<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.340> heat<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:58.970> up<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.540> let<00:02:59.810> attach<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
then I heat it up and let attach the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.680 
then I heat it up and let attach the
existing<00:03:00.950> sadder<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:01.640> they're<00:03:02.300> probably<00:03:02.480> not

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
existing sadder so they're probably not

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.770 
existing sadder so they're probably not
very<00:03:02.750> good<00:03:03.170> satyrs<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:04.070> they<00:03:04.700> do<00:03:04.760> work<00:03:05.180> so

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
very good satyrs but they do work so

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.040 
very good satyrs but they do work so
let's<00:03:06.680> go<00:03:06.890> do<00:03:07.070> an<00:03:07.100> audio<00:03:07.430> test<00:03:08.000> here<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:08.690> my

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
let's go do an audio test here and my

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.810 
let's go do an audio test here and my
iphone<00:03:09.709> here<00:03:10.160> first<00:03:11.120> we'll<00:03:11.330> do<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.660> with

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
iphone here first we'll do it with

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.300 
iphone here first we'll do it with
regular<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.290> headphones

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.830 

let<00:03:18.880> me<00:03:18.970> pick<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> song<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.860> do<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:25.270> I'll<00:03:25.599> turn<00:03:25.810> up

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
let me pick a song so do so I'll turn up

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.040 
let me pick a song so do so I'll turn up
the<00:03:25.959> volume<00:03:26.349> seeking<00:03:26.709> here<00:03:30.450> pick<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.480> very<00:03:31.780> good

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
the volume seeking here pick a very good

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.559 
the volume seeking here pick a very good
son<00:03:32.319> really<00:03:32.590> okay<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.900> can<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:35.920> just

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
son really okay so you can this is just

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.320 
son really okay so you can this is just
the<00:03:37.569> regular<00:03:37.959> volume<00:03:38.910> now<00:03:39.910> we'll<00:03:40.120> hook<00:03:40.269> this

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
the regular volume now we'll hook this

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.089 
the regular volume now we'll hook this
up<00:03:40.690> with<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.680> extension<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:44.410> will<00:03:44.709> still

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
up with the extension and it will still

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.340 
up with the extension and it will still
work<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:48.280> i<00:03:48.340> plug<00:03:48.610> that<00:03:48.790> into<00:03:49.000> there<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.630> i'm

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
work so i plug that into there and i'm

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.750 
work so i plug that into there and i'm
going<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.530> plug<00:03:50.680> this<00:03:50.920> into<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.340> iphone<00:03:53.760> wait

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
going to plug this into the iphone wait

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.520 
going to plug this into the iphone wait
wait<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> minute<00:03:55.390> here<00:03:55.569> i<00:03:55.630> know<00:03:56.080> i<00:03:56.110> got<00:03:56.380> that

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
wait a minute here i know i got that

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.100 
wait a minute here i know i got that
right<00:03:56.760> i'm<00:03:57.760> going<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:57.970> carefully<00:03:58.269> plug<00:03:58.870> this

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
right i'm going to carefully plug this

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:07.740 
right i'm going to carefully plug this
in<00:03:59.380> to<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:01.480> then<00:04:02.049> play<00:04:02.380> this<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:05.530> so<00:04:06.750> it's

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
in to and then play this and so it's

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.820 
in to and then play this and so it's
about<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.260> same<00:04:08.470> volume<00:04:10.319> so<00:04:11.319> that<00:04:11.349> means<00:04:11.650> my

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
about the same volume so that means my

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.300 
about the same volume so that means my
connections<00:04:12.430> were<00:04:12.700> better<00:04:12.940> than<00:04:13.060> what<00:04:13.959> it

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
connections were better than what it

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.330 
connections were better than what it
originally<00:04:15.310> came<00:04:15.730> with<00:04:16.169> but<00:04:17.169> um<00:04:17.350> obviously<00:04:18.100> i

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
originally came with but um obviously i

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.949 
originally came with but um obviously i
have<00:04:18.609> hookup<00:04:18.910> cables<00:04:19.329> here<00:04:19.479> this<00:04:19.660> isn't<00:04:19.930> a

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
have hookup cables here this isn't a

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.340 
have hookup cables here this isn't a
very<00:04:20.280> long-term<00:04:21.280> solution<00:04:22.210> but<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.020> was<00:04:23.169> fun

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
very long-term solution but it was fun

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.120 
very long-term solution but it was fun
to<00:04:23.380> take<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.800> cable<00:04:23.979> apart<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.729> see<00:04:25.600> that<00:04:26.130> the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
to take the cable apart and see that the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.060 
to take the cable apart and see that the
the<00:04:27.789> jacks<00:04:28.120> did<00:04:28.539> work<00:04:28.780> properly<00:04:29.320> it<00:04:29.590> was<00:04:29.800> just

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
the jacks did work properly it was just

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.560 
the jacks did work properly it was just
the<00:04:30.250> connections<00:04:30.850> of<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.060> cable<00:04:31.539> that<00:04:31.690> were

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
the connections of the cable that were

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.930 
the connections of the cable that were
poor<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:34.930> i<00:04:35.500> recommend<00:04:35.979> if<00:04:36.220> you<00:04:36.310> have<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.430> junkie

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
poor so i recommend if you have a junkie

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.469 
poor so i recommend if you have a junkie
cable<00:04:37.300> you<00:04:37.419> don't<00:04:37.539> like<00:04:38.430> use<00:04:39.430> your<00:04:39.700> i<00:04:40.150> used

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
cable you don't like use your i used

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.850 
cable you don't like use your i used
these<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.850> cutter<00:04:43.120> i<00:04:43.479> use<00:04:44.380> i<00:04:44.590> don't<00:04:44.770> have

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
these the in a cutter i use i don't have

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.460 
these the in a cutter i use i don't have
it<00:04:44.950> here<00:04:44.979> with<00:04:45.130> me<00:04:45.430> but<00:04:45.669> i<00:04:45.910> just<00:04:46.600> cut<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.930> black

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
it here with me but i just cut the black

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.920 
it here with me but i just cut the black
stuff<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:48.039> can<00:04:48.190> see<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.550> in<00:04:48.880> shards<00:04:49.600> here<00:04:49.840> it

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
stuff you can see it in shards here it

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.510 
stuff you can see it in shards here it
took<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.229> while<00:04:50.380> it<00:04:50.650> took<00:04:50.800> probably<00:04:50.979> half<00:04:51.370> an

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
took a while it took probably half an

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.540 
took a while it took probably half an
hour<00:04:51.930> it's<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.050> that<00:04:53.200> rip<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.860> cable<00:04:54.190> up<00:04:54.310> too

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
hour it's and that rip the cable up too

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.600 
hour it's and that rip the cable up too
bad<00:04:54.760> but<00:04:55.180> there's<00:04:55.330> a<00:04:55.419> fun<00:04:55.600> experiment<00:04:56.020> so<00:04:56.610> hope

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
bad but there's a fun experiment so hope

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.600 
bad but there's a fun experiment so hope
you<00:04:57.760> enjoyed<00:04:58.000> watching<00:04:58.240> this
