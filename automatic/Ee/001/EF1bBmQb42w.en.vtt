00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:09.590
 Cormorants Hello Yes 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:12.920
 It is now in the mating series pc PC Series And then 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.780
 Yes this time is Fujitsu 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:23.330
 I think I told you that it was born 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:28.090
 Well I think it is a little awkward type Makes you go easy and that 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.090
 I'm kind of a rough type 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.480
 Once Tour of it's in the school this simple Nico Rya 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.960
 There is no mistake 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.960
 From the box 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 It's a bit like this, it feels like it's coming here a little 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.780
 so 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.780
 If you raise it, the number goes up 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.880
 Well except when cleaning here 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:01.890
 Please try to tell this This is also well off without any problem I'm a locker from here 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.890
 It felt like I removed this hook 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.299
 It is a problem Well after 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.299
 2 types Well fine to say when the three types of squirrel followers 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.890
 In I describe a little later this is Well 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.450
 I'm not using dbd Ne'm maybe this place cd from this cd's tray 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.020
 Where 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.990
 Some water 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.119
 Because it is the best little bitty in or rather slightly 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.119
 It is there is only one large and medium-sized small resistance 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.170
 Most It is the long comparatively good a la Maison throttle 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.010
 I feel like I'm going into 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.330
 Therefore I think that I will finish making 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.730
 Umm 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:53.090
 The first three are here to do is first of here bis Yes I feel that is refreshing 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:57.130
 I wonder if I used a little slender tongue 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.130
 The rest is almost the same service 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.899
 During the year sheets for the time being 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.569
 Well Remove the type of and am Oite had you pulled out all the hard disk memory is 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.630
 You can easily replace it here 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.380
 I have become a zoo, but the expansion is also relatively easy 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.420
 But this is a little bit tomorrow 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.140
 Even a 55 went to cgx 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.190
 fmv 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.610
 a 030 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.610
 Isn't it 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.890
 It is here 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:41.540
 I want to try horse mackerel, but I open the challenge flat well 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.270
 After that , that line will remain the monitor cablening line in the open place . 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.950
 A little 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.330
 Name here 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.520
 It is difficult 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.990
 But this is the keyboard which it is from behind usually Castle or there is a portion where the screw stops 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.240
 I do, but this is just that 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:03.530
 It's heavy because it's like a road tape and it's heavy, but it's so much 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.530
 If you can raise it slowly 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.030
 It is this'm use cotton tape as this 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.030
 If you think something is wrong, you may not have stopped 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.030
 Nothing 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:24.560
 So why not let's go ahead 9 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:28.170
 Well I I have a lot of first way is when the little that say removing the flat-based humanities 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.610
 If this is the case this is why so little 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.810
 That 's why iron is too thick 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:38.160
 It's such a special kind of guy I wonder if it gets into a little thin groove 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.580
 I feel like pushing this into here 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.250
 And you're either here up Ku'o 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:48.530
 I do not go and confusing's right Nee 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:52.400
 I have a little time to go here, I feel like I'm going to eat here 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:57.480
 When is the Fu this kind of base that parliament still mode to stop in 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:00.830
 I will stop here and I will not go here 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.830
 Plunge into this groove 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.810
 Easy to miss you when you from the bus to break and not cable 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.860
 Hmm 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.860
 Such feeling 4 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.580
 That's it 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:25.090
 There is also water here and there 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.090
 It is this 12 to take off a hinge by participating in 1 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:34.030
 It's here to move 123 Three 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:38.260
 If 6 sweat this is off I do and this is not this is the country does not come off 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.770
 Here too here is pretty 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.569
 It's hard 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:48.199
 First of all, a few things 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:51.199
 You should go from here . Here is dbd Amen 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.800
 You there is a slave is a Yo we use in the sense in which 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.390
 from here 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.530
 I've always been strong here and here 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.530
 It is difficult here 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.030
 Here is a summary and it's like this 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.510
 Click 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.070
 If it does not Itadakanai raised in feeling value 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.990
 I think that there'm a little tough 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.060
 This is Tomoko 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.060
 In the beginning 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.710
 It is supposed to be here, but it's months 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.060
 Hmm 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.870
 There is also a cable here, so please do not fry it 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:35.050
 Hmm 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.050
 It means that you can not go to the hard disk unless you go here 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.390
 Pretty annoying 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.849
 Well here 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:46.300
 I will replace and unplug the LCD, but this cable or something 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:49.169
 Do you have any details 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.169
 There is wireless 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.740
 There is a speaker 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:58.180
 Oh and it's another flat cable here 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.180
 This is also small 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:08.260
 It is such a thing before this guy 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:11.220
 Because you're are pressed to such Fu from now 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.550
 Here to avoid scratching 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.360
 here 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.080
 It feels like putting in and raising a click 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.080
 I am doing this 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.010
 If you get here 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.010
 There is a hard disk here 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.330
 Such feeling is quite some places 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.190
 There are points 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:39.150
 It is a cat to I say I was a little while ago 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.950
 It is a squirrel kind of abc festival 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.950
 The smallest service is 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.360
 this 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.360
 Now you can see the cd tray 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:58.500
 This is the smallest 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.500
 There are only two types of people, so most are this big 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:07.820
 Nechotto not Hosah all this as I said you were awkward now and here that here does not open 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.110
 The fard risk obtained from is below this 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.280
 so 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.889
 this 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:18.620
 Also the keyboard 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:23.040
 I will usually come off if I remove the same screw whether it comes off 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:28.110
 With'm use cotton tape me rather than the squirrel 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:34.270
 So if you think it's heavy , you want to make it even if you miss it 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:35.639
 I do not know, but it is 8 people tape, but there is no problem if it is raised slowly 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.610
 Such feeling 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:42.229
 This time fujitsu 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:44.289
 It means that a little hard disk is in the back of it and flat cable 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:49.009
 Smaller flat cable 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:51.120
 How to remove it I just raised it and removed it Slide it 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:52.710
 Offset 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.180
 Offset 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:58.729
 Supposed 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:05.020
 It was full by force, but this one is here 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:07.930
 If you take it because there is also some success like the kind of sincerity painted on the surface 

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:12.479
 The key also operates 

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.479
 It is such a thing yes or more thank you
