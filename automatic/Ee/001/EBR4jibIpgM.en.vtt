00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.220
 superhero hello everyone my name is 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.109
 thanx a lot and last week 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.179
 what happened past me 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.280
 I just can't go to 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.410
 the comic horse in san diego has finally been 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.109
 shows a full trailer of batman 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.789
 against the superman most anticipated personally 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.240
 kinokomiksa not exactly for all 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.699
 time 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.859
 but at least for the last five years exactly and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.199
 if you have not seen this trailer then 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.750
 be sure to do it I looked it 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.090
 already at least 15 times and I advise you 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.040
 You can find the link in the video description. 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.649
 but at the same time look at the trailer squad 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.300
 suicides they are there next to and since myself 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.399
 the film is coming out only next year 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.649
 Now I invite you to see how 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.399
 batman and superman beat each other muzzles 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.500
 the game injustice gods among us think even 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.390
 disi's most loyal fans 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.230
 will argue that warner brothers and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.510
 disi comics 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.910
 very much behind marvel at that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 a time when marvel already has likes 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.980
 the universe currently consisting of 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.870
 12 films in children have a dark trilogy 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.789
 knight christopher nolan standing 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.110
 alone 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.350
 godless green lights that all 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.580
 want to forget and man became 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.229
 contradictory on a pretty good movie 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.369
 the purpose of which was to reload 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.409
 superman history 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.540
 as well as initiate the cinema of the universe 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.790
 di si you can talk about this movie 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.170
 for a long time everyone especially likes 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.240
 suck up the destruction 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.670
 I have my own opinion on this 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.380
 it doesn't matter now what matters 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.540
 man become brought enough 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.939
 profits to the big bosses warner 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.740
 brothers found it appropriate 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.720
 develop the whole universe but how in 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.549
 conditions of the modern world when a year 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.409
 comes out on three four kinokomiksa 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.229
 do something interesting and 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.570
 unusual disie seems to have found the answer to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.640
 this question you need to take the two most 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.220
 famous superheroes in history 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.840
 the existence of comics make them beat 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.240
 muzzle each other in one movie 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.399
 to take the brilliant comedian Frank 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.530
 miller and put zack snider in 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.659
 director's chair you can say that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.369
 please his films but no one thinks 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.619
 will argue with the fact that in terms of 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.990
 no visual effects 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.210
 equal all this may well be 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.069
 breath of fresh air all the more 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.259
 considering that films marvel with each 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.610
 year becomes so pop that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.129
 it slowly begins to cause 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.640
 disgust so what did he show us 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.890
 trailer 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.750
 but he showed enough to shut up 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.060
 even those whom struck marvel head 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.560
 brain in the most severe form unlike 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.900
 first trailer most memorable 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.270
 part of which was the final phrase 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.220
 batman trailers comic book showed us 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.670
 almost everything you need to know about it 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.800
 the movie 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.599
 timber wayne was in the metropolis when all 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.120
 happened and saw what is capable of 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.709
 superman moreover one of the buildings 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.680
 which was destroyed during the fight 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.319
 zod general and superman was wayne's office 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.120
 enterprises heaps of people died and for 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.750
 Batman is the same as losing 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.790
 his family being human again 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.640
 whose plan is for any life 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.010
 situations even in the absence of a plan 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.140
 batman has a plan cant decides what 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.750
 a man of such strength too 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.760
 dangerous even if he wishes good to the earth 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.280
 it may well happen that in one 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.470
 beautiful day he will return and decide all 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.540
 destroy us and nobody can 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.909
 stop in this case the plot 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.370
 injustice proof besides 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.769
 at the time of the Bruce film development 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.650
 got tired of all that shit he 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.780
 wears a suit of batman for 20 years alone 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.120
 of rubies namely jason is dead 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.799
 although not really but Batman 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.959
 he does not know one beautiful 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.959
 moment he decided to throw out all his 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.670
 anger and kill superman though he himself 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.069
 Of course, he believes that it is possible 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.269
 prevents mass genocide 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.250
 humanity is worth saying what is it 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.650
 rather unusual image of batman 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.110
 this seems we have not seen in the movie 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.180
 he's evil cruel and in some way 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.459
 you can call him a villain in this movie 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.980
 and despite the fact that in the comic frank 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.900
 Miller's Return of the Dark Knight 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.849
 the reason for their fights is quite different plot 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.849
 This comic book I probably do not retell 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.650
 I will read better themselves or cartoon 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.140
 in extreme cases, look, I do not know 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.000
 of course since the subtitle of the film 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.250
 the heyday of justice 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.019
 no one will kill anyone and batman 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.670
 supermen will be almost the best 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.049
 friends 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.330
 unite them will force a new adversary 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.099
 whose appearance will contribute to Lex 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.680
 whose luther we also see in it 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.199
 trailer by Jesse Eisenberg 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.500
 it was rumored that it might be doomsday 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.960
 although as in the trailer you can 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.940
 mark the body of the general zod maybe it's 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.160
 there will be something like a superman clone 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.910
 like bizzarro but now that's all 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.220
 riddles 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.840
 Another nice detail was that 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.690
 trailer we finally showed 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.760
 wonder woman in full uniform with 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.010
 sword and shield bracelets and everything 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.320
 It is a pity of course that they did not show 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.300
 Jason Momoa in the image of aquaman 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.520
 but then probably the trailer would have turned out 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.010
 too epic despite being myself 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.990
 the trailer was quite long for us 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.300
 didn't show too much after the exit 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.220
 the film is still almost a year and showed exactly 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.380
 as much as you need to calm 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.990
 fans and also gagging 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.460
 frankly speaking I am ready to talkative Hayter 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.690
 was crying with happiness when for the first time 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.460
 watched the trailer 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.919
 if you haven't done it yet 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.690
 see him immediately if you ever 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.250
 how much is the comic interested you 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.919
 guaranteed three and a half minutes 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.730
 pure pleasure as if strange 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.060
 it sounded like that 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.850
 well and at last aquaman is not useless 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.800
 second avengers sucks and spiderman 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.760
 never plays an important role in 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.600
 civil war 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.600
 That's all I wanted to say
