00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
too difficult about this there are a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.500 
too difficult about this there are a
couple<00:01:13.290> times<00:01:13.860> signature<00:01:14.430> changes<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.150> I'll

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
couple times signature changes and I'll

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.030 
couple times signature changes and I'll
mention<00:01:15.720> those<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.380> no<00:01:16.590> idea<00:01:16.890> what

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
mention those if you have no idea what

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.250 
mention those if you have no idea what
that<00:01:17.160> is<00:01:17.190> I<00:01:17.430> will<00:01:17.550> explain<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.960> right<00:01:19.110> so

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
that is I will explain that all right so

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.630 
that is I will explain that all right so
let's<00:01:19.440> learn<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.770> start<00:01:20.010> on<00:01:20.100> an<00:01:20.190> E<00:01:20.370> minor

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
let's learn it we start on an E minor

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.990 
let's learn it we start on an E minor
triad<00:01:21.890> triad<00:01:22.890> meaning<00:01:23.160> three<00:01:23.400> notes<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
triad triad meaning three notes in the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.200 
triad triad meaning three notes in the
right<00:01:24.180> hand<00:01:24.390> left<00:01:25.110> hands<00:01:25.380> got<00:01:25.560> an<00:01:25.680> e<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.280> e<00:01:26.490> G<00:01:26.970> B

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
right hand left hands got an e so e G B

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.140 
right hand left hands got an e so e G B
and<00:01:27.450> an<00:01:27.750> e<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> left<00:01:28.430> next<00:01:29.430> chord<00:01:29.760> is<00:01:29.850> an<00:01:29.940> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and an e on the left next chord is an a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.770 
and an e on the left next chord is an a
minor<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:31.170> left<00:01:31.350> e<00:01:31.560> AC<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:32.820> we

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
minor and the left e AC in the right we

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.840 
minor and the left e AC in the right we
play<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.290> six<00:01:34.740> chest<00:01:34.979> succession<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.640> chords

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
play that six chest succession of chords

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.680 
play that six chest succession of chords
twice<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.300> we<00:01:36.330> play<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.990> two<00:01:37.850> three<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.660> two

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
twice so we play one two three one two

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.580 
twice so we play one two three one two
three<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.540> point<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> time<00:01:43.259> signature

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
three so this point the time signature

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
three so this point the time signature
meaning<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> number<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.940> beats<00:01:45.150> per<00:01:45.300> measure

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
meaning the number of beats per measure

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.359 
meaning the number of beats per measure
is<00:01:46.080> three<00:01:46.440> three<00:01:47.340> four<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.970> two<00:01:48.270> three<00:01:49.369> one

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
is three three four one two three one

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.020 
is three three four one two three one
two<00:01:50.400> three<00:01:51.380> okay

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
two three okay

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.300 
two three okay
next<00:01:54.030> measure<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.539> a<00:01:54.600> G<00:01:54.960> chord<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.979> triad

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
next measure is a G chord and you triad

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.490 
next measure is a G chord and you triad
with<00:01:56.610> G<00:01:56.880> B<00:01:57.090> D<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> right<00:01:57.780> hand<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.229> G<00:01:58.410> on

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
with G B D in the right hand and G on

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.310 
with G B D in the right hand and G on
the<00:01:58.560> left<00:01:58.770> two<00:01:59.520> counts<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.119> one<00:02:00.570> two

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the left two counts on that one two

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.830 
the left two counts on that one two
three<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.550> beat<00:02:02.759> three<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.179> go<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:03.420> minor

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
three on beat three we go to a minor

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.410 
three on beat three we go to a minor
triad<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:05.390> AC<00:02:06.390> E<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.229> minor<00:02:07.500> triad<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:09.300> then

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
triad a AC E and a minor triad and then

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.100 
triad a AC E and a minor triad and then
back<00:02:09.600> back<00:02:09.899> down<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.229> E<00:02:10.259> minor<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:12.569> minor

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
back back down to E minor to a minor

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.960 
back back down to E minor to a minor
okay<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.530> first<00:02:14.130> four<00:02:14.340> measures<00:02:14.460> are<00:02:14.850> as

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
okay so first four measures are as

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.480 
okay so first four measures are as
follows<00:02:15.420> one<00:02:15.720> two<00:02:16.470> three<00:02:17.460> one<00:02:18.240> two<00:02:18.540> three<00:02:19.490> one

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
follows one two three one two three one

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.550 
follows one two three one two three one
two<00:02:21.120> three<00:02:22.340> one<00:02:23.340> two

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:36.890 

repeat<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:27.319> 1<00:02:28.319> 2<00:02:29.160> 3<00:02:30.680> 2<00:02:31.680> 3<00:02:32.270> 1<00:02:33.270> 2<00:02:33.630> 3<00:02:34.910> all<00:02:35.910> right<00:02:36.180> so

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
repeat that 1 2 3 2 3 1 2 3 all right so

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.090 
repeat that 1 2 3 2 3 1 2 3 all right so
that's<00:02:37.020> not<00:02:37.200> too<00:02:37.350> difficult<00:02:37.800> right

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
that's not too difficult right

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.690 
that's not too difficult right
it's<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.910> same<00:02:39.270> thing<00:02:39.600> twice<00:02:40.550> ok<00:02:41.550> that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
it's just that same thing twice ok that

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.280 
it's just that same thing twice ok that
same<00:02:41.970> first<00:02:42.300> 4<00:02:42.600> measures<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.080> taught<00:02:43.260> you

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
same first 4 measures that I taught you

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.530 
same first 4 measures that I taught you
twice<00:02:43.620> at<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.459> point<00:02:44.790> we've<00:02:44.940> got<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.120> new<00:02:45.300> core

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
twice at that point we've got a new core

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.790 
twice at that point we've got a new core
daddy<00:02:46.020> triad<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:48.510> D<00:02:48.840> F<00:02:49.050> sharp<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.709> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
daddy triad it's D F sharp a and the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.790 
daddy triad it's D F sharp a and the
right<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.130> Deanna<00:02:50.459> left<00:02:50.700> one<00:02:51.660> okay<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.650> is

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
right and Deanna left one okay this is

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.920 
right and Deanna left one okay this is
where<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.010> time<00:02:53.250> signature<00:02:53.550> changes<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.390> this

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
where the time signature changes in this

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.390 
where the time signature changes in this
measure<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.350> have<00:02:55.380> 4<00:02:55.800> counts<00:02:56.190> 1<00:02:56.850> 2<00:02:57.660> 3<00:02:58.440> 4<00:02:59.310> 1<00:03:00.120> 2<00:03:00.620> 3<00:03:01.620> 1

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
measure we have 4 counts 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.100 
measure we have 4 counts 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1
and<00:03:02.550> you'll<00:03:02.640> notice<00:03:02.820> we're<00:03:03.060> right<00:03:03.269> back<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> 3

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
and you'll notice we're right back to 3

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.590 
and you'll notice we're right back to 3
after<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.620> time<00:03:04.980> signature<00:03:05.430> wise<00:03:05.580> all<00:03:06.480> right

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
after that time signature wise all right

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.410 
after that time signature wise all right
so<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.900> measure<00:03:07.080> we<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.260> D<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.800> then<00:03:08.640> C<00:03:09.090> 6

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
so that measure we have D and then C 6

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.680 
so that measure we have D and then C 6
or<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.780> seeing<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.080> left<00:03:10.230> see<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:11.360> 2<00:03:12.360> counts

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
or just seeing the left see a 2 counts

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.690 
or just seeing the left see a 2 counts
on<00:03:12.780> each<00:03:12.959> which<00:03:13.290> gives<00:03:13.530> us<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.769> measure<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.040> 4

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
on each which gives us a measure of 4

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.520 
on each which gives us a measure of 4
all<00:03:15.510> right<00:03:15.630> if<00:03:15.720> that's<00:03:15.810> confusing<00:03:16.260> don't

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
all right if that's confusing don't

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.620 
all right if that's confusing don't
worry<00:03:16.709> about<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.040> just<00:03:17.069> learn<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.120> notes<00:03:18.330> and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
worry about it just learn the notes and

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.630 
worry about it just learn the notes and
rhythms<00:03:18.870> as<00:03:19.050> I'm<00:03:19.170> teaching<00:03:19.319> them<00:03:19.680> all<00:03:20.430> right

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
rhythms as I'm teaching them all right

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.490 
rhythms as I'm teaching them all right
so<00:03:20.819> at<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.209> point<00:03:21.420> we've<00:03:21.630> learned<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:22.110> couple

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
so at this point we've learned a couple

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.259 
so at this point we've learned a couple
different<00:03:22.739> patterns<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.340> intro<00:03:23.700> let's

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
different patterns in this intro let's

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.840 
different patterns in this intro let's
go<00:03:24.450> let's<00:03:24.780> go<00:03:24.900> through<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.170> all<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.500> minor<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.819> a

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
go let's go through it all a minor to a

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.300 
go let's go through it all a minor to a
minor<00:03:27.330> E<00:03:27.600> minor<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:29.190> minor<00:03:29.670> G<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> minor<00:03:32.040> E

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
minor E minor to a minor G to a minor E

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:41.590 
minor E minor to a minor G to a minor E
minor<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> minor<00:03:34.350> repeat<00:03:34.769> that

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.620 

now<00:03:42.600> here's<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.960> bar<00:03:43.170> for<00:03:43.710> one<00:03:44.010> two<00:03:44.730> three

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
now here's the bar for one two three

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.300 
now here's the bar for one two three
four<00:03:46.350> back<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:46.890> three<00:03:48.680> it's<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.860> same<00:03:50.070> thing

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
four back to three it's the same thing

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.090 
four back to three it's the same thing
as<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.550> intro<00:03:53.540> good<00:03:54.540> here's<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> bar<00:03:55.050> for<00:03:55.410> one

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
as the intro good here's a bar for one

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.810 
as the intro good here's a bar for one
two<00:03:56.850> three<00:03:57.660> four<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:59.280> measure<00:03:59.550> you'll

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
two three four and that measure you'll

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.430 
two three four and that measure you'll
notice<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.180> exactly<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.750> same<00:04:00.930> as<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.260> first

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
notice is exactly the same as the first

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.540 
notice is exactly the same as the first

alright<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.440> this<00:04:13.530> point<00:04:13.830> in<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.130> intro<00:04:14.520> /

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
alright and this point in the intro /

alright and this point in the intro /
reverse<00:04:15.900> first<00:04:16.590> verse<00:04:16.830> you<00:04:16.980> could<00:04:17.130> call<00:04:17.280> or<00:04:17.700> at

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
reverse first verse you could call or at

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.290 
reverse first verse you could call or at
the<00:04:19.160> tail<00:04:20.160> end<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.520> it<00:04:20.610> so<00:04:20.670> we<00:04:20.820> have<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> G<00:04:21.270> chord

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.300 
the tail end of it so we have a G chord

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.690 
the tail end of it so we have a G chord
G<00:04:21.840> on<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:21.989> Left<00:04:22.200> d<00:04:22.500> g/b<00:04:22.890> in<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.310> right<00:04:23.810> 1<00:04:24.810> 2<00:04:25.700> 3

counts one two three a four E okay and

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.010 
counts one two three a four E okay and
that's<00:04:59.670> this<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.420> thing<00:05:00.570> that<00:05:00.600> takes<00:05:00.810> us

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
that's this is the thing that takes us

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.050 
that's this is the thing that takes us
into<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.290> chorus<00:05:01.650> which<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:01.980> short<00:05:02.850> long

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060

into the chorus which is short long
short<00:05:03.090> long<00:05:03.840> on<00:05:04.320> G<00:05:05.010> F<00:05:05.220> sharp<00:05:05.250> F<00:05:05.880> sharp<00:05:05.970> F<00:05:06.660> so<00:05:07.620> we

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
short long on G F sharp F sharp F so we

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.380 
short long on G F sharp F sharp F so we
play<00:05:07.860> G<00:05:08.310> 2<00:05:09.030> short<00:05:09.930> long<00:05:10.200> short<00:05:10.230> long<00:05:11.150> done<00:05:12.150> and

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
play G 2 short long short long done and

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.260 
play G 2 short long short long done and
then<00:05:12.900> we're<00:05:13.020> into<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.440> chorus<00:05:14.150> alright<00:05:15.150> so

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
then we're into the chorus alright so

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.410 
then we're into the chorus alright so
actually<00:05:15.420> let's<00:05:15.720> look<00:05:15.780> at<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.020> back<00:05:16.200> half<00:05:17.420> so

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
actually let's look at the back half so

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.550 
actually let's look at the back half so
we're<00:05:18.540> playing<00:05:18.720> we'll<00:05:19.110> say<00:05:19.230> this<00:05:19.350> is<00:05:19.440> the

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
we're playing we'll say this is the

so<00:06:46.440> if<00:06:46.560> that<00:06:46.710> was<00:06:46.890> tough<00:06:47.280> go<00:06:47.430> back<00:06:47.700> work<00:06:48.360> it<00:06:48.510> out

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
so if that was tough go back work it out

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.450 
so if that was tough go back work it out
I<00:06:48.690> think<00:06:48.870> it<00:06:49.650> won't<00:06:49.890> take<00:06:50.160> too<00:06:50.370> many

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
I think it won't take too many

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.730 
I think it won't take too many
repetitions<00:06:50.940> but<00:06:51.360> play<00:06:52.290> it<00:06:52.410> until<00:06:52.530> you're

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740
