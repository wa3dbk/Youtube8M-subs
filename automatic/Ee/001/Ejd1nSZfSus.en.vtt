that these didn't sin that's just

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.360

because<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.840> don't<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.590> set<00:00:14.130> up<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
because I don't have this set up on a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.640

data plan and I don't have I messages
set<00:00:16.859> up<00:00:16.980> but<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.520> wasn't<00:00:17.850> really<00:00:18.029> necessary

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
set up but it wasn't really necessary

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.599

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
messaging application can do so you

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
messaging application can do so you

on the messages up here are actually
lighter<00:00:28.289> than<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> most<00:00:28.980> recent<00:00:29.490> messages

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
that are sent down here so it's a little

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620 
that are sent down here so it's a little
lighter<00:00:32.099> green<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.880> darker<00:00:33.270> as<00:00:33.450> the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.569 
info here and you can see that you can
actually<00:01:27.720> block<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.500> caller<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.400> tap

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
actually block this caller so if we tap

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.490
