I<00:03:22.170> think<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.230> teacher<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.800> not<00:03:23.830> about<00:03:24.310> the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
I think the teacher is not about the

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.550 
I think the teacher is not about the
antibody<00:03:25.360> education<00:03:25.780> but<00:03:25.960> I<00:03:25.990> think<00:03:26.260> for<00:03:26.500> me

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
antibody education but I think for me

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.030 
antibody education but I think for me
it's<00:03:26.890> it's<00:03:27.580> really<00:03:28.060> more<00:03:28.390> about<00:03:28.860> having<00:03:29.860> the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
it's it's really more about having the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.220 
it's it's really more about having the
effective<00:03:30.670> relationship<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:31.690> if<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.900> decide

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
effective relationship so if you decide

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.070 
effective relationship so if you decide
to<00:03:32.740> call<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.280> depend<00:03:33.610> on<00:03:33.930> they're<00:03:34.930> always

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
to call and depend on they're always

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.030 
to call and depend on they're always
