00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
sure nobody gets them down and if they

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.590 
sure nobody gets them down and if they
do<00:04:53.220> then<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.670> can<00:04:53.790> find<00:04:54.030> them<00:04:54.120> off<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.480> then

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
do then you can find them off and then

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.170 
do then you can find them off and then
get<00:04:54.750> that<00:04:54.900> flag<00:04:55.170> and<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:56.490> know<00:04:56.610> take<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:56.880> back

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
get that flag and you know take it back

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.350 
get that flag and you know take it back
to<00:04:57.920> captured<00:04:58.920> by<00:04:59.280> yourself<00:04:59.670> if<00:04:59.820> you<00:04:59.940> wanted<00:05:00.240> to
