00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
all right so this is Malcolm's riff that

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.820 
all right so this is Malcolm's riff that
kind<00:00:19.820> of<00:00:19.970> comes<00:00:20.600> in<00:00:20.870> a<00:00:20.900> little<00:00:21.170> ways<00:00:21.380> into<00:00:21.650> the

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
kind of comes in a little ways into the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.620 
kind of comes in a little ways into the
song<00:00:22.070> and<00:00:22.400> kind<00:00:22.610> of<00:00:22.700> doubles<00:00:23.060> in<00:00:23.240> with<00:00:23.450> the

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
song and kind of doubles in with the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.860 
song and kind of doubles in with the
intro<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:24.850> one<00:00:25.850> way<00:00:26.120> I've<00:00:26.330> kind<00:00:26.600> of<00:00:26.690> thought

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:26.870 
intro and one way I've kind of thought

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.080 
intro and one way I've kind of thought
about<00:00:27.020> this<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.620> basically<00:00:28.070> it's<00:00:28.310> just<00:00:28.370> a<00:00:28.610> b5

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
about this is basically it's just a b5

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.360 
about this is basically it's just a b5
chord<00:00:29.420> so<00:00:29.750> your<00:00:29.930> index<00:00:30.230> finger<00:00:30.650> is<00:00:31.010> right<00:00:31.130> on

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
fourth fret of the g now there's kind of

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.489 
fourth fret of the g now there's kind of
a<00:00:38.480> pulse<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:38.929> can<00:00:39.140> hear<00:00:39.649> I'm<00:00:40.339> sort<00:00:40.699> of<00:00:40.789> on<00:00:40.940> that

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:41.499 
a pulse you can hear I'm sort of on that

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.110 
a pulse you can hear I'm sort of on that
Beno<00:00:42.499> so<00:00:42.829> that<00:00:42.949> second<00:00:43.429> fret<00:00:43.609> of<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.940> string

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
Beno so that second fret of the a string

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.290 
Beno so that second fret of the a string
and<00:00:44.800> it<00:00:45.800> almost<00:00:46.070> seems<00:00:46.399> like<00:00:46.489> a<00:00:46.609> slight<00:00:46.969> palm

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
and it almost seems like a slight palm

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.990 
and it almost seems like a slight palm
mute<00:00:47.629> as<00:00:47.809> well

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.990 

and<00:00:53.660> in<00:00:54.109> my<00:00:54.469> mind<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.980> best<00:00:55.190> thing<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.489> do<00:00:55.820> is

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
and in my mind the best thing to do is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.330 
and in my mind the best thing to do is
just<00:00:56.269> to<00:00:56.390> remember<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:57.079> you've<00:00:57.379> got<00:00:57.590> a<00:00:57.620> strum

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
just to remember that you've got a strum

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.369 
just to remember that you've got a strum
pattern<00:00:58.760> here<00:00:58.969> basically<00:00:59.269> is<00:00:59.809> what<00:01:00.019> you<00:01:00.170> got

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
pattern here basically is what you got

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.869 
pattern here basically is what you got
where<00:01:00.920> you're<00:01:01.039> working<00:01:01.190> on<00:01:01.489> this<00:01:01.640> you're

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
where you're working on this you're

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.299 
where you're working on this you're
bouncing<00:01:02.300> from<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.600> low<00:01:02.780> note<00:01:03.050> here<00:01:03.469> which<00:01:04.159> is

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
bouncing from the low note here which is

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.859 
bouncing from the low note here which is
that<00:01:04.460> second<00:01:04.850> fret<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.119> a<00:01:05.180> string<00:01:05.330> and

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
that second fret of the a string and

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.810 
that second fret of the a string and
you're<00:01:06.830> kind<00:01:07.159> of<00:01:07.220> bouncing<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:08.210> these<00:01:09.820> these

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
you're kind of bouncing to these these

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.789 
you're kind of bouncing to these these
two<00:01:10.880> higher<00:01:11.450> strings<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.110> D<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.560> g

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
two higher strings the D and the g

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:33.640 
two higher strings the D and the g
string<00:01:13.190> in<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.729> chord

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.190 

so<00:01:34.610> I'll<00:01:34.730> just<00:01:34.880> play<00:01:35.060> that<00:01:35.210> real<00:01:35.510> slow<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:36.170> you

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
so I'll just play that real slow so you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:59.270 
so I'll just play that real slow so you
can<00:01:36.290> kind<00:01:36.620> of<00:01:36.680> see<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:36.980> drum<00:01:37.280> pattern<00:01:37.670> here

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:14.690

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
all right so go ahead and give that a

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:34.940 
all right so go ahead and give that a
try<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.350> then<00:02:17.620> move<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.310> next<00:02:18.490> section

simplified<00:02:51.370> b5<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.540> use<00:02:52.750> your<00:02:52.930> index

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
simplified b5 so you just use your index

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.230 
simplified b5 so you just use your index
finger<00:02:53.620> 2nd<00:02:54.100> fret<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.430> ring<00:02:55.000> finger

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
fourth fret of the D and we're going to

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.650 
fourth fret of the D and we're going to
move<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.350> an<00:02:59.470> a5<00:02:59.950> chord<00:03:00.310> index<00:03:00.790> finger<00:03:01.180> 2nd

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
move to an a5 chord index finger 2nd

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.970 
move to an a5 chord index finger 2nd

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
fret of the D and then you're going to

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.750 
fret of the D and then you're going to
pluck<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.550> D<00:03:03.700> together<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.950> quickly<00:03:06.430> roll

so that's your index finger second fret
of<00:03:11.939> the<00:03:11.969> a<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.719> all<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:18.859> and<00:03:19.859> you're<00:03:19.950> going<00:03:20.069> to

move<00:03:37.469> on<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.889> next<00:03:38.099> section<00:03:51.620> all<00:03:52.620> right

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
move on to the next section all right

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.910 
move on to the next section all right
this<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:53.159> the<00:03:53.189> pre-chorus<00:03:54.409> pretty<00:03:55.409> simple

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
this is the pre-chorus pretty simple

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.970 
this is the pre-chorus pretty simple
it's<00:03:56.549> going<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:56.879> kind<00:03:57.299> of<00:03:57.450> come<00:03:57.629> out<00:03:57.659> of

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
it's going to kind of come out of

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:13.110 
it's going to kind of come out of
Malcolm's<00:03:58.980> riff

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.090 

so<00:04:14.120> basically<00:04:14.510> it's<00:04:14.749> just<00:04:15.019> gonna<00:04:15.620> start<00:04:15.889> on<00:04:16.070> a

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.360 
so basically it's just gonna start on a
b5<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:18.070> 5v5

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
b5 a 5v5

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.180 
b5 a 5v5
and<00:04:20.090> then<00:04:21.079> second<00:04:21.739> time<00:04:21.940> starts<00:04:22.940> on<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.180> five

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
and then second time starts on a five

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.099 
and then second time starts on a five
five<00:04:25.190> bags<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:26.120> five<00:04:26.599> so<00:04:27.530> all<00:04:27.680> together
