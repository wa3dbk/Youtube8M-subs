help you understand what happens when
they<00:00:26.580> don't<00:00:26.880> work<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.480> something<00:00:27.810> comes<00:00:27.990> out

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
they don't work and something comes out

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.769 
they don't work and something comes out
wrong<00:00:28.529> which<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.340> frustrating<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.330> so

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
wrong which is so frustrating and so

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.780 
wrong which is so frustrating and so
really<00:00:31.140> understanding<00:00:31.309> how<00:00:32.309> all<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
really understanding how all of the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.209 
really understanding how all of the
ingredients<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.510> techniques<00:00:34.320> work<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.040> make

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
ingredients and techniques work to make

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.880 
ingredients and techniques work to make
beautiful<00:00:35.940> delicious<00:00:36.329> baked<00:00:37.200> goods<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
beautiful delicious baked goods and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.060 
beautiful delicious baked goods and
breads<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.760> immensely<00:00:39.629> helpful<00:00:39.920> even<00:00:40.920> if

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
breads can be immensely helpful even if

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.799 
breads can be immensely helpful even if
you're<00:00:41.219> pretty<00:00:41.399> experienced<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> kitchen

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you're pretty experienced in the kitchen

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.400 
you're pretty experienced in the kitchen
so<00:00:43.170> today<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.739> thought<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.930> topic<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> get

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
so today I thought a topic that I get

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.799 
so today I thought a topic that I get
asked<00:00:46.770> about<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.550> much<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
asked about so much and that is what is

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.990 
asked about so much and that is what is
the<00:00:48.870> difference<00:00:49.200> between<00:00:49.289> baking<00:00:50.280> powder<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the difference between baking powder and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.260 
the difference between baking powder and
baking<00:00:51.449> soda<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:53.430> two<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.000> pour

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
baking soda and these two when you pour

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.970 
baking soda and these two when you pour
them<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.199> at<00:00:55.320> them<00:00:55.469> they<00:00:55.770> look

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
them out and you look at them they look

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.029 
them out and you look at them they look
almost<00:00:56.329> identical<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.510> either<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
almost identical but either one or the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.760 
almost identical but either one or the
other<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.309> even<00:00:59.789> both<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.359> called<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.230> most

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
other or even both is called for in most

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.820 
other or even both is called for in most
baking<00:01:02.579> recipes<00:01:03.059> from<00:01:03.359> biscuits<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.350> cookies

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
baking recipes from biscuits to cookies

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.399 
baking recipes from biscuits to cookies
to<00:01:05.070> cakes<00:01:05.460> cupcakes<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.390> almost<00:01:07.110> everything

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
to cakes cupcakes and almost everything

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.060 
to cakes cupcakes and almost everything
in<00:01:07.680> between

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
in between

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.609 
in between
so<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.330> important<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.810> understand<00:01:10.290> how

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so it's so important to understand how

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.190 
so it's so important to understand how
these<00:01:10.890> work<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.520> baking<00:01:12.240> soda<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.840> baking

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
these work so baking soda and baking

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
these work so baking soda and baking
powder<00:01:13.409> are<00:01:13.920> both<00:01:14.189> considered<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.820> be

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
powder are both considered to be

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.950 
powder are both considered to be
chemical<00:01:15.930> leaveners<00:01:16.500> meaning<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.549> they

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
chemical leaveners meaning that they

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
chemical leaveners meaning that they
react<00:01:18.960> when<00:01:19.409> they're<00:01:19.530> added<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.070> batter<00:01:20.400> or

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
react when they're added to a batter or

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.359 
react when they're added to a batter or
a<00:01:20.790> dough<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.840> create<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.350> chemical<00:01:22.920> reaction

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
a dough to create a chemical reaction

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.090 
a dough to create a chemical reaction
that<00:01:24.030> levin's<00:01:24.900> your<00:01:25.140> baked<00:01:25.380> goods<00:01:25.500> adding

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that levin's your baked goods adding

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.749 
that levin's your baked goods adding
light<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> fluffy<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.780> airy<00:01:28.400> texture<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
light and fluffy and airy texture and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.270 
light and fluffy and airy texture and
allows<00:01:30.420> them<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> lift<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.409> rise<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
allows them to lift and rise so that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.370 
allows them to lift and rise so that
you're<00:01:32.490> not<00:01:32.640> left<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.600> super<00:01:34.079> dense

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you're not left with like a super dense

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
you're not left with like a super dense
hockey<00:01:34.770> puck<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> muffin<00:01:35.820> or<00:01:35.909> anything<00:01:36.150> like

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
hockey puck of a muffin or anything like

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
hockey puck of a muffin or anything like
that<00:01:36.450> chemical<00:01:37.350> leaveners<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.189> only

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
that chemical leaveners like this only

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.990 
that chemical leaveners like this only
work<00:01:39.509> when<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.290> are<00:01:40.350> fresh<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.310> accurately

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
work when they are fresh and accurately

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.179 
work when they are fresh and accurately
measured<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.229> we're<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.770> talking<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
measured so we're going to be talking a

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.469 
measured so we're going to be talking a
little<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.460> more<00:01:44.579> about<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
little bit more about that in just a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.330 
little bit more about that in just a
minute<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.170> want<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> quickly<00:01:46.530> say<00:01:46.710> that

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
minute but I want to quickly say that

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.550 
minute but I want to quickly say that
baking<00:01:48.060> powder<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.420> baking<00:01:48.450> soda<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:49.229> look

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
baking powder and baking soda they look

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.280 
baking powder and baking soda they look
very<00:01:49.590> similar<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.610> baking<00:01:51.329> powder<00:01:51.360> actually

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
very similar and baking powder actually

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830 
very similar and baking powder actually
contains<00:01:52.890> baking<00:01:53.490> soda<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.810> are

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
contains baking soda but that you are

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.980 
contains baking soda but that you are
very<00:01:55.649> different<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.579> should<00:01:56.850> never<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.659> used

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
very different and should never be used

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.270 
very different and should never be used
interchangeably<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.250> baking<00:02:00.210> soda<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
interchangeably so baking soda is a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.670

fresh to actually work it's really

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.590 
fresh to actually work it's really
important<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.620> not<00:03:25.190> only<00:03:25.400> use<00:03:25.760> baking<00:03:26.209> soda<00:03:26.239> by

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
important to not only use baking soda by

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.780 
important to not only use baking soda by
the<00:03:26.660> expiration<00:03:27.230> date<00:03:27.440> on<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.769> package<00:03:27.980> but

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
the expiration date on the package but

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.849 
the expiration date on the package but
to<00:03:29.000> check<00:03:29.299> for<00:03:29.540> freshness<00:03:30.140> frequently

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
to check for freshness frequently

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.220 
to check for freshness frequently
because<00:03:31.250> baking<00:03:31.609> soda<00:03:31.880> can<00:03:32.150> often<00:03:32.720> lose<00:03:32.989> its

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
because baking soda can often lose its

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.039 
because baking soda can often lose its
potency<00:03:33.489> even<00:03:34.489> before<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.970> expiration<00:03:35.660> date

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
potency even before that expiration date

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.050 
potency even before that expiration date
so<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.709> test<00:03:37.010> for<00:03:37.250> freshness<00:03:37.459> we're<00:03:37.910> actually

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
so to test for freshness we're actually

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.270 
so to test for freshness we're actually
going<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.540> combine<00:03:38.720> baking<00:03:39.530> soda<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.040> vinegar

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
going to combine baking soda and vinegar

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.789 
going to combine baking soda and vinegar
and<00:03:40.760> if<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.209> bubbles<00:03:41.540> up<00:03:41.900> then<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.350> know<00:03:42.560> it's

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
and if it bubbles up then you know it's

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.759 
and if it bubbles up then you know it's
fresh<00:03:43.070> if<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.850> bubbles<00:03:44.150> are<00:03:44.450> really<00:03:45.079> mild<00:03:45.380> or

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
fresh if it bubbles are really mild or

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.710 
fresh if it bubbles are really mild or
nothing<00:03:46.100> really<00:03:46.250> happens<00:03:46.790> then<00:03:47.180> it's<00:03:47.420> time<00:03:47.690> to

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
nothing really happens then it's time to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.990 
nothing really happens then it's time to
toss<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.440> baking<00:03:48.799> soda<00:03:48.829> immediately<00:03:49.760> and

toss that baking soda immediately and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.810 
toss that baking soda immediately and
buy<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.540> new<00:03:50.810> package<00:03:51.290> okay<00:03:51.739> so<00:03:51.799> let's<00:03:52.459> move<00:03:52.640> on

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
buy a new package okay so let's move on

on that one cup of flour you'll notice

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.770 
on that one cup of flour you'll notice
sometimes<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.520> baking<00:05:14.789> powder<00:05:15.030> in<00:05:15.300> baking

sometimes that baking powder in baking
soda<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:16.320> might<00:05:16.470> be<00:05:16.650> both<00:05:16.950> called<00:05:17.370> for<00:05:17.639> in<00:05:17.820> a

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
soda it might be both called for in a

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.700 
soda it might be both called for in a
recipe<00:05:18.389> and<00:05:18.630> this<00:05:18.990> is<00:05:19.110> because<00:05:19.440> when<00:05:19.590> they're

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
recipe and this is because when they're

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.920 
recipe and this is because when they're
combined<00:05:20.130> together<00:05:20.370> they<00:05:20.880> work<00:05:21.360> really<00:05:21.780> well

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
combined together they work really well

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.070 
combined together they work really well
to<00:05:22.410> not<00:05:22.620> only<00:05:22.830> neutralize<00:05:23.490> acid<00:05:24.150> but<00:05:24.720> to

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
to not only neutralize acid but to

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.320 
to not only neutralize acid but to
produce<00:05:25.440> lots<00:05:26.160> of<00:05:26.310> leavening<00:05:26.669> effect<00:05:27.030> and

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
produce lots of leavening effect and

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.480 
produce lots of leavening effect and
give<00:05:27.870> you<00:05:27.960> that<00:05:28.169> light<00:05:28.470> airy<00:05:28.740> delicate

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
give you that light airy delicate

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.000 
give you that light airy delicate
texture<00:05:29.930> combining<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.020> two<00:05:31.229> actually<00:05:31.830> works

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
texture combining the two actually works

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.600 
texture combining the two actually works
really<00:05:32.130> well<00:05:32.729> for<00:05:33.110> acidic<00:05:34.110> dough's<00:05:34.470> like<00:05:35.010> my

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
really well for acidic dough's like my

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.890 
really well for acidic dough's like my
favorite<00:05:36.030> chocolate<00:05:36.210> chip<00:05:36.570> cookie<00:05:36.870> dough

which<00:05:37.260> I'll<00:05:37.440> link<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.710> below<00:05:37.830> that<00:05:38.639> needs<00:05:38.880> to

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
which I'll link to below that needs to

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.110 
which I'll link to below that needs to
be<00:05:39.120> chilled<00:05:39.539> overnight<00:05:40.200> and<00:05:40.669> still<00:05:41.669> require<00:05:42.090> a

be chilled overnight and still require a
leavening<00:05:42.720> effect<00:05:43.110> so<00:05:43.740> those<00:05:44.039> are<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.280> basics

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
leavening effect so those are the basics

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.879 
leavening effect so those are the basics
of<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.120> difference<00:05:45.810> between<00:05:45.990> baking<00:05:46.620> soda

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889
