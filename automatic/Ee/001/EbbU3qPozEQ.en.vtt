know<00:00:20.410> about<00:00:20.500> a<00:00:20.650> hundred<00:00:20.890> prototypes<00:00:21.610> into<00:00:21.880> the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
know about a hundred prototypes into the

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.580 
know about a hundred prototypes into the
wind<00:00:22.119> tunnel<00:00:22.480> about<00:00:22.689> this<00:00:22.869> time<00:00:23.110> last<00:00:23.140> year

wind tunnel about this time last year

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.460 
wind tunnel about this time last year
ago<00:00:24.220> and<00:00:24.400> with<00:00:24.550> this<00:00:24.730> particular<00:00:25.470> prototype

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
ago and with this particular prototype

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.260 
ago and with this particular prototype
we<00:00:26.680> hit<00:00:26.829> a<00:00:26.860> negative<00:00:27.220> drag<00:00:27.520> decide<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.060> put<00:00:28.210> it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
we hit a negative drag decide to put it

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.720 
we hit a negative drag decide to put it
in<00:00:28.329> production<00:00:28.450> okay<00:00:29.349> and<00:00:29.680> by<00:00:30.099> negative<00:00:30.460> drag

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
in production okay and by negative drag

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.420 
in production okay and by negative drag
I<00:00:30.910> mean<00:00:31.149> at<00:00:31.480> 15<00:00:31.930> degrees<00:00:31.960> your<00:00:32.290> angle<00:00:32.920> you're

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
I mean at 15 degrees your angle you're

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.380 
I mean at 15 degrees your angle you're
going<00:00:33.579> to<00:00:33.640> get<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.820> propulsion

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
going to get a propulsion

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.090 
going to get a propulsion
actually<00:00:36.110> checking<00:00:36.350> out<00:00:36.559> we've<00:00:36.770> got<00:00:36.980> it

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
actually checking out we've got it

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.860 
actually checking out we've got it
charted<00:00:37.430> out<00:00:37.610> these<00:00:38.059> were<00:00:38.239> our<00:00:38.329> results<00:00:38.780> from

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
charted out these were our results from

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.889 
charted out these were our results from
the<00:00:38.989> San<00:00:39.200> Diego<00:00:39.550> tunnel<00:00:40.550> this<00:00:41.149> line<00:00:41.480> here

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
the San Diego tunnel this line here

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.830 
the San Diego tunnel this line here
represents<00:00:42.590> your<00:00:43.520> grams<00:00:43.850> of<00:00:44.059> drag<00:00:44.300> with<00:00:44.510> a<00:00:44.540> sub

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
represents your grams of drag with a sub

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.500 
represents your grams of drag with a sub
9<00:00:45.050> disk<00:00:45.379> compared<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:46.040> our<00:00:46.190> regular<00:00:46.670> zip<00:00:47.239> desk

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
9 disk compared to our regular zip desk

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.560 
9 disk compared to our regular zip desk
okay<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:48.559> you<00:00:49.040> know<00:00:49.129> between<00:00:49.610> 10<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.210> 20

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
okay so you know between 10 and 20

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.439 
okay so you know between 10 and 20
degrees<00:00:50.989> wind<00:00:51.320> angle<00:00:51.559> which<00:00:51.949> is<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:52.449> very

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
degrees wind angle which is a very

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.150 
degrees wind angle which is a very
common<00:00:53.900> wind<00:00:54.230> angle<00:00:54.410> especially<00:00:55.010> into

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
common wind angle especially into

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.920 
common wind angle especially into
England<00:00:55.550> you're<00:00:56.089> going<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.300> have<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:56.809> know<00:00:56.900> a

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
England you're going to have you know a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
England you're going to have you know a
negative<00:00:57.440> drag<00:00:57.710> ass<00:00:57.920> well

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
negative drag ass well

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.880 
negative drag ass well
so<00:01:00.550> on<00:01:01.120> top<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.360> that<00:01:01.600> we've<00:01:02.110> also<00:01:02.320> been

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
so on top of that we've also been

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.979 
so on top of that we've also been
working<00:01:02.950> with<00:01:03.610> power<00:01:04.210> tapper<00:01:04.390> quite<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.750> while

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
working with power tapper quite a while

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.520 
working with power tapper quite a while
back<00:01:05.260> over<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:06.090> we've<00:01:07.090> actually<00:01:07.470> gone<00:01:08.470> into

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
back over and we've actually gone into

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.190 
back over and we've actually gone into
developing<00:01:08.830> our<00:01:09.460> own<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.630> uses<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.050> power

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
developing our own that uses the power

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.120 
developing our own that uses the power
tap<00:01:11.820> electronic<00:01:12.820> okay<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:14.320> is<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.770> first

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
tap electronic okay so this is the first

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.910 
tap electronic okay so this is the first
and<00:01:15.430> only<00:01:15.840> power<00:01:16.840> measuring<00:01:17.440> kiss<00:01:17.680> that's

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
and only power measuring kiss that's

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.830 
and only power measuring kiss that's
going<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.130> be<00:01:18.220> available<00:01:18.490> okay<00:01:19.330> we've<00:01:19.720> had

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
going to be available okay we've had

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.050 
going to be available okay we've had
slipstream<00:01:20.410> on<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.740> for<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:20.979> couple<00:01:21.490> months<00:01:21.760> now

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
slipstream on it for a couple months now

anyone is our 1080 okay it's good the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.440 
anyone is our 1080 okay it's good the
same<00:01:46.070> surface<00:01:46.369> area<00:01:46.789> is<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> try<00:01:47.149> spoke

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
same surface area is a try spoke

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.330 
same surface area is a try spoke
although<00:01:48.049> it<00:01:48.200> destroys<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.860> wind<00:01:49.039> tunnel

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
although it destroys it the wind tunnel

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.899 
although it destroys it the wind tunnel
okay

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
okay

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.419 
okay
it<00:01:51.030> was<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.780> taking<00:01:52.200> an<00:01:52.320> 808<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> next

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
it was kind of taking an 808 to the next

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.280 
it was kind of taking an 808 to the next
level<00:01:53.789> okay

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
level okay

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.720 
level okay
work<00:01:55.620> with<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.860> couple<00:01:56.100> different<00:01:56.190> molds<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
work with a couple different molds and

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.460 
work with a couple different molds and
we<00:01:56.850> found<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.420> manipulating<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.260> shape

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
we found that manipulating the shape

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.520
