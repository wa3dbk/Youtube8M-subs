00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
I can't like I think of it and then

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.150 
I can't like I think of it and then
maybe<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.629> learn<00:00:51.840> from<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.739> always

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
maybe I can learn from it and I always

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.819 
maybe I can learn from it and I always
likes<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> learning<00:00:53.879> experience<00:00:54.090> and

likes it as a learning experience and

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.310 
likes it as a learning experience and
maybe<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.360> implement<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:57.899> own<00:00:57.930> play

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
maybe I can implement it in my own play

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080 
maybe I can implement it in my own play
or<00:00:58.469> something<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.309> see<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.640> for
