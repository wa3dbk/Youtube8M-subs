00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
I have ever done you know two doctors

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.890 
I have ever done you know two doctors

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
dialogue speaking and interacting and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.490 
dialogue speaking and interacting and
everything<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.740> learned<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:33.500> everything

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
everything so I learned like everything

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.069 
everything so I learned like everything
my<00:00:34.649> animation<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.489> think<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.480> many<00:00:36.750> things

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
my animation I think so so many things

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.310 
my animation I think so so many things
to<00:00:37.170> think<00:00:38.040> about<00:00:38.540> not<00:00:39.540> all<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.719> curves<00:00:40.050> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to think about not all the curves and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.970 
to think about not all the curves and
everything<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.920> two<00:00:41.070> characters<00:00:42.980> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
everything with two characters the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.810 
everything with two characters the
hardest<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:45.030> me<00:00:45.090> was<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.230> ice

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
hardest thing for me was the ice

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.090 
hardest thing for me was the ice
actually<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.660> know<00:00:48.860> giving<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> impression

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
actually you know giving the impression

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490 
actually you know giving the impression
that<00:00:50.719> characters<00:00:51.719> were<00:00:51.870> looking<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.440> each

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that characters were looking at each

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.650 
that characters were looking at each
other<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.030> know<00:00:54.149> randomly

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
other really not just you know randomly

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.229 
other really not just you know randomly
in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> face<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:55.829> something<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
in the face or something just have the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
in the face or something just have the
eyes<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.899> eyes<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.410> line<00:00:58.649> direction<00:00:58.949> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
eyes to the eyes I line direction and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.479 
eyes to the eyes I line direction and
think<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:00.539> hard<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.109> had<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
think that was really hard and I had to

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.910 
think that was really hard and I had to
kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.199> homeless<00:01:04.199> prim<00:01:04.409> my<00:01:04.530> friends

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
kind of do it homeless prim my friends

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.980 
kind of do it homeless prim my friends
sometime<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.580> keep<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> eyes<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.840> know

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
sometime just to keep the eyes you know

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.830 
sometime just to keep the eyes you know
interesting<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.420> characters

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
interesting in a way and the characters

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.100 
interesting in a way and the characters
really<00:01:10.700> looking<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.760> each<00:01:11.880> other<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.720> think

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
really looking at each other and I think

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
really looking at each other and I think
that's<00:01:13.409> important<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.430> what

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that's important because you know what

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.469 
that's important because you know what
they<00:01:14.939> say<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.020> eyes<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.009> mirror<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
they say the eyes are the mirror of the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.740 
they say the eyes are the mirror of the
soul<00:01:18.750> yeah<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.040> clear<00:01:20.280> my<00:01:21.240> animation

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
soul yeah is that clear my animation

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.810 
soul yeah is that clear my animation
really<00:01:21.990> changed<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.159> polishing<00:01:23.640> class

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
really changed in the polishing class

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.969 
really changed in the polishing class
actually<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.930> was<00:01:25.110> most<00:01:25.500> important

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
actually I think it was most important

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.469 
actually I think it was most important
for<00:01:26.009> me<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:27.240> production<00:01:27.979> really<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
for me for for production really is it

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.749 
for me for for production really is it
evolved<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.630> changed<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.320> lot<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.619> had<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.009> redo

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
evolved and changed a lot I had to redo

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
evolved and changed a lot I had to redo
a<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.509> had<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.960> push<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.590> lot<00:01:34.860> more

you know what like good animation at
first<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:38.939> after<00:01:39.240> polishing<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.280> pretty

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
to understand when to go you know wyd

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.410 
to understand when to go you know wyd
acting<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.810> more<00:01:51.110> subtle<00:01:51.590> acting<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.420> yeah

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
you know I tend to over animate a bit

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.930 
you know I tend to over animate a bit
you<00:01:57.350> know<00:01:57.470> make<00:01:57.650> beautiful<00:01:58.040> moods<00:01:58.640> and

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
you know make beautiful moods and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.270 
you know make beautiful moods and
everything<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.510> on<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.440> one<00:02:00.650> I<00:02:00.680> tried<00:02:01.040> to

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
everything and on that one I tried to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.780 
everything and on that one I tried to
you<00:02:01.670> know<00:02:01.700> turn<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.330> down<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.630> bit<00:02:02.780> just<00:02:03.790> just

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
you know turn that down a bit just just

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.150 
you know turn that down a bit just just
to<00:02:04.910> try<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.540> think<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:05.960> strike<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.620> still

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
to try it I think I strike and still

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.750 
to try it I think I strike and still
include<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.670> too<00:02:07.910> yeah
