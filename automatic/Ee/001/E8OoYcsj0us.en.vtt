00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.809
 valenciennes defeated early after 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.520
 noon in Lille the evian thonon gaillard has 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.080
 a great opportunity to take a step 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.150
 additional to maintaining 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.830
 relegating vea to nine points 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.480
 the last reception at the sports park 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.349
 d'annecy was a success 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.029
 in front of Monaco 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.669
 this time the pascal men 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.349
 dupraz face the bastians who do not 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.750
 are not in their best shape with 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.020
 a win in eight games 5 defeats 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.230
 and 2 draws 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.820
 bastia also conceded a goal to 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.050
 each of his movements since the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.920
 beginning of the season but Bastiais 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.320
 are going to be realistic thanks to florian 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.850
 raspentino at the half hour of play 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.920
 the bastiais had been globally 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.100
 dominated in the first half hour but 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.010
 is ultra efficient the deviation of 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.840
 the head of djibril cissé is impeccable 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.399
 for florent raspentino that false 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.129
 company to cédric mongongu is 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.079
 misleading jesper hansen 1 to 0 for 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.240
 bastia but the reaction of the evian 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.390
 thonon gaillard is not going to delay with this 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.869
 goal of nicolas benezet put on orbit 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.189
 by kévin bérigaud 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.999
 five minutes after the opening of the score 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.780
 Bastia 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:23.810
 the men of pascal dupraz react 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.329
 the service of bérigaud and perfect between 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.429
 Cahuzac and then romaric the dish of 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:32.810
 foot of the old nimes nicolas benezet 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:34.909
 fly 1 goal all over the break and 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.469
 the statistics are confirmed 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.469
 bastia always cash a goal to 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:43.290
 the outside all under the eyes of loved 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:46.310
 true backgammon local mascot 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.870
 frederic hantz who has not yet given 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.910
 his answer when one eventual 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.340
 extension and will see 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.410
 evian thonon gaillard ironing in front 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.920
 his protégés with this direct free kick 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.690
 shot by the Danish daniel wass sixth 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.540
 purpose of the season to hide his 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.940
 third direct free kick a record 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.970
 this season in league 1 mickaël landreau 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.850
 and cheated embarrassment and probably marco 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.770
 ruben and at the end of the game bastia will have the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.490
 ball of 2 everywhere at the end of the head of 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.470
 djibril cisse 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.350
 the timing of the ancient Auxerrois is 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.300
 perfect lacked the precision in the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.760
 finish 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.730
 we will stay there on this score of 2 goals 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.400
 to 1 for the evian thonon gaillard who 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.520
 get a nice bowl of oxygen for the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.520
 retention
