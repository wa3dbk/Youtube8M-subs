00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.500
 hello my name is max and so out 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.690
 yes hello today not only behind 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.369
 microphone but also in front of the camera 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.100
 that just makes me a little bit 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.600
 easier is the reason for this video 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.699
 following I wanted you one 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.380
 give small update as it is at 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.460
 I look and how it is with this channel 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.730
 go on 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.570
 There has not been one for about three months 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.210
 new video 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.880
 and that has take a simple reason 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.559
 I'm on the one hand moved to and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.239
 I started studying for others 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 which both take a lot of time 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.090
 has taken and the study also does it 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.070
 now 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.559
 but everything is getting a little bit slow 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.760
 regulated and organized and I have 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.180
 a little bit more time for mine 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.960
 Hobbies for example youtube 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.879
 that's where I come from 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.660
 already for the first point namely how should 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.870
 go on 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.390
 the last tutorial was very much on the topic 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.940
 big and i still want the two now 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 other types of engines one with the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.979
 driving a car can handle 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.180
 there are once the stepping motor 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.250
 and on the other dc motor 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.200
 but both are not quite so 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.340
 easy to navigate and I use 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.780
 that's why the motor steppe servo switched 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.880
 from adafruit it looks like this 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.130
 that comes as a kit you only then 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.409
 still has to solve together and if it is 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 Finished then you put it on the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.650
 arduino up and then at this 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.320
 switched on up to four DC motors 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.009
 two servus and two stepper motors 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.360
 connect 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.100
 that's what the whole thing looks like 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 this goal kindly from 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.890
 vatterodt dot com is provided 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.890
 to get 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.329
 this is an electronics online shop we 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.640
 have a lot of cool things to do 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.020
 theme arduino on offer 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.000
 and then us on the format 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.159
 to stop by the link you will find 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.219
 a video description in any case there 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.170
 at this point the script for 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.060
 The stepper tutorial is actually 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.830
 already finished but I'm missing right now 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.410
 a real camera with me that 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.510
 I can only do whole films 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.150
 This webcam is available with the me 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.170
 this video i just make i hope 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.330
 but that i will see you next week 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.129
 get organized then you get 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.790
 next week a new tutorial for 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.910
 I would like to discuss the subject of arduino afterwards 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.519
 something about the topic of rfid also make 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.340
 ivanschitz if you still have 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.110
 have ideas or like a few tutorials 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.340
 then on a specific topic would like 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.329
 Post it down in the comment box 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.280
 but I have more in addition 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.459
 a few ideas for a few videos 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.090
 regardless of bardolino namely to 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.910
 example a video series with the title 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.500
 students basics and what I imagine 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.599
 including form and I want one 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.720
 do some reviews and tutorials 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.549
 on the subject of technical gadgets the one 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.459
 Students can make everyday life easier 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.010
 for example this lg scanner mouse that 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.920
 looks like a normal mouse but has 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.030
 down there a scanner and with 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.930
 This scanner is easy to do 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.400
 scan longer passages of text and that 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.709
 for example, if you are straight 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.959
 the library is and only his laptop 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.940
 You can then with this mouse 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.280
 in short simply over the text version 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.310
 drÃ¼berfahren and then has this digital 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.079
 I know some of you saved 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.790
 are already out of the university 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.109
 I hope that one or the other 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.750
 still a few useful ones 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.819
 information can be found there and this 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.450
 Kanal was just from the beginning on 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.549
 made 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.790
 also independent of the arduino times a few 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.019
 to do tutorials and reviews and that 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.690
 I definitely want to go now 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.590
 make and i hope the arduino fans 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.030
 can still learn something there yes that was 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.489
 as far as news and information 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.139
 which I can give you fallen like 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.109
 said next week should the 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:05.780
 Stepping motor video come and see 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.780
 we'll be there until then, bye-bye
