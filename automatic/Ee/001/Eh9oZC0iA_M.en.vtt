00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
metals leach chemicals now you have me

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.000 
metals leach chemicals now you have me
thinking<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:38.030> what<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.120> i<00:00:39.180> do<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.690> stop<00:00:40.620> eating

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you can do that not for long how about I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.380 
you can do that not for long how about I
stop<00:00:46.379> cooking<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.860> eat<00:00:47.039> only<00:00:47.219> raw<00:00:47.340> food<00:00:47.760> there

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
stop cooking I eat only raw food there

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.510 
stop cooking I eat only raw food there
are<00:00:48.510> people<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.590> typically<00:00:50.430> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
are people to do that but typically it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.090 
are people to do that but typically it
won't<00:00:50.670> last<00:00:50.760> very<00:00:50.969> long<00:00:51.149> okay<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.680> i<00:00:52.860> am

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
won't last very long okay so if i am

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.600 
won't last very long okay so if i am
going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.760> cook<00:00:54.449> my<00:00:54.660> food<00:00:55.129> what<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> solution

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
going to cook my food what is a solution

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.150 
going to cook my food what is a solution
that<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.149> recommend<00:00:57.780> solutions<00:00:58.440> use<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that you recommend solutions use the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
that you recommend solutions use the
best<00:00:59.340> cooking<00:00:59.609> system<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> world<00:01:00.690> which

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
best cooking system in the world which

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.139 
best cooking system in the world which
is<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> solid<00:01:01.649> mass<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.070> three<00:01:02.730> cysteines

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
is a solid mass or three cysteines

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.240 
is a solid mass or three cysteines
titanium<00:01:03.960> stainless<00:01:04.170> steel<00:01:04.500> cookware<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
titanium stainless steel cookware and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.179 
titanium stainless steel cookware and
the<00:01:05.700> reason<00:01:06.030> why<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.540> because<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the reason why is because we have a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.600 
the reason why is because we have a
cooking<00:01:08.490> surface

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
cooking surface

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.730 
cooking surface
that<00:01:09.760> has<00:01:10.060> made<00:01:10.240> out<00:01:10.390> of<00:01:10.480> 36<00:01:10.900> things<00:01:11.080> titanium

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
that has made out of 36 things titanium

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.130 
that has made out of 36 things titanium
it<00:01:12.370> doesn't<00:01:12.820> reach<00:01:13.000> chemicals<00:01:13.630> or<00:01:13.780> hang<00:01:13.930> else

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
it doesn't reach chemicals or hang else

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.930 
it doesn't reach chemicals or hang else
into<00:01:14.440> your<00:01:14.560> food<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.010> your<00:01:15.130> food<00:01:15.310> tastes

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
into your food so your food tastes

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.540 
into your food so your food tastes
really<00:01:16.150> good<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:17.230> second<00:01:17.650> reason<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:18.130> even

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
really good the second reason is even

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.850 
really good the second reason is even
heat<00:01:18.730> distribution<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.720> what<00:01:20.230> this<00:01:20.410> does<00:01:20.680> is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
heat distribution and what this does is

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.440 
heat distribution and what this does is
allows<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.490> cook<00:01:21.700> like<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:21.940> little<00:01:22.270> mini

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
allows you to cook like a little mini

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.020 
allows you to cook like a little mini
oven<00:01:22.720> each<00:01:23.290> piece<00:01:23.620> and<00:01:23.920> at<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.460> same<00:01:24.640> time<00:01:24.700> you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
oven each piece and at the same time you

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.580 
oven each piece and at the same time you
don't<00:01:25.150> have<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.300> use<00:01:25.420> water<00:01:25.720> so<00:01:26.350> you're<00:01:26.500> not

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
don't have to use water so you're not

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.560 
don't have to use water so you're not
losing<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.250> nutrient<00:01:27.670> value<00:01:28.060> with<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.360> water

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
losing the nutrient value with the water

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.540 
losing the nutrient value with the water
that's<00:01:28.780> here<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.680> real<00:01:29.830> third<00:01:30.100> benefit

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
that's here and the real third benefit

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.490 
that's here and the real third benefit
is<00:01:30.610> temperature<00:01:31.180> control<00:01:31.570> you're<00:01:32.080> cooking<00:01:32.380> in

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
is temperature control you're cooking in

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.870 
is temperature control you're cooking in
temperature<00:01:33.010> that's<00:01:33.250> high<00:01:33.400> enough<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.729> kill

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
temperature that's high enough to kill

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.870 
temperature that's high enough to kill
bacteria<00:01:34.300> low<00:01:35.290> enough<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:36.010> not<00:01:36.250> destroy<00:01:36.670> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
bacteria low enough to not destroy the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.120 
bacteria low enough to not destroy the
nutrient<00:01:37.300> values<00:01:38.110> in<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.350> food<00:01:38.560> doesn't

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
nutrient values in the food doesn't

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.240 
nutrient values in the food doesn't
reach<00:01:39.250> boiling<00:01:39.550> or<00:01:40.330> steaming<00:01:40.360> or<00:01:41.250> microwaving

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
reach boiling or steaming or microwaving

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.550 
reach boiling or steaming or microwaving
temperatures<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:43.000> so<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:43.690> retain<00:01:44.080> up<00:01:44.410> to

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
temperatures and so you retain up to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.200 
temperatures and so you retain up to
average<00:01:45.369> of<00:01:45.520> about<00:01:45.640> ninety<00:01:46.000> three<00:01:46.119> percent

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
average of about ninety three percent

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.510 
average of about ninety three percent
and<00:01:46.690> emphasize<00:01:47.080> ninety-seven<00:01:47.710> percent<00:01:47.740> of

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
and emphasize ninety-seven percent of

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.520 
and emphasize ninety-seven percent of
the<00:01:48.759> nutrient<00:01:49.570> values<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.050> did<00:01:50.170> find<00:01:50.410> in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
the nutrient values that you did find in

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.280 
the nutrient values that you did find in
raw<00:01:50.680> food<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.460> really<00:01:51.670> is<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.780> most<00:01:53.050> complete

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
raw food so really is the most complete

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.200 
raw food so really is the most complete
way<00:01:53.619> to<00:01:53.680> cook<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.310> best<00:01:54.550> way<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:54.820> cook<00:01:55.030> your
