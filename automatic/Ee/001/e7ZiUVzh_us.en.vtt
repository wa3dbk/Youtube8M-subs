00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.349
 that has a spokesperson from the performance team form the latter 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:16.939
 is 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.820
 I thought the fantastic national policy was the perfect balance between 15 and master 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.300
 9 millimeters 35 dancers very good anyway and very strong are very beautiful 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.550
 they fun very beautiful really very beautiful very beautiful costumes and also a beautiful and 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.700
 customer focus 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.380
 and pleasant to look out for 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.380
 nice but it can beat 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.180
 weird things read today's newspaper 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.170
 last summer for children 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.019
 the sickness 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.680
 the day the municipality do it all is going to happen 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 I've never had it in one of the many beautiful ones 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.140
 as we part the first time 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.250
 it was a surprising implementation 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.060
 that sets classic expectations 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.050
 I thought it was an honor 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.050
 a very nice modern look 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.020
 I am not really a ballet look at me I thought it was very special me 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.750
 I enjoyed it 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.960
 and I think it was difficult for the dancers to do all this 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 to study 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.750
 yes I found beautiful found very beautiful 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.530
 worth finding that is not the end 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.770
 that sets the new era 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.770
 very different parts that this year surprisingly a real one 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.020
 year beautiful mix of 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.780
 fall of the rates 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.770
 from people 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.210
 the strongest point 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.560
 I found the decor 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.670
 because i'm quick 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.930
 already good in color so strong in that in ten years this decor will still be me 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.719
 take on me 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.120
 people who say 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.120
 remain standing 9 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.910
 that only reports that it is 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.309
 first fall into the water know a little 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:17.929

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.749

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.769
 completely overwhelmed 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.010
