00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:13.389
 good day my name is plaque gómez 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.940
 in the world we find all kinds of 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.950
 brands all work and strategy 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.720
 which is behind each one of these is 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.480
 something that has fascinated me for a long time 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.489
 time today we will talk about a 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.890
 transcendental theme that is part of the 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.020
 marketing strategy something that is going 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.259
 to allow to differentiate and identify 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.290
 goods or services that are in the market 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.930
 we will talk about strategies demands 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.000
 have you ever been told that one of the 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.980
 more difficult decisions at the time of 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.010
 launching a product to the market is that of 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.020
 put or not a brand is there though 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.870
 It presupposes a large investment in 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.520
 advertising promotion and even packaging is 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.330
 the main engine of the strategy 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.100
 advertising a brand is a name 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.620
 term sign symbol design or 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.660
 combination of the above that gives you a 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.630
 touch of distinction and uniqueness to 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.370
 products and allows us 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.100
 differentiate between them a brand 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.740
 makes a unique product or also a 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.780
 service but in essence a brand is 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.360
 much more than that is what the seller 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.940
 Ensures to deliver to the consumer a 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.979
 set of certain characteristics 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.410
 benefits and services for example what 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.660
 you feel when the app is the looby brand 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.759
 true quality or when you have a 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.790
 cocacola between your hands is different 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.190
 a pepsi or when you look for information in 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.509
 google instead of yahoo is for a reason 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.160
 do not think of a car bmw w when thinking 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.409
 in this brand we come to mind 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.630
 multiple associated meanings 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.030
 with attributes benefits values ​​and 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.609
 cultures because we think of a car 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.619
 expensive and well built in that if what 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.750
 we will never need more 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.670
 buy another we think about the electro 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.280
 performance and performance and in the culture 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.770
 German always organized and with 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.869
 good quality products in addition to what 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.020
 previous brands transmit us 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.689
 personality if the brand bmw or was a 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.819
 person that person would be maybe a 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.549
 important executive or someone with a 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.980
 good social position there are four 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.470
 brand strategies one is the extension 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.780
 line this is when a company 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.879
 introduce additional products in the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.370
 same category and the same brand by 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.670
 example new colors or presentations 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.860
 is also the brand extension is 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.870
 when the company launches a product in 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.209
 a great category but under the same 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.970
 brand for example a new model of 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.829
 auto multiple marks when a 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.859
 company introduce several brands of a 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:44.260
 same type and new brands is when 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.239
 a company to introduce a product in 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.840
 a new category and with a new 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.360
 brand 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.700
 brands in turn must follow certain 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.280
 guidelines to ensure acceptance between 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.050
 the public like to suggest something about the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.290
 benefits and qualities of the product 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.930
 it must be easy to pronounce recognize and 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.180
 remember to wish distinctive and should not 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.970
 use an ambiguous term or controls 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.549
 meanings today the strategy of 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.769
 brand is something so propitious and effective that 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.690
 almost nothing lacks bliss until the 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.870
 things we did not think possible 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.849
 put a mark we see them for example in 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.400
 the fruit supermarket with the 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.799
 label of different harvesters in the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.810
 brand may be housed benefits 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.420
 intangible that the buyer believes that 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.670
 you receive through the product so 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.340
 if the public is told that a brand 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.379
 is synonymous with prestige and good quality 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.379
 Taste is telling you that if you choose 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:41.200
 that mark your search is over you're 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.269
 is saving time and effort from this 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.010
 we can see how the strategy of 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.799
 brand is a fundamental part of the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.930
 advertising strategies as well as 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.299
 a touch of distinction that offers we see 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.410
 how multiple benefits come off 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.050
 thence 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.780
 conclusion we can highlight three points 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.430
 one the brand strategy plays a 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.530
 important role when it comes to 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.900
 differentiate yourself from the competition 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.420
 2 the marks as such should follow 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.460
 certain guidelines to guarantee your success 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.070
 and welcome among the public 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.380
 3 good brands will help build 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.570
 a corporate image when wearing the 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.540
 name of the company announcing the quality 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.400
 and the size of it well I hope that 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.710
 this information has been useful for 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.200

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.610
