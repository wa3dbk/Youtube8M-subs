00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.130
 álex alan Augustin how they feel about 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.500
 be participating in soitu double very 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.539
 happy we are very happy have been 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.400
 the tests quite strong the tests 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.019
 of characterization things that never 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.909
 we had done in life but what 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.449
 we are going incredible I say in 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:19.589
 our faces many trials 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.789
 exhaustive but the truth is worth 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.230
 very much the people are going to 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.839
 love seeing these and I think it's worth the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.089
 penalty as we said none of 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.890
 we are professional imitators 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.810
 then it's like a job from scratch 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 but the truth is that the teachers are 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.960
 real good production is great the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.940
 people who are responsible for 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.200
 styling image characterization what 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.810
 they also make us feel 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.550
 really professional imitators and that 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.990
 I think that is reflected when the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.090
 show if it's a super challenge because apart 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.620
 people will be able to see the shows so 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.210
 great that we suddenly see in the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.270
 awards are concerts 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.400
 of the artists that fill the arenas or 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.590
 the biggest stadiums in the world now 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.540
 in the 13 then he is very father with 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.520
 us and us the effort that 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.830
 we have to do is replicate it as is 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.549
 as they are doing so because 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.399
 imagine comparing 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:13.310
 madonna or with someone like britney 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.890
 spears or vacuum you know is something strong 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.679
 for any of us and have had 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.179
 some singer to imitate or you already know which 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.920
 it's your character the first one you're going to see 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.219
 we can not reveal any character 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.500
 because it has to be surprise we can not 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.119
 and that is that we have been rehearsing and 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.280
 now we have been doing tests 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.159
 to sing we are given characters and we 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.810
 they say to see this test and start 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.579
 teach with this because then it is also 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.099
 important that we get acclimated to 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.409
 do it once a week once a 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.000
 the week because that is what we are 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.289
 accustoming now then not 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.289
 we know if we have rehearsed 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.110
 good as the characterizations take 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:56.179
 long shots and tone 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.750
 dance steps then if we see 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.069
 ads as a mix of characters and 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.120
 at the time of the body in this week 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.190
 they go with this then as you see 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.870
 but but if even the father apart has 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.110
 been a reproduction work this 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.390
 great to begin to prepare us 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.010
 we have a school we have teachers 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.040
 vocalizing our singing our 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.030
 of imitation dance then really 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.530
 they are throwing all the meat to the spit 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.600
 so that when we are not there 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.910
 we are professional imitators 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.500
 you see a professional job in the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.240
 scenario and on the screen and that the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.010
 people see us there and well we won the 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.810
 respect I think good from from 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.900
 this program all the guests have 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.280
 my solute answer why marry 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.780
 the character of each movement that 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.450
 you do and turn up if you talk and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.850
 Simon the little hand is a job of 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.560
 very cannon research what we know 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.280
 is that the program will be the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.130
 big michael jackson britney spears 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.050
 as I was saying they are going to invite also 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.050
 great figures of mexico juan gabriel 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.459
 all the big ones are going to be not nothing 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.950
 more we do not know which ones go to us guys and 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.500
 how they think jurors are going to be 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.860
 or orca Hector Martinez 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.700
 cynthia who also former academic and this 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.410
 dude 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.000
 I think that cintia has to wear a 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.360
 little in our place because we are going 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.099
 see everywhere many is 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.230
 Hector said it is very severe 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.690
 the other day he warned us that he is not going 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.480
 to have mercy that is going to go super 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.610
 objective and that will be thorough in that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.160
 he wants to see a job very well done 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.819
 then he does not do a little bit if that guy 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.819
 also like 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.310
 That guy, this is funny, so I think 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.650
 that will evaluate us a lot the part of 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.940
 the comedy because it is and is very important 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.650
 that we not only have a good 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.900
 imitation but that between we have the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.030
 public entertaining open with asad and 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.760
 Have fun come to me Daniel 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.370
 cabral and is super authentic but niurka 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.340
 she is also an actress 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.739
 to dance is a singer then the truth 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.739
 that if they have what to criticize I know with 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.420
 what to tell you hear what you're doing well 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.940
 you're making it a food and I think that 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.650
 it's quite objective but I want 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.359
 also see the roll of snow they have 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.040
 the judges interact with each other 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.389
 we were in a treat for the people 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.430
 because good I know Héctor Martínez 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.070
 was my academy director six years ago 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.500
 years is where it is handled like 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.630
 they say things and where it hurts the most and 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.570
 you can never get there you think you can 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.419
 have there hector rolls how are they going to 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.130
 be surely fixing a judge 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.020
 civilian and see that you can hit a lot with 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.020
 the demon boss because he can do 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.410
 I believe that people between what he says 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.020
 what he does and struck out 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.870
 commented on chicken that is a great product 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.370
 in driver the truth has made a good 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.910
 great job that gives me joy and now 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.520
 it's going to be like your trophy but and it's to see it 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.620
 in another facet of here when we see it 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.790
 in avenging joy as it is a program in 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.700
 the mornings is very 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.820
 Well, it's very enjoyable but now with a 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.190
 rally of these at night you need 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.320
 to be suddenly very serious has a lot 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.380
 I believe that with sun has everything and 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.040
 apart he is amazing person of all the 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.440
 production and many surprises trial 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.270
 double many surprises as it has already 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.710
 said in other interviews are going to be 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.630
 even tantrums are going to celebrate with 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.850
 us because it has many dynamics 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.080
 of the program in addition to what they choose 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.420
 the judges who decide also 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.310
 we have the power one of the contests 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.780
 who have the immunity that that wins 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.610
 doing the best of the week also 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.080
 can save can also send 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.610
 nominations everything is fine and you create a 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.350
 conflict among peers because 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.990
 even if you do not want to, you have to save 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.760
 someone is criminal and then for 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.650
 be very good all the wave of reality 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.680
 This axis is also the one that is 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.450
 good strategy good my face or how 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.580
 did exactly if he did it right if he did not 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.710
 he did well he has the right to judge 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.370
 then people are going to have a good time 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.370
 very well 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.530
 we will be seeing from 18 onwards 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.620
 13 from Monday to Friday at 7 o'clock 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.620
 night
