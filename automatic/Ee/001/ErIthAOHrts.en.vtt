00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
brake fluid and that's a bad thing

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.000 
brake fluid and that's a bad thing
because<00:00:17.920> brake<00:00:18.520> fluid<00:00:18.970> has<00:00:19.150> the<00:00:19.390> ability<00:00:19.870> to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
because brake fluid has the ability to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.360

you<00:02:01.570> can<00:02:01.719> actually<00:02:02.109> see<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.499> through<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.920> hose

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
you can actually see it through the hose

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.929 
you can actually see it through the hose
you<00:02:03.689> continue<00:02:04.689> bleeding<00:02:05.289> it<00:02:05.439> until<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.759> have

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
you continue bleeding it until you have

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.050 
you continue bleeding it until you have
