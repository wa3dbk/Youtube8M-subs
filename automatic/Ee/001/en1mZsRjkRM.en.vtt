attention into these concepts and it's
very<00:02:54.810> intricate<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.590> process<00:02:56.130> we<00:02:56.700> have

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
very intricate the process we have

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.430 
very intricate the process we have
picked<00:02:57.120> Bowman<00:02:57.510> trees<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.110> goes<00:02:58.230> through

picked Bowman trees and it goes through
three-dimensional<00:02:59.190> carving<00:02:59.580> process<00:02:59.760> so

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
three-dimensional carving process so

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.390 
three-dimensional carving process so
that<00:03:00.870> they<00:03:01.020> have<00:03:01.230> control<00:03:01.710> of<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:02.130> grain<00:03:02.370> that

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
what the instrument cluster can do and

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.199 
what the instrument cluster can do and
you'll<00:03:25.980> notice<00:03:26.220> they've<00:03:26.430> designed<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:26.940> if

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
you'll notice they've designed it so if

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.610 
you'll notice they've designed it so if
you<00:03:27.330> mount<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.660> camera<00:03:27.900> on<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.260> phone<00:03:28.410> it's

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
you mount a camera on the phone it's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.110

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
concept and I will show you the handles

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.059 
concept and I will show you the handles
in<00:04:04.629> a<00:04:04.690> eventually<00:04:05.260> in<00:04:05.379> this<00:04:05.500> feature<00:04:05.769> it's

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
in a eventually in this feature it's

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.550 
in a eventually in this feature it's
blended<00:04:06.459> with<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.930> vehicle<00:04:07.930> it's<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.349> very

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
blended with the vehicle it's a very

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.080 
blended with the vehicle it's a very
intentional<00:04:09.220> way<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.549> they've<00:04:09.700> done<00:04:09.910> that

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
intentional way that they've done that

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.119 
intentional way that they've done that
they<00:04:10.269> didn't<00:04:10.480> want<00:04:10.599> to<00:04:10.690> design<00:04:11.019> an<00:04:11.319> actual

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
they didn't want to design an actual

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.160 
they didn't want to design an actual
door<00:04:12.370> handle<00:04:12.819> because<00:04:13.120> look<00:04:13.599> at<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.840> vehicle

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
door handle because look at the vehicle

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.839 
door handle because look at the vehicle
it<00:04:14.260> takes<00:04:14.530> away<00:04:14.799> from<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:15.220> line<00:04:15.400> as<00:04:15.640> far<00:04:15.670> as

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
it takes away from the line as far as

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.699 
it takes away from the line as far as
the<00:04:15.940> reason<00:04:16.329> there's<00:04:16.479> no<00:04:16.660> b-pillar<00:04:17.200> the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
the reason there's no b-pillar the

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.680 
the reason there's no b-pillar the
designers<00:04:18.190> want<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.459> turn<00:04:18.669> eyes<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.450> flow<00:04:19.660> a

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
designers want to turn eyes to flow a

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.560 
designers want to turn eyes to flow a
certain<00:04:20.290> way<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:21.100> lines<00:04:21.579> with<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.180> vehicle

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
certain way and lines with the vehicle

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.540 
certain way and lines with the vehicle
so<00:04:22.750> as<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.930> can<00:04:23.080> see<00:04:23.380> they've<00:04:23.800> extended<00:04:24.220> this

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
so as you can see they've extended this

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.129 
so as you can see they've extended this
line<00:04:24.760> down<00:04:24.970> into<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.450> wheel<00:04:25.600> parts<00:04:25.900> they

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
line down into the wheel parts they

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.990 
line down into the wheel parts they
oppose<00:04:26.440> it<00:04:26.470> but<00:04:26.919> there<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.220> one<00:04:27.460> there<00:04:27.700> does

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
oppose it but there is one there does

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.270 
oppose it but there is one there does
function<00:04:28.570> our<00:04:29.139> concept<00:04:29.590> that<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:29.950> actually

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
function our concept that you actually

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.310 
function our concept that you actually
do<00:04:30.580> operate<00:04:31.060> they<00:04:31.210> pride<00:04:31.450> themselves<00:04:31.479> of<00:04:32.110> that

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
do operate they pride themselves of that

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.409 
do operate they pride themselves of that
video<00:04:33.280> footage<00:04:33.610> have<00:04:33.910> this<00:04:34.030> big<00:04:34.240> logjam

Flyway now let the doors open it's

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.290 
Flyway now let the doors open it's
actually<00:04:38.710> an<00:04:38.800> especial<00:04:39.280> hinge<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.820> design

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
actually an especial hinge the design

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.689 
actually an especial hinge the design
to<00:04:40.449> notify<00:04:40.780> us<00:04:40.930> of<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:41.440> so<00:04:42.039> not<00:04:42.250> only<00:04:42.370> does<00:04:42.639> it

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
to notify us of that so not only does it

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.820 
to notify us of that so not only does it
open<00:04:43.090> it'll<00:04:43.240> ship<00:04:43.599> forward<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.319> idea<00:04:44.620> behind

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
open it'll ship forward the idea behind

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.219 
open it'll ship forward the idea behind
that<00:04:45.099> is<00:04:45.280> so<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.270> creates<00:04:46.449> workspaces

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
that is so that it creates workspaces

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.740 
that is so that it creates workspaces

going<00:04:55.569> to<00:04:55.870> be<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.020> challenge<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:56.560> they've

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
going to be a challenge so they've

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.409 
going to be a challenge so they've
actually<00:04:56.949> done<00:04:57.250> something<00:04:57.639> to<00:04:57.759> rectify<00:04:57.940> that
