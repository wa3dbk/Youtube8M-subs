less<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:37.479> same<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.710> there<00:01:38.829> seems<00:01:38.979> have<00:01:39.100> been

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
less the same but there seems have been

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.710 
less the same but there seems have been
quite<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.399> few<00:01:39.579> changes<00:01:39.909> behind<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.299> scenes<00:01:40.540> to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
quite a few changes behind the scenes to

quite a few changes behind the scenes to
improve<00:01:40.990> performance<00:01:41.259> particularly<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
launcher which is a really welcome

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.749

you've<00:02:09.830> got<00:02:09.920> text<00:02:10.250> labels<00:02:10.550> under<00:02:10.729> them<00:02:10.880> as<00:02:11.140> you

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
you've got text labels under them as you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.540 
you've got text labels under them as you
can<00:02:12.260> see<00:02:12.410> we're<00:02:12.530> having<00:02:12.710> a<00:02:12.770> few<00:02:12.920> Wi-Fi<00:02:13.250> issues

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
can see we're having a few Wi-Fi issues

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.800 
can see we're having a few Wi-Fi issues
there<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:13.970> we're<00:02:14.150> probably<00:02:14.330> not<00:02:14.510> gonna<00:02:14.630> be<00:02:14.750> on

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
there so we're probably not gonna be on

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.810 
there so we're probably not gonna be on
cloud<00:02:14.960> androidcentral<00:02:15.740> what<00:02:16.430> we<00:02:16.520> can<00:02:16.670> do

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
cloud androidcentral what we can do

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.390 
cloud androidcentral what we can do
though<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.150> take<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.750> look<00:02:17.990> at<00:02:18.260> HTC<00:02:18.710> watch<00:02:19.070> which

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
though is take a look at HTC watch which

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.250 
though is take a look at HTC watch which
is<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:19.970> device<00:02:20.240> as<00:02:20.450> well<00:02:20.630> I've<00:02:20.960> seen<00:02:21.140> on

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
is on this device as well I've seen on

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.380 
is on this device as well I've seen on
sensation<00:02:21.860> nothing<00:02:22.670> pre-loaded<00:02:23.120> on<00:02:23.210> there

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
sensation nothing pre-loaded on there

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.610 
sensation nothing pre-loaded on there
but<00:02:23.570> then<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.750> wouldn't<00:02:23.900> expect<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:24.380> on

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
but then you wouldn't expect it on

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.580 
but then you wouldn't expect it on
pre-release<00:02:25.190> software<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.470> usual

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
pre-release software this is the usual

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.020 
pre-release software this is the usual
store<00:02:27.950> interface<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:28.520> because<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.760> having

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
store interface but because of having

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.460 
store interface but because of having
some<00:02:29.180> Wi-Fi<00:02:29.510> issues<00:02:29.810> that's<00:02:30.020> not<00:02:30.170> loading

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
usual carousel effects that's back in

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.180 
usual carousel effects that's back in
cents<00:02:37.400> 35<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.290> it's<00:02:39.290> an<00:02:39.440> awful<00:02:39.709> lot<00:02:39.770> smoother

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
cents 35 and it's an awful lot smoother

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.530 
cents 35 and it's an awful lot smoother
than<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.730> in<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.940> earlier<00:02:41.180> version<00:02:41.480> of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
than it is in the earlier version of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.420 
than it is in the earlier version of
sense<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.500> one<00:02:42.620> of<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.770> biggest<00:02:42.920> complaints

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
sense so one of the biggest complaints

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.830 
sense so one of the biggest complaints
with<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.550> original<00:02:43.760> sensation<00:02:44.510> was<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
with the original sensation was that the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.540 
with the original sensation was that the
launch<00:02:45.050> was<00:02:45.230> slow<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.740> kind<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.070> jerky<00:02:46.400> and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
launch was slow and kind of jerky and

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.910 
launch was slow and kind of jerky and
it's<00:02:47.060> much<00:02:47.390> much<00:02:47.600> smoother<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.560> that's<00:02:48.709> even

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
it's much much smoother and that's even

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.990 
it's much much smoother and that's even
more<00:02:48.950> impressive<00:02:49.490> when<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:49.610> consider<00:02:49.700> that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
more impressive when you consider that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.790 
more impressive when you consider that
this<00:02:50.180> thing<00:02:50.390> isn't<00:02:50.570> running<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.900> dual-core<00:02:51.260> CPU

you've<00:02:56.600> got<00:02:56.750> 768<00:02:57.680> Meg's<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.100> board<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.580> about

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
you've got 768 Meg's on board and about

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.120 
you've got 768 Meg's on board and about
500<00:02:59.660> or<00:03:00.050> so<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.530> available<00:03:00.650> for<00:03:01.040> app

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
500 or so that is available for app

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.010 
500 or so that is available for app
usage<00:03:01.490> which<00:03:01.700> i<00:03:01.970> think<00:03:02.300> is<00:03:02.480> more<00:03:02.630> than<00:03:02.750> enough

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
usage which i think is more than enough

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.630 
usage which i think is more than enough
so<00:03:03.680> let's<00:03:03.890> take<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.040> look<00:03:04.190> at<00:03:04.250> some<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.520> new
