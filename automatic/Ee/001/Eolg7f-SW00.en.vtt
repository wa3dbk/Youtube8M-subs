00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
slowest then you have to move your

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.850 
slowest then you have to move your
fingers<00:03:02.700> already<00:03:03.060> pretty<00:03:03.420> damn<00:03:03.690> fast<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.770> is

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
fingers already pretty damn fast that is
