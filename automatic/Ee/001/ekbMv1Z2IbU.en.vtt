 merciless time management today we 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.410
 essentially begin to engage in their straight 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.259
 responsibilities that is going to be managed 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.170
 our time will be all harmonious 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.310
 distribute we have gone before 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.770
 preparatory part 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.220
 the first four days today has come 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.650
 time to get yourself a diary first 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.880
 I would like to say for what 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.309
 need diary first shoulder us 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.399
 need a diary that's actually 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.520
 planning if you don't make a plan 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.829
 the next day just somehow 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.190
 try along the way come up with what 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.379
 do something you greatly reduces your 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.190
 productivity surely noticed 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.739
 for a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.300
 it was those days when I don't know what 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 Now do there I think that you can 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.199
 now do it well come on in 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.440
 I will sit in contact and well mail now 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.680
 see Satan I'll go show when u 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.000
 you have no plan here that begins 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.989
 incomprehensible spending time just 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.450
 spender vani and his 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.060
 and in the end in the end just lose 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.049
 a lot of time so it is impossible to friends 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 do that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.060
 we definitely need to competently 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.180
 planning your time is needed 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.080
 diary but that 's not the only thing 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.829
 for which the second is needed than is needed, this 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.540
 recording your ideas and thoughts along the way 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.869
 we have different ideas and thoughts 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.540
 if we don't write them down then how would this 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.229
 nor was it hard to hurt anyone but we 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.939
 after all school forget for themselves often 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.399
 noticed that this happens 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.560
 great idea and you think that you and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.479
 I will definitely not forget now 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.820
 write it ok anyway when 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.409
 podvernotsya daily arm let 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.810
 when I went to bed I will write down in the morning 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.490
 in the morning you also forget this idea therefore 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.649
 very important as soon as you got 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.630
 some idea chicken important thought right away 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.500
 write it for this, too, need 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.479
 diary the third item is the release 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.709
 of consciousness 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.210
 if your head is crammed with something 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.120
 constantly do not understand what you are and 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.270
 wait for new ideas are much worse than yours 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.030
 chapter as it is by the way she as vat is filled 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.380
 water and new thoughts just shimmer 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.030
 through it you need this water so 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.570
 let's say throw it in the diary 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.250
 free up your head for new thoughts 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.410
 it works great you will notice when 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.830
 you will write out all your thoughts all 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.540
 your ideas your diary you will begin 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.090
 come more and more and where 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.110
 all the best from the good idea itself 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.590
 brilliant idea 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.040
 that's exactly the way we won't start coming by the way 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.380
 as 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.890
 communities with harry potter when he's out 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.410
 of his head he dedicated a vessel to that pool 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.110
 remembered from memory 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.760
 we have your head put a pool of memory 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.520
 some thoughts here are torso and you need 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.100
 do if chapters place your pool 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.400
 your diary memory your thoughts only 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.600
 instead of a magic wand you have a pen 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.630
 3 what is needed and 4 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.540
 this story of your life diary you 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.380
 you mark the most interesting ones 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.660
 affairs behind some interesting events and 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.460
 then after decades it will be 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.040
 unique information archives when you 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.290
 will become famous steep successful a 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.120
 if you will if you are engaged 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.710
 topics like time management then 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.920
 you have a very big chance to become exactly 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.840
 so because this view is very small 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.030
 people doing it very few people 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.980
 understand the importance of this if you are now 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.320
 already on the fifth to me training it means you 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.260
 definitely have a very good chance 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.260
 become raise such people and for your 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:58.000
 future biographers will give your wife a nickname 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:01.630
 invaluable benefit on what is worth following 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.180
 talk today is how to lead 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.340
 diary 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.190
 Now I will tell only short 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.700
 concept because you still do not have 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.050
 diary you only buy it today 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.120
 tomorrow we take a closer look at how 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.790
 withdraw and today only tell about 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.060
 one such technique is hard planning 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.740
 the most effective remember this 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.710
 just hard planning technique 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.840
 I have tested the most effective 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.450
 different techniques a bunch of different techniques 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.850
 making a plan in practice made sure 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.490
 that cats are hard on China tasks 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.520
 some things you have time at times 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.830
 more what is tough planning 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.180
 Now I will try to show here 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:50.090
 for example you write from 6 to 7 yoga know 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.090
 yoga from eight to eight thirty you 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.639
 breakfast and what else are you doing there 10 to 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:00.650
 10 30 os is a rest 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:04.850
 we have to plan it hard again 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.400
 even rest and here I just spent 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.669
 excerpt from the plan is actually from eight 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.240
 up to thirty from 8 30 to 10, too, that should 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:17.810
 stand here just as an example 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:21.160
 still a very important point make a plan 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:25.150
 before going to bed there is the protection of methods of reference 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.100
 diary is at bedtime or in the morning 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.729
 the overwhelming advantage is the technique 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.620
 making a plan before bed because 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.380
 if you make a plan from the morning on 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.820
 it takes a lot of energy since 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.160
 you start planning 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.340
 what did he do during the day in the morning you 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.740
 usually you know this one like this since morning 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.870
 ideal and this is flour and the plan can be the same 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.050
 white make up therefore bedtime 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.880
 because before going to bed such things are usually 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.280
 ambitious and so necessary 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.530
 make a plan before it and in the morning already 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.220
 don't think about what to do just 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.050
 looked took done from practice without 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.320
 thinking to do it is also very important 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.100
 practice is very important skill 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:13.030
 so friends back we have two tasks 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.810
 first buy dated diary 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.340
 precisely dated diary they 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.590
 there are such diaries in which it is necessary 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.120
 set the date myself but i think it is 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.890
 there is nothing you just waste 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.560
 time to constantly represent the date 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.870
 so you will need to do every day 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.280
 so it does not have any entries in the diary 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.620
 no sense began to buy 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.120
 undated diary 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.950
 contacting diary there 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.810
 different kinds you need not really 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.780
 save should be a good diary 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:44.680
 he will be himself for a year due to 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.170
 it to you to purchase consciously by the way 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.320
 if this course see for example in 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.730
 in the middle of the year do not think everything is necessary 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.130
 from next year 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.410
 buy diary that all was beautiful 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.500
 I will not do this anyway 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.690
 start a diary now 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.290
 half a year can deprive a lot 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.880
 so bath diary now but 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.510
 if you let it stay there two 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.010
 months before the end of the year you have to specifically 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.840
 meaning there is no buying dated in 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.300
 In this case, some simple 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.010
 notebook for 2 for a couple of months or 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.690
 Undated diary for a couple 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.720
 months but from next year 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.130
 son and dated diary well again 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.840
 I will repeat and you can not even postpone 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.270
 if two months are left until the end of the year 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.240
 no need to transfer time management to 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:34.050
 new year and the second task 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.060
 make a plan the next day 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.410
 make up at least 5 hard points 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.010
 which you must do and tough 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:46.870
 time so wanted to try to rise 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:48.910
 some rest block in general make 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.160
 sample plan for the next day while you 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.020
 I do not know how to do it very correctly 

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.170
 but we'll talk about it with you 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.130
 the following is not training you should already be 

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.230
 with a diary 

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.600
 the pole is not training therefore running 

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.670
 shops or order in the area where 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.820
 want but tomorrow you should already be 

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:09.480

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.480
