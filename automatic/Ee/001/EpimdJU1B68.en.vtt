00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:22.240
 The Shortest Kite of the Cattle 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:24.930
 It is a foot model after 2523 and 252, so it will be released this time this time 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:30.440
 We will little by commentary 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:34.910
 It's 5.2 feet, so basically I throw away that long cast 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.820
 But it is to think Well this anyone accurately hit some short distance 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.750
 so 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.710
 After all this 4 axis carbon is that 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.840
 I will claim that the rod twists cleanly 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.630
 So 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.390
 Cast again 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.850
 It is very suitable to do such things slowly and carefully . 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.940
 Because 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:02.550
 2522 252 should have to enter the Tteyuu to 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:08.380
 But I'm of that soft display it something so can comfortably Cass to true 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.170
 You Yes in the rod, such as not shake really slowly raised Kedomo's carbon rod 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.530
 so 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.800
 Enhanced version of it 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:22.630
 It is about 3 of this 2523 word ending put together power, and this one is 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.990
 With respect to here but back and forth 25 grams little it will not face better of around 20 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:31.470
 It will be shaped when the gram front and back are facing 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 In fact, if you try to cast that year , it's not easy for anyone to be there 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.050
 But it'd seem obvious because that I feel is throwing smoothly that I think not stick 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.160
 Also 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:47.220
 I think that the commonplace is willing to achieve a special fiber referred to in this 4-axis carbon 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.760
 I think it would be nice 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.240
 To last year 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.420
 5.4 also I'd have launched the feet of Cattle 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.310
 It is a completely different design and I do a new design 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.740
 Ft has been achieved serve me in the mansion 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:10.190
 So - 2522 or cat to later on in I will continue to 20 grams before and after So is 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:15.860
 Again the one who is also Well something I that Masushi not suitable for those of a certain degree light class of 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.300
 I also love the 5/8 oz of that head and the lure around my head , so I need a lure around that 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.300
 We developed that we want you to be comfortable 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300
 Hmm 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:31.030
 I'm Saab would freely rebound from the carbon rod is bending just this 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.750
 It's difficult to control today, though 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.490
 Even if you throw this slowly 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.800
 I can control properly 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.800
 Because there is not flexes This Serve So 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:49.120
 It does together aim at easy to pinpoint the death yesterday of control 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.750
 If you let me raise it really slowly 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.800
 I think it 's good I 'm pursuing it as soon as possible 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.810
 Well as a development concept 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.610
 I want you to throw it slowly 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.870
 It will be good 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.870
 Oh, overhead is also the same 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.510
 Anyway, it is one of the characteristics that the timing is easy to take 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.680
 But it is very makore 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.310
 It's flexible but it bends well even with a fish 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.480
 I will remain at that end 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.690
 So 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.250
 Fishing is fun too but it is short 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:35.510
 This is the feature of the tricks 5 people 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:37.530
 Then I made do I'm pretty strongly seen can be seen Well I Are You a 252's 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.770
 In this regard 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.210
 mo 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.340
 In terms of personality, it's no accident and no problem anymore 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.260
 that 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.870
 I can burn it slowly but 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.459
 I want to throw strongly 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.110
 In Well so Kedomo I'm not good to so-so safely go up and say represent the overhang 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.700
 We put as much of power say 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:01.370
 So once the layers is also flew lightly that in 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.830
 I'm hard at 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.410
 Because the port is short with feet 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.840
 pumice 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.250
 eh 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.250
 Gonna be easier to handle 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.459
 I get really Hey powerful dregs 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.269
 So also is Okinaru 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.269
 I am all right now 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.130
 Really I say that short rod is 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.520
 A little 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.460
 It is difficult to express action 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.400
 There is a difficult part in design, but 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.930
 It took quite some time and it was good 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.830
 that 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.249
 Really everyone 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.840
 It seems easy to use 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.500
 Because it is 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.139
 By all means 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.480
 I would like to have an adventure 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.410
 It was 2522 and 252 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.410
 Thanking you in advance 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.039
 Hmm
