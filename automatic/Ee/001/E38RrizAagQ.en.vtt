00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.770
 today we are going to make this nice necklace with 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.890
 picks the mabel leaf and rings 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.890
 metallic 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.329
 for this we are going to need rings 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.089
 10 mm metal beads hama beads 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.519
 of opis la and 6 mm rings 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.939
 we will also use a closure of 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.939
 carabiner 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.780
 it was a piece of string and a pair of tweezers 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.340
 let's start by entering an account 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.340
 in a 10-millimeter ring 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.570
 and then we will introduce another ring 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.570
 for that same account 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.070
 and we will stay like this 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.820
 now we will introduce another account in that 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.820
 same ring 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.860
 and then another ring on that account 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.570
 and so on we will continue 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.940
 doing these steps until 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.460
 get the desired length either 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.729
 for a bracelet or in this case for a 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.729
 necklace 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.820
 when we have the desired measurement already 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.430
 we can start to create our design 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.979
 for this model I look at what is the center 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.170
 of the necklace and I'm placing other rings 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.740
 with beads forming a kind of 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.740
 triangle 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:13.130
 a row with 5 rings another with 4 other 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.130
 with 3 another with 2 and then a single 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.739
 and now we are going to use the rings of 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.340
 6 mm to join the rings 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.340
 big 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.000
 let's start by joining the row of 5 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.920
 rings at the ends 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.480
 you have to calculate well for you 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.480
 stay right in the center of the necklace 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.770
 and so little by little we are going to unite the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.380
 rings 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.120
 At the end of the video you have a photo where 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.120
 you will see the design more closely 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.140
 when we have already placed this row of 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.610
 rings we will place the following ones of the 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.860
 same way 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.860
 and so we will form the triangle 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.840
 and that's it, we have our 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.000
 necklace now we just have to place a 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.500
 small piece of chain in each ring of the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.500
 ends and a close 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.590
 here you can see more closely how they are 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.590
 placed the rings 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.430
 Look how nice it looks 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.640
 now you can do yours with the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.640
 design that you like 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.410
 if you liked it, do not forget to give like and 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.540
 share it with your friends 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.669

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.940
