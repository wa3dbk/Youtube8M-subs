okay<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.270> am<00:00:03.570> going<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:04.049> be<00:00:04.200> demonstrating<00:00:04.620> that

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
okay I am going to be demonstrating that

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.049 
okay I am going to be demonstrating that
you<00:00:05.670> can<00:00:06.000> get<00:00:06.330> an<00:00:06.569> electrical<00:00:07.230> current<00:00:08.160> from

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
you can get an electrical current from

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.860 
you can get an electrical current from
an<00:00:09.870> electrical<00:00:10.410> charge<00:00:10.620> from<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.309> lemon<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.179> I

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
an electrical charge from a lemon and I

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.289 
an electrical charge from a lemon and I
know<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.160> can<00:00:14.309> do<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.700> through<00:00:15.120> my

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
know that you can do that through my

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.050 
know that you can do that through my
internet<00:00:15.660> research<00:00:16.139> but<00:00:17.010> I'm<00:00:17.130> also<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.880> to

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
internet research but I'm also going to

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.810 
internet research but I'm also going to
try<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.869> an<00:00:19.050> apple<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.680> an<00:00:20.130> onion<00:00:20.430> which

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
try it with an apple and an onion which

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.790 
try it with an apple and an onion which
I<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.390> know<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:21.779> they<00:00:21.960> will<00:00:21.990> conduct<00:00:22.470> an

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
I do not know if they will conduct an

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.500 
I do not know if they will conduct an
electrical<00:00:23.580> charge<00:00:23.760> or<00:00:24.029> give<00:00:24.150> off<00:00:24.359> an

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
electrical charge or give off an

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.589 
electrical charge or give off an
electric<00:00:24.930> an<00:00:25.230> electrical<00:00:25.800> charge<00:00:26.029> so<00:00:27.029> first<00:00:27.390> I

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
electric an electrical charge so first I

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.529 
electric an electrical charge so first I
have<00:00:27.630> gathered<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.080> my<00:00:28.289> supplies<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.539> my

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
lemon my apple and my onion and then I

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.959 
lemon my apple and my onion and then I
have<00:00:33.360> three<00:00:33.809> paper<00:00:34.590> clips<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.370> three<00:00:35.579> pennies

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
have three paper clips and three pennies

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
have three paper clips and three pennies
for<00:00:36.420> each<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:37.969> and<00:00:38.969> then<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.750> also<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.469> my

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
for each one and then I also have my

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770 
for each one and then I also have my
voltage<00:00:41.100> meter<00:00:41.340> hooked<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> my<00:00:42.510> laptop

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
voltage meter hooked up to my laptop

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
voltage meter hooked up to my laptop
which<00:00:43.530> all<00:00:43.710> zoom<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> readings<00:00:44.700> when

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
which all zoom in on the readings when

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.180 
which all zoom in on the readings when
we<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.090> those<00:00:45.239> hooked<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.620> knife<00:00:46.829> just

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
we get those hooked up and a knife just

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.619 
we get those hooked up and a knife just
to<00:00:47.309> make<00:00:47.520> little<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.450> then<00:00:48.629> slits<00:00:49.050> into<00:00:49.289> each

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
to make little and then slits into each

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.799 
to make little and then slits into each
item<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> basically<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> battery

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
item here so basically we know a battery

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
item here so basically we know a battery
is<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.010> make<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> battery<00:00:56.610> by<00:00:56.820> suspending

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
is you can make a battery by suspending

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.439 
is you can make a battery by suspending
two<00:00:57.690> different<00:00:58.170> metals<00:00:58.500> into<00:00:58.800> an<00:00:59.070> acid<00:00:59.489> well

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
two different metals into an acid well

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.500 
two different metals into an acid well
lemons<00:01:00.930> contain<00:01:01.410> citric<00:01:01.949> acid<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> two

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
lemons contain citric acid so the two

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.299 
lemons contain citric acid so the two
different<00:01:03.539> metals<00:01:04.229> I'm<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:04.920> using

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
different metals I'm going to be using

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.390 
different metals I'm going to be using
is<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> paperclip<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.170> penny<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.250> I'm

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
is the paperclip and the penny so I'm

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.609 
is the paperclip and the penny so I'm
going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:08.790> ahead<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.299> started<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> I'm

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
going to go ahead and get started so I'm

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.240 
going to go ahead and get started so I'm
going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:11.479> two<00:01:12.830> slits<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:16.009> one<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.040> each

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
going to make two slits here one on each

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.880 
going to make two slits here one on each
side<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.030> once<00:01:18.509> I'm<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.320> insert<00:01:19.830> my

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
side and once I'm going to insert my

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.600 
side and once I'm going to insert my
paperclip

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.760 

and<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:24.240> other<00:01:24.390> side<00:01:24.630> I'm<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.440> insert

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and the other side I'm going to insert

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.539 
and the other side I'm going to insert
my<00:01:25.860> penny

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.950 

okay<00:01:29.820> I'm<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.600> hook<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.200> lead<00:01:32.359> to<00:01:35.960> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
okay I'm going to hook up a lead to the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.580 
okay I'm going to hook up a lead to the
paperclip<00:01:37.289> and<00:01:37.729> one<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.450> penny<00:01:42.590> this

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
paperclip and one to the penny this

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.569 
paperclip and one to the penny this
gives<00:01:43.920> me<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.490> reading<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:46.219> negative<00:01:47.219> point

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
gives me a reading of negative point

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.499 
gives me a reading of negative point
eight<00:01:47.819> six<00:01:48.240> six<00:01:48.569> seven<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.670> tells<00:01:51.240> me

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
eight six six seven so that tells me

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.090 
eight six six seven so that tells me
that<00:01:51.539> my<00:01:51.899> leaves

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that my leaves

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.749 
that my leaves
I<00:01:54.079> mean<00:01:55.079> are<00:01:55.319> potentially<00:01:55.829> backwards<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.729> I

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
I mean are potentially backwards so I

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.789 
I mean are potentially backwards so I
will<00:01:57.209> switch<00:01:57.630> them<00:01:57.869> over<00:01:58.020> still<00:01:58.530> positive

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
will switch them over still positive

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.440 
will switch them over still positive
charge<00:02:00.200> put<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.530> my<00:02:01.649> paper<00:02:01.920> clip<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.610> then

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
charge put one on my paper clip and then

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.929 
charge put one on my paper clip and then
the<00:02:03.770> positive<00:02:04.770> lead<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.250> red<00:02:05.549> one<00:02:05.759> I'm

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
the positive lead is the red one I'm

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.479 
the positive lead is the red one I'm
going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.179> put<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.689> penny<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.489> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
going to put it on the penny and the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.809 
going to put it on the penny and the
negative<00:02:08.849> lead<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:10.079> black<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.489> I'm

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
negative lead is the black one and I'm

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.759 
negative lead is the black one and I'm
going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> put<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.810> paper<00:02:12.989> clip<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
going to put it on to the paper clip and

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.860 
going to put it on to the paper clip and
let's<00:02:14.370> see<00:02:14.610> what<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.060> gives<00:02:15.299> us<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:18.660> gives

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
let's see what that gives us that gives

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.789 
let's see what that gives us that gives
us<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.079> potential<00:02:20.000> reading<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.269> 0.9<00:02:21.900> for<00:02:22.440> three

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
us a potential reading of 0.9 for three

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.770 
us a potential reading of 0.9 for three
and<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:24.959> positive<00:02:25.319> number<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.750> that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
and that is positive number so that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.640 
and that is positive number so that
tells<00:02:28.560> me<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.129> in<00:02:29.519> my<00:02:29.930> battery<00:02:30.930> my<00:02:31.260> lemon

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
tells me that in my battery my lemon

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.390 
tells me that in my battery my lemon
battery<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.410> red<00:02:34.410> lead<00:02:34.650> connected<00:02:35.250> to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
battery that the red lead connected to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.050 
battery that the red lead connected to
the<00:02:35.519> plus<00:02:35.730> side<00:02:36.030> or<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.480> penny<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.459> black

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the plus side or the penny and the black

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.090 
the plus side or the penny and the black
side<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:41.160> -<00:02:41.519> lead<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.150> black<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:43.500> black<00:02:43.709> lead

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
side the - lead the black the black lead

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.460 
side the - lead the black the black lead
to<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.700> paperclip<00:02:45.180> was<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.660> minus<00:02:45.989> sign<00:02:46.170> so

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
to the paperclip was the minus sign so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.910 
to the paperclip was the minus sign so
that<00:02:46.650> tells<00:02:46.889> me<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.549> is<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.920> positive

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
that tells me that this is the positive

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.520 
that tells me that this is the positive
terminal<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:51.239> my<00:02:51.389> battery<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.049> this<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
terminal of my battery and this is the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.569 
terminal of my battery and this is the
negative<00:02:52.709> terminal<00:02:52.950> my<00:02:53.489> battery<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:56.160> next<00:02:56.370> I'm

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
negative terminal my battery so next I'm

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.460 
negative terminal my battery so next I'm
going<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.760> try<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.030> same<00:02:57.359> thing<00:02:57.420> with<00:02:58.139> an

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
going to try the same thing with an

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.449 
going to try the same thing with an
apple<00:03:00.709> I'll<00:03:01.709> make<00:03:01.889> two<00:03:02.130> holes<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:05.130> put<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
apple I'll make two holes and put the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.580 
apple I'll make two holes and put the
penny<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:05.849> one<00:03:06.299> side<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.840> paperclip<00:03:10.410> in

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
penny in one side and the paperclip in

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.520 
penny in one side and the paperclip in
the<00:03:10.889> other

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.229 

I'm<00:03:15.530> gonna<00:03:15.680> go<00:03:15.890> ahead<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.189> hook<00:03:16.310> up<00:03:16.549> my

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
I'm gonna go ahead and hook up my

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.649 
I'm gonna go ahead and hook up my
positive<00:03:17.780> lead<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.620> penny<00:03:22.239> my<00:03:23.239> negative

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
positive lead to the penny my negative

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.630 
positive lead to the penny my negative
lead<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.470> paperclip<00:03:27.189> this<00:03:28.189> gives<00:03:28.459> me<00:03:28.610> a

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
lead to the paperclip this gives me a

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.339 
lead to the paperclip this gives me a
potential<00:03:29.239> reading<00:03:29.599> of<00:03:29.720> point<00:03:30.079> zero<00:03:30.349> to<00:03:30.860> two

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
potential reading of point zero to two

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.600 
potential reading of point zero to two
so<00:03:33.349> that<00:03:33.500> was<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:33.799> little<00:03:34.040> bit<00:03:34.250> more<00:03:34.430> than

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
so that was this a little bit more than

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.399 
so that was this a little bit more than
the<00:03:34.700> lemon<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:36.739> we<00:03:37.010> can<00:03:37.310> in<00:03:37.640> fact<00:03:38.140> conduct<00:03:39.140> an

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
the lemon so we can in fact conduct an

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.289 
the lemon so we can in fact conduct an
electrical<00:03:40.010> current<00:03:40.220> or<00:03:40.549> get<00:03:40.730> an<00:03:40.849> electrical

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
electrical current or get an electrical

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.229 
electrical current or get an electrical
current<00:03:41.510> from<00:03:42.379> an<00:03:42.739> apple<00:03:44.079> and<00:03:45.079> testing<00:03:46.239> last

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
current from an apple and testing last

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.539 
current from an apple and testing last
I'm<00:03:47.810> going<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.319> try<00:03:48.620> with<00:03:49.129> the<00:03:49.489> onion<00:03:50.049> and<00:03:51.549> I'm

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
I'm going to try with the onion and I'm

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.369 
I'm going to try with the onion and I'm
going<00:03:52.819> to<00:03:52.970> just<00:03:53.239> make<00:03:53.420> two<00:03:53.720> holes<00:03:53.989> in<00:03:54.230> the

going to just make two holes in the
onion<00:03:58.959> try<00:03:59.959> not<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.290> cry<00:04:00.530> because<00:04:00.889> onions

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
onion try not to cry because onions

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.470 
onion try not to cry because onions
always<00:04:01.609> make<00:04:01.970> me<00:04:02.120> cry<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.650> this<00:04:04.519> one<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:05.180> have

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
always make me cry and this one I have

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.430 
always make me cry and this one I have
the<00:04:05.840> oldest<00:04:06.230> penny<00:04:06.470> is<00:04:06.680> from<00:04:06.950> 1978<00:04:07.819> and<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:09.200> read

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
the oldest penny is from 1978 and I read

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.229 
the oldest penny is from 1978 and I read
online<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:10.670> know<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:10.940> have<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.180> believe

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
online you know you have to believe

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.240 
online you know you have to believe
everything<00:04:11.510> on<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.049> internet<00:04:12.200> but<00:04:12.650> now<00:04:12.829> I<00:04:12.859> did

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
everything on the internet but now I did

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.210 
everything on the internet but now I did
read<00:04:13.489> that<00:04:13.519> if<00:04:14.030> there's<00:04:14.540> before<00:04:14.989> 1982<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:16.039> has

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
read that if there's before 1982 it has

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.960 
read that if there's before 1982 it has
more<00:04:16.430> copper<00:04:16.820> in<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:18.620> may<00:04:18.979> affect<00:04:19.729> the

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
more copper in it so that may affect the

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.990 
more copper in it so that may affect the
reading

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.450 

okay<00:04:25.780> I<00:04:25.810> got<00:04:26.170> my<00:04:26.880> two<00:04:27.880> metals<00:04:28.330> into<00:04:28.690> my<00:04:29.620> battery

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
okay I got my two metals into my battery

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.640 
okay I got my two metals into my battery
and<00:04:31.030> I'm<00:04:31.300> going<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.690> put<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.980> red<00:04:33.190> lead<00:04:34.650> and

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
and I'm going to put the red lead and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.629 
and I'm going to put the red lead and
the<00:04:36.010> black<00:04:36.250> lead<00:04:36.460> on

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:47.240 

and<00:04:40.120> this<00:04:40.360> gives<00:04:40.689> me<00:04:40.780> a<00:04:40.900> potential<00:04:41.800> reading<00:04:44.729> of

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
and this gives me a potential reading of

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.820 
and this gives me a potential reading of
0.92<00:04:48.250> -<00:04:49.259> so<00:04:50.259> in<00:04:50.409> fact<00:04:50.680> we<00:04:50.979> can<00:04:51.009> get<00:04:51.639> a

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
0.92 - so in fact we can get a

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.309 
0.92 - so in fact we can get a
electrical<00:04:53.830> charge<00:04:54.300> from<00:04:55.830> an<00:04:56.830> onion<00:04:57.930> an<00:04:58.930> onion

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
electrical charge from an onion an onion

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:05.459 
electrical charge from an onion an onion
will<00:05:00.129> make<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.310> battery<00:05:00.909> and<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:03.280> lemon<00:05:03.789> and<00:05:04.469> an

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
will make a battery and a lemon and an

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:16.909 
will make a battery and a lemon and an
apple<00:05:07.259> we'll<00:05:08.259> all<00:05:08.349> make<00:05:08.650> electrical<00:05:09.610> charges

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.399 

sorry<00:05:17.520> it<00:05:17.669> rolled<00:05:17.879> on<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.030> floor<00:05:18.389> okay<00:05:19.020> so<00:05:19.289> we

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
sorry it rolled on the floor okay so we

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:20.719 
sorry it rolled on the floor okay so we
have<00:05:19.620> all<00:05:19.650> three<00:05:20.039> of<00:05:20.189> those<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.550> will

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
have all three of those that will

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.270 
have all three of those that will
conduct<00:05:21.240> an<00:05:21.419> electrical<00:05:21.870> charge<00:05:22.080> based<00:05:22.949> on<00:05:23.129> my

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
conduct an electrical charge based on my

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.730 
conduct an electrical charge based on my
observations<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.419> Apple<00:05:24.870> actually<00:05:25.080> had<00:05:25.590> the

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
observations the Apple actually had the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.459 
observations the Apple actually had the
strongest<00:05:26.189> charge<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:27.389> lemon<00:05:27.750> was<00:05:27.960> second

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
strongest charge the lemon was second

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:32.570 
strongest charge the lemon was second
and<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:29.370> onion<00:05:29.789> was<00:05:29.969> third<00:05:30.270> and<00:05:31.009> I<00:05:32.009> wanted<00:05:32.430> to

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
and the onion was third and I wanted to

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.059 
and the onion was third and I wanted to
do<00:05:32.729> it<00:05:32.849> with<00:05:33.030> an<00:05:33.150> LED<00:05:33.330> light<00:05:33.810> but<00:05:34.409> I<00:05:34.710> did<00:05:34.919> not

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
do it with an LED light but I did not

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.730
