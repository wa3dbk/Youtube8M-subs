00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.990
 two 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.310
 food banks are formed 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.560
 citizen awareness businessmen 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.750
 dedicated to the food industry 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.180
 they become aware of the great contempt that 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.700
 exists in this country and on the other hand a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.200
 great need in that way the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.270
 first food bank in the city 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.480
 from guadalajara 20 years ago currently 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.960
 we have 66 affiliated food banks 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.449
 in this country they rescue more than 112,000 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.699
 tons of perishable food and not 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.100
 perishables that have served us for 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.770
 bring to the table of more than one million 200 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.400
 thousand people fresh food in 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.400
 opportunity 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.810
 the bank works through donations 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.830
 in places where it is no longer 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.360
 using the food because it is not 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.430
 marketable but if it is edible if 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.590
 is consumable by people some 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.350
 food could be because it is very 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 advanced its maturity state some other 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.220
 because its packaging could be damaged 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.920
 but the interior and the content of 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.350
 food is perfect every month in this 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.360

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.210
 the fruits and vegetables that are around 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.810

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.649
 everything that is behind me is 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.539
