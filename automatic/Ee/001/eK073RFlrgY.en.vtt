something<00:00:43.040> like<00:00:43.430> that

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.900 

okay<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.590> first<00:01:01.950> I<00:01:02.280> guess<00:01:02.460> we're<00:01:02.610> going<00:01:02.700> to<00:01:02.790> be

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
okay so first I guess we're going to be

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.939 
okay so first I guess we're going to be
working<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.300> these<00:01:03.600> two<00:01:04.050> front<00:01:04.470> sections

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
working with these two front sections

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
working with these two front sections
here<00:01:05.460> okay<00:01:06.390> then<00:01:06.660> we're<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> take<00:01:07.290> about

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
here okay then we're going to take about

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.640 
here okay then we're going to take about
a<00:01:07.680> half<00:01:07.800> inch<00:01:08.220> section<00:01:09.030> from<00:01:09.270> each<00:01:09.570> side<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
a half inch section from each side of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.180 
a half inch section from each side of
the<00:01:10.970> park

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.650

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
so once you've got your little section

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.880 
so once you've got your little section
here<00:01:21.690> you're<00:01:22.050> just<00:01:22.230> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.440> comb<00:01:22.620> his<00:01:22.830> hair

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.950 

then<00:02:11.350> with<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.770> pot<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.000> first<00:02:13.210> pie<00:02:13.420> section

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
be one lengths now so you're basically

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.830

just<00:02:18.100> going<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.550> call<00:02:18.760> most<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.360> over<00:02:19.660> to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
just going to call most of it over to

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.300 
just going to call most of it over to
the<00:02:19.930> other<00:02:20.110> side<00:02:20.470> but<00:02:20.740> you're<00:02:20.890> going<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.130> leave

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
a little piece and we're going to use

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.570 
a little piece and we're going to use
this<00:02:22.930> as<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.200> new<00:02:23.530> guide<00:02:23.770> we're<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.370> going

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
to create another pie shape starting

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:39.060

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
going to create a center part you're

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.830 
going to create a center part you're
going<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:24.790> create<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.060> little<00:03:25.390> bit<00:03:25.629> of<00:03:25.750> an

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
going to create a little bit of an

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.929 
going to create a little bit of an

you can see where my guide is and how

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.259 
you can see where my guide is and how
much<00:03:32.349> shorter<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.069> is<00:03:33.189> then<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.579> rest<00:03:33.730> of<00:03:34.000> my

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
much shorter it is then the rest of my

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.720 
much shorter it is then the rest of my

and I just basically put it in like a
ponytail<00:04:43.710> like<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:45.060> this<00:04:45.120> is<00:04:45.180> still<00:04:45.480> my

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
ponytail like this and this is still my

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.960 
ponytail like this and this is still my
guide<00:04:45.840> by<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.110> way<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.530> what<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.250> did<00:04:47.550> was<00:04:47.580> I

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
guide by the way and what I did was I

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.340 
guide by the way and what I did was I
just<00:04:48.210> kind<00:04:48.420> of<00:04:48.510> felt<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:51.450> top<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.320> now

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
just kind of felt the top of it and now

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.800 
just kind of felt the top of it and now
you're<00:04:52.650> just<00:04:52.680> going<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.040> try<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.280> do<00:04:53.730> a<00:04:54.150> PI

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
you're just going to try and do a PI

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.320 
you're just going to try and do a PI
section<00:04:55.410> like<00:04:55.650> this<00:04:56.060> hopefully<00:04:57.060> it'll<00:04:57.180> be

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
section like this hopefully it'll be

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.700 
section like this hopefully it'll be
easier

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
easier

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.190 
easier
and<00:05:00.480> then<00:05:01.480> you're<00:05:01.600> just<00:05:01.630> going<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.930> clip<00:05:02.080> the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
and then you're just going to clip the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.190 
and then you're just going to clip the
rest<00:05:02.380> of<00:05:02.500> your<00:05:02.590> hair<00:05:02.800> up<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:04.660> now<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:04.900> have

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
rest of your hair up so now you have

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.710 
rest of your hair up so now you have
your<00:05:05.230> one<00:05:05.710> section<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:06.700> then<00:05:07.360> this<00:05:07.540> is<00:05:07.690> the

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
your one section and then this is the

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.960 
your one section and then this is the
guide<00:05:08.020> so<00:05:08.890> I'm<00:05:09.040> just<00:05:09.220> going<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.490> take<00:05:09.760> the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
guide so I'm just going to take the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.550 
guide so I'm just going to take the
guide<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:10.420> put<00:05:10.600> it<00:05:10.690> with<00:05:10.780> this<00:05:10.960> section<00:05:11.440> and

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
guide and put it with this section and

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:23.420 
guide and put it with this section and
hopefully<00:05:12.100> this<00:05:12.280> method<00:05:12.700> will<00:05:12.880> work
