00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
size 15 needles and the pattern is super

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.490 
size 15 needles and the pattern is super
simple<00:02:38.730> i<00:02:38.970> bought<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.330> off<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.480> etsy<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.350> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
simple i bought it off of etsy and the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.230 
simple i bought it off of etsy and the
seller<00:02:40.740> was<00:02:40.980> great<00:02:41.280> i<00:02:41.310> would<00:02:41.550> recommend<00:02:42.000> her

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
seller was great i would recommend her

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.950 
seller was great i would recommend her
to<00:02:42.590> anybody<00:02:44.480> that's<00:02:45.480> what<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.660> looks<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:45.900> so

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
to anybody that's what it looks like so

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.660 
to anybody that's what it looks like so
far<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.530> should<00:02:46.680> be<00:02:46.740> done<00:02:46.770> pretty<00:02:47.370> quickly

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
far this should be done pretty quickly

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.700 
far this should be done pretty quickly
because<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:48.960> approximately

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
because it's just this for approximately

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.560 
because it's just this for approximately
nine<00:02:49.890> inches<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:51.120> i<00:02:51.150> really<00:02:51.240> don't<00:02:51.330> have<00:02:51.540> that

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
nine inches so i really don't have that

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.150 
nine inches so i really don't have that
much<00:02:51.870> longer<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.230> go<00:02:52.320> before<00:02:52.590> i<00:02:52.740> start<00:02:53.070> my

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
much longer to go before i start my

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.490 
much longer to go before i start my
decreasing<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.750> i<00:02:54.780> might<00:02:54.930> even<00:02:55.080> get<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.320> done

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
decreasing so i might even get this done

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.220 
decreasing so i might even get this done
tonight<00:02:55.820> we'll<00:02:56.820> see<00:02:57.000> that's<00:02:57.780> all<00:02:57.990> that<00:02:58.140> i<00:02:58.170> have
