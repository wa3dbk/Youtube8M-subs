00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 very popular topics now 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.930
 use smartphones instead of smart 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.540
 sports watches ie all information 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.340
 and I your impulse about your tracks 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.450
 about all your workouts recorded 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.130
 directly into the smartphone has been used 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.750
 certain offers and then in general 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.029
 then you share it or 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.570
 analyze your runs yourself 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.910
 however, despite the very large 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.529
 advantage of using smartphones in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.320
 training very often I see people 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.800
 running around and holding this very smartphone in 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.840
 hands this is the deepest mistake it is very 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.030
 wrong smartphone is heavy enough 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.040
 thing and in general even light things during 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.059
 run no need to hold 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.870
 it seriously upsets your 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.649
 running technique and adds asymmetry 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.030
 and so not to the ideal run of the majority 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.730
 lovers 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.420
 in the world do not hold the smartphone and in the hands 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.200
 using special bags for this 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.140
 the most popular topic now is 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.130
 of course the bags on the forearm for 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.920
 smartphones 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.560
 but in my opinion this is not the best way out 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.070
 provisions because the belt from this 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.430
 bag pulls 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.039
 muscle impairs the work of this muscle 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.500
 enslaves very strongly and of course 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.630
 worsens 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.549
 the bloodstream is all not the best way out 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.030
 provisions the best way out is 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:40.210
 good old belt bag but belt 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.190
 the bag should be flat exactly like that 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.289
 how do running brands that is it 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.830
 very flat bag where 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:51.179
 very clearly and enters the smartphone of course 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.360
 You can also put money and keys 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.479
 tightly tighten you on the belt and here 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.090
 such a way out 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.799
 minimally violates the technique 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.200
 running and practically does not interfere with you in 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.390
 running time 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.100
 used so big and enough 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.100
 heavy device like a smartphone
