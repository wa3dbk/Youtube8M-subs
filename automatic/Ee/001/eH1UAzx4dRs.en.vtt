hi<00:00:15.379> this<00:00:15.440> is<00:00:15.709> Kevin<00:00:16.099> for<00:00:16.250> pixlr.com

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
hi this is Kevin for pixlr.com

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.909 
hi this is Kevin for pixlr.com
what<00:00:17.930> I'm<00:00:18.020> going<00:00:18.169> to<00:00:18.230> do<00:00:18.320> in<00:00:18.410> this<00:00:18.470> video<00:00:18.619> is<00:00:18.770> to

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:18.919 
what I'm going to do in this video is to

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.950 
what I'm going to do in this video is to
demonstrate<00:00:19.009> the<00:00:19.460> technique<00:00:19.880> for<00:00:20.539> frequency

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
demonstrate the technique for frequency

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.070 
demonstrate the technique for frequency
separation<00:00:21.140> in<00:00:21.769> 8-bit<00:00:22.580> mode<00:00:22.849> so<00:00:23.570> first<00:00:23.929> of<00:00:24.050> all

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
separation in 8-bit mode so first of all

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.509 
separation in 8-bit mode so first of all
I'm<00:00:24.230> going<00:00:24.380> to<00:00:24.439> make<00:00:24.590> two<00:00:24.769> duplicates<00:00:25.099> of<00:00:25.429> the

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
I'm going to make two duplicates of the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.700 
I'm going to make two duplicates of the
original<00:00:26.119> layer<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:26.900> hold<00:00:27.050> down<00:00:27.199> ctrl<00:00:27.560> or

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
original layer and hold down ctrl or

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.529 
original layer and hold down ctrl or
command<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.279> press<00:00:28.699> down<00:00:28.880> J<00:00:29.119> a<00:00:29.150> couple<00:00:29.449> of

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
command and press down J a couple of

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.269 
command and press down J a couple of
times<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:30.289> second<00:00:30.650> layer<00:00:30.800> I'm<00:00:30.980> going<00:00:31.099> to<00:00:31.160> call

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
times the second layer I'm going to call

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.310 
times the second layer I'm going to call
low<00:00:31.580> low<00:00:32.180> frequency<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:34.900> the<00:00:35.900> upper<00:00:36.170> layer

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
low low frequency and the upper layer

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.060 
low low frequency and the upper layer
I'm<00:00:36.440> going<00:00:36.650> to<00:00:36.710> call<00:00:36.860> high<00:00:37.280> frequency<00:00:39.070> now

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
I'm going to call high frequency now

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.740 
I'm going to call high frequency now
what<00:00:40.580> I'm<00:00:40.670> going<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:40.850> just<00:00:40.970> do<00:00:41.120> it<00:00:41.150> to<00:00:41.570> go<00:00:41.690> to

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
what I'm going to just do it to go to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.270 
what I'm going to just do it to go to
the<00:00:41.930> low<00:00:42.049> frequency<00:00:42.530> layer<00:00:42.710> I'm<00:00:42.949> going<00:00:43.100> to<00:00:43.159> go

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
the low frequency layer I'm going to go

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.670 
the low frequency layer I'm going to go
to<00:00:43.339> the<00:00:43.489> filter<00:00:43.729> which<00:00:44.659> is<00:00:44.690> blur<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.470> I<00:00:45.559> choose

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
to the filter which is blur and I choose

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.350 
to the filter which is blur and I choose
Gaussian<00:00:45.890> blur<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:46.580> I'm<00:00:46.970> going<00:00:47.119> to<00:00:47.180> apply<00:00:47.269> a

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
Gaussian blur and I'm going to apply a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.229 
Gaussian blur and I'm going to apply a
blur<00:00:47.629> whatever<00:00:48.559> it<00:00:48.739> might<00:00:49.070> be<00:00:49.339> 10<00:00:49.729> pixels<00:00:50.119> in

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
blur whatever it might be 10 pixels in

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.990 
blur whatever it might be 10 pixels in
this<00:00:50.360> case<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.309> next<00:00:52.309> I'm<00:00:52.489> going<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.760> go<00:00:52.940> to

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
this case and next I'm going to go to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.670 
this case and next I'm going to go to
the<00:00:53.180> high<00:00:53.330> frequency<00:00:53.839> layer<00:00:54.049> switch<00:00:54.440> that<00:00:54.619> on

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
the high frequency layer switch that on

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.359 
the high frequency layer switch that on
then<00:00:55.460> go<00:00:55.580> to<00:00:55.640> image<00:00:56.439> will<00:00:57.439> go<00:00:57.619> to<00:00:57.680> apply<00:00:58.070> image

00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:58.369 
then go to image will go to apply image

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.439 
then go to image will go to apply image
and<00:00:59.140> the<00:01:00.140> settings<00:01:00.589> for<00:01:00.739> this<00:01:00.949> are<00:01:01.220> as<00:01:01.699> follows

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
and the settings for this are as follows

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.679 
and the settings for this are as follows
I'm<00:01:02.930> going<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:03.199> choose<00:01:03.470> glare<00:01:04.369> low<00:01:04.970> frequency

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
I'm going to choose glare low frequency

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.099 
I'm going to choose glare low frequency
I'm<00:01:06.350> going<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:06.979> choose<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.790> mode<00:01:08.180> as<00:01:08.479> subtract

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
I'm going to choose the mode as subtract

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.310 
I'm going to choose the mode as subtract
and<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.429> scale<00:01:10.729> is<00:01:10.759> going<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.090> be<00:01:11.179> too<00:01:11.509> the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
and the scale is going to be too the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.770 
and the scale is going to be too the
offset<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:12.770> going<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.039> be<00:01:13.130> 1<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.490> 8<00:01:13.729> then<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.659> will

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
offset is going to be 1 to 8 then I will

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.859 
offset is going to be 1 to 8 then I will
hit<00:01:14.960> OK<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.619> I'm<00:01:16.460> going<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.820> put<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.570> high

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
hit OK and I'm going to put the high

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.310 
hit OK and I'm going to put the high
frequency<00:01:18.350> layer<00:01:18.500> on<00:01:18.770> linear<00:01:19.310> light<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.320> that

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
frequency layer on linear light and that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.560 
frequency layer on linear light and that
should<00:01:21.530> give<00:01:21.740> us<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:22.130> very<00:01:22.579> good<00:01:22.700> replication

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
should give us a very good replication

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.410 
should give us a very good replication
of<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.590> original<00:01:24.979> image<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:25.909> that's<00:01:26.179> the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
of the original image so that's the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.840 
of the original image so that's the
technique<00:01:26.810> in<00:01:27.140> 8-bit<00:01:27.380> mode<00:01:27.859> if<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.609> want<00:01:28.789> to

know<00:01:28.969> more<00:01:29.210> about<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:29.630> technique<00:01:30.109> then

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
know more about this technique then

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.919 
know more about this technique then
please<00:01:30.710> watch<00:01:30.859> the<00:01:31.100> 16-bit<00:01:31.609> mode<00:01:32.060> video<00:01:32.479> that

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929
