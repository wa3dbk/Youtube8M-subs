00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
go ahead and do that and then the

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.830 
go ahead and do that and then the
secondary<00:02:10.070> weapon<00:02:10.490> I<00:02:10.700> don't<00:02:11.270> have<00:02:11.360> very<00:02:11.540> many

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
secondary weapon I don't have very many

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
almond playing some domination so let's

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.590 
almond playing some domination so let's
go<00:02:47.660> ahead<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.840> see<00:02:47.989> how<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:48.440> thing<00:02:48.650> perform

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
go ahead and see how this thing perform

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.210 
go ahead and see how this thing perform
um<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.660> feel<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.380> it's<00:02:51.530> gonna<00:02:51.650> have<00:02:51.860> quite<00:02:52.190> a

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
um I feel like it's gonna have quite a

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.030 
um I feel like it's gonna have quite a
bit<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.459> recoil<00:02:52.880> because<00:02:53.470> we<00:02:54.470> are<00:02:54.590> using<00:02:57.040> we're

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
bit of recoil because we are using we're

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.720 
bit of recoil because we are using we're
using<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.910> UH<00:02:58.940> nursing<00:02:59.030> rail<00:02:59.480> with<00:02:59.720> an<00:02:59.840> empty

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
using the UH nursing rail with an empty

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.400 
using the UH nursing rail with an empty
so<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.940> might<00:03:02.090> have<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.390> little<00:03:02.750> bit<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:02.959> recoil

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
so it might have a little bit of recoil

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.320 
so it might have a little bit of recoil
prepared<00:03:04.340> if<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.489> using<00:03:04.910> like<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.060> named

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
to using them for city with my grip so I

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.210 
to using them for city with my grip so I
use<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.450> 320<00:04:02.170> is<00:04:02.260> a<00:04:02.290> little<00:04:02.650> different<00:04:02.980> for

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
use that 320 is a little different for

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:19.510 
use that 320 is a little different for
me<00:04:07.319> you'll<00:04:08.319> be<00:04:08.440> on<00:04:08.530> target

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.460 

alright<00:04:20.520> yeah<00:04:20.670> so<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:22.440> handles<00:04:23.220> very<00:04:23.310> well

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
alright yeah so it handles very well

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.640 
alright yeah so it handles very well
considering

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
considering

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.450 
considering
I've<00:04:26.979> probably<00:04:27.250> said<00:04:27.550> that<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.790> live<00:04:29.370> 20<00:04:32.460> your

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
I've probably said that I live 20 your

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.910 
I've probably said that I live 20 your
overall<00:04:34.000> accurate

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.270 

but<00:04:38.060> overall<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.330> does<00:04:39.480> handle<00:04:39.750> really<00:04:39.930> well

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
but overall it does handle really well

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.150 
but overall it does handle really well
