look a little bit better I'm going to
choose<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.030> realistic<00:02:00.990> option<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
choose the realistic option in here and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
choose the realistic option in here and
you<00:02:02.250> will<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> pod<00:02:03.060> immediately<00:02:03.240> that

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
you will see on the pod immediately that

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.929 
you will see on the pod immediately that
it<00:02:03.960> kind<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.290> changes<00:02:04.920> makes<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.729> power

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
it kind of like changes makes a power

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.540 
it kind of like changes makes a power
look<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.329> little<00:02:06.479> bit<00:02:06.659> more<00:02:06.810> real<00:02:07.110> now<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
look a little bit more real now we can

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.270 
look a little bit more real now we can
also<00:02:08.700> go<00:02:08.940> into<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.450> shadow<00:02:09.950> option<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.069> here

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
also go into this shadow option in here

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.980 
also go into this shadow option in here
and<00:02:11.370> there's<00:02:11.520> some<00:02:11.640> different<00:02:11.940> options

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
and there's some different options

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.400 
and there's some different options
in<00:02:13.080> here<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.650> could<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.310> example<00:02:14.340> turn<00:02:14.940> on

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
in here I could for example turn on

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.230 
in here I could for example turn on
something<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.950> ground<00:02:17.310> shadows<00:02:17.910> and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
something like the ground shadows and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.970 
something like the ground shadows and
soon<00:02:18.840> as<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.020> do<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.620> will<00:02:19.710> see<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
soon as I do that you will see on the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.610 
soon as I do that you will see on the
screen<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.760> get<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.000> shadows<00:02:21.570> there<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.110> that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
screen we get the shadows there and that

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.860 
screen we get the shadows there and that
looks<00:02:22.800> really<00:02:23.070> cool<00:02:23.400> now<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.540> makes<00:02:24.690> me

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
looks really cool now that makes me

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.810 
looks really cool now that makes me
think<00:02:25.110> about<00:02:25.230> one<00:02:25.590> thing<00:02:25.920> though<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.550> haven't

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.730 
think about one thing though I haven't
really<00:02:27.120> thought<00:02:27.270> about<00:02:27.540> how<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.200> want<00:02:28.650> to

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740

bottom up here in the queue tab I can

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.710 
bottom up here in the queue tab I can
actually<00:02:49.800> right<00:02:50.460> click<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.180> can<00:02:51.210> go<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.630> and

actually right click and I can go in and
I<00:02:51.780> can<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:51.960> flip<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.680> around<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.340> now<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.490> have

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
I can just flip it around so now I have

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.000 
I can just flip it around so now I have
the<00:02:53.850> top<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.420> as<00:02:55.020> soon<00:02:55.110> as<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.620> hey

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
the top and as soon as I do that hey

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.580 
the top and as soon as I do that hey
there's<00:02:56.550> our<00:02:56.790> shadows<00:02:57.330> right<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:58.230> that's<00:02:58.470> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
there's our shadows right so that's a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.200 
there's our shadows right so that's a
little<00:02:58.830> trick<00:02:59.190> how<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.490> can<00:02:59.760> move<00:02:59.940> things

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
little trick how you can move things

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.260 
little trick how you can move things
around<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.200> get<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> right<00:03:01.740> shadows<00:03:02.270> we

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
around so you get the right shadows we

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.060 
around so you get the right shadows we
can<00:03:03.420> also<00:03:03.570> go<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.020> turn<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.440> objects

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
can also go in and turn on the objects

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.800 
can also go in and turn on the objects
shadows<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.460> means<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.090> like<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:06.420> around

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
shadows that means that like to around

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.600 
shadows that means that like to around
the<00:03:06.900> holes<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.470> now<00:03:07.620> get<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.950> right<00:03:08.100> shadows

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the holes you now get the right shadows

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.790 
the holes you now get the right shadows
and<00:03:08.820> then<00:03:09.090> we<00:03:09.210> have<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:09.570> cool<00:03:09.900> ambience

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
and then we have this cool ambience

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.000 
and then we have this cool ambience
shadow<00:03:11.100> but<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.880> really<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:13.010> photorealistic

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
shadow but is really a photorealistic

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.960 
shadow but is really a photorealistic
shadow<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:16.110> will<00:03:16.620> kind<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.460> like<00:03:17.640> make<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
shadow that will kind of like make the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.240 
shadow that will kind of like make the
counterbore<00:03:18.480> looks<00:03:18.810> good<00:03:19.050> we<00:03:19.680> can<00:03:19.830> also<00:03:19.980> turn

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
counterbore looks good we can also turn

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.370 
counterbore looks good we can also turn
on<00:03:20.310> things<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.120> reflection<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.050> floor

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
on things like reflection and the floor

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.050 
on things like reflection and the floor
so<00:03:22.830> now<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.100> almost<00:03:23.220> looks<00:03:23.520> like<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:23.820> sitting

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
so now it almost looks like it's sitting

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.430 
so now it almost looks like it's sitting
on<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.210> like<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.420> glass<00:03:24.810> table<00:03:25.170> or<00:03:25.410> something

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
on the like a glass table or something

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.280 
on the like a glass table or something
like<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.510> now<00:03:27.510> another<00:03:27.810> thing<00:03:27.960> I<00:03:28.140> want<00:03:28.260> to

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
like that now another thing I want to

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.610 
like that now another thing I want to
point<00:03:28.350> out<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.520> view<00:03:29.960> here<00:03:30.960> so<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.500> go

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
point out is the view here so you can go

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.590 
point out is the view here so you can go
into<00:03:31.740> orthographic<00:03:32.400> view<00:03:32.790> what<00:03:33.300> is<00:03:33.390> what<00:03:33.510> we

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
into orthographic view what is what we

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.150 
into orthographic view what is what we
normally<00:03:33.810> modeling<00:03:34.530> it's<00:03:34.710> almost<00:03:34.890> like<00:03:35.040> if

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
normally modeling it's almost like if

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.430 
normally modeling it's almost like if
you<00:03:35.280> just<00:03:35.430> hit<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:35.880> paper<00:03:36.150> very<00:03:36.570> straight

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
you just hit it on paper very straight

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.900 
you just hit it on paper very straight
lines<00:03:37.770> but<00:03:38.100> if<00:03:38.220> you're<00:03:38.340> switching<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.820> over

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
lines but if you're switching it over

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.870 
lines but if you're switching it over
the<00:03:39.120> perspective<00:03:39.930> we<00:03:40.590> get<00:03:40.800> that<00:03:40.980> real<00:03:41.340> look<00:03:41.700> on

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
the perspective we get that real look on

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.260 
the perspective we get that real look on
our<00:03:42.000> part<00:03:42.330> right<00:03:42.920> now<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:43.950> talked<00:03:44.400> before<00:03:44.670> about

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
our part right now I talked before about

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.650 
our part right now I talked before about
the<00:03:46.050> environments<00:03:47.040> with<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.250> two<00:03:47.460> lights<00:03:47.790> so

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
the environments with the two lights so

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.110 
the environments with the two lights so
what<00:03:48.990> this<00:03:49.170> means<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:49.860> our<00:03:50.610> part<00:03:51.000> is

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
what this means is that our part is

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.330 
what this means is that our part is
actually<00:03:51.240> living<00:03:51.660> inside<00:03:52.080> of<00:03:52.140> this

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
actually living inside of this

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.430 
actually living inside of this
environment<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.720> right<00:03:54.720> now<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.020> like<00:03:55.170> two

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
environment and right now is like two

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.470 
environment and right now is like two
lights<00:03:55.740> hanging<00:03:56.070> down<00:03:56.370> from<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.730> ceiling<00:03:56.850> but

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
lights hanging down from the ceiling but

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.200 
lights hanging down from the ceiling but
if<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.690> switch<00:03:57.960> over<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.290> something<00:03:58.740> like<00:03:58.890> well

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
if I switch over to something like well

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.030 
if I switch over to something like well
stood<00:04:00.210> got<00:04:00.480> courtyard<00:04:01.110> rights<00:04:01.440> nothing<00:04:01.860> like

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
stood got courtyard rights nothing like

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.550 
stood got courtyard rights nothing like
good<00:04:02.520> old<00:04:02.610> Germany<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.360> if<00:04:03.870> i<00:04:03.990> zoom<00:04:04.020> out<00:04:04.500> a

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
good old Germany and if i zoom out a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.070 
good old Germany and if i zoom out a
little<00:04:04.740> you<00:04:05.160> will<00:04:05.520> see<00:04:05.850> that<00:04:06.300> my<00:04:06.570> part<00:04:06.900> is

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
little you will see that my part is

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.670 
little you will see that my part is
actually<00:04:07.260> sitting<00:04:07.800> inside<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.460> well<00:04:09.300> this

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
actually sitting inside of well this

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.870 
actually sitting inside of well this
courtyard<00:04:10.700> environment<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.860> you<00:04:13.860> know<00:04:14.010> if<00:04:14.490> i

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
courtyard environment and you know if i

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.599 
courtyard environment and you know if i
zoom<00:04:14.910> back<00:04:15.150> in<00:04:15.570> you<00:04:16.530> will<00:04:16.709> see<00:04:16.980> that<00:04:17.250> on<00:04:17.459> the

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
zoom back in you will see that on the

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.560 
zoom back in you will see that on the
pad<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.359> almost<00:04:19.070> reflecting<00:04:20.270> on<00:04:21.270> its

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
pad is almost reflecting on its

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.750 
pad is almost reflecting on its
reflecting<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.140> environment<00:04:22.770> on<00:04:22.950> our<00:04:23.400> part

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
reflecting that environment on our part

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.660 
reflecting that environment on our part
itself<00:04:24.260> gives<00:04:25.260> me<00:04:25.440> almost<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.890> feeling<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.340> a

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
itself gives me almost a feeling of a

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.880 
itself gives me almost a feeling of a
hope<00:04:26.820> offense<00:04:27.240> or<00:04:27.390> something<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.560> that<00:04:28.740> is

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
hope offense or something and that is

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.890 
hope offense or something and that is
really<00:04:29.070> can<00:04:29.850> really<00:04:30.120> look<00:04:30.270> good<00:04:30.420> on<00:04:30.540> your<00:04:30.660> part

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
really can really look good on your part

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.080 
really can really look good on your part
now<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:31.410> course<00:04:31.650> maybe<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.370> don't<00:04:32.490> I've<00:04:32.880> already

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
now of course maybe I don't I've already

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.000 
now of course maybe I don't I've already
selected<00:04:33.420> my<00:04:33.630> background<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.260> don't<00:04:34.530> want<00:04:34.770> that

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
selected my background I don't want that

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.360 
selected my background I don't want that
environment<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:37.530> show<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.950> background

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
environment to to show in the background

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.770 
environment to to show in the background
you<00:04:38.460> can<00:04:38.610> actually<00:04:38.880> go<00:04:39.000> into<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.390> settings

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
you can actually go into the settings

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.350 
you can actually go into the settings
tab<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.590> if<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.860> toggle<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.460> displays<00:04:41.970> seen

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360

tab and if you toggle this displays seen
image<00:04:42.930> then<00:04:43.830> hey<00:04:44.100> then<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.850> back<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.210> your

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
image then hey then you back to your

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.390 
image then hey then you back to your
good<00:04:45.480> old<00:04:45.570> background<00:04:46.140> but<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.590> reflection

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
good old background but the reflection

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.630 
good old background but the reflection
of<00:04:47.580> that<00:04:48.200> environment<00:04:49.200> of<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.860> courtyard<00:04:50.430> is

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
of that environment of the courtyard is

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.970 
of that environment of the courtyard is
still<00:04:50.910> in<00:04:51.030> our<00:04:51.150> part<00:04:51.540> now<00:04:52.350> of<00:04:52.500> course<00:04:52.560> as<00:04:52.890> you

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
still in our part now of course as you

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.920 
still in our part now of course as you
can<00:04:53.160> see<00:04:53.400> there's<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.940> lot<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.120> options<00:04:54.570> in<00:04:54.660> here

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
can see there's a lot of options in here

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.500 
can see there's a lot of options in here
and<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.530> can<00:04:55.710> play<00:04:56.040> around<00:04:56.160> with<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:56.640> you

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
and you can play around with this you

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.750 
and you can play around with this you
know<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:58.470> will<00:04:58.620> see<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:58.980> things<00:04:59.220> updates

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
know you will see the things updates

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.250 
know you will see the things updates
right<00:05:00.030> away<00:05:00.390> when<00:05:00.690> i<00:05:00.720> play<00:05:00.990> with<00:05:01.170> the

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
right away when i play with the

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.080 
right away when i play with the
brightness<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:01.950> things<00:05:02.130> like<00:05:02.310> that<00:05:02.370> so<00:05:03.030> you

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
brightness and things like that so you

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.640 
brightness and things like that so you
can<00:05:03.210> definitely<00:05:03.420> just<00:05:03.810> that<00:05:03.960> if<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.170> want<00:05:04.380> to

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
can definitely just that if you want to

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.250 
can definitely just that if you want to
but<00:05:05.280> already<00:05:05.670> now<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:06.270> think<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:06.930> part

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
but already now I think that the part

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.900 
but already now I think that the part
looks<00:05:07.530> pretty<00:05:07.890> good<00:05:08.100> right<00:05:08.160> i<00:05:08.460> mean<00:05:08.640> it's

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
looks pretty good right i mean it's
