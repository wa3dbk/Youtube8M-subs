it's kind of nice you can open this up

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.859 
it's kind of nice you can open this up
and<00:00:08.930> see<00:00:09.930> the<00:00:10.080> actual<00:00:10.350> hip<00:00:10.620> joint<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.809> so<00:00:12.809> if

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:12.869 
and see the actual hip joint and so if

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.369 
and see the actual hip joint and so if
we<00:00:12.959> take<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.170> out<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.559> there<00:00:15.230> this<00:00:16.230> is

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
we take that out of there this is

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.900 
we take that out of there this is
basically<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.860> hip<00:00:17.100> joint<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.400> got<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.670> big

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
basically a hip joint we got this big

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.779 
basically a hip joint we got this big
ball<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.009> neck<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.519> then<00:00:20.670> this

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
ball and this is the neck and then this

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.839 
ball and this is the neck and then this
is<00:00:20.849> the<00:00:21.060> femur<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.869> your<00:00:21.990> big<00:00:22.140> leg<00:00:22.380> bone

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
is the femur this is your big leg bone

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.259 
is the femur this is your big leg bone
so<00:00:23.849> flight<00:00:24.089> snap<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.720> ball<00:00:24.929> right<00:00:25.199> off<00:00:25.259> and

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
so flight snap that ball right off and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.189 
so flight snap that ball right off and
when<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.300> big<00:00:27.509> problems<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:28.019> this

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
when the big problems with this

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.859 
when the big problems with this
avascular<00:00:28.650> necrosis<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.789> osteonecrosis<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.230 
avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis is
all<00:00:31.410> those<00:00:31.589> blood<00:00:31.919> vessels<00:00:32.060> funnel<00:00:33.060> through

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
all those blood vessels funnel through

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.880 
all those blood vessels funnel through
that<00:00:33.450> little<00:00:33.600> channel<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.410> big<00:00:34.650> ball

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
that little channel to this big ball

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250 
that little channel to this big ball
well<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.030> sever<00:00:36.300> them<00:00:36.570> first<00:00:36.840> off<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
well if you sever them first off it's a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.350 
well if you sever them first off it's a
high<00:00:37.500> impact<00:00:37.949> energy<00:00:38.250> does<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.699> lot<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> damage

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
high impact energy does a lot of damage

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.689 
high impact energy does a lot of damage
you<00:00:39.809> basically<00:00:40.530> sever<00:00:41.010> all<00:00:41.250> those<00:00:41.460> blood

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
you basically sever all those blood

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.819 
you basically sever all those blood
vessels<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> body<00:00:43.230> has<00:00:43.410> got<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> try

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
vessels and now the body has got to try

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.410 
vessels and now the body has got to try
to<00:00:43.859> heal<00:00:44.129> all<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.520> back<00:00:44.730> together<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
to heal all that back together and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.779 
to heal all that back together and
unfortunately<00:00:46.109> when<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> snap<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.609> whole

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
unfortunately when you snap the whole

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.939 
unfortunately when you snap the whole
ball<00:00:48.000> off<00:00:48.269> there's<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.690> high<00:00:48.840> risk<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.920> know

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
ball off there's a high risk of you know

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.099 
ball off there's a high risk of you know
not<00:00:50.489> getting<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.000> full<00:00:51.239> blood<00:00:51.539> supply<00:00:51.870> back

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
not getting the full blood supply back

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.439 
not getting the full blood supply back
to<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.340> happens<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.300> is

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
to it and then what happens and this is

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.729 
to it and then what happens and this is
what's<00:00:54.629> happened<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:54.989> Floyd<00:00:55.170> case<00:00:55.440> some<00:00:55.710> of

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
what's happened in Floyd case some of

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.069 
what's happened in Floyd case some of
the<00:00:55.920> ball<00:00:56.100> dies<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.699> his<00:00:56.820> case<00:00:57.120> quite<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> bit

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the ball dies in his case quite a bit

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.869 
the ball dies in his case quite a bit
it's<00:00:58.199> almost<00:00:58.379> half<00:00:58.679> of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> whole<00:00:59.250> ball<00:00:59.519> is

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it's almost half of the whole ball is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's almost half of the whole ball is
now<00:01:00.449> dead<00:01:00.839> and<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.190> becomes

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
now dead and then it just becomes

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.950 
now dead and then it just becomes
instead<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.059> being<00:01:03.210> nice<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.390> smooth<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
instead of being nice and smooth and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.690 
instead of being nice and smooth and
round<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:04.830> irregular<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.550> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
round now it's really irregular and that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.360 
round now it's really irregular and that
just<00:01:05.940> wears<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.110> grinds<00:01:07.410> in<00:01:07.740> there<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.190> kind

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
just wears and grinds in there it's kind

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.700 
just wears and grinds in there it's kind
of<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.580> sandpaper<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:10.170> time<00:01:10.470> goes

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
of like sandpaper now and as time goes

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.110 
of like sandpaper now and as time goes
on<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.100> whole<00:01:11.220> thing<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.910> wears

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
on the whole thing just kind of wears

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.360 
on the whole thing just kind of wears
down<00:01:12.420> falls<00:01:13.050> apart<00:01:13.200> creates<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> lot<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.070> pain

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
down falls apart creates a lot of pain

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:33.560 
down falls apart creates a lot of pain
and<00:01:14.700> disability

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.770 

so<00:01:34.570> this<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.259> my<00:01:36.189> shoulder<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.270> now<00:01:37.720> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
so this is a my shoulder and now the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.230 
so this is a my shoulder and now the
ball<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.049> completely<00:01:38.710> gone<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.640> kids<00:01:40.000> set

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
ball is completely gone so the kids set

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.789 
ball is completely gone so the kids set
that<00:01:40.420> as<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.720> desktop<00:01:41.049> that's<00:01:41.380> pretty<00:01:41.619> much

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
that as the desktop that's pretty much

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.149 
that as the desktop that's pretty much
that's<00:01:42.220> funny<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.840> had<00:01:44.080> this<00:01:44.200> same<00:01:44.890> type

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
that's funny so you had this same type

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.060 
that's funny so you had this same type
of<00:01:45.330> problem<00:01:46.330> but<00:01:46.630> with<00:01:46.780> your<00:01:46.930> shoulder<00:01:47.320> yeah

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
of problem but with your shoulder yeah

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.249 
of problem but with your shoulder yeah
so<00:01:48.280> this<00:01:48.430> problem<00:01:48.939> typically<00:01:49.360> occurs<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:50.229> the

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
so this problem typically occurs in the

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.219 
so this problem typically occurs in the
hip<00:01:51.040> joint<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.520> shoulder<00:01:51.880> joint<00:01:52.229> mainly

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
hip joint in the shoulder joint mainly

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.350 
hip joint in the shoulder joint mainly
because<00:01:53.409> both<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:53.860> them<00:01:54.070> have<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:54.759> big<00:01:55.119> ball

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
because both of them have that big ball

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.330 
because both of them have that big ball
and<00:01:55.690> this<00:01:55.840> little<00:01:56.020> stock<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:56.649> feeds<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.130> and

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
and this little stock that feeds it and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.609 
and this little stock that feeds it and
when<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:57.700> sever<00:01:58.030> that<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.690> got<00:01:58.869> problems<00:02:01.619> and

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
when you sever that you got problems and

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.249 
when you sever that you got problems and
then<00:02:03.190> when<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.700> replace<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.420> thatís

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
then when you replace it you thatís

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.309 
then when you replace it you thatís
becomes<00:02:05.649> a<00:02:05.710> stainless<00:02:06.130> steel<00:02:06.159> ball<00:02:07.110> yeah<00:02:08.110> so

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
becomes a stainless steel ball yeah so

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.930 
becomes a stainless steel ball yeah so
the<00:02:08.530> main<00:02:08.709> two<00:02:09.009> types<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.459> surgeries<00:02:09.700> are<00:02:11.940> kind

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
the main two types of surgeries are kind

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.990 
the main two types of surgeries are kind
of<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.930> hip<00:02:14.200> resurfacing<00:02:14.400> surgery<00:02:15.400> they

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
of this hip resurfacing surgery they

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000 
of this hip resurfacing surgery they
shave<00:02:16.300> this<00:02:16.480> down<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> bit<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.140> they<00:02:17.230> kind<00:02:17.890> of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
shave this down a bit and they kind of

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.160 
shave this down a bit and they kind of
press<00:02:18.220> fit<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> cap<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.510> standard<00:02:19.989> one

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
press fit a cap on it the standard one

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.410 
press fit a cap on it the standard one
is<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:20.470> will<00:02:20.590> cut<00:02:20.769> that<00:02:20.920> whole<00:02:21.190> part<00:02:21.459> off<00:02:21.730> and

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
is that will cut that whole part off and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.690 
is that will cut that whole part off and
then<00:02:22.569> they<00:02:22.690> nail<00:02:22.900> down<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.170> spike<00:02:23.739> with<00:02:24.370> another

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
then they nail down a spike with another

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.300 
then they nail down a spike with another
ball<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:24.970> sticks<00:02:25.510> up<00:02:25.690> there<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.890> kind<00:02:27.250> of

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
ball that sticks up there and kind of

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.090 
ball that sticks up there and kind of
replaces<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.030> that's<00:02:28.269> that's<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.690> standard

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
replaces it that's that's the standard

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.630 
replaces it that's that's the standard
people<00:02:30.100> do<00:02:30.280> real<00:02:30.459> well<00:02:30.670> with<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:32.459> but<00:02:33.459> yeah

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
people do real well with that but yeah

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.210 
people do real well with that but yeah
so<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.480> know<00:02:34.600> that's<00:02:34.780> that's<00:02:35.440> my<00:02:35.620> shoulder

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
so you know that's that's my shoulder

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.830 
so you know that's that's my shoulder
it's<00:02:36.370> not<00:02:36.519> too<00:02:36.730> much<00:02:36.880> unlike<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.420> hip<00:02:37.600> you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
it's not too much unlike the hip you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.650 
it's not too much unlike the hip you
typically<00:02:38.320> have<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.680> nice<00:02:39.340> round<00:02:39.670> ball<00:02:39.940> and

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
typically have this nice round ball and

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.720 
typically have this nice round ball and
as<00:02:40.959> time<00:02:41.170> gone<00:02:41.410> has<00:02:41.739> gone<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.370> ball<00:02:42.549> is

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
as time gone has gone on that ball is

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.210 
as time gone has gone on that ball is
just<00:02:42.880> flattened<00:02:43.450> out<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:44.769> almost<00:02:45.010> just

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
just flattened out and it's almost just

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.150 
just flattened out and it's almost just
like<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.400> stick<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:46.600> know<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.799> look<00:02:47.920> at<00:02:48.070> it

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
like a stick you know if you look at it

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160 
like a stick you know if you look at it
from<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.549> top<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.390> know<00:02:49.510> there's<00:02:49.840> no<00:02:49.959> more

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
from the top you know there's no more

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.120 
from the top you know there's no more
ball<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:55.079> so<00:02:56.079> the<00:02:56.200> nice<00:02:56.350> smooth<00:02:56.650> ball<00:02:56.920> is

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
ball to it so the nice smooth ball is

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.009 
ball to it so the nice smooth ball is
now<00:02:57.310> just<00:02:57.579> flattened<00:02:58.269> now<00:02:58.420> there's<00:02:58.750> all<00:02:58.870> these

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
now just flattened now there's all these

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.020 
now just flattened now there's all these
bone<00:02:59.290> spurs<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.950> that's<00:03:00.100> all<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.430> arthritis

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
bone spurs and that's all the arthritis

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.400 
bone spurs and that's all the arthritis
is<00:03:01.209> just<00:03:01.450> kind<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.140> mess<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:04.390> then<00:03:05.109> here's

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
is just kind of a mess and then here's

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.620 
is just kind of a mess and then here's
Floyd's<00:03:07.049> original<00:03:09.120> fracture<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:10.269> you<00:03:10.359> can<00:03:10.480> see

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
Floyd's original fracture so you can see

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.900 
Floyd's original fracture so you can see
right<00:03:10.660> through<00:03:11.230> there<00:03:11.530> he<00:03:11.950> snapped<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.700> ball

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
right through there he snapped the ball

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:21.290 
right through there he snapped the ball
off

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.240 

here's<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.450> nice<00:03:22.870> comparison<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:23.830> here's<00:03:24.040> the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
here's a nice comparison so here's the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.970 
here's a nice comparison so here's the
normal<00:03:24.610> ball<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:26.080> now<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.260> can<00:03:26.440> see<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.800> one

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
normal ball and now you can see this one

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.309 
normal ball and now you can see this one
is<00:03:27.099> just<00:03:27.130> snapped<00:03:27.580> off<00:03:27.849> and<00:03:28.180> see<00:03:28.870> typically

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
is just snapped off and see typically

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.990 
is just snapped off and see typically
that<00:03:29.440> was<00:03:29.590> set<00:03:29.830> up<00:03:29.950> higher<00:03:30.220> see<00:03:30.550> this<00:03:30.700> stick

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
that was set up higher see this stick

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.280 
that was set up higher see this stick
straight<00:03:31.300> up<00:03:31.450> like<00:03:31.599> an<00:03:31.750> ice<00:03:31.870> cream<00:03:32.080> cone

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
straight up like an ice cream cone

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.850 
straight up like an ice cream cone
definitely<00:03:32.830> lower<00:03:33.040> yeah<00:03:37.080> here<00:03:38.080> are<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.500> pins

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
definitely lower yeah here are the pins

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.309 
definitely lower yeah here are the pins
going<00:03:39.430> up<00:03:39.610> into<00:03:40.090> here's<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.599> ball<00:03:40.810> it's<00:03:41.170> just

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
going up into here's the ball it's just

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.690 
going up into here's the ball it's just
a<00:03:41.410> faint<00:03:41.650> outline<00:03:42.069> that<00:03:42.340> they're<00:03:42.550> doing

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
a faint outline that they're doing

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.570 
a faint outline that they're doing
during<00:03:43.090> 30<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:44.050> this<00:03:44.200> gives<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.530> surgeon<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:45.069> look

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
during 30 so this gives a surgeon a look

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.550 
during 30 so this gives a surgeon a look
to<00:03:45.730> see<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.150> make<00:03:46.269> sure<00:03:46.300> it<00:03:46.599> spins<00:03:46.870> are<00:03:47.140> all<00:03:47.260> in

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
to see and make sure it spins are all in

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.710 
to see and make sure it spins are all in
the<00:03:47.709> right<00:03:47.860> place<00:03:48.190> so<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:49.150> was<00:03:49.330> done<00:03:49.480> during

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
the right place so that was done during

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.759 
the right place so that was done during
the<00:03:49.900> surgery<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:55.420> maybe<00:03:55.630> go<00:03:55.810> back<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.410> one

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
the surgery you maybe go back to the one

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.059 
the surgery you maybe go back to the one
where<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.190> was<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.489> comparison<00:04:02.069> actually

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
where it was the comparison actually

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.880 
where it was the comparison actually
leave<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:03.370> in<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.580> show

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.160 

Thanks<00:04:10.430> yeah<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:11.330> it's<00:04:11.450> just<00:04:11.569> a<00:04:11.720> really<00:04:11.750> bad

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
Thanks yeah so it's just a really bad

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.930 
Thanks yeah so it's just a really bad
injury<00:04:12.440> as<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:12.830> bottom<00:04:13.370> line<00:04:13.550> with<00:04:13.760> this

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
injury as the bottom line with this

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:29.930 
injury as the bottom line with this
thing<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:17.510> now<00:04:17.720> here<00:04:18.140> is<00:04:18.290> uh

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.780 

so<00:04:30.510> here<00:04:31.230> are<00:04:31.500> this<00:04:31.740> is<00:04:31.800> actually<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.370> second

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
so here are this is actually the second

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.600 
so here are this is actually the second
set<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.090> pins<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.570> were<00:04:33.690> placed<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.170> there

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.459 

here's<00:04:41.210> where<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.509> problem<00:04:41.870> first<00:04:42.110> became

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:42.469 
here's where the problem first became

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.339 
here's where the problem first became
apparent<00:04:42.830> in<00:04:43.789> November<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.509> 04<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.139> Floyd

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
apparent in November of 04 and Floyd

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.230 
apparent in November of 04 and Floyd
started<00:04:45.650> having<00:04:45.830> more<00:04:46.009> hip<00:04:46.159> pain<00:04:46.370> now<00:04:47.000> we<00:04:47.060> can

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
started having more hip pain now we can

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.270 
started having more hip pain now we can
see<00:04:47.419> this<00:04:47.569> big<00:04:47.810> cyst<00:04:48.229> basically<00:04:48.680> this<00:04:48.740> big<00:04:48.979> eat

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
see this big cyst basically this big eat

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.330 
see this big cyst basically this big eat
out<00:04:49.490> cavity<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.620> also<00:04:51.620> it's<00:04:51.860> kind<00:04:52.069> of<00:04:52.129> hard<00:04:52.310> to

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
out cavity and also it's kind of hard to

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.070 
out cavity and also it's kind of hard to
stop<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.669> comparison<00:04:53.240> but<00:04:53.360> now<00:04:53.539> this<00:04:53.780> ball

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
stop the comparison but now this ball

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.249 
stop the comparison but now this ball
that<00:04:54.409> used<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.710> stick<00:04:55.039> up<00:04:55.219> here<00:04:55.879> is<00:04:56.259> now

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
that used to stick up here is now

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.800 
that used to stick up here is now
flattened<00:04:57.919> out<00:04:58.069> so<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:59.180> can<00:04:59.300> kind<00:04:59.509> of<00:04:59.569> compare

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
flattened out so you can kind of compare

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.089 
flattened out so you can kind of compare
the<00:05:00.139> two<00:05:00.349> and<00:05:02.469> so<00:05:03.469> that's<00:05:03.710> kind<00:05:03.979> of<00:05:04.039> the

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
the two and so that's kind of the

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:14.190 
the two and so that's kind of the
flattening

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.590 

so<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:15.250> idea<00:05:15.280> is<00:05:15.640> it's<00:05:15.880> almost<00:05:16.120> like<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.480> ice

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
so the idea is it's almost like the ice

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.150 
so the idea is it's almost like the ice
cream<00:05:16.870> cone<00:05:17.110> is<00:05:17.350> the<00:05:17.650> ice<00:05:17.770> cream<00:05:17.980> is<00:05:18.070> now

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
cream cone is the ice cream is now

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.640 
cream cone is the ice cream is now
melting<00:05:18.700> on<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:19.000> cone<00:05:20.670> and<00:05:22.140> then<00:05:23.140> after<00:05:23.500> that

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
melting on the cone and then after that

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.810 
melting on the cone and then after that
he<00:05:24.190> had<00:05:24.490> surgery<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:25.950> this<00:05:26.950> is<00:05:27.190> kind<00:05:27.550> of<00:05:27.640> our

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
he had surgery and this is kind of our

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.360 
he had surgery and this is kind of our
end<00:05:28.000> result<00:05:30.240> where<00:05:31.240> we<00:05:31.390> took<00:05:31.540> the<00:05:31.720> pins<00:05:31.960> out

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
end result where we took the pins out

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.800 
end result where we took the pins out
they<00:05:33.370> did<00:05:33.550> multiple<00:05:34.000> drilling<00:05:34.450> it<00:05:34.570> can<00:05:34.690> kind

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
they did multiple drilling it can kind

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.480 
they did multiple drilling it can kind
of<00:05:34.900> see<00:05:35.080> these<00:05:35.260> channels<00:05:35.770> so<00:05:36.160> your<00:05:36.280> drill

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
of see these channels so your drill

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.160 
of see these channels so your drill
channels<00:05:36.910> up<00:05:37.090> into<00:05:37.330> this<00:05:37.480> ball<00:05:37.750> to<00:05:37.960> try<00:05:38.110> to

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
channels up into this ball to try to

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.560 
channels up into this ball to try to
restore<00:05:38.380> some<00:05:38.860> blood<00:05:39.100> flow<00:05:39.400> but<00:05:40.270> it<00:05:40.390> doesn't

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
restore some blood flow but it doesn't

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.090 
restore some blood flow but it doesn't
care<00:05:40.900> anything<00:05:41.110> what<00:05:41.500> you're<00:05:41.680> trying<00:05:41.890> to<00:05:41.980> do

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
care anything what you're trying to do

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.940 
care anything what you're trying to do
is<00:05:42.310> stabilize<00:05:42.850> this<00:05:43.660> big<00:05:43.990> mess<00:05:44.260> here<00:05:44.290> and<00:05:44.770> try

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
is stabilize this big mess here and try

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.040 
is stabilize this big mess here and try
to<00:05:45.010> slow<00:05:45.400> down<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.850> normal<00:05:46.480> collapse<00:05:46.840> that

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
to slow down the normal collapse that

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.620 
to slow down the normal collapse that
occurs<00:05:47.380> and<00:05:47.820> so<00:05:48.820> this<00:05:49.090> is<00:05:49.270> just<00:05:49.480> really

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
occurs and so this is just really

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.360 
occurs and so this is just really
regular<00:05:50.260> there's<00:05:50.590> this<00:05:50.740> big<00:05:50.950> eating<00:05:51.190> out

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
regular there's this big eating out

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.340 
regular there's this big eating out
cavities<00:05:51.640> basically<00:05:52.330> this<00:05:52.450> whole<00:05:52.510> top<00:05:52.960> half

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
cavities basically this whole top half

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.510 
cavities basically this whole top half
of<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:53.620> ball<00:05:53.890> is<00:05:54.310> dead<00:05:55.860> does<00:05:56.860> that<00:05:57.100> like<00:05:57.310> dick

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
of the ball is dead does that like dick

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.370 
of the ball is dead does that like dick
is<00:05:57.910> that<00:05:58.120> yeah<00:05:58.390> I<00:05:58.420> did<00:05:58.720> like<00:05:58.870> yeah<00:05:59.200> exactly

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
is that yeah I did like yeah exactly

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.410 
is that yeah I did like yeah exactly
decayed<00:06:00.130> and<00:06:00.460> necrotic<00:06:00.850> would<00:06:01.150> call<00:06:01.300> it

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
decayed and necrotic would call it

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:12.450 
decayed and necrotic would call it
basically<00:06:01.720> dead<00:06:02.050> phone

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.330 

and<00:06:12.750> there's<00:06:13.750> some<00:06:14.650> good<00:06:14.949> MRI<00:06:15.430> pictures<00:06:17.340> so

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
and there's some good MRI pictures so

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.180 
and there's some good MRI pictures so
this<00:06:18.759> one<00:06:19.030> here<00:06:19.660> is<00:06:19.840> probably<00:06:20.590> the<00:06:20.830> best

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.529 

because<00:06:24.190> you<00:06:24.280> have<00:06:24.370> a<00:06:24.460> comparison<00:06:24.910> so<00:06:25.210> this<00:06:25.360> is

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
because you have a comparison so this is

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.219 
because you have a comparison so this is
a<00:06:25.569> normal<00:06:26.020> head<00:06:26.199> look<00:06:26.349> at<00:06:26.470> that<00:06:26.680> normal<00:06:27.220> ball

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
a normal head look at that normal ball

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.770 
a normal head look at that normal ball
now<00:06:29.229> on<00:06:29.440> this<00:06:29.590> side<00:06:29.919> the<00:06:30.729> ball<00:06:31.150> and<00:06:31.479> everything

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
now on this side the ball and everything

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.830 
now on this side the ball and everything
is<00:06:31.900> just<00:06:32.110> gone<00:06:32.460> that's<00:06:33.460> amazing<00:06:34.060> the<00:06:34.300> contrast

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
is just gone that's amazing the contrast

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:48.950 
is just gone that's amazing the contrast
yeah

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.710 

as<00:06:49.160> you<00:06:50.160> can<00:06:50.310> see<00:06:50.610> i<00:06:50.669> mean<00:06:51.090> the<00:06:51.210> contrast

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
as you can see i mean the contrast

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.409 
as you can see i mean the contrast
events<00:06:52.229> not<00:06:52.860> even<00:06:53.160> this<00:06:53.490> is<00:06:53.550> the<00:06:53.880> best<00:06:54.060> picture

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
events not even this is the best picture

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.200 
events not even this is the best picture
that<00:06:54.600> really<00:06:54.930> just<00:06:55.770> shows<00:06:56.069> you<00:06:56.280> everybody<00:06:56.819> can

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
that really just shows you everybody can

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.760 
that really just shows you everybody can
look<00:06:57.330> at<00:06:57.449> this<00:06:57.569> and<00:06:57.750> just<00:06:57.870> see<00:06:58.139> that<00:06:58.410> that's

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
look at this and just see that that's

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.589 
look at this and just see that that's
just<00:06:59.099> not<00:06:59.310> right<00:06:59.550> it's<00:06:59.910> got<00:07:00.090> to<00:07:00.240> be<00:07:00.300> painful

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 
just not right it's got to be painful

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.249 
just not right it's got to be painful
and<00:07:01.080> Alex<00:07:01.560> again<00:07:02.550> I<00:07:02.940> mean<00:07:03.569> that's<00:07:03.690> so<00:07:04.020> well

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 
and Alex again I mean that's so well

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:05.870 
and Alex again I mean that's so well
formed<00:07:04.710> over<00:07:04.830> here<00:07:05.250> and<00:07:05.400> then<00:07:05.550> it's<00:07:05.699> just

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
formed over here and then it's just

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.779 
formed over here and then it's just
nothing<00:07:06.120> it's<00:07:06.449> just<00:07:06.539> kind<00:07:06.990> of<00:07:07.020> like<00:07:07.789> it's

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:08.789 
nothing it's just kind of like it's

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:13.410 
nothing it's just kind of like it's
amazing

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:13.420 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.660 

got<00:07:14.200> one<00:07:14.410> other<00:07:14.590> one<00:07:14.860> that<00:07:14.890> might<00:07:15.190> have<00:07:15.370> a<00:07:15.400> good

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.670 
got one other one that might have a good

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.220 
got one other one that might have a good
shot<00:07:18.090> yeah<00:07:19.090> and<00:07:19.240> this<00:07:19.360> is<00:07:19.480> just<00:07:19.630> a<00:07:19.780> different

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.230 
shot yeah and this is just a different

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.900 
shot yeah and this is just a different
little<00:07:20.500> different<00:07:20.800> technique<00:07:21.250> basically<00:07:21.850> the

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:21.910 
little different technique basically the

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:29.640 
little different technique basically the
same<00:07:22.120> thing<00:07:25.230> yeah<00:07:26.230> let's<00:07:26.860> see<00:07:27.010> where<00:07:27.160> is<00:07:28.650> there

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:29.650 
same thing yeah let's see where is there

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.890 
same thing yeah let's see where is there
we<00:07:29.770> go<00:07:29.920> so<00:07:30.580> the<00:07:30.670> same<00:07:30.850> thing<00:07:30.880> perfectly<00:07:31.660> nice

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:31.900 
we go so the same thing perfectly nice
