00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello girls at super happy 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.960
 find you today for a tutorial 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.580
 hairstyle it's true that I do not have poster 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.559
 very regularly lately 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.590
 compared to usual it's true that 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.150
 my videos were a little bit apart 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.590
 but here I am back so here we go 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.020
 precisely with a hairstyle pic so 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.820
 just not it makes you happy 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.380
 and so this hairstyle is going to be a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.750
 half-tailed with a word a little bit 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.949
 special instead of a half that you 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.109
 can also make a tail of 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.030
 low horse I realized them on my 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.980
 hair ben my smooth hair of course 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.840
 you can achieve hair 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.969
 curly or curl it will be just as 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.440
 pretty maybe even more pretty 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.730
 if you do it on curly hair 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 or curly I advise you just 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 banneux high school slightly hurt and of 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.050
 wicks when you go to serve you for 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.149
 the hairstyle 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.789
 it will avoid giving an effect a little bit 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.980
 too much mess with I despise is 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.600
 curly knowing that there is it going to be a 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.170
 knot so I think it's still 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.850
 prettier to smooth your two games 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.649
 and also you can realize it on 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.439
 mid-length hair not necessarily and I 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.880
 want as long as mine so here you go 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.830
 it's gone and I leave you with the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.110
 tutorial was not starting to catch a wick 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.470
 on the side of your head went there 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.890
 the back train a little to go 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.670
 your fingers and place it at the hands of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.670
 middle of your head 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.650
 xla with pliers for them 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.150
 hold well and to avoid 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.330
 to have to hold throughout the 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.330
 conduct 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.710
 then came to take a lock of the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.910
 same size as earlier but from 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.400
 the other side of your head 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.509
 the cena at the back and makes the pass is 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.369
 well below the mud by now 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.290
 the loop with your thumb you go 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.380
 pass on the finger under the left hand so 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.970
 the one that served that loop is 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.130
 grabbed the new wick to make it 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.119
 pass underneath 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.860
 so if you have me this a life 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.450
 that's what you have for now and 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.399
 you will then pass Vaudois to 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.920
 through the loop to pass the wick to 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:06.220
 the interior go then vaudois under 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.210
 the right sleeve and catch the snow 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.210
 to pass it underneath 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.150
 you just have to go back to the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.150
 snow in the mud 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.620
 do not forget to remove the clip 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.230
 tighten the knot and that's it already 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.300
 finished to make a ponytail 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.850
 divided all of your hair 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.710
 for three parts taking more than 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.970
 hair for the middle part attached 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.250
 the middle part in a ponytail 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.080
 pass and then you'll repeat them 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.580
 same gestures as before with your 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.470
 two wicks and above that you 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.380
 go on then you make a loop you the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.200
 task and you pass the second snow 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.020
 below the loop below the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.760
 first wick inside the 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.620
 loop under the second arrow and again 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.620
 once inside the loop 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.719
 finally tie your wicks with a 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.180
 transparent elastic or with two by 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.719
 his chemo by hiding them under the nose and 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.719
 this is finished
