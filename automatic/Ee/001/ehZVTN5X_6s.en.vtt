so as Carly said a group of researchers

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660 
so as Carly said a group of researchers
a<00:01:13.289> very<00:01:13.500> reputable<00:01:13.710> group<00:01:14.159> from<00:01:14.340> Harvard

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
a very reputable group from Harvard

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.160 
a very reputable group from Harvard
University<00:01:14.729> found<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.810> drop<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
University found that if they drop the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.570 
University found that if they drop the
temperature<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.680> fat<00:01:16.860> cells<00:01:17.070> those<00:01:17.340> fat<00:01:17.550> cells

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
temperature of fat cells those fat cells

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.639 
temperature of fat cells those fat cells
died<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:18.810> would<00:01:18.929> process<00:01:19.140> through<00:01:19.500> your

that right it brings it into the vacuum

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.760 
that right it brings it into the vacuum
so<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:48.000> vacuum<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.869> suction<00:01:49.170> which<00:01:49.500> sucks

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
so the vacuum has a suction which sucks

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.559 
so the vacuum has a suction which sucks
up<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.280> sucking<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.849> up<00:01:50.910> through<00:01:51.209> your<00:01:51.360> skin

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
is just I'm looking at that stomach on

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.610 
is just I'm looking at that stomach on
the<00:03:31.359> left<00:03:31.419> that<00:03:31.629> I<00:03:32.019> wouldn't<00:03:32.439> have<00:03:32.530> thought

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
the left that I wouldn't have thought

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.409 
the left that I wouldn't have thought
there<00:03:32.769> was<00:03:32.859> enough<00:03:33.069> to<00:03:33.220> suck<00:03:34.000> into<00:03:34.180> that

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:34.419 
there was enough to suck into that

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.099 
there was enough to suck into that
little<00:03:34.569> device<00:03:35.129> but<00:03:36.129> there<00:03:36.579> is<00:03:36.700> what<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.750> I

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
little device but there is what I and I

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.659 
little device but there is what I and I
think<00:03:38.200> I've<00:03:38.500> been<00:03:38.709> always<00:03:38.950> really<00:03:39.310> conscious

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
think I've been always really conscious

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.610 
think I've been always really conscious
about<00:03:39.760> what<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.120> eat<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.389> I<00:03:40.750> exercise<00:03:41.349> but<00:03:41.560> I

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
around my stomach that I couldn't get

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.589 
around my stomach that I couldn't get
rid<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.159> is<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.489> is<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.879> gone<00:03:46.090> for<00:03:46.299> good<00:03:46.329> or<00:03:46.510> when

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
rid of is it is it gone for good or when

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.300 
rid of is it is it gone for good or when
it<00:03:46.690> melts<00:03:47.049> does<00:03:47.229> it<00:03:47.349> go<00:03:47.500> back<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.769> where<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.159> was

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
it melts does it go back to where it was

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.409 
it melts does it go back to where it was
before<00:03:48.760> it's<00:03:49.060> frozen

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
before it's frozen

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.420 
before it's frozen
yeah<00:03:49.780> that's<00:03:49.989> cause<00:03:50.139> I<00:03:50.769> got<00:03:50.949> home<00:03:51.129> you<00:03:51.250> just

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
yeah that's cause I got home you just

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.309 
yeah that's cause I got home you just
those<00:03:52.090> fat<00:03:52.269> cells<00:03:52.479> are<00:03:52.599> dead<00:03:52.690> they're<00:03:53.169> gone

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
those fat cells are dead they're gone

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.080 
those fat cells are dead they're gone
for<00:03:53.530> good<00:03:53.560> those<00:03:53.889> petals<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:54.579> mean<00:03:54.729> you<00:03:54.940> can

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
for good those petals I mean you can

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.979 
for good those petals I mean you can
still<00:03:55.239> get<00:03:55.359> better<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:55.629> that<00:03:55.690> area<00:03:55.810> because

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
still get better in that area because

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.780 
still get better in that area because
other<00:03:56.260> fat<00:03:56.470> cells<00:03:56.680> there<00:03:56.889> but<00:03:57.159> it's<00:03:57.280> harder<00:03:57.639> to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
other fat cells there but it's harder to

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.180 
other fat cells there but it's harder to
do<00:03:58.299> up<00:03:58.479> to<00:03:58.840> other<00:03:58.989> factor<00:03:59.379> other<00:03:59.650> fat<00:03:59.919> cells

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
do up to other factor other fat cells

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.430 
do up to other factor other fat cells
don't<00:04:00.579> race<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.239> get<00:04:01.359> back<00:04:01.599> there<00:04:01.840> but<00:04:02.079> that

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
don't race to get back there but that

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.530 
don't race to get back there but that
would<00:04:02.590> be<00:04:02.620> mine<00:04:02.889> you<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.790> number<00:04:04.299> of<00:04:04.389> fat

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
would be mine you the number of fat

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.360 
would be mine you the number of fat
cells<00:04:04.569> they<00:04:04.840> have<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.379> set<00:04:05.680> in<00:04:05.829> your<00:04:05.919> body<00:04:06.129> at

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
cells they have is set in your body at

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.280 
cells they have is set in your body at
the<00:04:06.609> age<00:04:06.699> of<00:04:06.790> around<00:04:06.909> 18<00:04:07.329> so<00:04:07.930> your<00:04:08.079> fat

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
the age of around 18 so your fat

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.409 
the age of around 18 so your fat
distribution<00:04:08.500> of<00:04:09.159> how<00:04:09.370> your<00:04:09.519> shape<00:04:09.729> is<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.180> set

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
distribution of how your shape is is set

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.030 
distribution of how your shape is is set
around<00:04:10.599> that<00:04:10.900> age<00:04:11.049> how<00:04:11.470> much<00:04:11.620> as<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.829> judges

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
around that age how much as the judges

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.300 
around that age how much as the judges
yes<00:04:12.430> it's<00:04:13.269> about<00:04:13.510> $850<00:04:14.409> per<00:04:14.470> session<00:04:14.739> I<00:04:14.979> say<00:04:15.159> it

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
yes it's about $850 per session I say it

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.599 
yes it's about $850 per session I say it
varies<00:04:15.639> from<00:04:15.760> about<00:04:15.819> yes<00:04:16.419> 750<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.139> 950<00:04:17.709> right<00:04:18.010> I

fractional lasers an independent study

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.900 
fractional lasers an independent study
in<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.470> last<00:05:23.620> week<00:05:23.860> in<00:05:24.010> the<00:05:24.100> u.s.<00:05:24.370> compared<00:05:24.820> it

that removing machines and this was

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.880 
that removing machines and this was
found<00:05:28.690> to<00:05:28.810> be<00:05:28.930> by<00:05:29.140> far<00:05:29.350> the<00:05:29.410> most<00:05:29.590> effective

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
found to be by far the most effective

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.650 
found to be by far the most effective
and<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.340> safest<00:05:30.700> now<00:05:30.970> it's<00:05:31.090> not<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.300> Harvard

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
and the safest now it's not the Harvard
