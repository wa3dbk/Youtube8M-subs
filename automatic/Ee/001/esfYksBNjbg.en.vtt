00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
would make a unboxing for this for this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.720 
would make a unboxing for this for this
video<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.300> let's<00:00:38.719> go<00:00:40.430> well<00:00:42.230> let's<00:00:43.230> start<00:00:43.500> on

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
video so let's go well let's start on

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.360 
video so let's go well let's start on
I'm<00:00:44.730> wrapping<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.739> I'm<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:46.890> sure<00:00:47.070> where<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
I'm wrapping this I'm not sure where the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.810 
I'm wrapping this I'm not sure where the
best<00:00:47.550> place<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.450> I'm<00:00:48.539> guessing<00:00:49.820> anywhere

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
best place is but I'm guessing anywhere

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:09.580 
best place is but I'm guessing anywhere
I<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.180> into<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.570> now

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.039 

it's<00:01:10.590> more<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:10.979> pass<00:01:11.609> the<00:01:11.880> parcel<00:01:12.780> whatever

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
it's more like pass the parcel whatever

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.929 
it's more like pass the parcel whatever

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
no me I'll probably cut this when I

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:32.440

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
can't see this at all but there's a huge

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.289 
can't see this at all but there's a huge
handprint<00:04:15.849> like<00:04:16.419> that<00:04:16.600> on<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.840> I'm<00:04:17.109> not<00:04:17.350> sure

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
handprint like that on it I'm not sure

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.659 
handprint like that on it I'm not sure
why<00:04:19.299> that's<00:04:19.510> there<00:04:19.660> that's<00:04:19.900> quite<00:04:20.019> weird<00:04:22.320> yeah

why that's there that's quite weird yeah

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.590 
why that's there that's quite weird yeah
but<00:04:24.669> as<00:04:24.789> you<00:04:25.000> can<00:04:25.120> see<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:26.410> Xbox<00:04:26.800> itself<00:04:27.600> the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
but as you can see the Xbox itself the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.930 
but as you can see the Xbox itself the
controller<00:04:29.470> I<00:04:29.710> don't<00:04:30.070> think<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.520> is<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.789> one

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
controller I don't think that is the one

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.870 
controller I don't think that is the one
you<00:04:31.090> get<00:04:31.270> with<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.930> slim<00:04:32.919> originated<00:04:33.639> but<00:04:33.820> I

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
you get with the slim originated but I

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.830 
you get with the slim originated but I
don't<00:04:34.090> care<00:04:34.270> as<00:04:34.449> long<00:04:34.479> as<00:04:34.600> I've<00:04:34.810> got

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
don't care as long as I've got

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.290 
don't care as long as I've got
controller<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:35.830> can<00:04:36.010> play<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.460> it's<00:04:37.090> better

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
controller and I can play it it's better

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.909 
controller and I can play it it's better
than<00:04:37.479> having<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.840> original<00:04:37.930> one<00:04:38.410> way<00:04:38.590> it

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
than having the original one way it

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.710
