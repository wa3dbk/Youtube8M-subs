00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.370 
we've been able to reach you know we're
gonna<00:03:25.790> be<00:03:26.000> releasing<00:03:26.210> it<00:03:26.630> on<00:03:26.690> YouTube<00:03:27.140> with

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
gonna be releasing it on YouTube with

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.170 
gonna be releasing it on YouTube with
sort<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.770> different<00:03:28.250> strategy<00:03:28.490> as<00:03:28.940> kind<00:03:29.150> of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
sort of a different strategy as kind of

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.170 
sort of a different strategy as kind of
a<00:03:29.300> second<00:03:29.690> wave<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:31.490> you<00:03:31.790> know<00:03:31.910> I'm<00:03:32.000> still

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
a second wave and you know I'm still

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.970 
a second wave and you know I'm still
talking<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.780> number<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:33.140> websites<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:33.740> I

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
talking to a number of websites that I

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.870 
talking to a number of websites that I
hope<00:03:34.490> it<00:03:34.610> will<00:03:34.730> end<00:03:34.940> up<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:35.710> and<00:03:36.820> you<00:03:37.820> know

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
hope it will end up on and you know

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.140 
hope it will end up on and you know
ultimately<00:03:39.160> my<00:03:40.160> approach<00:03:40.580> was<00:03:40.730> making<00:03:41.060> the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
ultimately my approach was making the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.820 
ultimately my approach was making the
short<00:03:41.360> in<00:03:41.480> general<00:03:41.810> as<00:03:42.170> opposed<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.530> releasing

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
short in general as opposed to releasing

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.040 
short in general as opposed to releasing
it<00:03:43.010> online<00:03:43.130> was<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.300> it's<00:03:44.540> gonna<00:03:44.660> be<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> great

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
it online was that it's gonna be a great

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.350 
it online was that it's gonna be a great
thing<00:03:45.110> for<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.560> feature<00:03:45.800> regardless<00:03:46.550> of<00:03:46.760> how

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
thing for the feature regardless of how

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.170 
thing for the feature regardless of how
it<00:03:47.480> turns<00:03:47.660> out<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.110> who<00:03:48.170> sees<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:49.000> because<00:03:50.000> for

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
it turns out and who sees it because for

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.490 
it turns out and who sees it because for
me<00:03:50.300> it's<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.510> proof<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:50.750> concept<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.380> it's

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
me it's a proof of concept and it's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.720 
me it's a proof of concept and it's
getting<00:03:51.710> on<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.920> set<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.340> working<00:03:52.610> at<00:03:52.700> a

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
getting on the set and working at a

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.280 
getting on the set and working at a
certain<00:03:53.060> pace<00:03:53.240> and<00:03:53.600> finding<00:03:53.930> good<00:03:54.050> crew

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
certain pace and finding good crew

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.350 
certain pace and finding good crew
members<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:55.010> just<00:03:55.520> you<00:03:55.640> know<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.910> on<00:03:56.060> set

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
members and just you know the on set

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.760 
members and just you know the on set
reps<00:03:56.660> of<00:03:57.020> making<00:03:57.650> a<00:03:57.710> movie<00:03:57.980> in<00:03:58.100> this<00:03:58.280> genre<00:03:59.770> but

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
reps of making a movie in this genre but

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:01.960 
reps of making a movie in this genre but
I<00:04:00.830> think<00:04:01.040> there<00:04:01.160> are<00:04:01.280> a<00:04:01.310> lot<00:04:01.610> of<00:04:01.640> different

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
I think there are a lot of different

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.220 
I think there are a lot of different
approaches<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.450> could<00:04:02.540> take<00:04:02.750> with<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:02.960> short

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
approaches you could take with a short

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.610 
approaches you could take with a short
you<00:04:04.130> know<00:04:04.250> one<00:04:04.610> would<00:04:04.790> be<00:04:05.080> okay<00:04:06.080> you<00:04:06.140> make<00:04:06.410> it

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
you know one would be okay you make it

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.650 
you know one would be okay you make it
you<00:04:07.100> hold<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.460> back<00:04:07.640> if<00:04:08.330> you're<00:04:08.450> trying<00:04:08.630> to

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
you hold it back if you're trying to

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.060 
you hold it back if you're trying to
raise<00:04:08.810> fun<00:04:09.050> right<00:04:09.230> fund<00:04:09.620> raising<00:04:09.950> you

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
raise fun right fund raising you

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.660 
raise fun right fund raising you
approach<00:04:10.430> investors<00:04:11.230> privately<00:04:12.640> with<00:04:13.640> a

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
approach investors privately with a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.780 
approach investors privately with a
screening<00:04:14.320> it's<00:04:15.320> good<00:04:15.620> they<00:04:16.160> feel<00:04:16.190> special

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
screening it's good they feel special

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.479 
screening it's good they feel special
they're<00:04:17.060> invested<00:04:17.600> in<00:04:18.250> making<00:04:19.250> this<00:04:19.430> happen

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
they're invested in making this happen

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.620 
they're invested in making this happen
because<00:04:19.910> they<00:04:20.120> feel<00:04:20.299> like<00:04:20.390> they've<00:04:20.510> had

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
because they feel like they've had

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.180 
because they feel like they've had
special<00:04:21.020> access<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:21.620> would<00:04:21.710> be<00:04:21.830> one<00:04:21.979> way<00:04:22.010> of

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
special access that would be one way of

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.340 
special access that would be one way of
doing<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.640> you<00:04:23.090> know<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.300> other<00:04:23.450> is<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:24.020> submit

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
doing it you know the other is to submit

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.890 
doing it you know the other is to submit
the<00:04:24.470> film<00:04:24.680> festivals<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.310> wait<00:04:25.520> and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
the film festivals and wait and

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.210 
the film festivals and wait and
hopefully<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:27.350> know<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.560> play<00:04:27.830> a

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
hopefully you know you play a

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.400 
hopefully you know you play a
prestigious<00:04:28.669> festival<00:04:28.970> maybe<00:04:29.900> you<00:04:30.050> even<00:04:30.169> win

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
prestigious festival maybe you even win

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.200 
prestigious festival maybe you even win
some<00:04:30.590> award<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.250> that<00:04:31.460> kind<00:04:31.669> of<00:04:31.760> validation

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
some award and that kind of validation

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.390 
some award and that kind of validation
allows<00:04:32.600> you<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.960> then<00:04:33.080> go<00:04:33.350> pitch<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.250> investors

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
allows you to then go pitch to investors

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.930 
allows you to then go pitch to investors
and<00:04:34.910> while<00:04:35.000> it's<00:04:35.150> still<00:04:35.210> not<00:04:35.810> online<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:37.190> think

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
and while it's still not online I think

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.400 
and while it's still not online I think
I'll<00:04:38.210> always<00:04:38.360> wonder<00:04:38.750> about<00:04:38.780> these<00:04:39.110> different

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
I'll always wonder about these different

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.140 
I'll always wonder about these different
approaches<00:04:39.830> but<00:04:40.520> there's<00:04:40.669> really<00:04:40.790> no<00:04:40.940> way<00:04:41.060> of

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
approaches but there's really no way of

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.540 
approaches but there's really no way of
knowing<00:04:41.390> beforehand<00:04:41.900> oh<00:04:42.290> this<00:04:42.979> is<00:04:43.130> right<00:04:43.340> oh

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
knowing beforehand oh this is right oh

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.360 
knowing beforehand oh this is right oh
this<00:04:43.729> is<00:04:43.850> wrong<00:04:44.090> this<00:04:44.479> will<00:04:44.630> work<00:04:44.780> this<00:04:44.960> won't

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
this is wrong this will work this won't

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.250 
this is wrong this will work this won't
and<00:04:46.370> for<00:04:46.790> me<00:04:46.940> ever<00:04:47.240> since<00:04:47.419> I<00:04:47.570> got<00:04:47.600> started<00:04:47.990> I've

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
and for me ever since I got started I've

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.870 
and for me ever since I got started I've
always<00:04:48.470> felt<00:04:48.650> that<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:49.190> know<00:04:49.610> there's<00:04:49.820> a

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
always felt that you know there's a

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.969 
always felt that you know there's a
place<00:04:50.090> for<00:04:50.120> drama<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:51.020> for<00:04:51.260> quality<00:04:51.410> content

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
place for drama and for quality content

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.310 
place for drama and for quality content
online<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:52.970> it's<00:04:53.750> always<00:04:53.870> been<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.110> goal<00:04:54.290> of

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
online and it's always been a goal of

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.890 
online and it's always been a goal of
mine<00:04:54.530> so<00:04:54.919> it<00:04:55.010> just<00:04:55.190> made<00:04:55.370> sense<00:04:55.640> to<00:04:56.450> go<00:04:56.479> with

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
mine so it just made sense to go with

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.520 
mine so it just made sense to go with
this<00:04:57.080> approach<00:04:58.150> especially<00:04:59.150> as<00:04:59.450> we've<00:05:00.380> been

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
this approach especially as we've been

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.020 
this approach especially as we've been
in<00:05:00.680> pre-production<00:05:01.250> on<00:05:01.310> manchild<00:05:01.820> and

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
in pre-production on manchild and

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.870 
in pre-production on manchild and
development<00:05:02.750> for<00:05:02.900> so<00:05:03.080> long<00:05:03.290> that<00:05:03.850> waiting<00:05:04.850> for

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
development for so long that waiting for

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.640 
development for so long that waiting for
a<00:05:05.060> festival<00:05:05.570> or<00:05:05.630> doing<00:05:05.930> these<00:05:06.050> things<00:05:06.229> behind

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
a festival or doing these things behind

that's<00:06:44.380> kind<00:06:44.590> of<00:06:44.620> the<00:06:44.770> approach<00:06:44.860> I<00:06:45.190> have<00:06:45.510> and

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 
that's kind of the approach I have and

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.300 
that's kind of the approach I have and
you<00:06:46.930> know<00:06:47.050> I<00:06:47.290> guess<00:06:47.770> there'll<00:06:47.950> be<00:06:47.980> plenty<00:06:48.160> of

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
you know I guess there'll be plenty of

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.610 
you know I guess there'll be plenty of
time<00:06:48.490> in<00:06:48.670> the<00:06:48.730> future<00:06:48.850> to<00:06:49.030> take<00:06:50.020> meetings<00:06:50.260> and

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
time in the future to take meetings and

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.670 
time in the future to take meetings and
pause<00:06:50.830> and<00:06:51.190> strategize<00:06:51.700> and<00:06:52.440> you<00:06:53.440> know<00:06:53.500> take

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
pause and strategize and you know take

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.880 
pause and strategize and you know take
our<00:06:53.800> time<00:06:53.950> with<00:06:53.980> it<00:06:54.310> but<00:06:54.520> but<00:06:54.940> you<00:06:55.150> know<00:06:55.890> I'm

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:56.890 
our time with it but but you know I'm

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.550 
our time with it but but you know I'm
not<00:06:57.210> I'm<00:06:58.210> not<00:06:58.240> letting<00:06:58.630> go<00:06:58.660> of<00:06:58.750> that<00:06:58.960> that<00:06:59.380> rock
