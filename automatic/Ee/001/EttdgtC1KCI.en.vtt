Devil's<00:01:20.240> make<00:01:20.420> sense<00:01:20.690> there<00:01:20.930> but<00:01:21.590> was<00:01:21.830> there

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
Devil's make sense there but was there

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.310 
Devil's make sense there but was there
was<00:01:22.370> a<00:01:22.550> was<00:01:23.330> was<00:01:23.660> there<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:23.840> contributing

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
was a was was there a contributing

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.920 
was a was was there a contributing
factor<00:01:24.380> on<00:01:24.920> how<00:01:25.100> last<00:01:25.400> season<00:01:25.580> played<00:01:26.120> out<00:01:26.330> and

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
factor on how last season played out and

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.620 
factor on how last season played out and
I<00:01:27.380> guess<00:01:28.070> I<00:01:28.190> gotta<00:01:28.400> ask<00:01:28.460> in<00:01:28.820> particular<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
I guess I gotta ask in particular the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.530 
I guess I gotta ask in particular the
the<00:01:30.410> dust-up<00:01:31.100> between<00:01:31.160> Marcus<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.000> pan<00:01:32.240> coach

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
the dust-up between Marcus and pan coach

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.310 
the dust-up between Marcus and pan coach
and<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.260> sec<00:01:33.580> um<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:35.090> think<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:35.690> was<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.080> small

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
and a sec um I think it was a small

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.650 
and a sec um I think it was a small
factor<00:01:36.770> but<00:01:36.950> but<00:01:37.160> you<00:01:37.460> know<00:01:37.580> I<00:01:37.610> think<00:01:38.270> that

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
factor but but you know I think that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.530 
factor but but you know I think that
incident<00:01:39.110> was<00:01:39.580> made<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.700> be<00:01:40.790> bigger<00:01:41.000> than<00:01:41.090> we

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
incident was made to be bigger than we

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.240 
incident was made to be bigger than we

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
imagined you would be it's certainly a

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.360 
imagined you would be it's certainly a
strong<00:02:20.450> emotional<00:02:20.930> tie<00:02:21.080> there<00:02:21.320> with<00:02:21.980> marcus

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
strong emotional tie there with marcus

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.180 
strong emotional tie there with marcus
being<00:02:22.520> his<00:02:22.730> twin<00:02:23.209> brother<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:24.380> but<00:02:24.830> we<00:02:24.920> you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
being his twin brother so but we you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.520 
being his twin brother so but we you
know<00:02:25.250> we<00:02:25.370> think<00:02:25.580> over<00:02:25.880> time<00:02:26.290> he'll<00:02:27.290> see<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
know we think over time he'll see the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.290 
know we think over time he'll see the
value<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.190> we<00:02:28.670> think<00:02:28.850> will<00:02:28.910> help<00:02:29.030> him<00:02:29.209> grow

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
value in it we think will help him grow

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.460 
value in it we think will help him grow
as<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> player<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.840> help<00:02:30.080> him<00:02:30.140> grow<00:02:30.260> as<00:02:30.440> a

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
as a player and help him grow as a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.470 
as a player and help him grow as a
person<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.100> also<00:02:31.550> i<00:02:31.670> think<00:02:32.030> it's<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.420> good

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
person and also i think it's a good

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.000 
person and also i think it's a good
opportunity<00:02:32.540> for<00:02:32.959> marcus<00:02:33.350> if<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.769> look<00:02:33.920> at

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
opportunity for marcus if you look at

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.170 
opportunity for marcus if you look at
the<00:02:34.100> choice<00:02:34.280> roster<00:02:34.700> i<00:02:34.730> think<00:02:34.970> he<00:02:35.030> has<00:02:35.120> a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the choice roster i think he has a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.000 
the choice roster i think he has a
chance<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.600> play<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.140> lot<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.440> potentially<00:02:36.860> be

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
chance to play a lot and potentially be

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.140 
chance to play a lot and potentially be
the<00:02:37.040> starter<00:02:37.730> at<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.910> small<00:02:38.120> forward

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
the starter at the small forward

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.140 
the starter at the small forward
position<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:39.590> i<00:02:39.620> imagine<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.700> Markieff

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
position so i imagine that Markieff

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.790 
position so i imagine that Markieff
might<00:02:41.390> be<00:02:41.570> no<00:02:41.930> it's<00:02:42.080> not<00:02:42.230> as<00:02:42.380> thrilled<00:02:42.680> with

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
might be no it's not as thrilled with

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.009
