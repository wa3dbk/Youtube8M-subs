00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.340
 good at 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.850
 So at least that's how I am 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.770
 taken and now only turns 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.539
 the question 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.820
 So first of all, thank you in any case 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 every single one of the video rated 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.159
 I was visiting my now have before just 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.470
 16 record through this video and the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:14.250
 current here always very short the video 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:19.290
 within 23 hours it has 494 likes 11 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.880
 discs and 2007 126 calls achieved this 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.100
 is a number that is really something of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 I'm really fascinated myself 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.960
 still surprised how many people 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.240
 have looked at this video and 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.409
 the video was a hell of a lot of work 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.020
 would like that at this point again 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.630
 stressed it was a hell of a lot of work with 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.180
 margins with sometimes gets very short 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.570
 say with graduations 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.479
 meditating edges has it all 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.430
 24 hours took so 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.049
 summed up alone this motion 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.149
 tracking scene i can do that now 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.680
 possibly again show somewhere 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.100
 she has me alone already three 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 run for hours then used yes and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.420
 my pc is really bad global 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.310
 Illumination turned on so that a 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.530
 The 3d font looks a bit better 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.030
 yes one or the other I can do something 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.680
 The others may start with that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.470
 not that not so bad 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.239
 and yes, I'm really there 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.940
 strong on little but played around but 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.500
 thankful that you may have the video like that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.140
 have pushed a bit in, I say 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.640
 Now just marco phoenix that 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.890
 know how posted his facebook page 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.010
 that really surprised me a lot 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.660
 I was really baffled and really 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.330
 thank you very much to you 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.319
 are both pointed and more there 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.910
 not really to say 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.680
 and now the question arises if I am 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.569
 It should also make a making-of 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.360
 Say I should show again like me 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.030
 the whole video so edited and 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.860
 Well, not me, of course, I will not 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.209
 go through each step again but 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.629
 I 'll show you a little bit like me 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.370
 that worked with which program 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.739
 yes something like that, for example, the motion 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.840
 tracking so the 3d font in the video 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.099
 how I implemented them and so on 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.599
 What do you mean in the comments 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.200
 you want to write something so will you 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.629
 what not and yes I wanted to 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.940
 nothing else to say about the subject 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.129
 played and indeed co phoenix have this 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.590
 tricks or those kiels made that was 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.150
 I actually have everything in the video 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.330
 made only the video was just for the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.560
 two dedicated as the 100,000 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.010
 subscribers have cracked 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.260
 and yes, so many people have me too 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.190
 asked where can you be so good with that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.319
 handle the bow 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:31.049
 yes, frankly , I know that myself 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:32.519
 I do not know so I can 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.319
 actually only a thing I can 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.420
 the only way to explain that myself 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.260
 ego shooter for a very long time 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:44.400
 play games and there quick scoping only speak 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.620
 swype and maybe it's because that 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.180
 I handle the bow so well 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.459
 he can not imagine now 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.989
 sound or something but many have me 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.030
 yourself written in the comments yes 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.010
 you're very good with the bow 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.470
 how do you do that somehow? 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.360
 trick or yes as I said doing the exercise 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.280
 Master is here at this point 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.590
 say that does not mean that I'm the best 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.819
 am there are always better than me that 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.170
 I want at this point explicitly 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.760
 stressed and yes but I mean a lot 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.099
 People were surprised and that's the one 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.989
 only explanation of course there are 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.660
 not a few tricks and tips 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.010
 could possibly betray but if then 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.380
 I would do that too in an extra 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.910
 make video and if you have such an extra 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.780
 video just want to write in 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.940
 the comments 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.170
 because then a video will come and 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.730
 I will give you such a few small ones then 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.760
 Tips betrayed as you better then 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.580
 to play a bow in the bow or 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.220
 as a aiming or aiming from the bow 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.530
 so then we just come to times 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.750
 last topic that would be the room tour 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.690
 yes, yes, I had the last one 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.110
 week do not have so much time there are easy 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.970
 because I renovated my room 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.430
 I have got new furniture 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.570
 and I have to build them all 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.120
 with my father with my brother 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.840
 done alone and after a few 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.940
 There were finally problems, too 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.260
 furniture and although there was once the problem 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.280
 I can do it now very briefly 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.210
 seen to open 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.980
 we just as a sideboard states 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:16.740
 I think so exactly sideboard hot that 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:18.870
 and sun dresser ordered his whole 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.110
 Ordered living room wall and we have 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.100
 given us the same parts twice 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.380
 then we will be back 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.010
 Scooters drove so days the parts 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.530
 Bought 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.000
 and yes, the people were there 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.890
 you could actually be a bit stubborn 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.390
 already say they told us that 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.800
 you do not have the parts in stock 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.300
 then we simply told her 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.460
 yes okay, but we want the montage 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.720
 free of charge as well as our fuel 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.710
 back because I think it is 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.480
 of course that we share our parts 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.010
 if we build them ourselves 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.840
 to be provided 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.250
 especially if we still have a buzz of 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.860
 money on it 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.380
 yes and then they had all 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.210
 comic wise detail in stock 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.650
 because they thought we have the parts 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.030
 not in stock we would need the walls 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.720
 order that could be two weeks in 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.250
 claim 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.950
 and I mean this is one 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.750
 a little crazy and yes 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.480
 That's why we do not let ourselves be fooled 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.970
 we have everything here in the room now 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.190
 make available all sofa cabinet 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.340
 possible new bed also comes 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.990
 in the near future and yes, so if you 're fame too 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.770
 want to write so easy in the 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.960
 Comments 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.690
 I'm relatively flexible in that 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.280
 And yes, I am in this position 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.830
 actually already reached the end 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.930
 and as I said I hope the video has 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.460
 you liked it if you liked it 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.610
 Of course I would like to have one 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.470
 happy evaluation and yes then 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.210
 I would say skin is a new one 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.210
 crafting bed until next time
