house can you point out some of the
energy-efficient<00:00:09.000> aspects<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:09.719> you

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
energy-efficient aspects of this you

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.240 
energy-efficient aspects of this you
know<00:00:09.990> what<00:00:10.139> what<00:00:10.500> makes<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:10.830> more<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.099> an

typical house might be sure one of the
first<00:00:15.059> things<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.360> probably<00:00:15.480> want<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.750> look

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
first things you probably want to look

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.380 
first things you probably want to look
at<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.500> what<00:00:17.490> type<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.699> eating<00:00:17.940> system

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
at is is what type of eating system

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.210 
at is is what type of eating system
you're<00:00:18.510> using<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> house<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.619> happens

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
you're using on the house this happens

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.900 
you're using on the house this happens
to<00:00:20.279> be<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> Coleman<00:00:21.020> modulating<00:00:22.020> furnace<00:00:22.910> if

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to be a Coleman modulating furnace if

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
to be a Coleman modulating furnace if
you<00:00:24.090> look<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.600> newer<00:00:25.109> phoners<00:00:25.529> furnaces<00:00:26.070> they

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
you look on newer phoners furnaces they

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160 
you look on newer phoners furnaces they
always<00:00:26.369> have<00:00:26.519> an<00:00:26.640> energy<00:00:26.970> label<00:00:27.420> guide<00:00:27.930> down

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
always have an energy label guide down

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.140 
always have an energy label guide down
here<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.740> says<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.029> as

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
here and this one says it it can be as

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.700 
here and this one says it it can be as
efficient<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.779> ninety<00:00:31.019> seven<00:00:31.289> point<00:00:31.439> five

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
efficient up to ninety seven point five

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.370 
efficient up to ninety seven point five
percent<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.430> means<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.000> basically

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
percent so that means that basically

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.049 
percent so that means that basically
ninety<00:00:34.380> seven<00:00:34.680> point<00:00:34.829> five<00:00:35.430> percent<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
ninety seven point five percent of the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.520 
ninety seven point five percent of the
heat<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.600> furnace<00:00:37.050> generates

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
heat that this furnace generates

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.020 
heat that this furnace generates
actually<00:00:38.010> makes<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.370> into<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.579> house<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
actually makes it into the house the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.580 
actually makes it into the house the
other<00:00:39.059> two-and-a-half<00:00:39.600> percent<00:00:39.780> will

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
other two-and-a-half percent will

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.290 
other two-and-a-half percent will
actually<00:00:40.860> go<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.309> exhaust<00:00:41.579> piping<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
actually go out the exhaust piping and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.990 
actually go out the exhaust piping and
make<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> outside<00:00:43.280> older<00:00:44.280> furnaces<00:00:44.820> if

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
make it to the outside older furnaces if

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
make it to the outside older furnaces if
you're<00:00:45.120> looking<00:00:45.329> at<00:00:45.480> an<00:00:45.570> older<00:00:45.840> home<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.590> lot<00:00:46.890> of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
you're looking at an older home a lot of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.590 
you're looking at an older home a lot of
times<00:00:47.010> you'll<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.460> metal<00:00:47.640> chimneys<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.270> on

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
times you'll see metal chimneys on on

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.990 
times you'll see metal chimneys on on
furnaces<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.920> means<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.340> heat<00:00:50.820> is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
furnaces and that means that heat is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.430 
furnaces and that means that heat is
going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> go<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> chimney<00:00:51.719> with

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
going to go up the chimney with

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
going to go up the chimney with
technology<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> way<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.430> right<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
technology the way it is right now this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.569 
technology the way it is right now this
furnace<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.420> nice<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.020> number<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.320> reasons

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
furnace is nice for a number of reasons

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.450 
furnace is nice for a number of reasons
one<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.850> not<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.660> its<00:00:57.809> efficiency<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.590> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
one is not just its efficiency but it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.819 
one is not just its efficiency but it
also<00:01:00.149> comes<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.570> an<00:01:00.750> ECM<00:01:01.109> motor<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.500> ECM

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
also comes with an ECM motor and ECM

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.590 
also comes with an ECM motor and ECM
motor<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> furnace<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.480> going

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
motor on the furnace actually is going

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.810 
motor on the furnace actually is going
to<00:01:03.660> cost<00:01:03.930> quite<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.500> bit<00:01:04.559> less<00:01:04.890> than<00:01:04.920> say<00:01:05.309> an<00:01:05.610> old

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
to cost quite a bit less than say an old

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600 
to cost quite a bit less than say an old
motor<00:01:06.590> furnaces<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.100> older<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
motor furnaces that are older with the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.740 
motor furnaces that are older with the
metal<00:01:08.850> chimneys<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.360> sort<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> things

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
metal chimneys and that sort of things

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.539 
metal chimneys and that sort of things
typically<00:01:10.320> don't<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.950> ECM<00:01:11.310> motor

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
typically don't have the ECM motor

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.219 
typically don't have the ECM motor
they're<00:01:11.850> probably<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> run<00:01:12.420> somewhere

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
they're probably going to run somewhere

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.690 
they're probably going to run somewhere
between<00:01:13.409> five<00:01:13.890> hundred<00:01:13.920> eight<00:01:14.280> hundred<00:01:14.310> Watts

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
between five hundred eight hundred Watts

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.910 
between five hundred eight hundred Watts
every<00:01:15.000> time<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.270> fan<00:01:15.540> turns<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.680> one<00:01:16.830> is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
every time that fan turns on this one is

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.990 
every time that fan turns on this one is
probably<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> run<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.700> hundred

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
probably going to run about a hundred

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.280 
probably going to run about a hundred
watts<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.330> less<00:01:18.540> when<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:18.869> running<00:01:19.080> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
watts or less when it's running so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
watts or less when it's running so
that's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.340> big<00:01:20.549> savings<00:01:21.000> on

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that's a it's a it's a big savings on

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.179 
that's a it's a it's a big savings on
the<00:01:21.450> electrical<00:01:21.900> side<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.170> things<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:23.040> also

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the electrical side of things but also

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.399 
the electrical side of things but also
on<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> modulating<00:01:24.000> side<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.720> gonna<00:01:24.900> not

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
on the modulating side it's gonna not

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.920 
on the modulating side it's gonna not
use<00:01:26.250> more<00:01:26.610> gas<00:01:26.880> than<00:01:26.939> actually<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.720> needs

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
use more gas than actually what it needs

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.020 
use more gas than actually what it needs
to<00:01:28.049> eat<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> house<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.000> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
to eat the house so so if this is a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.600 
to eat the house so so if this is a
sixty<00:01:30.420> thousand<00:01:30.900> bt<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.560> input<00:01:31.799> furnace<00:01:32.400> we

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
sixty thousand bt you input furnace we

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.140 
sixty thousand bt you input furnace we
might<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.939> supplying<00:01:33.829> thirty<00:01:34.829> thousand<00:01:35.729> BTUs

this<00:01:43.890> house<00:01:44.070> aside<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> furnace<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
this house aside from the furnace is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.200 
this house aside from the furnace is
that<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.720> gas<00:01:45.869> water<00:01:46.170> heater<00:01:47.149> was<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that we do have a gas water heater was a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.840 
that we do have a gas water heater was a
nice<00:01:48.450> smart<00:01:48.689> valve<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.610> gas<00:01:50.610> water

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
nice smart valve on it so gas water

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.060 
nice smart valve on it so gas water
heaters<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.049> also<00:01:52.200> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.950> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
heaters this is also kind of it's a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.300 
heaters this is also kind of it's a
power<00:01:53.250> vent<00:01:54.320> but<00:01:55.320> also<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> PVC

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
power vent but also we can use the PVC

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.270 
power vent but also we can use the PVC
chimney<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:57.000> we're<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:57.450> using

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
chimney because we're actually using

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.770 
chimney because we're actually using
less<00:01:59.280> heat<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.759> chilly<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
less heat in that chilly so more the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.999 
less heat in that chilly so more the
heat<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.049> actually<00:02:01.200> staying<00:02:01.619> with<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.829> water

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
heat is actually staying with the water

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
heat is actually staying with the water
heaters<00:02:02.310> same<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> way<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
heaters same with the with the way it is

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.980 
heaters same with the with the way it is
with<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.140> furnace<00:02:04.939> and<00:02:05.939> then<00:02:06.090> lastly<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.810> this

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
with the furnace and then lastly in this

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.960 
with the furnace and then lastly in this
mechanical<00:02:07.560> room<00:02:07.710> we'll<00:02:08.129> talk<00:02:08.310> about<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> HRV

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
mechanical room we'll talk about the HRV

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.630 
mechanical room we'll talk about the HRV
the<00:02:09.840> HRV<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.440> actually<00:02:10.860> essential<00:02:11.489> especially

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the HRV is actually essential especially

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.370 
the HRV is actually essential especially
in<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> house<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.390> that's<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:12.900> tight<00:02:13.140> as

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
in a house like this that's as tight as

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.050 
in a house like this that's as tight as
is<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.920> house<00:02:14.160> actually<00:02:14.460> comes<00:02:14.850> with<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
is this house actually comes with a

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.840 
is this house actually comes with a
point<00:02:15.600> zero<00:02:15.780> five<00:02:16.080> air<00:02:16.920> change<00:02:17.280> per<00:02:17.490> hour<00:02:17.610> that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
point zero five air change per hour that

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.760 
point zero five air change per hour that
means<00:02:17.970> five<00:02:18.960> percent<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.500> air<00:02:19.620> is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
means five percent of the air is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.700 
means five percent of the air is
naturally<00:02:20.250> changed<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:20.940> house<00:02:21.710> every

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
naturally changed in this house every

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.780 
naturally changed in this house every
hour

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
hour

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.210 
hour
ASHRAE<00:02:24.660> would<00:02:24.900> would<00:02:25.260> say<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.650> thirty<00:02:25.950> five

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
ASHRAE would would say that thirty five

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.460 
ASHRAE would would say that thirty five
percent<00:02:26.430> air<00:02:27.120> change<00:02:27.480> per<00:02:27.720> hour<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.110> actually

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
percent air change per hour is actually

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.890 
percent air change per hour is actually
healthy<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.460> we're<00:02:30.000> way<00:02:30.150> off<00:02:30.360> from<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.660> five

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
healthy so we're way off from that five

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.450 
healthy so we're way off from that five
percent<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.470> thirty<00:02:31.710> five<00:02:31.770> percent<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
percent that thirty five percent so the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.400 
percent that thirty five percent so the
way<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:32.820> make<00:02:33.000> up<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:34.020> we<00:02:34.200> put

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
way that we make up for that is we put

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.130 
way that we make up for that is we put
in<00:02:34.500> an<00:02:34.620> HRV<00:02:34.950> an<00:02:35.430> HRV<00:02:35.850> actually<00:02:36.480> brings<00:02:36.780> air<00:02:36.990> in

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
in an HRV an HRV actually brings air in

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.950 
in an HRV an HRV actually brings air in
from<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.350> outside<00:02:37.760> heats<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.940> air<00:02:38.970> up<00:02:39.300> using

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
from the outside heats the air up using

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.660 
from the outside heats the air up using
the<00:02:40.230> heat<00:02:40.410> that's<00:02:40.590> already<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.190> house<00:02:41.310> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the heat that's already in the house and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.580 
the heat that's already in the house and
puts<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.300> into<00:02:42.450> our<00:02:42.630> furnace<00:02:42.810> system<00:02:43.320> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
puts it into our furnace system and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.320 
puts it into our furnace system and
distributes<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.610> fresh<00:02:44.850> air<00:02:45.030> through<00:02:45.270> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
distributes that fresh air through the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.450 
distributes that fresh air through the
building<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.780> one<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.260> those<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.070> nice

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
building and one of those the the nice

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.340 
building and one of those the the nice
things<00:02:47.700> about<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.000> that's<00:02:48.150> its<00:02:48.900> actual

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
things about it that's its actual

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.140 
things about it that's its actual
benefit<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.400> fresh<00:02:50.640> air<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> house

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
benefit is is the fresh air in the house

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.460 
benefit is is the fresh air in the house
for<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.510> occupants<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.230> we're<00:02:52.350> getting

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
for the occupants so that we're getting

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.170 
for the occupants so that we're getting
fresh<00:02:52.830> air<00:02:53.010> all<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> time<00:02:53.460> from<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.820> outside

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
fresh air all the time from the outside

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.210 
fresh air all the time from the outside
we're<00:02:54.390> not<00:02:54.510> breathing<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.470> recycled<00:02:56.070> air

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
we're not breathing that recycled air

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.850 
we're not breathing that recycled air
that's<00:02:56.490> that<00:02:57.090> stale<00:02:57.450> inside<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.960> house<00:02:58.110> and

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
that's that stale inside the house and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.710 
that's that stale inside the house and
of<00:02:58.980> course<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.250> other<00:02:59.390> feature<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.600> this

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
of course the other feature to this

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.180 
of course the other feature to this
thing<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.140> advantage<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.620> having<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:02.070> is

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
thing of the advantage of having it is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.740 
thing of the advantage of having it is
that<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:03.030> actually<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.420> controlled<00:03:03.900> by<00:03:03.960> a

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
that it actually is controlled by a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
that it actually is controlled by a
controller<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.930> will<00:03:07.110> allow<00:03:07.290> us<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.560> set<00:03:07.740> the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
controller that will allow us to set the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.950 
controller that will allow us to set the
relative<00:03:08.250> humidity<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.760> house<00:03:09.000> it's

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
relative humidity in the house it's

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.020 
relative humidity in the house it's
blinking<00:03:10.410> forty<00:03:10.740> six<00:03:10.980> because<00:03:11.310> it's<00:03:11.490> actually

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
blinking forty six because it's actually

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.310 
blinking forty six because it's actually
we<00:03:12.150> wanted<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.450> get<00:03:12.540> down<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.900> forty<00:03:13.170> six

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
we wanted to get down to forty six

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.440 
we wanted to get down to forty six
percent<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.890> reading<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.400> over<00:03:14.760> at

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
percent it's reading that it's over at

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.790 
percent it's reading that it's over at
this<00:03:15.690> point<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.050> over<00:03:16.230> forty<00:03:16.470> six<00:03:16.650> percent

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
this point it's over forty six percent

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.070 
this point it's over forty six percent
humidity<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.580> there's<00:03:18.420> different<00:03:18.570> controls

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
humidity so there's different controls

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.160 
humidity so there's different controls
on<00:03:19.230> here<00:03:19.380> as<00:03:19.530> far<00:03:19.560> as<00:03:19.800> speeds<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:21.170> anything

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
on here as far as speeds and anything

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.410 
on here as far as speeds and anything
that<00:03:22.200> goes<00:03:22.440> over<00:03:22.950> fifty<00:03:23.850> percent<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.270> actually

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
that goes over fifty percent is actually

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.750 
that goes over fifty percent is actually
a<00:03:24.660> little<00:03:24.840> bit<00:03:24.990> too<00:03:25.110> much<00:03:25.290> for<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.280> house<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.670> we

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
a little bit too much for a house and we

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.400 
a little bit too much for a house and we
start<00:03:26.970> worried<00:03:27.120> about<00:03:27.270> mold<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.930> things<00:03:28.260> like

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
start worried about mold and things like

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.500 
start worried about mold and things like
that<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.700> we'd<00:03:29.820> like<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.030> stay<00:03:30.180> within<00:03:30.390> a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
that so so we'd like to stay within a

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.120 
that so so we'd like to stay within a
healthy<00:03:30.780> humidity<00:03:31.140> level<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.590> one

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
healthy humidity level and this is one

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.150 
healthy humidity level and this is one
of<00:03:32.160> those<00:03:32.250> ways<00:03:32.490> that<00:03:32.700> we<00:03:32.760> can<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:33.000> that
