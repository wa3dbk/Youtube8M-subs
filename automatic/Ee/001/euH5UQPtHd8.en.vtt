00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:16.209
 Hi everyone, it 's the Mami Mun of the Studio. 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:17.450
 We introduce how to make a hidden door to be seen in the second round of Red Stone course this time 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.550
 To do 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:25.640
 What is the first thing you need is a block list 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.090
 Sticky List Sticky Piston Red Stone 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.710
 Red stone repeater 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.740
 It is Redstone torch pressure-sensitive plate 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.380
 Yes 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:40.990
 In Emaa 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:45.790
 Toka or was living something normally make also it home like a good at Toka your home 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:49.420
 Let's go with friends with the multiplayer 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:55.320
 In fact it seems like there is a back room hidden room 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.400
 If you step on this pressure- sensitive board, you will feel as if the chat here opens 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.270
 Yes 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.640
 When you can go in and what's next 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.980
 Enchantment 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.300
 No. 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.310
 The Toka or stashed Toka I in such Fu what you want to hide 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.340
 it can 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.980
 How to make this other system 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 I want to teach this time 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.909
 Yes 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.510
 Well, first of all it's the item I mentioned earlier 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.320
 Block list because anything is fine 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.770
 Redstone p turrets here 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.060
 Take off kiss 1 yes 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.960
 In It is 8 First 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.640
 one two Three 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.000
 Four 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.240
 I do not have to put four directions, but I count four and put them like this 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240
 Yes 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.480
 I agree 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.080
 so 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.080
 As in the case of a little while ago easy to understand This time I was of Honda 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.850
 I feel that let's the yellow-green of the blog puts it this is go here and triggered the person and 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.230
 I value ordering 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.280
 so 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.400
 Next 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.220
 Red Stone Torch put it here 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.490
 Shake up 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.490
 above 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.620
 Block 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.620
 Yes 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.800
 The trick is to make it basic symmetrical as well 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.730
 In yeah yeah 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.730
 Something like this 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.209
 In such a feeling that we are angry 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.459
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.459
 As land shall 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.790
 Oh 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.060
 Yes 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.060
 so 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.980
 Here too 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.980
 I would like to make a switch 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.530
 th 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:03.890
 Yes I was in love with this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.890
 Then put the Red Stone Repeater here next 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:13.140
 No 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.140
 Move Red Stone Repeater And Renew Red Stone Only 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.470
 The 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.810
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.190
 Please connect all the ground this ground 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.540
 Pull the Pettosu 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.840
 Well then 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.490
 Oh dear 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.290
 I want to hide 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.670
 This is the color of the ground 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.490
 That a 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.330
 I put the pants are the place to put on the evening 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.330
 On this side 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.560
 Summertime 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.610
 is not it 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.590
 Oh the Kurtz version 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.600
 That is to say 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.620
 If 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.620
 But I have made quite a tea quickly Yes It is already completed 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.830
 with this 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.270
 It is the completion of the hidden door of the piston door 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.050
 To open the Stone 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.130
 In the game back on here in the room 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:15.210
 I could do something like this 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:19.519
 Yes, I introduced it quite briefly 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:23.620
 It's pretty hard here is red stone's 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:27.560
 Put the block on top 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.090
 Because the block emits a power source, here too 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:36.480
 I mean this pist also moves 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.900
 Yes, the Stone 's Redstone lipid A just as I said it is this in even earlier 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.009
 Absent 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.630
 As I said in the last video 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:45.620
 Red Stone Repeater is what powers the block 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.950
 When pressed 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.210
 This blog is powered 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.650
 If this power and the power stick to each other 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.550
 Here 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.550
 It will be off 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.960
 Different here will disappear east and adding here cooperation 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:12.710
 Yes when violence is added and disappears 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:16.120
 Have gone to Fu such is now in the fact that 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:21.680
 This will power Red Stone and Pizza 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:26.620
 It is not that the open bottom of the high land is to disappear minus 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:33.030
 It is the completion of that degree of dependence to see with this 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.030
 It's easy, so please try it too and let's meet again at the next video 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.020
 Hmm
