00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello my name is ildar usmanov and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.450
 this is jobmax.ru 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.560
 in this lesson we'll talk about 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.740
 how do we do 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.700
 The accordion menu on our site looks 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.020
 she follows 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.240
 here we have 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.620
 separate menu there are items and in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.370
 each of these clauses has sub-clauses 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.140
 and if we click on the menu item 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.780
 then in it we have displayed sub 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.000
 here we are changing how we see the picture 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.000
 we can also customize 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.650
 this is how this menu works 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.580
 let's 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.390
 trim how to do it for this we are with you 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.000
 let's use a special module 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.570
 accordion menu of suit 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.570
 here we download it 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.710
 for its version for example for Joomla 3 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.770
 my case 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.460
 and install the most common way 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.250
 next we are with you 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.120
 going over 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.710
 training module manager and here 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:20.860
 us buttons create a new type appears 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.860
 a module called accordion suit menu 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.380
 and let us analyze the main 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.140
 settings how it all works 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.240
 here we have the most 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.780
 the main thing is to choose a menu which 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.780
 us will be displayed 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.670
 I created specifically for this case 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.090
 menu called accordion menu 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.009
 Looks at us 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:55.149
 look for the menu accordion menu 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:58.030
 that is, we have separate sub item 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:04.060
 Accordion 1 menu has nested 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:06.400
 accordion 1 2 3 and everything is the same 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.920
 rest 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.330
 in order to make an embedded item 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.020
 menu, we are here to indicate 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.020
 parent element 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.710
 Now 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.550
 I'm crossing 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:28.440
 a module manager extension 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.440
 and we parse the basic settings 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.150
 I press 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.150
 to give 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.250
 Accordion suit menu 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:44.370
 didn't start choosing a position for example i 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:51.030
 I choose right now 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.030
 title for example accordion menu 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.600
 Further 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.670
 Here we'll choose the 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.870
 in the menu which will be broadcast in 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.799
 this module is the initial level 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.580
 that is, from what level of nesting us 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.200
 start off 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.870
 let's try to keep it 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.870
 place and see what we did 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.870
 updated 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.340
 let me previous off every 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.340
 happening 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:36.830
 We look and look like this 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.330
 Cardin menu without different pictures then 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.140

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.480

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:53.100
 check and changed the pictures for this i 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.100

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.040
 here am I 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.060
