00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.070
 Russian national team 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.930
 gymnastics in the strongest composition 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.940
 took part in the national championship 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.450
 which took place in samara according to 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.389
 Reno Unified Team Head Coach 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.070
 recognized radio leaders such 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.410
 the competition represented 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.990
 test start before the Moscow Grand Prix 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.359
 at 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.239
 well and in the spotlight the audience as always 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.939
 was the Olympic champion evgenia 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.769
 Kanaeva 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.039
 Olympic champion 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.020
 major trends 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.500
 angular 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500
 no no who 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.430
 makers of affairs portrait of olympic 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.830
 champions evgenii kanaeva 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.930
 editorial assignment with which it seems 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.330
 even a novice reporter could handle 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.560
 how to cope in the warm-up room and 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.659
 immediately a question 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.589
 how to capture the one who is hiding from 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.929
 camcorder as accurate as possible 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.079
 transfer of this triple to live from 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.079
 of journalists 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.120
 I do not like for the duration of the competition 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.070
 Yes, and the media mafia often give mykaze on 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 others having vanin I don't know but 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.040
 I think I need to shoot on the roles 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.450
 Alexander Aspen 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.530
 Well, forcibly nice you will not be creating a video 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.990
 portraits will have to rely on 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.790
 capabilities of the modern coccyx and 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.820
 draw on the sayings of people from 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.270
 world of art 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.789
 gymnastics 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.950
 so what is she Eugene Kanaeva in three words 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.950
 three times start from the masses 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.820
 after three days 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.780
 smart beautiful of it 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.670
 in 2009 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.670
 in the end, h 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.310
 completely solved 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.190
 star fever 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.420
 she doesn't even have one 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.370
 little further 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.690
 the second 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.330
 this is a gymnast 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.800
 who wholeheartedly loves artistic 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.169
 gymnastics and understands 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.189
 that suspicion is the most important thing 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.009
 work 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.919
 Dmitry Cherkasov 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.039
 channel traffic 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.099
 should be two-time 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.609
 Olympic champion 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.799
 very positive image 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.469
 naturally was negative 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.349
 Olympic Beijing gold would go to 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.709
 another gymnast 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.340
 on warm up Kanaeva indeed 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.200
 centered down 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.519
 exchange short replicas 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.389
 coaches matter they language however if 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.560
 desire arises can fool around 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.129
 but again short and to the point 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.359
 any operator attempt 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.129
 close up kanaeva ends 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.129
 the same phrase 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.989
 Baku 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.650
 new program new sensations new 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.940
 run them new errors 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.150
 not everything is smooth and now she does not hide it 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.950
 disappointment seems like a capital 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.300
 soothingly the words the coach leaves in 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.450
 without attention 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.830
 one more observation of children is not capable 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.980
 get used to new circumstances 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.800
 concept of a few hours what the operator 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.420
 still not lag behind stroking his tape 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.910
 no longer paying attention to 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.089
 camcorder located just 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.909
 few centimeters 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.640
 new program denied 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.510
 another batch of autographs Rosnano 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.230
 so how correct is all the same and Eugene 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.949
 Kanaeva 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.129
 three pictures you need to ask 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.129
 what he knows about himself more than others 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.179
 this is democracy 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:43.179
 I had other plans sometimes not 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.879
 I replied 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.040
 not yet developed by yet another 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.289
 strongest lead sport samara
