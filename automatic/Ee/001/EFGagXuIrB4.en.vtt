00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.669
 home 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.560
 then 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560

 they are part of the used vintage hp clothing either - had been 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.290
 belong to the past 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.540
 it is here at the land system once upon a time it is proposed by many exhibitors who 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.900
 they come from all over Italy and offer clothing 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.130
 accessories ranging from the 50s to the 80s are designer garments or with 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.220
 finishing is tailoring you love rods 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.569
 high fashion victim 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:58.199
 but also simply people who want to create a style 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.679
 really personal because they can find truly unique items 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.450
 browsing through the various exhibitors of vintage objects 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.180
 you can really find a large number of items and clothing 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.399

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.520
 necklaces various types of jewels in short, and so on and so forth 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.909
 agents can belong to a more distant past with me and refined 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.330
 20s clothes 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.990
 I have a somewhat more recent past than those of the fabulous 60s 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.159
 the fact is that ironing for this sector is with me 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.189
 mary open the grandmother's trunk and I learn that not only clothes are found 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.850
 and various objects of the past 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.180
 but we also rediscover our roots, our history and ours 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.870
 emotions 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.570
 lovers of these is not sought after 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.580
 unique ether original pieces stand out and to create their own personal style 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.190
 but let's find out more about vintage from those who made one 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.190
 passion indeed wonder and own lifestyle 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.199
 we reached the maria luisa nomad new fashion vintage hostel 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
 I wanted to ask what his typical customers are 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:27.279
 the mind mind 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.719
 You can believe in you mentees in two categories 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.429
 the little girls 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:38.119
 because they have never known the fashion of the past so they are 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.349
 fascinated by all that 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.450
 if it is a duty, call that in reality vintage is now very trendy and is 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.749
 at the highest levels be ladies of a certain age of a certain class who do not 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:53.809
 they can find more in the shops if you don't like big names 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.809
 pieces that really 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:58.299
 baby 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.539
 nico beautiful materials 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.289
 m timeless 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:07.699
 these are my 2 categories mainly and about the piece 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.899
 impossible to find where word-of-mouth is plotted 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.659
 daily spasmodic research 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:21.359
 some friends who call me about the ladies who may have found ho 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.779
 seen 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.779
 and the attendance of many markets 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.790
 and privately because in this moment, unfortunately, private individuals also have 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.519
 this kind of problem here 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.719
 many propose themselves bring me their things I choose 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.819
 the choice is very difficult because it is among many things maybe you find the 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.159
 price unavailable l the gem that 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.419
 never would you have imagined to find 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.509
 you know something ovo 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:52.239
 the technician at the particular teatroteam who were particularly fashionable in this 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.459
 moment this moment all chanel 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.519
 anything chanel 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.790
 from the bags to the glasses to the shoe ladders, all off 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.499
 chanel 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:08.180
 And then all the greatest biggest cd boot signatures obviously set to tweet 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:09.049
 Don 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.009
 these are the things that mostly go the most 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:16.349
 do you see any of the most important snakes yes for example speaking 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.299
 of chanel 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.599
 up I for example found the 2 55 which is the first quilted chanel takes the 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.070
 name from the date you meet the phoenix 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.569
 in February 55 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.319
 from her then later came out all the scenes between those with the episodes 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.199
 civil coffee of the 80s 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.699
 and she is characterized by the fact 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.560
 put that his eyelashes were embroidered inside and outside he had nothing 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.020
 xenon 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.300
 the classic among. who made her or 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.830
 and what can I say defend these are wooden stops are very old fendi 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.849
 they are practically impossible to find at what age they are part of another 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.889
 these should belong about in the early 70s procurement of the 70s 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.550
 because I inquired 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.480
 and I'm 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.689
 obor see me 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.689
 unique pieces because each one was made 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.849
 assembled and made 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.639
 unco special materials such as the wood that then fendi no longer has 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.059
 repeated 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:17.490
 but 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.530
 there
