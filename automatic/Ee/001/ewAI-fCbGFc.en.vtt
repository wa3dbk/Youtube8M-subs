00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.770
 video i will teach you the basis 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.050
 california punk rock 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.389
 This video is designed primarily for 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.750
 newbies 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:19.109
 for those people who are not yet able 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.730
 play the guitar here but it is very 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.460
 like punk rock and they would like 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.910
 learn him to play punk rock this is very 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.300
 simple music and learn to play quite 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.610
 really a few days and so on than 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.790
 being built along each other flows 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.180
 above all on the reef reef fry 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.980
 much easier than chord usually 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.079
 beginners painful legal but 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.110
 the cutting of the reef there so if we 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.059
 we want to start playing now in detail 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.680
 we can fully learn in a week 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:59.190
 having mastered the reef and so standard 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:04.409
 punk rocker reef is how it is done 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.000
 when played it shrinks means two 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.290
 two fingers are taken 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.200
 shrinks on the fifth fret 5 string on 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.360
 seventh fret 4 strings here they are 1 2 here 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.979
 It turned out to be like that with fingers 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.860
 squeezed was full for what was compressed 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.320
 tightly carry over the same 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.130
 design on the ears stage that is on 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.810
 sixth 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.810
 and 5 days 1 time 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.320
 then we bring the same design 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.510
 at 2 water left 1 2 that is at 3 and at 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:50.750
 fifth fret and back to the right 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.750
 cut it turned out we have 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:04.170
 referred to as the battle to play as a rule of 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.050
 the road is very simple fight 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.459
 take if we are not quite newbies yet 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.820
 I can use the pick 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.190
 just two fingers of the right hand 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.739
 we cross and like a pinch of salt 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.739
 here to index finger a lot 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:25.260
 stood for the thumb here and beat on 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.980
 two strings the point is that not 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.470
 to touch 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.980
 other string except that the two are 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.980
 we pinch 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.590
 next we have this little finger here yes 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.220
 it is as if we are sticking out here somehow 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.930
 not good here what are we doing with him we 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.270
 take and put it on the hole in which 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.730
 we have a ring finger that is but 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.770
 on the underside of the nameless that is 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.320
 right here on 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:11.920
 in this reef it will be the third string on 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.810
 7 characters 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.000
 and we get iron from three strings 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.660
 further, even the design itself goes over 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.660
 us up 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:32.430
 further in two mode 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.430
 left and back for 2 fret showa 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.079
 try 50 times like this 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:44.890
 fighting 8 times two three 4 5 six 7 8 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:49.950
 times two three 4 5 six 7 8 times two three 4 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.950
 5 six 7 8 times two three 4 5 6 7 8 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:04:06.689
 yes I like pan cancer how is it done when darling 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:10.480
 you know, yes, this is how this is done 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:15.040
 the palm of the right hand is taken here 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.849
 this garbage is just not a miracle not 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.460
 snuggles up just put gently up 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:26.110
 softly-softly fingers here's the thing Doe 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.340
 squeezed reef here and here for these three 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.340
 the strings that we actually clamp and 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.340
 volume 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:56.950
 Here we have a simple 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:00.310
 punk tune yes here we can now 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.020
 compose some simple pac melodies 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.380
 maybe they will be useful in the future 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.470

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.820
