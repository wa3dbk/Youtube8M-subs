2000 this is a quick breakdown of the

2000 this is a quick breakdown of the

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
development of our figure City Mo Vaughn

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.099 
development of our figure City Mo Vaughn
from<00:00:17.050> 1962<00:00:18.050> all<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:18.679> way<00:00:18.769> up<00:00:18.859> to<00:00:19.000> 20<00:00:20.000> 55<00:00:20.570> we're

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
from 1962 all the way up to 20 55 we're

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.339 
from 1962 all the way up to 20 55 we're
pretty<00:00:21.289> much<00:00:21.410> skipping<00:00:21.890> a<00:00:21.980> bunch<00:00:22.160> of<00:00:22.279> the

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
pretty much skipping a bunch of the

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.710 
pretty much skipping a bunch of the
growth<00:00:24.349> cycle<00:00:25.009> of<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:25.339> city<00:00:25.609> so<00:00:25.939> that<00:00:25.970> you

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
growth cycle of the city so that you

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.749 
growth cycle of the city so that you
don't<00:00:26.869> have<00:00:26.929> to<00:00:27.019> sit<00:00:27.230> around<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:27.650> watch<00:00:27.919> every

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
don't have to sit around and watch every

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.619 
don't have to sit around and watch every
single<00:00:29.119> minute<00:00:29.269> of<00:00:29.419> the<00:00:29.539> game<00:00:30.669> it's<00:00:31.669> already

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
single minute of the game it's already

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.020 
single minute of the game it's already
kind<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.140> boring<00:00:33.710> game<00:00:34.190> begin<00:00:34.610> with<00:00:34.789> to

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
kind of a boring game begin with to

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.849 
kind of a boring game begin with to
watch<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:36.670> we<00:00:37.670> might<00:00:37.879> as<00:00:37.910> well<00:00:38.350> add<00:00:39.350> events

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
watch so we might as well add events

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:45.009 
watch so we might as well add events
time<00:00:40.160> forward<00:00:40.760> for<00:00:41.059> you<00:00:42.850> it'll<00:00:43.850> pretty<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.449> lot

time forward for you it'll pretty a lot

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.900 
time forward for you it'll pretty a lot
of<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.800> shots<00:00:46.039> will<00:00:46.280> be<00:00:46.309> taken<00:00:46.579> from<00:00:46.640> this

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
of the shots will be taken from this

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.060 
of the shots will be taken from this
angle<00:00:47.180> right<00:00:47.510> here<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:48.289> can<00:00:48.500> kind<00:00:48.829> of<00:00:48.890> see

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
angle right here so you can kind of see

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.310 
angle right here so you can kind of see
everything<00:00:49.789> spreading<00:00:50.210> out<00:00:50.300> from<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:50.750> main

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
that little sign that pops up there is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.100 
that little sign that pops up there is
the<00:00:58.080> marker<00:00:59.040> that<00:00:59.160> i<00:00:59.220> use<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.490> counter<00:01:00.110> signify

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
the marker that i use to counter signify

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.049 
the marker that i use to counter signify
the<00:01:01.170> little<00:01:01.740> the<00:01:01.860> screen

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
if you turned off disasters it's not

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.190 
if you turned off disasters it's not
really<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.880> big<00:01:31.180> deal<00:01:31.240> at<00:01:31.570> all<00:01:31.690> you'll<00:01:32.050> just

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
really a big deal at all you'll just

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.880 
really a big deal at all you'll just
have<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.500> occasional<00:01:32.950> explosion<00:01:33.640> but<00:01:34.330> a

turn-off<00:01:35.890> disasters<00:01:36.730> is<00:01:36.940> kind<00:01:37.120> of<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.330> easy

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
turn-off disasters is kind of the easy

turn-off disasters is kind of the easy
way<00:01:38.110> out<00:01:38.700> makes<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.850> game<00:01:40.000> entirely

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
way out makes the game entirely

way out makes the game entirely
non-challenging

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.950 

you'll<00:01:48.259> get<00:01:49.259> state<00:01:49.560> capital<00:01:50.240> you'll<00:01:51.240> notice

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
you'll get state capital you'll notice

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.469 
you'll get state capital you'll notice
that<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.490> any<00:01:53.820> buildings<00:01:54.270> around

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
that if you have any buildings around

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.380 
that if you have any buildings around
your<00:01:54.689> airport<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.590> they<00:01:56.039> tend<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.789> cause<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> lot

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
your airport it they tend to cause a lot

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.050 
your airport it they tend to cause a lot
of<00:01:57.420> problems<00:01:57.899> because<00:01:58.700> especially<00:01:59.700> dent

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
of problems because especially dent

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.230 
of problems because especially dent
zones<00:02:00.420> you'll<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:01.020> building<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:02.030> there<00:02:03.030> are

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
zones you'll get building that there are

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.790 
zones you'll get building that there are
much<00:02:03.720> taller<00:02:04.229> than<00:02:04.470> they<00:02:05.009> need<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
much taller than they need to be and

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.400 
much taller than they need to be and
airplanes<00:02:08.800> will<00:02:09.210> not<00:02:10.210> correct<00:02:10.810> for<00:02:10.930> this<00:02:11.200> in

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
airplanes will not correct for this in

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.470 
airplanes will not correct for this in
any<00:02:11.500> way<00:02:11.620> they<00:02:12.070> will<00:02:12.190> merely<00:02:12.580> run<00:02:13.060> into<00:02:13.330> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
any way they will merely run into the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
any way they will merely run into the
sides<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.260> buildings<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:16.020> want<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.110> say<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.410> it

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
sides of buildings I want to say that it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.790 
sides of buildings I want to say that it
probably<00:02:17.770> eight<00:02:18.070> good<00:02:19.020> four<00:02:20.020> or<00:02:20.050> five

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
assume as a bug well it's not even

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.300 
assume as a bug well it's not even
technically<00:02:37.150> a

technically a

technically a
bug<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.170> it's<00:02:40.470> probably<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.310> an<00:02:41.610> air

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
bug in that it's probably just an air

somewhere anyway we start to build out

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.090 
somewhere anyway we start to build out
where<00:03:12.150> from<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.600> course<00:03:13.049> central<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.950> the

city in yep sure enough another fire
breaks<00:03:16.860> out<00:03:18.170> this<00:03:19.170> one's<00:03:19.440> pretty<00:03:19.830> nasty<00:03:20.340> but

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
breaks out this one's pretty nasty but

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.809 
breaks out this one's pretty nasty but
once<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.380> start<00:03:22.620> getting<00:03:22.650> huge<00:03:23.250> fires<00:03:23.549> like

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
once you start getting huge fires like

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.759 
once you start getting huge fires like
this<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.299> get<00:03:24.510> any<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.140> get<00:03:25.319> out<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.440> hand

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
this you get any to just get out of hand

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.550 
this you get any to just get out of hand
the<00:03:26.610> easiest<00:03:27.239> way<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.480> deal<00:03:27.720> with<00:03:27.810> them<00:03:28.049> is<00:03:28.290> to

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the easiest way to deal with them is to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.250 
the easiest way to deal with them is to
bulldoze<00:03:29.220> around<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.640> perimeter<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.330> then

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
bulldoze around the perimeter and then

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.360 
bulldoze around the perimeter and then
you<00:03:31.500> can<00:03:31.650> start<00:03:31.890> moving<00:03:32.580> your

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
you can start moving your

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.940 
you can start moving your
about<00:03:33.730> firefighters<00:03:34.269> in<00:03:34.599> do<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.959> take<00:03:35.739> care

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
about firefighters in do you take care

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.470 
about firefighters in do you take care
of<00:03:35.980> anything<00:03:36.310> on<00:03:36.580> me<00:03:36.760> outside

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.880 

then<00:03:41.080> when<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.379> kind<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.590> Whittle<00:03:41.800> it<00:03:41.830> down

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
then when you kind of Whittle it down

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.979 
then when you kind of Whittle it down
you<00:03:42.340> notice<00:03:42.670> there's<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.030> large<00:03:43.269> patch<00:03:43.720> of

you notice there's a large patch of

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.690 
you notice there's a large patch of
empty<00:03:44.530> space<00:03:44.650> there<00:03:45.010> than<00:03:45.220> that<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.489> city

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
sure you take out the roads because yeah

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.890 
sure you take out the roads because yeah
they<00:04:53.240> seem<00:04:54.110> very<00:04:54.140> very<00:04:54.920> flammable<00:04:55.220> for<00:04:55.900> rock

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
they seem very very flammable for rock

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.840 
they seem very very flammable for rock
and<00:04:56.930> cement<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:59.980> yep<00:05:00.980> another<00:05:01.280> fire<00:05:01.610> breaks

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
and cement and yep another fire breaks

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.920 
and cement and yep another fire breaks
out

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.830 

it's<00:05:06.620> it's<00:05:07.039> almost<00:05:07.310> hilarious<00:05:08.090> sometimes<00:05:08.330> to

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
it's it's almost hilarious sometimes to

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.370 
it's it's almost hilarious sometimes to
watch

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
watch

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.710 
watch
and<00:05:10.770> see<00:05:11.220> just<00:05:11.550> how<00:05:11.730> long<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.090> takes<00:05:12.420> for

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
and see just how long it takes for

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.930 
and see just how long it takes for
another<00:05:13.590> plane<00:05:13.920> to<00:05:14.100> crash<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.760> would<00:05:14.910> think

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
another plane to crash you would think

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.720 
another plane to crash you would think
that<00:05:15.390> maybe<00:05:16.260> they<00:05:16.770> might<00:05:16.950> hire<00:05:17.190> some<00:05:17.580> better

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
that maybe they might hire some better

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.700 
that maybe they might hire some better
pilots<00:05:18.210> or<00:05:19.490> perhaps<00:05:20.990> you<00:05:21.990> know<00:05:22.080> maybe<00:05:22.470> some

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
pilots or perhaps you know maybe some

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.820 
pilots or perhaps you know maybe some
training<00:05:23.520> maybe<00:05:24.180> maybe<00:05:24.900> they<00:05:25.230> need<00:05:25.380> to<00:05:25.500> check

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
training maybe maybe they need to check

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.980 
training maybe maybe they need to check
some<00:05:26.100> maintenance<00:05:26.970> logs<00:05:27.390> on<00:05:27.630> these<00:05:27.780> things

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
some maintenance logs on these things

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.920 
some maintenance logs on these things
but<00:05:28.380> I<00:05:29.160> don't<00:05:29.490> know<00:05:29.580> what<00:05:29.790> it<00:05:29.940> is<00:05:30.060> but<00:05:30.090> they

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
but I don't know what it is but they

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.780 
but I don't know what it is but they
just<00:05:31.320> can't<00:05:31.590> keep<00:05:31.860> these<00:05:32.070> damn<00:05:32.310> things<00:05:32.340> in<00:05:32.700> the

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
just can't keep these damn things in the

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.990 
just can't keep these damn things in the
sky<00:05:33.290> now<00:05:34.290> that's<00:05:34.470> 20<00:05:34.770> 47<00:05:35.040> we<00:05:35.550> should<00:05:35.700> we<00:05:35.970> should

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
sky now that's 20 47 we should we should

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.260 
sky now that's 20 47 we should we should
have<00:05:36.390> some<00:05:36.690> better<00:05:36.930> technology<00:05:37.770> by<00:05:38.430> now<00:05:38.610> that

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
have some better technology by now that

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.570 
have some better technology by now that
it<00:05:39.500> prevent<00:05:40.500> this<00:05:40.680> thing<00:05:40.920> this<00:05:41.220> stuff<00:05:41.460> from

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
it prevent this thing this stuff from

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.430 
it prevent this thing this stuff from
happening<00:05:41.730> but<00:05:43.100> no<00:05:44.100> they<00:05:44.760> continue<00:05:45.210> on<00:05:45.440> to

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
happening but no they continue on to

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.070 
happening but no they continue on to
this<00:05:46.590> day<00:05:47.120> planes<00:05:48.120> are<00:05:48.270> falling<00:05:48.660> on<00:05:48.810> this<00:05:48.900> guy

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
this day planes are falling on this guy

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.670 
this day planes are falling on this guy
for<00:05:49.110> no<00:05:50.070> apparent<00:05:50.490> reason

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.890 

hmm<00:05:53.690> but<00:05:54.690> yeah<00:05:54.870> the<00:05:55.669> hydroelectric<00:05:56.669> dam<00:05:57.539> wall

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
hmm but yeah the hydroelectric dam wall

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.760 
hmm but yeah the hydroelectric dam wall
right<00:05:58.289> there<00:05:58.970> will<00:05:59.970> continue<00:06:00.449> to<00:06:00.600> grow<00:06:00.870> along

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
right there will continue to grow along

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.999 
right there will continue to grow along
with<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.039> e<00:06:02.070> size<00:06:02.520> of<00:06:02.669> our<00:06:02.820> population

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
with the e size of our population

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.330 
with the e size of our population
because<00:06:05.900> let's<00:06:06.900> face<00:06:07.020> it<00:06:07.350> we<00:06:07.800> need<00:06:08.039> all

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
because let's face it we need all

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.580 
because let's face it we need all
electricity<00:06:09.060> we<00:06:09.360> can<00:06:09.479> get<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.840> I<00:06:10.169> really

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
electricity we can get and I really

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.920 
electricity we can get and I really
don't<00:06:10.770> feel<00:06:10.919> like<00:06:11.009> messing<00:06:11.400> around<00:06:11.639> every<00:06:12.120> 50

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
don't feel like messing around every 50

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.189 
don't feel like messing around every 50
years<00:06:13.169> with<00:06:13.410> making<00:06:13.830> a<00:06:13.889> new<00:06:14.009> one<00:06:15.080> all<00:06:16.080> right

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
years with making a new one all right

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.830 
years with making a new one all right
for<00:06:16.500> next<00:06:16.919> time<00:06:17.039> I'll<00:06:17.550> look<00:06:18.300> into<00:06:18.539> some<00:06:18.720> of<00:06:18.750> the

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
for next time I'll look into some of the

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.640 
for next time I'll look into some of the
technology<00:06:19.289> we<00:06:19.470> picked<00:06:19.680> up<00:06:19.860> between<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:21.870> two

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
technology we picked up between the two

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.950 
technology we picked up between the two
dates

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.050 

hopefully<00:06:25.560> we'll<00:06:25.770> show<00:06:26.100> offs<00:06:26.220> new<00:06:26.490> buildings

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
hopefully we'll show offs new buildings

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.620 
hopefully we'll show offs new buildings
tell<00:06:27.780> them<00:06:27.960> this<00:06:28.650> is<00:06:28.860> amp<00:06:29.100> and<00:06:29.360> have<00:06:30.360> a<00:06:30.389> good

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
tell them this is amp and have a good

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.750 
tell them this is amp and have a good
one
