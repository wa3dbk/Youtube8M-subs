00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.810
 the fears exactly not the things 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.720
 when they do not depend on one 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.150
 they are not afraid 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.880
 I'm not afraid at all because I stayed 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.210
 little time in charge man I'm 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.020
 convinced I have an opinion in the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.330
 sense that precautionary measures 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.050
 they will continue because that is what it seems 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.510
 that dictates common sense 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.470
 although obviously common sense 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.720
 sometimes it goes in one direction and the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.240
 legal requirements go they go in another 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.950
 we are working as not 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.100
 it can be otherwise as if nothing 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.130
 out to happen the sample is this 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.650
 signing because we believe that is what 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.390
 deserves betis that we continue working 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.670
 because we are working to 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.770
 a club that is 100 years old and so 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.740
 less has lasted another 100 years more not 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.330
 we can not at all for our work 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.280
 we have to keep doing it with the 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.970
 same or more ambition than in any 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.970
 other circumstances 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.820
 rafa and a little bit in a funny way 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.760
 has given a little understanding what is the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.580
 ambition of this club the ambition that 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.170
 obviously represents this control 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.960
 with what we have we as 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.690
 professionals the speech of the champions 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.760
 and I like to listen to the music of the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.620
 champions and will listen to it so many times 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.360
 that now a little bit lacking 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.420
 but really the message that we have 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.550
 to give is little by little by stage that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.820
 we have to grow up I said 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.970
 also in the presentation 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.800
 the objective is not permanence 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.170
 the stability is different than 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.500
 means staying in the first division 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.950
 of a certain and far from fear of 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.830
 lose the category away from fear 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.479
 far from feeling the fire that burns you 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.080
 good that we built another position the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.459
 starting point for other objectives 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.980
 logically this will have been achieved 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.330
 little what rafael pasta company a 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.940
 little bit the same thing that I also 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.440
 listen to the music of the champions and the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.680
 firecrackers that throw when they reach the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.050
 glasses and we missed it and a little the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.720
 same challenge that for him is for me as 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.060
 professional and for this advice you 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.680
 will take Swiss to high quotas of 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.780
 according to your social dimension 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.020
 it's a bit the requirement that we have to 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.020
 to have 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.569
 I look at the answer you can even 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.209
 seem repetitive so many times here there 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.370
 a starting point where we are 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.840
 all agree is to say that the betis 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.180
 that we have by place for the soccer player 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.340
 to keep growing let's not forget 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.440
 that he is a very young player because 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.910
 we are talking about danny ceballos and not 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.550
 we have to forget we have so and 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.500
 zeballos I believe that the betis has to 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.090
 work a lot with the footballer to 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.340
 help you become a 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.500
 player more important than it is 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.850
 demonstrating why the potential has it 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.090
 and therefore it is also a 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.239
 our responsibility 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.220
 on the other hand the boy the your environment you 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.950
 family will also continue that place 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.690
 ideal for this is the betis therefore 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.180
 The boy also worked as a tuca 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.239
 they also understand it here I think that 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.700
 it was a matter of brief because it is 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.970
 logically with our nuances or 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.420
 when we always try to side 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.040
 our by logically doing things 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.560
 the best possible part of the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.989
 footballer logically doing something more 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.579
 by the player but the basis by which 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.579
 what we have already tried 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.489
 many times 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.680
 adds the president so many times 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.530
 may announce 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.569
 me with adam personally immediately 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.730
 we finished the last game had a 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.160
 conversation 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:12.460
 much more where the footballer lent me 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.380
 your total commitment to this club that is 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.209
 something that for me as sports director 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.019
 It is essential because it is also 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.370
 fundamental for the entracer is to say 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.740
 this player that we have in the goal 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.930
 logically he is thinking about the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.000
 betis from there he had a 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.320
 conversation with your representative and 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.720
 Well, I just asked them to tell us 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.420
 they gave the time 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.610
 now that we need to work for 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.220
 take forward the construction of this 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.680
 first project and that later with 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.590
 the tranquility and attention it deserves 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.470
 Adam we will talk about your situation I think 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.170
 Adam's performance has been very 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.660
 good adam and that a few ports to come 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.330
 to the betis we must recognize it therefore 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.950
 your situation with the time it deserves 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.790
 to be served now is a moment 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.070
 frantic another moment of our 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.540
 worry is in another need us 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.610
 we forget the importance that can 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.700
 have a player like adam i think that 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.070
 these kinds of situations have their 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.710
 due time because they deserve respect 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.620
 also more than writing communicate 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.730
 you are focused on the player himself and what 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.320
 they understood perfectly 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.730
 share share that the moment 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.250
 Hector is now that we are with the club 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:33.100
 logically in time they have another 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.290
 priority but not an importance for 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.780
 both with its due time and with the 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.240
 time they deserve 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.730
 we have a pretty good rating 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.040
 depth of all the footballers who 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.440
 the betis has available ie 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.750
 that incorporate returning from an olive 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.570
 that they have right now here in 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.790
 seville with the betis shirt not us 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.060
 changes the planning for 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.060
 nothing
