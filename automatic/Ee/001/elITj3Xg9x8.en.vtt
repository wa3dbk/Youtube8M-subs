00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.889
 look at me, it has been my turn to drive 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.730

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.360
 thank you very much for letting me be part 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.430
 of this really cute that is a 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.309
 privilege to be able to share with 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.089
 you to say 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:49.860
 So we say goodbye to the family of 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.860
 telethon 2014 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.280
 well first now they are 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 42 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.650
 I do not know if the public has a 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.330
 very slight clue that I said that I 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.810
 I was not going to go until we will not reach 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.810
 the goal and what do you think I'm here 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.079
 in the flesh and bone to me now there are 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.209
 to keep in mind that we have passed 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:40.399
 worried hours and at certain times 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:44.319
 of the transmission two three four five 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:47.479
 in the afternoon we actually saw that 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.299
 too much uphill then you can 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.230
 improving thanks to god but everything 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.750
 receive in that the town 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.320
 take the attitude that is waiting 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.400
 that each one determines I will help 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.970
 to do it I want to do it 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.590
 They make willy when when we started 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.880
 be this telethon adventure the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.130
 savior of the star 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.040
 we had a million colones and we said 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.310
 in a quixote it is impossible to achieve 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.160
 today we are looking for one million 805 thousand 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.520
 106 thousand dollars 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.620
 and it's much bigger than ever I could 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.810
 Sizing responsibility 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.400
 popular alternative because companies 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.890
 they do everything they can think that the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.300
 Cupcakes is not always for cards 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.610
 clear and the responsibility of each 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.100
 person that you have not seen before 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.830
 cameras but they have broken the spine 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.780
 these 27 hours from previous months 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.600
 doing activities activities of 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.840
 fundraising allow us suddenly 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.390
 get to this moment 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.450
 and it's very important because there are three 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.280
 centers together that depending on this 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.750
 that we're going to sing all together 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.330
 then all the savior and I'm going to 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.350
 ask them to stand up please 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.510
 depending on this the telethon work 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.269
 is still going 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.209
 public standing there we have them all 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.879
 our audience stand up and it's time 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.299
 beautiful in which we unite the voices in the 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.980
 moment in which then and to the hours 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.290
 the artists arrived 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.659

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.450

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.670
