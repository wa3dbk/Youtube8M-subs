00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
thinking when it comes to politics

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.740 
thinking when it comes to politics
uh-huh<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:44.459> agree<00:03:45.329> with<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.510> lot<00:03:45.599> of

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
uh-huh and I agree with a lot of

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.680 
uh-huh and I agree with a lot of
Hillary's<00:03:46.230> policies<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.970> do<00:03:48.090> agree<00:03:48.569> with

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
Hillary's policies and I do agree with

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.140 
Hillary's policies and I do agree with
repealing<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:50.430> Bill<00:03:50.609> of<00:03:50.730> Rights<00:03:50.880> not

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
repealing the Bill of Rights not

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.020 
repealing the Bill of Rights not
entirely<00:03:51.590> but<00:03:52.590> some<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.519> does<00:03:53.700> need<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:53.940> be

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
entirely but some of it does need to be

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.830 
entirely but some of it does need to be
repealed<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:54.720> I'm<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.900> pro<00:03:55.769> black<00:03:56.010> person<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.390> I

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
repealed but I'm a pro black person so I

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.809 
repealed but I'm a pro black person so I
come<00:03:58.230> from<00:03:58.349> an<00:03:58.530> aspect<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.310> little<00:03:59.640> cool

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
aspect that relies on justice and then

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.170 
aspect that relies on justice and then
