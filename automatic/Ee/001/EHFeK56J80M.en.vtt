00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
oh and there was something really odd

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.630 
oh and there was something really odd
about<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.090> way<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.299> was<00:01:57.420> packaged<00:01:57.899> inside<00:01:58.640> Ben

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
about the way it was packaged inside Ben

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.149 
about the way it was packaged inside Ben
came<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:00.960> plastic<00:02:01.409> thing<00:02:01.890> which

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
came in this little plastic thing which

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.800 
came in this little plastic thing which
made<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.549> look<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.729> maybe<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:03.750> were

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
made it look like maybe they were

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.270 
made it look like maybe they were
thinking<00:02:03.899> about<00:02:04.229> putting<00:02:04.439> him<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.829> book<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
thinking about putting him in a book and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.210 
thinking about putting him in a book and
then<00:02:06.149> they<00:02:06.899> were<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.079> both<00:02:07.680> stuck<00:02:08.039> inside

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
then they were just both stuck inside

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.600 
then they were just both stuck inside
this<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.560> bard<00:02:10.560> didn't<00:02:11.039> have<00:02:11.190> us

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
this so bard didn't have us

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.490 
this so bard didn't have us
so<00:02:11.760> package<00:02:12.300> which<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> little<00:02:12.930> odd<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
so package which was a little odd that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.370 
so package which was a little odd that
one<00:02:13.770> was<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.280> one<00:02:14.400> wasn't<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.020> anyway<00:02:16.020> like<00:02:16.230> I

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380
