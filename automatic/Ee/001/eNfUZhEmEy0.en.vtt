good pump with those 21 so we're gonna

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.990 
good pump with those 21 so we're gonna
go<00:03:26.290> hit<00:03:26.680> some<00:03:26.739> cables<00:03:27.250> mix<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.760> up<00:03:27.879> a<00:03:27.970> little

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
go hit some cables mix it up a little

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:50.240 
go hit some cables mix it up a little
bit<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.590> shock<00:03:29.590> those<00:03:29.799> muscles

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.949 

so<00:03:51.250> with<00:03:51.549> those<00:03:51.760> cable<00:03:52.120> exercises<00:03:52.780> you

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
so with those cable exercises you

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.330 
so with those cable exercises you
probably<00:03:53.230> noticed<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.709> my<00:03:53.920> reps<00:03:54.099> were<00:03:54.310> a

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
probably noticed that my reps were a

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.339 
probably noticed that my reps were a
little<00:03:54.610> lower<00:03:54.879> like<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.870> mentioned<00:03:56.230> earlier

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
little lower like I mentioned earlier

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.140 
little lower like I mentioned earlier
I'm<00:03:56.860> definitely<00:03:57.340> trying<00:03:57.489> to<00:03:57.640> stick<00:03:57.879> with<00:03:58.030> some

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
I'm definitely trying to stick with some

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.240 
I'm definitely trying to stick with some
heavier<00:03:58.480> weight<00:03:58.780> well<00:03:59.080> my<00:03:59.260> carbs<00:03:59.620> my<00:03:59.799> calories

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
heavier weight well my carbs my calories

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.979 
heavier weight well my carbs my calories
are<00:04:00.370> higher<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:00.819> my<00:04:00.910> energy<00:04:01.330> levels<00:04:01.629> feeling

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
are higher and my energy levels feeling

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.020 
are higher and my energy levels feeling
great<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.470> really<00:04:02.680> want<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.340> take<00:04:03.459> advantage<00:04:03.610> of

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
great I really want to take advantage of

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.780 
great I really want to take advantage of
that<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.870> definitely<00:04:05.319> hit<00:04:05.950> some<00:04:06.310> higher

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
that so I definitely hit some higher

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.839 
that so I definitely hit some higher
weight<00:04:07.090> lower<00:04:07.420> rep<00:04:07.720> on<00:04:07.930> those<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.579> now<00:04:09.579> for<00:04:09.819> a

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
weight lower rep on those and now for a

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.270 
weight lower rep on those and now for a
finisher<00:04:10.299> I'm<00:04:11.079> gonna<00:04:11.290> do<00:04:11.440> some<00:04:11.620> band<00:04:11.799> work<00:04:12.010> for

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
finisher I'm gonna do some band work for

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.930 
finisher I'm gonna do some band work for
my<00:04:12.370> biceps

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
my biceps

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.339 
my biceps
I<00:04:13.000> think<00:04:13.299> bands<00:04:13.540> are<00:04:13.720> one<00:04:13.840> of<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.079> most

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
I think bands are one of the most

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.800 
I think bands are one of the most
underused<00:04:15.010> pieces<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.549> equipment<00:04:15.760> in<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.239> gym

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
underused pieces of equipment in the gym

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.879 
underused pieces of equipment in the gym
and<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.979> have<00:04:18.280> seen<00:04:18.729> great<00:04:18.940> results<00:04:19.090> with<00:04:19.630> those

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
and I have seen great results with those

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.960 
and I have seen great results with those
I'm<00:04:20.889> going<00:04:21.039> to<00:04:21.100> show<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.280> some<00:04:21.579> bicep<00:04:21.760> curls
