00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
your hair the little blue stuff my

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.000 
your hair the little blue stuff my
mother<00:00:47.110> used<00:00:47.320> it<00:00:47.470> on<00:00:47.530> my<00:00:47.710> hair

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
mother used it on my hair

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.680 
mother used it on my hair
and<00:00:48.160> back<00:00:48.610> then<00:00:48.820> I<00:00:48.910> will<00:00:49.060> say<00:00:49.210> it<00:00:49.329> worked<00:00:49.510> great

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
and back then I will say it worked great

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.240 
and back then I will say it worked great
little<00:00:49.989> look<00:00:50.380> it<00:00:50.620> was<00:00:50.710> like<00:00:50.770> a<00:00:50.890> grease<00:00:51.220> a

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
little look it was like a grease a

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.030 
little look it was like a grease a
little<00:00:51.550> grease<00:00:51.730> on<00:00:51.850> water<00:00:52.090> went<00:00:52.510> a<00:00:52.570> long<00:00:52.690> way

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
little grease on water went a long way

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.000 
little grease on water went a long way
so<00:00:54.040> but<00:00:54.460> then<00:00:54.730> I<00:00:55.059> guess<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:56.350> magic<00:00:56.500> decided

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
so but then I guess the magic decided

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.040 
so but then I guess the magic decided
that<00:00:57.100> they<00:00:57.220> wanted<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.550> come<00:00:57.820> up<00:00:58.000> in<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.690> natural

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
that they wanted to come up in a natural

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.360 
that they wanted to come up in a natural
hair<00:00:59.200> game<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.920> do<00:01:00.790> this<00:01:01.149> here<00:01:01.450> co-wash<00:01:02.370> they

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
hair game and do this here co-wash they

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.469 
hair game and do this here co-wash they
should<00:01:03.550> have<00:01:03.640> stuck<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.940> what<00:01:04.089> they<00:01:04.239> know

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
should have stuck to what they know

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.190 
should have stuck to what they know
because<00:01:05.049> this<00:01:05.799> they<00:01:06.640> don't<00:01:06.820> know<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.420> like

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
because this they don't know and like
