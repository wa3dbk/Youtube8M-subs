that<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.220> screen<00:01:26.460> protectors<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:27.119> cut<00:01:27.360> short

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that the screen protectors not cut short

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.840 
that the screen protectors not cut short
whatsoever<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.950> comes<00:01:29.189> right<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
whatsoever so it comes right up to the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.850 
whatsoever so it comes right up to the
edge<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.450> screen<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.560> full

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860

screen<00:01:31.890> coverage<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.850> part<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.270> also

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
screen coverage on that part and also

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.929 
screen coverage on that part and also
the<00:01:34.470> true<00:01:34.740> show<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.159> she<00:01:35.340> had<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> little<00:01:35.729> bit

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the true show that she had a little bit

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.580 
the true show that she had a little bit
of<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.090> cut<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.420> towards<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> top<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.409> also

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.310 
on it that resists against your finger
this<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.910> actually<00:02:24.180> pretty<00:02:24.360> smooth<00:02:24.720> overall

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
this is actually pretty smooth overall

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.320 
this is actually pretty smooth overall
it<00:02:25.590> has<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.130> nice<00:02:26.430> feel<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.120> won't

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
it has a nice feel on it so you won't

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330 
it has a nice feel on it so you won't
really<00:02:27.540> have<00:02:27.660> problems<00:02:28.080> with<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.440> number<00:02:29.190> two

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
really have problems with it number two

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.890 
really have problems with it number two
is<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.550> does<00:02:29.910> get<00:02:30.120> your<00:02:30.240> fingerprints<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
is it does get your fingerprints on it

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.930 
is it does get your fingerprints on it
but<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.170> not<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.530> bad<00:02:31.890> as<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.220> tri-d<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.670> true

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
but it's not as bad as a tri-d a true

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.460 
but it's not as bad as a tri-d a true
shield<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.870> reason<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.140> named<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.320> a

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
shield so the reason I named that a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.990 
shield so the reason I named that a
positive<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:35.100> because<00:02:35.370> right<00:02:35.580> now<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.760> really

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
positive is because right now you really

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.640 
positive is because right now you really
only<00:02:36.120> got<00:02:36.270> two<00:02:36.480> options<00:02:36.660> for<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.080> curved<00:02:37.320> screen

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
only got two options for a curved screen

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.410 
only got two options for a curved screen
protector<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.100> got<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.460> curved<00:02:38.670> crystal<00:02:39.120> and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
protector you got the curved crystal and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.240 
protector you got the curved crystal and
also<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> true<00:02:40.140> shield<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.710> this<00:02:41.040> was<00:02:41.190> a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
also the true shield so this was a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.560 
also the true shield so this was a
little<00:02:41.490> bit<00:02:41.610> better<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.030> regard<00:02:42.420> with

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
little bit better in that regard with

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.750 
little bit better in that regard with
you<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.810> name<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.350> positive<00:02:43.590> now<00:02:44.460> on<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
you I name it a positive now on the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.370 
you I name it a positive now on the
downside<00:02:45.180> it's<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.450> fact<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.959> does<00:02:46.140> show

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
downside it's the fact that it does show

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.050 
downside it's the fact that it does show
some<00:02:46.590> light<00:02:46.770> scratching<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:47.670> now<00:02:47.850> I

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
some light scratching on it now I

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.250 
some light scratching on it now I
probably<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.540> gonna<00:02:48.660> be<00:02:48.750> able<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.930> show<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.080> on

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
probably I gonna be able to show it on

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.440 
probably I gonna be able to show it on
camera<00:02:49.320> because<00:02:49.830> they're<00:02:50.430> just<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:50.790> small<00:02:51.120> but

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
camera because they're just so small but

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.060 
camera because they're just so small but
there's<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.990> little<00:02:52.140> bit<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.350> light<00:02:52.530> scratching

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
there's a little bit of light scratching

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.340 
there's a little bit of light scratching
on<00:02:53.250> my<00:02:53.670> screen<00:02:54.090> right<00:02:54.300> here<00:02:54.330> but<00:02:54.840> obviously

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
on my screen right here but obviously

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
on my screen right here but obviously
the<00:02:55.500> reason<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.800> get<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> screen<00:02:56.250> protector

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
the reason you get a screen protector

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.040 
the reason you get a screen protector
and<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.240> scratches<00:02:57.690> get<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:57.959> the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
and so the scratches get on the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.410 
and so the scratches get on the
protector<00:02:58.410> not<00:02:58.740> on<00:02:58.860> your<00:02:59.040> screen<00:02:59.310> now<00:03:00.150> number

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
protector not on your screen now number

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.930 
protector not on your screen now number
two<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.720> pricing<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.320> is<00:03:01.440> 16<00:03:01.920> bucks<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.760> do

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
two is pricing it is 16 bucks and you do

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.610 
two is pricing it is 16 bucks and you do
get<00:03:03.090> two<00:03:03.330> screenshots<00:03:03.660> which<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> little

get two screenshots which is a little

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.960 
get two screenshots which is a little
bit<00:03:04.740> better<00:03:04.950> than<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.220> true<00:03:05.459> show<00:03:05.670> because

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
bit better than a true show because

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.150 
bit better than a true show because
that's<00:03:06.120> 12<00:03:06.450> bucks<00:03:06.690> for<00:03:06.930> one<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:07.800> it's<00:03:08.010> still

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that's 12 bucks for one but it's still

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.350 
that's 12 bucks for one but it's still
expensive<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.850> can<00:03:08.970> get<00:03:09.090> some<00:03:09.209> other

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
expensive you can get some other

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.640 
expensive you can get some other

alternatives out there and most people

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.260 
alternatives out there and most people
will<00:03:11.010> be<00:03:11.160> pleased<00:03:11.490> with<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.060> screen

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
will be pleased with the screen

four<00:03:14.790> or<00:03:14.820> five<00:03:15.090> bucks<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.660> it's<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> little<00:03:16.050> bit

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
four or five bucks so it's a little bit

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.259 
four or five bucks so it's a little bit
more<00:03:16.320> expensive<00:03:16.770> than<00:03:16.890> others<00:03:17.220> now<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.940> third

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
more expensive than others now the third

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.940 
more expensive than others now the third
con<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.080> probably<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.440> biggest<00:03:19.680> one<00:03:19.920> for

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
con and probably the biggest one for

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.620 
con and probably the biggest one for
most<00:03:20.190> people<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.850> fact<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.330> will

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
most people is the fact that this will

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.840 
most people is the fact that this will
bubble<00:03:21.900> up<00:03:22.140> with<00:03:22.590> quite<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.890> few<00:03:22.980> cases<00:03:23.400> now

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
bubble up with quite a few cases now

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.030 
bubble up with quite a few cases now
I've<00:03:24.209> tried<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.840> about<00:03:25.080> six<00:03:25.350> cases<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:25.920> had

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
I've tried it on about six cases and had

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.300 
I've tried it on about six cases and had
no<00:03:26.220> problems<00:03:26.790> but<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.840> lot<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.290> TPU<00:03:28.739> cases<00:03:28.980> will

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
no problems but a lot of TPU cases will

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.680 
no problems but a lot of TPU cases will
have<00:03:29.489> problems<00:03:29.880> with<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.420> reason<00:03:30.660> for

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
have problems with and the reason for

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.509 
have problems with and the reason for
that<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.170> because<00:03:31.200> TPU<00:03:31.860> case<00:03:32.040> have<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> nice

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
that is because TPU case have a nice

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.580 
that is because TPU case have a nice
tight<00:03:32.820> fit<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:33.209> them<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:33.600> they<00:03:34.050> have<00:03:34.200> sort<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.470> a

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
tight fit on them so they have sort of a

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.100 
tight fit on them so they have sort of a
cut<00:03:34.860> edge<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.370> them<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.570> what<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.810> will<00:03:36.959> do

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
cut edge on them and what that will do

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.810 
cut edge on them and what that will do
is<00:03:37.140> basically<00:03:37.470> it'll<00:03:37.860> lift<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.580> screen

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
is basically it'll lift the screen

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.090 
is basically it'll lift the screen
protector<00:03:39.120> up<00:03:39.300> by<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:39.780> pushing<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.440> on<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.860> so

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
protector up by just pushing it on it so

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.830 
protector up by just pushing it on it so
because<00:03:41.580> it's<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:41.730> tight<00:03:42.060> fitting<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.570> wants

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
because it's so tight fitting it wants

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.020 
because it's so tight fitting it wants
to<00:03:42.989> rest<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.590> bezel<00:03:44.070> on<00:03:44.220> top<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.820> screen

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
to rest the bezel on top of the screen

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.729 
to rest the bezel on top of the screen
so<00:03:45.420> it'll<00:03:45.690> just<00:03:45.720> cause<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.080> lot<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.320> bubbling

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
so it'll just cause a lot of bubbling

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.650 
so it'll just cause a lot of bubbling
all<00:03:46.920> around<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.459> now<00:03:47.610> over<00:03:48.150> time<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.510> might

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
all around it now over time that might

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.240 
all around it now over time that might
get<00:03:48.810> worse<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.320> might<00:03:49.410> get<00:03:49.530> dust<00:03:49.830> underneath

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
get worse it might get dust underneath

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.380 
get worse it might get dust underneath
and<00:03:50.519> then<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:50.820> ruin<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.150> screen

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
and then you just ruin the screen

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.030 
and then you just ruin the screen
protector<00:03:51.690> overall<00:03:52.110> but<00:03:52.350> from<00:03:52.799> what<00:03:52.890> I've

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
protector overall but from what I've

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.500 
protector overall but from what I've
tested<00:03:53.430> I've<00:03:53.519> had<00:03:53.700> no<00:03:53.850> problems<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.390> I've

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
tested I've had no problems and I've

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.420 
tested I've had no problems and I've
used<00:03:54.690> about<00:03:54.840> six<00:03:55.200> cases<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> Distronic<00:03:56.220> case

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
used about six cases a Distronic case

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.970 
used about six cases a Distronic case
the<00:03:56.940> candy<00:03:57.360> shell<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.750> barely-there<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.650> bunch

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
the candy shell the barely-there a bunch

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.680 
the candy shell the barely-there a bunch
of<00:03:59.070> cases<00:03:59.370> out<00:03:59.519> there<00:03:59.549> so<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.150> signed<00:04:00.570> no

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
of cases out there so I signed no

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.940 
of cases out there so I signed no
problems<00:04:01.049> with<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.410> but<00:04:01.500> i<00:04:01.560> do<00:04:01.620> want<00:04:01.890> to

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
problems with it but i do want to

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
problems with it but i do want to
mention<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.340> because<00:04:02.430> i<00:04:02.640> know<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.790> lot<00:04:02.940> of

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
mention it because i know a lot of

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.670 
mention it because i know a lot of
people<00:04:03.090> have<00:04:03.420> had<00:04:03.600> issues<00:04:03.750> with<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.470> if

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
people have had issues with this so if
