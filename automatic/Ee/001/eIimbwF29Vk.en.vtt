 auteuil this sunday with andrea price 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.580
 del quality no quality of the games 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.580
 must confirm at this level there now 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.720
 well that's the only thing steeples 3500 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.980
 meters it's true that it's a distance 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 in auteuil we are more used to 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.200
 to use 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.239
 in short it's clear it's a path 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.250
 maybe the easiest on the steeplechase 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.210
 of auteuil then come back from 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.600
 the rear guard is what it will be 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.120
 easy 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.260
 tawny do not reassure know maybe it's 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.969
 may know it the key to the race 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.649
 it may be the key to the race 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.030
 well, listen and see what we're going to see 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.550
 your selection is worth 8 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.660
 so we will start with the 8 tango 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.789
 lima the 2 pindar the 9 may kansas say it 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.120
 colorados seven on the 5th 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.670
 a look on the 11th is not the water on August 4th 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.979
 and May 2 kara and May 14 on frontenac 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 ok then your factory is a favorite 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.840
 since these numbers 8 tango the anthem to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.430
 100% on the strip two accessits 80% 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.680
 in this category 4 out of 5 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.060
 it may be her day she is 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.619
 irreproachable she is irreproachable 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.180
 this year she is no further than 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.380
 fifth 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.310
 as you said she is 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.470
 really well suited to the style it's 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.130
 vincent railwayman so and I do that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.049
 saw me 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.900
 you know I already wanted to say a lot 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.890
 I love you so much low from there I 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.620
 think there is no reason that 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.170
 that tango the imac or resort badly his 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.370
 back home was not bad at all we did 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.140
 seen that the gallorini would tend to 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.520
 good progress on their return is 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.260
 clear so low since the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.670
 back was already not bad I think 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.680
 there for the win it should be 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.610
 quite logically we all agree 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.180
 the lights are green 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.600
 we will oppose him the number 2 badar 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.910
 confirmed at this level 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.200
 already two successes on the steeple there too 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.050
 you have to be wary yes completely 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.970
 then his return to the quinté the 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.350
 last time was we could in 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.520
 wait a little better it's clear there 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.430
 had 6 against 1 there was money 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.979
 still on his chances before at 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.739
 spring so of success on the steeplechase 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.390
 and success associated with jérémy da silva 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.850
 the last time it was jacques ricou 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.680
 jérémy da silva will find pindar 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.010
 this time it can be the key so 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.140
 it may be a small indication to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.269
 I think padar is gallorini 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.800
 also it should also run in 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.150
 progress as much as a couple and 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.920
 gallorini not impossible this is it 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.709
 announce a gallorini couplet in the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.400
 andré adel price in third position on 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.769
 number 9 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.760
 but when dias then I know you 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.959
 have had his trainer you have to 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.299
 the info prod would have completely 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.610
 i got marcel rolland phone this 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.709
 morning I'm mostly asking the question 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.959
 I had a little doubt about the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.040
 steeple in auteuil 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.840
 about nicosia this because the year 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.450
 last it was still not too much 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.620
 too well spent 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.230
 nicosia it was oriented on to 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.299
 this year is there marcel rolland presents 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.430
 mechanic on the steeple he told me 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.590
 frankly in the morning in the morning there is 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.720
 no worries at work so from 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 from there but hey I'm doing it I'm going to do 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.959
 trust 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.480
 must remember that muco 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.459
 he was the favorite of the president 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.500
 last year he fell he is 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.090
 fell but still institute the level 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.829
 of glucose dias so I would say that 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.790
 limit muco dias so really he does a 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.400
 faultless course 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.450
 it's not declassifying it may 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.379
 it's a good thing we're going to 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.730
 remember in intrinsic value you have 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.049
 he finished third of the wrestler iii 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.640
 true that we designate car simon 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.890
 completely on these values ​​there it was 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.689
 from steeples here is spent in pure class 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.500
 it's for me it's this guy it's 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.060
 the best of the class lot one is 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.500
 Okay 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.200
 in fourth position of number ten she 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.970
 come down from a floor colorado seven who 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.010
 come running in big progress but 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.750
 it was on the good ones he already has 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.040
 titles on the slipway me I had you 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.329
 for me it's me I'll call it's a 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.980
 little poker game little poker game 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.450
 yeah I do not like saying that and I do not like 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.650
 not me here I do not like this choice 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.269
 I do not like so I 'll tell you I 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.950
 you go to hide it but hey must 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.780
 beware he is fourth of the chinco price 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.510
 so in June it's not nothing 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.730
 so judged on it we can not 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.049
 we can speak against the last time 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.849
 it was a good start on the ages 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.319
 note especially that the third was at 18 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.180
 lengths it's clear so there is 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.920
 really two horses and the rest of the 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.569
 world 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.620
 I think he too should blame 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.480
 progress on that race 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.320
 find the steeple it's not going 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.359
 disturb at all good after each 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.470
 its six o'clock it's a bargain it's 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.539
 a printing business there all of 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.210
 scrunchies here appreciate not need to 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.190
 this is the shape the steeple not 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.870
 of concern why not that's the logic 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.979
 you it is if you are realistic me I 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.160
 I'm still a little dreamy it's 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.080
 normal in fifth position but 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.430
 precisely the number 5 a look but 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.560
 have to give you the floor we're going 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.000
 listen to emmanuel rivron who collected 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.800
 the confidences of his coach guy 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.690
 deniaud who tells us about the chances of 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.020
 number 5 a look that we listen is the 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.520
 big of the ground minute I often 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.900
 had the opportunity to chat with guy from 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.510
 again in recent weeks about 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.740
 of a look the combrée trainer in 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.000
 the maine-et-loire is very confident 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.650
 before the quinté of September 11th 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.539
 because d contested on the is yet a 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.970
 look there highly disappointed it was a 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.440
 little mocked of him that's the reason 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.610
 for which of us there provided 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.960
 of Australian blinders last time 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.860
 for this return on the steeple chase is 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.539
 that day we look at it 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.770
 admirably defended must not 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.990
 forget that in steeple ch and a look 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.970
 had preceded sidi bou canadel autumn 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.830
 last guide to liners but the 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.630
 Australian blinders this sunday a 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.030
 look will be further favored by this 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.830
 short distance of 3500 meters guide 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.310
 we preferred this quinté at the price 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.840
 montgomery 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.110
 it will take a look at this 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.540
 Sunday at height 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.130
 we will have understood a recent look 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.110
 second of the violin 2 on this race 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.220
 it is true that the horse looks at top 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.020
 port 2 and yesterday big advantage can not 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.930
 the mady aside so is the last time 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.550
 it is true that we did not linger 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.950
 really have a look especially on her 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.510
 music of the year now you on 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.670
 It must be said that a look had when 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.020
 even had a lot of bad luck since 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.790
 start of the season it's clear but 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.040
 as manu rightly said it's 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.350
 a horse that on its true value 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.790
 Ben is well worth a lot like senza 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.210
 last time this one years when he 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.560
 hand he must go here here 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.750
 well when it goes well behind 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.060
 elastic but after that it's worth it 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.070
 choice of quality that we will be wary of 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.630
 more good coach so go pretty 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.650
 confident so if he represents there I 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.750
 think it's not it's not to do 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.760
 the turn when vics bah listen 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.390

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.520
