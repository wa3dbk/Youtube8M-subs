00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 we take it away with a former double champion 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.040
 World Cup Puerto Rico Ivan Calderón and several 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.080
 then to the door of another title fight 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.769
 global and entered own home account what 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.830
 where they go well motivated well 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.520
 eager as it arrives on day 6 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.660
 these are the things that they leave when they do not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.380
 It does a good job a good record 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.220
 good fight that I had 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.739
 thanks again another concierge with a 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.050
 good boy a young boy with 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.350
 many nights of an interesting fight 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.620
 for the first time the largest component 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.350
 much bigger than them 58 and young 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.220
 very hungry and that will be a challenge 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:54.729
 for me to prove that what prevents 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:57.449
 that desire that we just interview you 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.040
 coincidentally we found a champion very 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.629
 respectful 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.600
 understands that the fight is not easy he 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.100
 he understands that he is in someone else's house is not 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.360
 also the first time for him to leave 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.159
 out of home 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.909
 do you think there's a downside to him or a 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.070
 advantage over here does not come champion 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.869
 global to the mentality of or does not change and 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.409
 one when not about them I do not care 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.860
 where are we going from if the only thing 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.140
 has in favor of law 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.240
 He has recently become a champion and has that desire 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.480
 that hunger that that what can 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.220
 help a lot in this fight and most 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.660
 important that there is a lot of respect for 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.400
 we both know that these well 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.320
 professionals you have to fight there 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.160
 do our work but that is not 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.020
 they have 27,737 that many 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.300
 that increase because Ivan Calderón already 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.880
 you have 9 can not move look what you 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.180
 happened to junior chavez and there are many 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.130
 champions out there of cooperation with 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.360
 many veterans as there have been for 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.360
 the one that we follow his story 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.350
 the champion you now return to your 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.850
 natural post 105 pounds then a 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.700
 little bit about that transition of 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.740
 return to the weight for our world know 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.260
 that when I had the decision to go up 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.630
 the 108 was more a business more for 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.970
 opportunity of another title with bags 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.690
 bigger with a loudmouth that was coming 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.080
 winning the other point and they offered me the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.140
 opportunity that sure if we go 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.140
 let's take the one we can lose the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.720
 undefeated but I do not miss the 105 because 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.330
 we had the decision to go up we were 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.640
 fields and made the decision of civil and 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.560
 I felt like in those sitting moments 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.840
 and I stayed until I found a 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.030
 I'm sure he dominated me in strength 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.120
 who made this decision of good hair to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:57.040
 the 105,000 with my safety and so 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.420
 that in a way wants to say the same 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.310
 that now comes to recover some things 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.050
 that I have borrowed because you that the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.190
 you lost that we never followed the movie 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.480
 never 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.280
 the undefeated day there many times one 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.890
 makes decisions at that weight because no 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.180
 there were challengers there was no fight like 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.180
 interesting and that's why 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.320
 the same 954 returns at 47 if there's no 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.320
 one 40 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.120
 [Music] 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.220
 a new fight with sure a lot much 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.020
 sadness of your part of you for you thing 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.880
 that puerto rico returns to the 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.790
 scene here at home but it's a 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.470
 commitment to Puerto Rican politics 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.270
 what message does it send to all 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.480
 puerto rican tecos to invite them 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:55.150
 He has been supporting the rise 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.610
 let the undefeated in let's go when it happens 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.879
 well strong well and with lots of action and 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.000
 especially support that I always 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.000

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.380

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.389
 of the notify persecute thousands of thousands of 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.400

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.430
 of the types 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.240
 I feel a mere admiration towards them and 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.910
 be aware of the race returns 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.340
