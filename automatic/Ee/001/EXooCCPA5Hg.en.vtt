some people were wearing those things
yeah<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.010> don't<00:02:15.130> think<00:02:15.430> they're<00:02:15.610> Chanel<00:02:15.940> or

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240

yeah but I don't think they're Chanel or
no<00:02:16.780> no<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.010> think<00:02:18.220> there<00:02:18.340> was<00:02:18.430> one<00:02:18.460> fashion

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
no no but I think there was one fashion

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.590 
no no but I think there was one fashion
house<00:02:19.210> that<00:02:19.420> had<00:02:19.540> taken<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.140> mankini<00:02:20.740> and

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
house that had taken on the mankini and

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.020 
house that had taken on the mankini and
developed<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.870> be<00:02:22.990> sold<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.550> some<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:24.910> these

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
developed it to be sold so some of these

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.700 
developed it to be sold so some of these
fashions<00:02:25.420> do<00:02:25.630> get<00:02:25.840> worn<00:02:26.050> by<00:02:26.170> people<00:02:26.470> picking

fashions do get worn by people picking
it<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:26.950> guess<00:02:27.100> people<00:02:27.280> who<00:02:27.460> want<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:28.140> get

it I guess people who want to get

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.690 
it I guess people who want to get
attention<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.860> draw<00:02:30.160> attention<00:02:30.310> to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
attention and draw attention to

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.700 
attention and draw attention to
themselves<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.360> type<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.170> person<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.530> suppose

upon something here it's the idea of a

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.980 
upon something here it's the idea of a
unified<00:03:00.280> aesthetic<00:03:00.880> it's<00:03:01.060> not<00:03:01.240> just<00:03:01.630> some

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
unified aesthetic it's not just some

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.370 
unified aesthetic it's not just some
funky<00:03:02.410> hat<00:03:02.590> or<00:03:02.860> something<00:03:03.160> like<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.820> a

funky hat or something like that it's a

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.870 
funky hat or something like that it's a
color<00:03:05.380> or<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.710> pattern<00:03:06.100> that's<00:03:06.280> repeated<00:03:06.700> and

color or a pattern that's repeated and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.550 
color or a pattern that's repeated and
then<00:03:06.940> maybe<00:03:07.210> that<00:03:07.660> goes<00:03:07.840> along<00:03:07.990> with<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.350> car

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
then maybe that goes along with the car

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.770 
then maybe that goes along with the car

much<00:03:25.330> more<00:03:26.700> pretentious<00:03:27.700> than<00:03:28.030> fashion<00:03:28.660> I

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
much more pretentious than fashion I

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.510 
much more pretentious than fashion I
