00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 Tell us the lesson today is about the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.700
 openwrt replay 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.770
 when I started playing bacteria 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.239
 played by driving open by hand 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.190
 left 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.290
 as I've never had orientation of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.540
 teachers have always studied alone did 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.719
 some private lessons 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.680
 I thought I was wrong playing with 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.590
 the open driving now I got some 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.899
 methods and started to study again 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.960
 this type of driving 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.320
 this facilitates the use of the right hand as 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.870
 melodies while the left leads into the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.869
 hatch uses the radio on the left to 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.290
 some notes some conditions work 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.570
 well my advice is to start 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.760
 playing lyrics with driving and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.040
 sixteenth note on left hand 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.540
 How will I show you? I hope that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.540
 enjoy good studies
