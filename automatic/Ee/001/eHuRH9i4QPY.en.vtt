so the megamix right here is one of the
little<00:00:22.560> interesting<00:00:23.550> cubes<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.570> not<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
interesting twos and I never seen this

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:41.450 
interesting twos and I never seen this
before<00:00:36.500> yes<00:00:38.239> has<00:00:39.239> 12<00:00:39.960> sides<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.410> total<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.950> has

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
before yes has 12 sides in total and has

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.330 
before yes has 12 sides in total and has
11<00:00:41.850> pieces<00:00:42.030> love<00:00:42.660> stickers<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.829> side<00:00:44.100> when

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
11 pieces love stickers on one side when

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.459 
11 pieces love stickers on one side when
you<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.730> five<00:00:45.239> five<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
you have it five five and one in the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.880 
you have it five five and one in the
middle

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
middle

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.430 
middle
now<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.579> similar<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.120> when<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> take<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> off<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
now it's similar to when I take it off I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.880 
now it's similar to when I take it off I
am<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.850> am<00:00:51.000> making<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> video<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.890> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
am going I am making a video of the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.970 
am going I am making a video of the
little<00:00:53.699> review<00:00:54.030> about<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.899> sort<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.440> what

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
little review about the sort of what

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.970 
little review about the sort of what
you've<00:00:56.160> broken<00:00:56.520> apart<00:00:57.079> cubes<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> take<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you've broken apart cubes so I take it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680 
you've broken apart cubes so I take it
apart<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.520> show<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.910> mechanism<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.539> stuff

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
apart and show you a mechanism and stuff

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.200 
apart and show you a mechanism and stuff
like<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.170> will<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.460> video<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.059> can

like that I will have that video you can

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.719 
like that I will have that video you can
just<00:01:03.239> check<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.690> channel<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.350> watch<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.949> this

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
just check my channel to watch and this

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.289 
just check my channel to watch and this
cube<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:07.020> also<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:07.979> these<00:01:08.280> color<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
cube it also you know these color the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.570 
cube it also you know these color the
regular<00:01:10.049> plastic<00:01:10.530> color<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.860> white<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.400> can

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
regular plastic color is white you can

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.410 
regular plastic color is white you can
see<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.640> also<00:01:14.820> comes<00:01:15.270> with

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
see and that I think it also comes with

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.929 
see and that I think it also comes with
yellow<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.259> yellow<00:01:16.500> look<00:01:17.310> at<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.909> just

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
yellow and yellow look at this I just

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969 
yellow and yellow look at this I just
bought<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> white<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.530> looks<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:19.890> than

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
bought the white one it looks more than

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.670 
bought the white one it looks more than
sort<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.310> classic<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.680> better

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
sort of a classic you know it is better

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.460 
sort of a classic you know it is better
than<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.250> black<00:01:23.580> ones<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:25.799> let<00:01:26.369> me<00:01:26.520> continue

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
than that black ones so let me continue

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.270 
than that black ones so let me continue
so<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:29.430> not<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so it's not just like this if I if you

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.609 
so it's not just like this if I if you
can<00:01:32.700> also<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.299> make<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> cross<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.259> with

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
can also like make a cross you know with

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.670 
can also like make a cross you know with
a<00:01:34.650> color<00:01:35.479> this<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:36.720> instead<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> cross<00:01:37.439> can

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
a color this one instead of a cross can

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:51.100 
a color this one instead of a cross can
make<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> star<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.610> let<00:01:38.850> me<00:01:38.939> make<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:46.100> like<00:01:49.700> this

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
make a star so let me make one like this

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.429 
make a star so let me make one like this
there<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.200> go

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
there you go

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.490 
there you go
so<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.890> take<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> star<00:01:54.320> no<00:01:55.320> it's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500
