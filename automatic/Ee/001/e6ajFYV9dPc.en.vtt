00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
amazing and also I've seen previous

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.449 
amazing and also I've seen previous
footage<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:14.269> Spartan<00:03:15.269> Ops<00:03:15.419> and<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:16.169> does<00:03:16.500> look

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
footage of Spartan Ops and it does look

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.210 
footage of Spartan Ops and it does look
amazing<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:18.269> does<00:03:18.449> kind<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.840> x<00:03:19.109> by<00:03:19.440> these<00:03:19.889> rules

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
amazing it does kind of x by these rules

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.119 
amazing it does kind of x by these rules
but<00:03:20.579> it's<00:03:20.699> a<00:03:20.819> sandbox<00:03:21.299> kind<00:03:21.569> of<00:03:21.659> experience<00:03:22.199> it

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
but it's a sandbox kind of experience it

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.420 
but it's a sandbox kind of experience it
also<00:03:23.340> says<00:03:23.849> Spartan<00:03:24.840> Ops<00:03:24.959> is<00:03:25.169> set<00:03:25.440> after<00:03:25.650> halo

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
also says Spartan Ops is set after halo

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.479 
also says Spartan Ops is set after halo
4<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.090> itself<00:03:27.959> will<00:03:28.290> lay<00:03:28.440> out<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> substantial

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
4 and itself will lay out a substantial

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.849 
4 and itself will lay out a substantial
plot<00:03:29.819> these<00:03:30.720> events<00:03:31.139> will<00:03:31.349> more<00:03:31.620> than<00:03:31.799> likely

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
plot these events will more than likely

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.819 
plot these events will more than likely
lead<00:03:32.549> into<00:03:32.879> halo<00:03:33.090> 5<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:34.379> that<00:03:34.560> will<00:03:34.680> probably

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
lead into halo 5 but that will probably

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.490 
lead into halo 5 but that will probably
probably<00:03:35.549> be<00:03:35.939> a<00:03:35.970> next<00:03:36.419> gen<00:03:36.720> release<00:03:37.019> now

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
probably be a next gen release now

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.979 
probably be a next gen release now
that's<00:03:37.709> really<00:03:38.220> quite<00:03:38.549> exciting<00:03:38.939> new<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.569> you

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
unknown we've all watched TV and we've

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.319 
unknown we've all watched TV and we've
all<00:04:10.530> played<00:04:10.680> games<00:04:11.099> but<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:11.939> two<00:04:12.120> put

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
all played games but the two put

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.539 
all played games but the two put
together<00:04:12.560> nothing<00:04:13.560> quite<00:04:13.829> like<00:04:13.859> this<00:04:14.250> has

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549

been attempted in gaming before and
that's<00:04:16.500> true<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:17.009> think<00:04:17.430> that's<00:04:17.609> why

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
that's true I think that's why

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.610

no one's quite done this before
so<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.760> this<00:04:23.790> is<00:04:24.060> how<00:04:24.180> Frank<00:04:24.540> O'Connor

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
so and this is how Frank O'Connor
