on painting the stock this afternoon for

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.820 
on painting the stock this afternoon for
my<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> our<00:00:10.349> build<00:00:11.269> my<00:00:12.269> dad<00:00:12.509> got<00:00:12.719> me<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.410> my

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
my a our build my dad got me this for my

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.870 
my a our build my dad got me this for my
birthday<00:00:15.830> I<00:00:16.830> guess<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.520> wouldn't<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.789> been

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
birthday I guess it wouldn't have been

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.470 
birthday I guess it wouldn't have been
my<00:00:18.060> first<00:00:18.090> choice<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:20.029> 4<00:00:21.029> stock<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.840> guess

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
my first choice in a 4 stock but I guess

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.929 
my first choice in a 4 stock but I guess
I<00:00:25.250> wasn't<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.340> sure<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.580> was<00:00:26.670> gonna<00:00:26.760> get

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
I wasn't really sure I was gonna get

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.689 
I wasn't really sure I was gonna get
anyway<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.869> guess<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:29.099> made<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.429> easier

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
anyway so I guess it made it easier

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.400 
anyway so I guess it made it easier
whenever<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.060> was<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.300> given<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.289> I'm

this thing apart and I've been looking
trying<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.170> try<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> find<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> video<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:24.350> but

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
uh nobody's gonna beat you on it so I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.310 
uh nobody's gonna beat you on it so I
just<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.850> took<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:31.159> took<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> sling<00:01:32.670> mount

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
just I took out took out the sling mount

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.990 
just I took out took out the sling mount
earlier<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.829> simple<00:01:37.939> trying<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
earlier which is pretty simple trying to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.480 
earlier which is pretty simple trying to
figure<00:01:39.150> out<00:01:39.180> how<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> take<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.920> lever

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
figure out how to take this this lever

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.420 
figure out how to take this this lever
off<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.049> could<00:01:43.110> paint<00:01:43.409> underneath<00:01:44.159> there

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
off so I could paint underneath there

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.039 
off so I could paint underneath there
and<00:01:44.520> paint<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.909> whole<00:01:45.240> entire<00:01:45.450> lever<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and paint that whole entire lever but I

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.569 
and paint that whole entire lever but I
guess<00:01:46.229> I'm<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.409> gonna<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:48.049> just<00:01:49.490> do<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
guess I'm just gonna have to just do the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.190 
guess I'm just gonna have to just do the
best<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.909> can

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
best I can

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.990 
best I can
and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.799> think<00:01:52.860> I'm<00:01:53.159> gonna<00:01:53.340> I'm<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.850> gonna

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and I think I'm gonna I'm not gonna

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.270 
and I think I'm gonna I'm not gonna
paint<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.680> tape

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
paint the but I think I'm going to tape

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.249 
paint the but I think I'm going to tape
right<00:01:56.610> along<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.150> edge<00:01:57.330> I<00:01:57.720> guess<00:01:57.810> you'll<00:01:58.110> guys

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
right along the edge I guess you'll guys

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.420 
right along the edge I guess you'll guys
see<00:01:58.439> her<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.650> a<00:01:58.710> second<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.340> my

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
see her in a second but I think of my

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.510 
see her in a second but I think of my
tape<00:01:59.610> right<00:01:59.790> along<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.180> edge<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:02.100> leave<00:02:02.340> that

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
tape right along the edge and leave that

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.100 
tape right along the edge and leave that
back<00:02:02.790> part<00:02:03.090> black<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:03.750> there's<00:02:03.930> gonna<00:02:04.020> be

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
but I haven't really decided yet but I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.759 
but I haven't really decided yet but I
think<00:02:20.400> when<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.700> would<00:02:20.910> try<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.150> paint<00:02:21.330> this

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
think when I would try to paint this

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.380 
think when I would try to paint this
before<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.830> gets<00:02:22.950> too<00:02:23.130> dark<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:26.239> all<00:02:27.239> right

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
before it gets too dark so all right

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
it was what it looks like whenever I'm

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.670 
it was what it looks like whenever I'm
done<00:03:38.519> so<00:03:40.489> shouldn't<00:03:41.489> take<00:03:41.609> long

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.910 

all<00:03:45.220> right<00:03:45.340> there<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.640> is<00:03:45.730> sprayed<00:03:46.920> it's

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
all right there it is sprayed it's

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.640 
all right there it is sprayed it's
pretty<00:03:48.400> wet<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:48.670> put<00:03:48.909> a<00:03:48.939> pretty<00:03:49.150> heavy<00:03:50.140> coat<00:03:50.470> on

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
pretty wet I put a pretty heavy coat on

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.890 
pretty wet I put a pretty heavy coat on
that<00:03:50.799> first<00:03:51.010> coat<00:03:51.280> I'm<00:03:52.180> not<00:03:52.420> sure<00:03:52.629> it's<00:03:52.750> gonna

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
that first coat I'm not sure it's gonna

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.580 
that first coat I'm not sure it's gonna
need<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.110> second<00:03:53.500> one<00:03:53.620> but<00:03:54.959> look<00:03:55.959> shiny<00:03:56.290> that's

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
need a second one but look shiny that's

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.289 
need a second one but look shiny that's
that<00:03:56.920> is<00:03:57.069> because<00:03:57.340> it's<00:03:57.519> just<00:03:57.670> it's<00:03:57.879> still<00:03:58.120> wet

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
that is because it's just it's still wet

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.780 
that is because it's just it's still wet
I<00:03:58.329> really<00:03:58.629> did<00:03:58.810> just<00:03:59.400> get<00:04:00.400> done<00:04:00.549> spraying<00:04:00.879> it

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
I really did just get done spraying it

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.099 
I really did just get done spraying it
it's<00:04:03.790> going<00:04:03.939> to<00:04:04.000> drive<00:04:04.239> flat<00:04:04.540> it's<00:04:04.900> already

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
it's going to drive flat it's already

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.210 
it's going to drive flat it's already
kind<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:05.319> starting<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.620> draw<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.829> flat<00:04:06.069> right

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
kind of starting to draw a flat right

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.530 
kind of starting to draw a flat right
there<00:04:08.250> but<00:04:10.500> I'm<00:04:11.500> hoping<00:04:11.799> it<00:04:11.920> matches<00:04:12.329> will<00:04:13.329> see

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
there but I'm hoping it matches will see

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.640 
there but I'm hoping it matches will see
whenever<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:13.900> pull<00:04:14.109> this<00:04:14.260> tape<00:04:14.500> off

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
whenever I pull this tape off

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.870 
whenever I pull this tape off
what<00:04:17.650> kind<00:04:17.829> of<00:04:17.859> contrast<00:04:18.430> it's<00:04:18.579> gonna<00:04:18.729> have

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
what kind of contrast it's gonna have

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.129 
what kind of contrast it's gonna have
with<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.120> black<00:04:19.389> it<00:04:19.630> should<00:04:19.780> look<00:04:19.900> pretty

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
with that black it should look pretty

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.409 
with that black it should look pretty
good<00:04:23.340> it's<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.430> good<00:04:24.550> thing<00:04:24.699> about<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:25.150> about

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
good it's a good thing about it about

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.150 
good it's a good thing about it about
this<00:04:25.660> is<00:04:25.870> if<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.229> does<00:04:26.410> we're<00:04:26.590> off<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:26.919> can<00:04:27.010> just

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
this is if it does we're off I can just

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:37.129 
this is if it does we're off I can just
spray<00:04:27.850> some<00:04:27.880> more<00:04:28.150> on<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:29.639> so<00:04:34.289> it's<00:04:35.289> done

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
spray some more on it so it's done
