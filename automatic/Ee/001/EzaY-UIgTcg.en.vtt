 what's on the page to explain everything 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.270
 Included in the pack is on the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.489
 back is always a bit 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.930
 Explanation of the remote control itself and 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.399
 on the other side are things 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.170
 like please do not eat etc 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.610
 but who is the remote control that's right 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.899
 anyway, not something that next door 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.910
 quickly snap back knife 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.010
 cut it in some glue here 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.840
 point up and there it works 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.030
 again , the thing goes like a sarcophagus 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.739
 on and the theme already the beautiful 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.300
 product of our choice namely the xbox 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.129
 from remotes I was on first 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.050
 look, I thought so many small pieces 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.399
 soap beautiful beautifully compact 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.920
 Do you see my hands in comparison 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.020
 the thing is not a huge one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.150
 current that is relatively small relative 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.010
 inconspicuous and the search went off yes 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.869
 probably to vulture actually see the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.580
 batteries are hidden, yes 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.780
 Similarly, what do you think aside ice cold 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.549
 Cold touch the thing I guess 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 Immediately a bit of packing just up 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.619
 center reading material for the toilet or 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.979
 what to throw away a break where to 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.659
 hangmen are the batteries so well let 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.430
 Do not irritate us like it 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.930
 how are the things missing we look that 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.939
 now the production please more accurate 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.560
 the surface and the bottom is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.509
 completely ruined we have such a top 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.759
 xbox no button also known from the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.380
 controller kept the whole in chrome 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.720
 the main keys are on it 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.250
 At the back you can already see that I look like 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.409
 a little phone that way 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.060
 nice so in any case is good in 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.460
 the hand of the haptic, yes, really 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.090
 perfect we have all the important ones 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.070
 controls which was also on one 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.479
 controller on back again with me 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.799
 even so i have had my xbox with me 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.090
 my amplifier coupled so far 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.710
 I can also volume and something 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.299
 Adjust all times you are out 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.310
 The pressure point is also reversed 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.680
 wonderful and it should already be 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.850
 I do not know anything 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740
 is missing here or 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.630
 hmm 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.130
 brooding brooding and we have 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.780
 stupidly looked at ourselves again we thought 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.090
 wait here something is right 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.160
 not small over dazzle and that would be 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.840
 the family again and to the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.970
 packaging where i put the mediation in it 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.849
 was and we acquire that is also equal 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.519
 see where the batteries are hidden yes 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.680
 do not throw everything away right away 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.330
 Attention, back there are the batteries 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.830
 hidden as a first intended it 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.560
 Well, the takers come very quickly 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.540
 are welded out as I said before 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.610
 the well-known manufacturer of the company d 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.680
 Point is in any case neat it 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.000
 no no disposable quality so there 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.230
 you really have to say microsoft has 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.940
 not up here what to get there 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.190
 Compared to the xbox 360 packaging 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.090
 because that was partly off 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.650
 thank you 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.180
 that was not so nice 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.769
 packed a good deal of soap goes 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.269
 namely on there you have no pressure point 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.220
 press briefly and you're done 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.500
 flap on the back on the inside 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.500
 relatively finished so no rattling 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.690
 nothing neat at all that fits 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.269
 just like ass on bucket short 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.650
 given so that the contacts 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.840
 we do not see above either 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.730
 Inserted the remote where I am 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.630
 really extremely pleased about it 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.549
 because we're talking about that here 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.709
 remote control costs 20 euros dear 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.030
 people link to that by the way in the video 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.380
 description is an Amazon partner 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.299
 they do not go round and now 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.590
 So that 's really a gimmick that 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.230
 This can only happen 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.630
 Remote control in the high price segment 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.890
 namely an internal lighting that 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.370
 funny thing about the thing is the thing 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.440
 not only reacts to pressure but to 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.940
 that is, once the family is in motion 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.230
 the hand of one I knew exactly 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.609
 can press on the same 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.319
 Dimming it with it too 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.910
 So there they have something 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.739
 come up with that and that gives of me 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.970
 In any case, two trees up 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.950
 Now as always after through careful 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.090
 goes out the outside and moves again briefly and 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.100
 Already the thing goes on again 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.810
 I'm looking forward to any event, that's me 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.180
 am satisfied with the part I use I 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.280
 already very active that part in 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.870
 my no home theater system anymore 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.000
 We just have to watch the movie 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.130
 Now here are a few impressions 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.109
 photographed by ice cold hands 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.549
 pupsi that has always been such a fight 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.200
 if you are filmic and had to 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.150
 turn on the controller and then it lights up 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.859
 the lamp that makes the remote 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.489
 just loud quiet walk before going to the 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.079
 start page 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.489
 you can also enforce us 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.739
 See the whole thing with lighting 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.440
 very discreetly held in blue 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.979
 that really fits that really perfectly 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.960
 fits perfectly into every home cinema rhine 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.520
 is not intrusive is not 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.380
 huge does not take place to the outside 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 away is perfect in the hand and we 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.680
 see the processing here too 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.930
 really excellent so there you can 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.210
 really for this price of 20 euros 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.490
 for the sake of the best, do not expect any more 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.169
 I have the prize I am the prize I have 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.180
 The sake of buying the best will not regret 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.800
 So I really put everyone on 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.690
 heart if you need a remote control 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.250
 for example for watching movies or for 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.660
 TV shows or simply times 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.110
 quickly back and forth to turn on 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.340
 Bisserl picked up the remote remote control 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.990
