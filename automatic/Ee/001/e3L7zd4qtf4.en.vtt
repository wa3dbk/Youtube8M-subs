talk to you about the right shoes and if
they<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.300> make<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> difference<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:37.500> how

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
they really make a difference or how

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.350 
they really make a difference or how
much<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.040> difference<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.579> really

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
much of a difference they can really

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.459 
much of a difference they can really
make<00:00:39.570> because<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> lot<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.170> people<00:00:40.410> are

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
make because a lot of people are

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.600 
make because a lot of people are
concerned<00:00:40.559> about<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.780> also<00:00:43.610> improving

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
concerned about that and also improving

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.880 
concerned about that and also improving
muscle<00:00:44.820> quality<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.680> innervating<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
muscle quality and innervating the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
muscle quality and innervating the
central<00:00:47.219> nervous<00:00:47.370> system<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.180> your

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
central nervous system so that your

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.049 
central nervous system so that your
muscles<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.710> activated<00:00:50.070> more<00:00:50.399> quickly<00:00:52.010> so

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
muscles can be activated more quickly so

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.340 
muscles can be activated more quickly so
does<00:00:54.059> changing<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.510> shoes<00:00:54.750> really<00:00:55.110> make<00:00:55.320> a

does changing your shoes really make a
difference<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:55.920> jump<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:57.719> only<00:00:57.960> real

you're<00:01:33.509> probably<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:34.140> right<00:01:35.299> you<00:01:36.299> shouldn't

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you're probably all right you shouldn't

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
you're probably all right you shouldn't
overestimate<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.350> difference<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.890> can

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
overestimate the difference this can

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.090 
overestimate the difference this can
make<00:01:38.159> though<00:01:38.869> it'll<00:01:39.869> probably<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.470> pretty

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
make though it'll probably be pretty

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.789 
make though it'll probably be pretty
unnoticeable<00:01:42.170> but<00:01:43.170> combined<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
unnoticeable but combined with the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.710 
unnoticeable but combined with the
knowledge<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.340> these<00:01:44.490> videos<00:01:44.850> you'll

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
knowledge in all these videos you'll

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.950 
knowledge in all these videos you'll
definitely<00:01:46.200> notice<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.649> difference<00:01:47.960> lighter

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
definitely notice a difference lighter

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.080 
definitely notice a difference lighter
shoes<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.680> actually<00:01:50.100> feel<00:01:50.369> quick<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.909> nice

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
shoes can actually feel quick and nice

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.810 
shoes can actually feel quick and nice
and<00:01:51.560> really<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.770> feeling<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.159> lightness<00:01:53.369> is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and really the feeling of lightness is

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.539 
and really the feeling of lightness is
going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.240> better<00:01:54.390> than<00:01:55.049> any<00:01:55.430> reduction<00:01:56.430> in

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
going to be better than any reduction in

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.920 
going to be better than any reduction in
weight<00:01:56.759> since<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.299> actual<00:01:57.659> amount<00:01:57.750> of

weight since the actual amount of
reduced<00:01:58.170> weight<00:01:58.409> isn't<00:01:58.710> significant

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
reduced weight isn't significant
