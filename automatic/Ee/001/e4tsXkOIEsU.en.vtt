 Hello friends, my name is Johnny Bueno, √Åvila Soccer coach. Ok, today we are going to see the shooting technique. The shooting technique is very important because you must have a good shot towards the goal. It's very simple. If you are right, you use your left leg pointing with your tip of your shoe where the ball will go. It is very important because that, this leg is going to give you the balance and the appropriate swing so that the ball goes where you want. My right foot, which is the one I'm going to kick with ... I'm going to kick with the bone part, this part of the bone, this part, not this part, this is not, not the tip, not here; This part called instep ... I'm going to kick the ball. The tip of my shoe goes down. Putting the movement of your leg always in front, you should not put it back because if you put it back, when you are going to kick, you do not have enough balance and balance for the ball to go straight. If you take this position, the ball will go up. Your foot in front ... you take the, the instep to give it in the middle of the ball, not up, not so down, in the center of the ball. When you go, finish kicking the ball, the tip of your shoe always looking down; not up, not ending up but down. Finish in a position of your knee and hip at 90 degrees. This is the position. So let's make an example. So the ball will always go where you want. Work this technique hard, hard, every day and you will improve a lot. Good luck and take care of yourself.
