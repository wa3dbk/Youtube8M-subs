00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
have real find points on them they're

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.659 
have real find points on them they're
super<00:04:14.989> sharp<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.440> they're<00:04:16.070> just<00:04:16.459> absolutely

them are I went from a 3/8 handle up to
this<00:05:47.380> 7/16<00:05:48.310> handle<00:05:48.670> which<00:05:48.820> is<00:05:49.090> much<00:05:49.870> much

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
this 7/16 handle which is much much

stronger<00:05:50.410> is<00:05:50.740> going<00:05:50.920> to<00:05:50.980> be<00:05:51.070> zero<00:05:51.430> problems

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
stronger is going to be zero problems

stronger is going to be zero problems
with<00:05:52.330> them<00:05:52.480> I<00:05:52.570> have<00:05:52.750> very<00:05:53.080> few<00:05:53.320> problems<00:05:53.770> with

were a little bit of slipping on some of
them<00:06:00.400> and<00:06:00.990> by<00:06:01.990> that<00:06:02.170> I<00:06:02.200> mean<00:06:02.290> when<00:06:02.650> you<00:06:02.830> put<00:06:03.670> a

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
them and by that I mean when you put a

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.810

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
nut in and put a nut in here and started

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.460 
nut in and put a nut in here and started
to<00:06:06.880> come<00:06:07.060> down<00:06:07.090> on<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.660> it<00:06:07.810> would<00:06:07.930> slip<00:06:08.200> and

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
to come down on it it would slip and

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.930 
to come down on it it would slip and
what<00:06:08.590> was<00:06:08.710> happen<00:06:09.010> this<00:06:09.130> slide<00:06:09.400> bar<00:06:09.700> was

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
what was happen this slide bar was

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.130 
what was happen this slide bar was
sliding<00:06:10.180> in<00:06:10.510> what<00:06:11.490> and<00:06:12.510> lots<00:06:13.510> of<00:06:13.660> things<00:06:13.930> to

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
sliding in what and lots of things to

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.010 
sliding in what and lots of things to
eliminate<00:06:14.620> that<00:06:14.800> slippage<00:06:15.340> and<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:16.870> other

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
eliminate that slippage and the other

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.500 
eliminate that slippage and the other
thing<00:06:17.290> that<00:06:17.320> was<00:06:17.620> dragging<00:06:18.210> wasn't<00:06:19.210> a<00:06:19.330> really

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
thing that was dragging wasn't a really

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.910 
thing that was dragging wasn't a really
smooth<00:06:19.990> operation

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
smooth operation

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.330 
smooth operation
I<00:06:20.950> made<00:06:21.550> some<00:06:21.760> internal<00:06:22.180> adjustments<00:06:22.870> that

I made some internal adjustments that

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.650 
I made some internal adjustments that

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
really got is about a smooth this is

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.280 
really got is about a smooth this is
both<00:06:25.990> versions<00:06:26.470> I<00:06:26.530> know<00:06:26.590> how<00:06:26.800> to<00:06:26.890> make<00:06:27.130> one

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
both versions I know how to make one

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.110
