00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
a base to the house in this shape not

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.060 
a base to the house in this shape not
have<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.150> shape<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.900> shape<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.500> you're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
reason why I love this house is you

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.690 
reason why I love this house is you
could<00:00:45.510> make<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.870> long<00:00:46.140> or<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.739> short<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
could make it as long or as short as you

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.119

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
want I have chosen to do one two three

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.100 
want I have chosen to do one two three
four<00:00:50.520> modules<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.329> these<00:00:51.870> are<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
four modules and these are the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.750 
four modules and these are the
separations<00:00:52.680> between<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.100> rooms<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.610> you'll

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
separations between the rooms and you'll

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.729 
separations between the rooms and you'll
see<00:00:53.940> how<00:00:54.059> those<00:00:54.239> work<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> moment<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.530> add

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
see how those work in a moment but add

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.670 
see how those work in a moment but add
three<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.000> base<00:00:57.180> log<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:57.960> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
three on to your base log like this so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.889 
three on to your base log like this so
that<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.980> total<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.430> four<00:00:59.670> high<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.180> go

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that it's a total of four high and go

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
that it's a total of four high and go
ahead<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.219> logs

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
ahead and do that on all of your logs

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.429 
ahead and do that on all of your logs
and<00:01:02.820> when<00:01:02.969> you're<00:01:03.090> ending<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> house<00:01:03.600> instead

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
and when you're ending the house instead

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.399 
and when you're ending the house instead
of<00:01:04.500> doing<00:01:04.890> an<00:01:05.159> open<00:01:05.700> block<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.510> just

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
of doing an open block like this just

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
of doing an open block like this just
fill<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.950> log<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.700> will<00:01:08.820> nice

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
fill it in with a log and that will nice

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.810 
fill it in with a log and that will nice
make<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> nice<00:01:09.960> end<00:01:10.320> point<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.010> your<00:01:11.189> house<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
make a nice end point to your house and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.940 
make a nice end point to your house and
then<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> outsides<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.260> these<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.770> want

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
then on the outsides of these you want

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.550 
then on the outsides of these you want
to<00:01:14.040> grab<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.460> block<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.140> little

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
to grab this block and just do a little

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
to grab this block and just do a little
support<00:01:17.430> sort<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.970> thing<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.509> really

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
support sort of thing I'm not really

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.929 
support sort of thing I'm not really
sure<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:18.990> that'd<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.229> called<00:01:19.729> what<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
sure what that'd be called what that

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.820 
sure what that'd be called what that
would<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.270> called<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:21.840> whatever<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.680> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
would be called but whatever it is it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
would be called but whatever it is it
looks<00:01:22.979> nice<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:23.970> top<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.420> go

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
looks nice and then on top of these go

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.910 
looks nice and then on top of these go
ahead<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:24.960> add<00:01:25.080> your<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.500> cobblestone

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
I would definitely add this to your

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.710 
I would definitely add this to your

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
there's a ton of materials needed seeing

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.610 
there's a ton of materials needed seeing
as<00:03:43.570> how<00:03:43.690> each<00:03:43.900> room<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.320> going<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.500> be

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
as how each room is going to be

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.340 
as how each room is going to be
different<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.160> I<00:03:45.220> just<00:03:45.370> grabbed<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.940> first

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
different so I just grabbed the first

different so I just grabbed the first
two<00:03:47.350> little<00:03:47.709> modules<00:03:50.250> decorations<00:03:51.250> or

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
two little modules decorations or

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.229 
two little modules decorations or
whatever<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.730> want<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:51.910> call<00:03:52.060> these<00:03:52.180> things

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
whatever you want to call these things

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
so in the corner here I place a crafting

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.940 
so in the corner here I place a crafting
table<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:55.989> hold<00:03:56.170> down<00:03:56.200> shift<00:03:56.620> or

whatever on pocket edition to put a
pressure<00:03:58.930> plate<00:03:59.170> above<00:03:59.440> not<00:03:59.680> sure<00:03:59.830> if<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.010> can

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
pressure plate above not sure if you can

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.340 
pressure plate above not sure if you can
unpack<00:04:00.459> edition<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.120> then<00:04:01.540> when<00:04:01.720> I<00:04:01.750> did<00:04:02.050> here

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
unpack edition and then when I did here

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.440 
unpack edition and then when I did here
is<00:04:02.380> I<00:04:02.560> had<00:04:02.709> two<00:04:02.950> pots<00:04:03.220> with<00:04:03.550> you<00:04:03.970> guessed<00:04:04.239> it

you can actually see and whatnot
yeah<00:04:18.579> there<00:04:18.850> we<00:04:18.970> go<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.989> then<00:04:20.769> when<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.009> did

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
yeah there we go and then when I did

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.060 
yeah there we go and then when I did
over<00:04:21.820> here<00:04:21.850> is<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.419> just<00:04:22.449> put<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:23.110> chest<00:04:23.650> on<00:04:23.919> a
