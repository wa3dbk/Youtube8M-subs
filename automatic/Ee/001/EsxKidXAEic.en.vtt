00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
thought out and planned and coordinated

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.160 
thought out and planned and coordinated
so<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.579> like<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:01.000> kind<00:03:01.269> of<00:03:01.299> like<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.510> whole<00:03:01.810> look

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
so I like you kind of like a whole look

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.720 
so I like you kind of like a whole look
I<00:03:02.470> mean<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.920> bad<00:03:03.070> thing<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.340> if<00:03:03.579> you<00:03:03.700> don't

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
I mean the bad thing is if you don't

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.020 
I mean the bad thing is if you don't
like<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.239> look<00:03:04.450> then<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.900> know<00:03:05.560> at<00:03:05.829> all<00:03:06.030> it

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
like the look then you know at all it

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.550 
like the look then you know at all it
might<00:03:07.239> be<00:03:07.329> at<00:03:07.420> all<00:03:07.570> or<00:03:07.750> nothing<00:03:08.049> thing<00:03:08.200> for<00:03:08.440> you

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
might be at all or nothing thing for you

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.979 
might be at all or nothing thing for you
but<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.730> think<00:03:10.030> it's<00:03:10.239> definitely<00:03:10.510> worth<00:03:10.840> of

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
but I think it's definitely worth of

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.080 
but I think it's definitely worth of
thirty-six<00:03:11.380> dollars<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.950> pieces<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.609> know
