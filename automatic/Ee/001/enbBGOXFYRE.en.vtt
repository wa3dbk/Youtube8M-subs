00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.990
 determine the number of solutions for each 

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:06.850
 one of these equations give us three 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.770
 equations before solving these 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.970
 equations in particular let's remember one 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.770
 little when we can have a solution 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.100
 infinite solutions or no solution 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.110
 we will have a solution if by solving the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.780
 equation we can reach some 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.260
 result as x is equal to some number 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.780
 x is equal to say so 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.199
 abstract x is equal to or if we were 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.390
 really solve we will have x equals 5 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.069
 or 10 or less pi at last 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.929
 but if we really solve for a 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:40.780
 x in specific then we will have a 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:43.390
 This solution is therefore a 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.729
 so try to manipulate these equations 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.139
 completely legitimate but 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:52.870
 with something crazy like 3 equals 5 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:55.960
 you will have no solution and if 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.780
 rationally think about it all 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.999
 these equations are about finding an x 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.089
 that satisfies this and if it is only 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.049
 simplify and get something like 3 is the same 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.960
 to 5 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:12.399
 you may wonder is there any x 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.890
 that can magically do x opa do 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.229
 three is equal to 5 and the answer is not 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.479
 no x can magically make three be 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.609
 equal to 5 there is no way to do 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.950
 this is true no matter which x 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.689
 We chose soon if you have something very 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.380
 strange that means you do not have 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.689
 solution 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.119
 on the other hand if you get something like 5 is 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.009
 equal to 5 I'm using too many number 5 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.630
 need not be a number 5 could be 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.399
 7 10 113 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.869
 Actually, I'm going to take these five only. 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.570
 to make sure you do not think 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.130
 that is with five you get to something and if something 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.469
 be equal to yourself what will be 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.109
 true no matter what x you 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.880
 choose any x you choose it 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.799
 It will be real good so we will have 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.200
 infinite solutions 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.859
 using this as a preview let's try 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.409
 solve these three equations here we go 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.479
 see maybe we can subtract if people 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.429
 You want to get rid of this two here on the side. 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.740
 left, we can subtract two of the 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.740
 two sides subtracting two of the two 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.730
 sides we'll stick with on the left side 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.980
 Let's stay with less 7x on the side 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.390
 Let's stay right 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.470
 with 2 x 1 they will cancel less 9 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:27.299
 x 2 x - 9 x simplify we will have less 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.920
 7 x we have less 70 equal to minus 7 x 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.049
 You're probably already seeing this. 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.870
 will give this equation is already true 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.540
 for any x you choose minus seven 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.790
 times this x is going to be equal to less 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.040
 seven times this is so we are 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.269
 walking towards this scenario but can 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.400
 think I do not see 13 equals 13 ee 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.530
 if you do something like split the two sides 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.060
 for at least 7 what am I doing this 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.340
 point is even necessary to understand 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.709
 this is seven times some number 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.620
 it will always be seven times less 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.799
 same number but if you did that you 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.799
 would have x is equal to x we could raise 3 x 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.109
 2 sides would have zero equals zero 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.540
 is true for whatever x you choose 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.760
 zero will always equal zero then 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.709
 any of these statements shall be the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.310
 true for whatever x you choose 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.019
 in this equation here we have a number 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.660
 infinite solutions 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.760
 Let's think about this one in between. 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.880
 good again, let's try 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.690
 I'll do it a little differently, I'll add 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:37.400
 this 2x and this - 9x here we will stay 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:45.959
 with at least 7 x + 3 equals minus 7 x 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:46.769
 plus 32 x + - 9 x equals minus 7 x + 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.660
 2 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.910
 Let's add, in fact, it's better to do 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.799
 this in green let's use the color green 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.190
 two more 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.780
 we have two here now let's add 7x 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.239
 on both sides 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.730
 if we add 7 installed left 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.440
 we'll only have three here added 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.870
 If it hits the right side it will 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.690
 disappear and we will only have two 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.660
 here all I did was add 7x to 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.739
 two sides of the equation and now we have something 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.109
 meaningless 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.750
 no matter what x you choose the com 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.690
 magic this xis can be does not exist 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.460
 x shape make three equal to 2 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.630
 therefore in this scenario we have no 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.010
 no solution 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.820
 not the x in the universe that can satisfy 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.300
 this equation 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.160
 now let's see this third scenario 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.950
 once again we will subtract three of the 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.020
 two sides just to see if we can 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.080
 to get rid of this independent term let 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.710
 stay with less 70 left side 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.560
 on the right side we will have 2 x 1 - 1 now 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.780
 we can subtract 2x from both sides 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:04.020
 subtract 2x from both sides we will get 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.180
 one subtracting 2x will get nine - 9 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.100
 x is equal to minus one 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.410
 we can divide both sides for less 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.780
 nine and we will have an x 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.940
 is equal to a one therefore in this scenario 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.970
 here we get very clearly 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.280
 find the xx equals a nono that 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:25.430
 satisfies this equation so it is 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.430
 here is only one solution.
