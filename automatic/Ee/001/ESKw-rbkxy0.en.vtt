00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
didn't and we were the first ones who

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
didn't and we were the first ones who
attacked<00:01:02.969> because<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.690> were<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.870> four<00:01:04.170> this

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
so that kind of gave the other players

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.260 
so that kind of gave the other players
an<00:01:07.020> idea<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.860> where<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> real<00:01:08.729> attack<00:01:09.060> is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
an idea of where the real attack is

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
an idea of where the real attack is
coming<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.780> obviously<00:01:10.560> he<00:01:10.770> put<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.189> lot<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.250 
coming and obviously he put a lot of
defense<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.240> village<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.780> he<00:01:12.840> got<00:01:12.990> help

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
one of the top alliances i know were

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.740 
one of the top alliances i know were
first<00:01:17.520> we're<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> top

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
first we're kind of like in the top

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.200 
first we're kind of like in the top
three<00:01:19.020> alliance<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:20.549> are<00:01:20.670> lies<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
three alliance but there are lies as a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.740 
three alliance but there are lies as a
big<00:01:21.770> big<00:01:22.770> metal<00:01:23.549> line<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.360> another

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
big big metal line so that have another

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.780 
big big metal line so that have another
seven<00:01:25.500> eight<00:01:25.710> wings<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.400> are<00:01:26.460> actually

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
seven eight wings that are actually

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.690 
seven eight wings that are actually
really<00:01:27.299> really<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.900> big<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:29.009> that's<00:01:29.490> what

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
really really really big so that's what

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.280 
really really really big so that's what
happened<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.360> play<00:01:30.570> prepared<00:01:31.079> enough

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
happened the play prepared enough

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380 
happened the play prepared enough
defense<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.890> our<00:01:32.280> hammer<00:01:32.670> wasn't<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> only

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
defense and our hammer wasn't the only

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.530 
defense and our hammer wasn't the only
hammer<00:01:33.780> always<00:01:34.350> actually<00:01:34.920> landed<00:01:35.400> first<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.509> i

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
hammer always actually landed first so i

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.660 
hammer always actually landed first so i
took<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.930> most<00:01:37.110> damage<00:01:37.590> autos<00:01:38.100> landed<00:01:38.460> first

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
took the most damage autos landed first

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.359 
took the most damage autos landed first
and<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> other<00:01:39.509> attacks<00:01:40.079> landed<00:01:40.590> so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
and then the other attacks landed so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.920 
and then the other attacks landed so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
hammer this is the clearing wave which

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.270 
hammer this is the clearing wave which
sucked<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.750> God<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:48.960> hammer<00:01:49.200> killed<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.770> he

sucked and God or hammer killed and he

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.859 
sucked and God or hammer killed and he
had<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> lot<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> defense<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.479> i<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.659> show<00:01:51.810> you

had a lot of defense and i will show you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
had a lot of defense and i will show you
guys<00:01:52.020> how<00:01:52.079> many<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.619> actually<00:01:53.040> killed<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.549> you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
guys how many be actually killed as you

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.030 
guys how many be actually killed as you
guys<00:01:54.060> could<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.990> doesn't<00:01:55.350> show<00:01:55.649> how<00:01:55.829> many

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
guys could see it doesn't show how many

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.069 
guys could see it doesn't show how many
were<00:01:56.159> killed<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:57.090> there's<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.540> way<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.899> knowing

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
were killed but there's a way of knowing

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.100 
were killed but there's a way of knowing
it<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.560> estimate<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.490> how<00:01:59.520> many<00:01:59.729> be<00:02:00.030> killed<00:02:00.329> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
it on estimate of how many be killed so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.679 
it on estimate of how many be killed so
these<00:02:01.469> are<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.649> three<00:02:01.740> waves<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.329> other

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
these are the three waves so the other

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.510 
these are the three waves so the other
two<00:02:03.960> ways<00:02:04.140> were<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> cata<00:02:04.950> waves<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
two ways were just the cata waves and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.080 
two ways were just the cata waves and
which<00:02:05.670> failed<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.960> lost<00:02:07.729> 14<00:02:08.729> nearly

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
which failed so we just lost 14 nearly

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.550 
which failed so we just lost 14 nearly
14,000<00:02:10.020> worth<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.410> crop<00:02:10.940> wrong<00:02:11.940> for

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
14,000 worth of crop wrong for

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.790 
14,000 worth of crop wrong for
hammer<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.099> which<00:02:14.000> sucks<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.500> know<00:02:15.530> we

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
hammer and which sucks but you know we

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.010 
hammer and which sucks but you know we
have<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.010> rebuild<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.730> things<00:02:16.940> happen<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.840> let

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
have to rebuild and things happen so let

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.570 
have to rebuild and things happen so let
me<00:02:18.050> show<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.319> guys<00:02:18.410> how<00:02:18.560> many<00:02:18.890> we<00:02:19.160> actually

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.490 
me show you guys how many we actually
killed<00:02:19.910> if<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.239> go<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.450> top<00:02:20.780> 10<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.380> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
killed if you go to top 10 and the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.830 
killed if you go to top 10 and the
players<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:22.640> will<00:02:22.849> show<00:02:23.060> how<00:02:23.270> many<00:02:23.450> we<00:02:23.569> can<00:02:23.720> we

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
players it will show how many we can we

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.360 
players it will show how many we can we
actually<00:02:23.989> kill<00:02:25.209> 2521<00:02:26.209> troops<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.440> enemies

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
actually kill 2521 troops of the enemies

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.160 
actually kill 2521 troops of the enemies
so<00:02:28.610> basically<00:02:29.090> we<00:02:29.209> killed<00:02:29.920> 2521<00:02:30.920> defense<00:02:32.170> and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.280 
so basically we killed 2521 defense and
this<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:34.099> I<00:02:34.340> know<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.940> because<00:02:35.110> we<00:02:36.110> didn't

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290

village we attacked in the past week so

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.089 
village we attacked in the past week so
that's<00:02:40.550> how<00:02:40.760> much<00:02:40.910> defense<00:02:41.300> we<00:02:41.510> chilled<00:02:41.780> and

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
that's how much defense we chilled and

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.920 
that's how much defense we chilled and
they<00:02:43.099> were<00:02:43.190> supposed<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.610> go<00:02:43.790> five<00:02:44.150> hammers<00:02:44.690> on

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
players health which was one of one of

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.110 
players health which was one of one of
them<00:02:49.940> were<00:02:50.420> us<00:02:50.840> but<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.980> know<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.850> other<00:02:53.000> two

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.400 
players didn't attack and that kind of
sucked<00:02:55.220> but<00:02:55.790> still<00:02:56.180> our<00:02:56.390> hammer<00:02:56.630> was<00:02:56.900> first<00:02:57.170> so

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
sucked but still our hammer was first so

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.259 
sucked but still our hammer was first so
