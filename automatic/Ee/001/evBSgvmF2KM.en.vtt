years<00:00:49.760> ago<00:00:50.120> Jojo<00:00:50.960> came<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:51.469> us<00:00:51.649> with<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.640> idea

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
years ago Jojo came to us with the idea

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.930 
years ago Jojo came to us with the idea
of<00:00:53.090> this<00:00:53.270> perfect<00:00:53.780> craft<00:00:53.989> ride<00:00:54.350> cymbal<00:00:54.940> every

of this perfect craft ride cymbal every
symbol<00:00:56.180> he's<00:00:56.420> played<00:00:56.719> up<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:57.109> now<00:00:57.320> was<00:00:57.829> always

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
symbol he's played up to now was always

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.069 
symbol he's played up to now was always
a<00:00:58.160> bit<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.399> a<00:00:58.519> compromise<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.449> may<00:00:59.660> have<00:00:59.780> a<00:00:59.809> good

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
a bit of a compromise it may have a good

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.740 
a bit of a compromise it may have a good
ride<00:01:00.289> or<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.800> fairly<00:01:01.219> good<00:01:01.370> right<00:01:01.699> thing<00:01:01.940> but<00:01:02.629> it

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
ride or a fairly good right thing but it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.259 
ride or a fairly good right thing but it
wasn't<00:01:03.109> a<00:01:03.500> great<00:01:04.070> combination<00:01:04.550> that<00:01:04.940> he<00:01:05.089> knew

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
wasn't a great combination that he knew

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.359 
wasn't a great combination that he knew
that<00:01:05.479> could<00:01:05.630> be<00:01:05.750> created<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:06.530> over<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.340> past

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
that could be created so over the past

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.270 
that could be created so over the past
year<00:01:08.090> we've<00:01:08.690> worked<00:01:08.929> on<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.350> Omni<00:01:09.800> we've

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
year we've worked on the Omni we've

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.620 
year we've worked on the Omni we've
tried<00:01:10.520> different<00:01:10.759> sizes<00:01:11.500> 18<00:01:12.500> through<00:01:12.740> 20<00:01:12.890> two

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
tried different sizes 18 through 20 two

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.029 
tried different sizes 18 through 20 two
different<00:01:14.630> hammer<00:01:14.810> pattern<00:01:15.410> different<00:01:15.890> lathe

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
different hammer pattern different lathe

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.770 
different hammer pattern different lathe
patterns<00:01:16.550> and<00:01:17.000> we<00:01:17.179> think<00:01:17.450> we've<00:01:17.600> really

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
patterns and we think we've really

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.510 
patterns and we think we've really
nailed<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.350> with<00:01:18.440> what<00:01:18.590> we<00:01:18.710> have<00:01:18.890> here<00:01:19.160> today

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
nailed it with what we have here today

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.670 
nailed it with what we have here today
at<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.910> army<00:01:20.330> it's<00:01:21.020> got<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.170> great<00:01:21.320> stick

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
at the army it's got a great stick

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.340 
at the army it's got a great stick
definition<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.430> strong<00:01:22.759> bill<00:01:23.090> very<00:01:23.780> thin<00:01:24.110> edge

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
definition a strong bill very thin edge

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.109 
definition a strong bill very thin edge
so<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:24.710> can<00:01:24.890> go<00:01:25.040> from<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.310> right<00:01:25.520> pattern<00:01:25.850> of

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
so you can go from the right pattern of

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.390 
so you can go from the right pattern of
the<00:01:26.210> crack<00:01:26.450> back<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.049> ride<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.740> then<00:01:28.040> one

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
the crack back to the ride and then one

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.310 
the crack back to the ride and then one
doesn't<00:01:28.729> overtake<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.240> other<00:01:29.390> it's<00:01:30.170> our

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
doesn't overtake the other it's our

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.960 
doesn't overtake the other it's our
closest<00:01:30.740> anyone's<00:01:31.130> ever<00:01:31.280> something<00:01:31.700> having

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
closest anyone's ever something having

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.290 
closest anyone's ever something having
two<00:01:32.150> symbols<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.689> one

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
two symbols of one

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.770 
two symbols of one
it's<00:01:33.900> available<00:01:34.230> in<00:01:34.410> 18<00:01:34.860> inch<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.310> 22-inch

it's<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.310> perfect<00:02:00.520> crash<00:02:00.970> right<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
it's the perfect crash right and

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.700 
it's the perfect crash right and
actually<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.520> marketing<00:02:04.150> campaign<00:02:04.630> it's<00:02:05.590> a
