00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
computer terminal it's gonna be in here

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.270 
computer terminal it's gonna be in here
it's<00:01:55.079> gonna<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> left<00:01:55.799> now<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.130> you

go in there come down here again you
have<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.030> use<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.239> rewire<00:03:10.660> to<00:03:10.989> make<00:03:11.620> this

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
have to use that rewire to make this

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.190 
have to use that rewire to make this
door<00:03:12.070> available<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.989> ground

door available to you and on the ground
is<00:03:14.410> going<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.739> be<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.040> ID<00:03:15.190> tag<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:16.000> you'll<00:03:16.120> see

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
is going to be the ID tag and you'll see

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.090 
is going to be the ID tag and you'll see
here<00:03:16.600> on<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.900> map<00:03:17.080> momentarily<00:03:17.709> where<00:03:18.010> we<00:03:18.160> are

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
here on the map momentarily where we are

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.860 
here on the map momentarily where we are
now<00:03:21.100> on<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.489> map<00:03:21.760> there<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.180> see<00:03:22.390> my<00:03:22.630> white

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
now on the map there you see my white

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.340 
now on the map there you see my white
circle<00:03:23.410> if<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:23.920> look<00:03:24.070> at<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.250> green<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
circle if you look at the green the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.470 
circle if you look at the green the
point<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.130> we're<00:03:27.280> going<00:03:27.549> to<00:03:27.730> that's<00:03:28.150> where

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
point that we're going to that's where

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.500 
point that we're going to that's where
we're<00:03:28.630> starting<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.980> one<00:03:30.280> from<00:03:30.670> right<00:03:31.420> at

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
we're starting of this one from right at

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.180 
we're starting of this one from right at
that<00:03:31.660> point<00:03:31.930> we're<00:03:32.110> gonna<00:03:32.230> go<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.650> our<00:03:32.739> kind<00:03:33.130> of

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
that point we're gonna go to our kind of

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.830 
that point we're gonna go to our kind of
log<00:03:33.340> number<00:03:33.519> 34<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.329> you<00:03:34.420> could<00:03:34.540> come<00:03:34.690> back

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
log number 34 so you could come back

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.720 
log number 34 so you could come back
here<00:03:35.110> you'll<00:03:35.260> see<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.590> save<00:03:35.860> point<00:03:36.220> there's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
here you'll see that save point there's

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.430 
here you'll see that save point there's
also<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.060> blueprint<00:03:37.660> that's<00:03:37.780> on<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.200> table

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
also a blueprint that's on that table

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.280 
also a blueprint that's on that table
back<00:03:39.310> here's<00:03:39.610> event<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.209> can<00:03:40.420> go<00:03:40.450> into<00:03:40.840> and

computer<00:05:10.900> terminal<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.440> computer<00:05:11.830> terminals

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
computer terminal the computer terminals

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.400 
computer terminal the computer terminals
for<00:05:12.699> that<00:05:12.910> mr.<00:05:13.240> o<00:05:13.300> most<00:05:13.509> logs<00:05:13.750> look<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.169> little

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
for that mr. o most logs look a little

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.730 
for that mr. o most logs look a little
different<00:05:15.599> so<00:05:16.599> you're<00:05:16.750> gonna<00:05:16.840> access<00:05:17.320> this

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
going to be an ID tag in here as well

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.969 
going to be an ID tag in here as well
just<00:05:23.520> about<00:05:24.520> 15<00:05:25.180> feet<00:05:25.449> away<00:05:25.599> so<00:05:26.560> we're<00:05:26.770> going

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
just about 15 feet away so we're going

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.279 
just about 15 feet away so we're going
to<00:05:27.099> go<00:05:27.430> ahead<00:05:27.550> and<00:05:28.060> head<00:05:28.510> that<00:05:28.539> way<00:05:29.020> and

to go ahead and head that way and

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.529 
to go ahead and head that way and
that'll<00:05:30.190> be<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.400> final<00:05:30.760> collectable<00:05:31.330> in

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
that'll be the final collectable in
