00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.009
 on the ground 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.399

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.100
 global events around them 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.800

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.239
 passive 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.200
 it was a disaster because now 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.610
 the buyer could watch what he wanted 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.450
 they themselves also impose agencies 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.299
 but an agency like this considered themselves 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.890
 invincible not so they shrugged it off 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.509
 from the changes they were kept for what is already 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:23.640

 but they held out the hardest 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.990

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.930
 places of country associations 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.710
 agency just reworked 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.830

 future changes

 but in the end, no car causes 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.149
 what matters is that once at the agency 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.099
 people were sitting 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
