00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
we're looking at it still it can vary

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500 
we're looking at it still it can vary
from<00:02:09.619> region<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.979> region<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:10.610> some<00:02:11.239> reasons

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
from region to region so some reasons

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.300 
from region to region so some reasons
might<00:02:11.660> be<00:02:11.750> before<00:02:12.049> I<00:02:12.080> wasn't<00:02:12.650> all<00:02:12.799> depending

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
might be before I wasn't all depending

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.920 
might be before I wasn't all depending
on<00:02:13.430> availability<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:15.440> moment

what about the price it'll probably be

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.160 
what about the price it'll probably be
similar<00:02:24.549> to<00:02:24.760> whether<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.569> current<00:02:25.719> of<00:02:25.959> time

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
similar to whether the current of time

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.099
