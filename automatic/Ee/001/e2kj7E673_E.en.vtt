00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
and this is the naked version which has

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.760 
and this is the naked version which has
just<00:01:54.040> one<00:01:54.370> basic<00:01:54.940> rule<00:01:55.120> cars<00:01:56.110> must<00:01:56.620> have

just one basic rule cars must have

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.640 
just one basic rule cars must have
waited<00:01:56.980> people<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.700> bugs

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
waited people and bugs

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.890 
waited people and bugs
the<00:01:59.830> idea<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.790> removing<00:02:01.600> all<00:02:01.750> those

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
the idea is that removing all those

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.470 
the idea is that removing all those
trappings<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.710> modern<00:02:02.770> day<00:02:03.220> traffic<00:02:03.520> means

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
trappings of modern day traffic means

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.200 
trappings of modern day traffic means
drivers<00:02:04.900> cyclists<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:05.890> pedestrians<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:07.030> to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
drivers cyclists and pedestrians have to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.280 
drivers cyclists and pedestrians have to
interact<00:02:08.790> they<00:02:09.790> stop<00:02:10.119> looking<00:02:10.270> at<00:02:10.570> signs<00:02:10.840> and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
interact they stop looking at signs and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.440 
interact they stop looking at signs and
start<00:02:11.680> looking<00:02:11.860> at<00:02:12.100> each<00:02:12.220> other<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.820> negotiate

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
start looking at each other to negotiate

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.720 
start looking at each other to negotiate
their<00:02:13.660> way<00:02:13.810> around<00:02:13.960> along<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.190> across<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
their way around along and across the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.000 
their way around along and across the
intersection<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.780> people<00:02:17.140> companies<00:02:17.740> listen

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
intersection so people companies listen

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.500 
intersection so people companies listen

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
section with no time for actually

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.510 
section with no time for actually
slowing<00:02:20.350> down<00:02:20.560> because<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.160> think<00:02:21.220> it's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
slowing down because I think it's

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.330 
slowing down because I think it's
dangerous<00:02:21.700> yeah<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:23.410> then<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.100> people

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
dangerous yeah and then the people

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.760 
dangerous yeah and then the people
personalities<00:02:25.030> kick<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.050> give<00:02:26.620> way

there's quite a lot mr. Beatty juncture
as<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.180> bonus<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.440> new<00:02:56.650> safer<00:02:57.310> roundabout<00:02:57.820> is

as a bonus the new safer roundabout is

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.039 
as a bonus the new safer roundabout is
much<00:02:58.270> easier<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.960> the<00:02:59.080> eye

tremendous amount of thorn has gone into
the<00:03:03.459> road<00:03:03.640> design<00:03:03.969> inductor<00:03:04.599> these<00:03:05.230> waterfowl

the road design inductor these waterfowl
is<00:03:06.129> not<00:03:06.310> only<00:03:06.489> look<00:03:06.790> good<00:03:07.030> they<00:03:07.540> serve<00:03:07.840> a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
is not only look good they serve a

is not only look good they serve a
purpose<00:03:08.579> connected<00:03:09.579> to<00:03:09.700> senses<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.749> Hemi

so far this shared space system has been

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.509 
so far this shared space system has been
trialed<00:03:23.109> by<00:03:23.139> seven<00:03:23.709> regions<00:03:24.189> in<00:03:24.400> the

the UK with promising results the real
