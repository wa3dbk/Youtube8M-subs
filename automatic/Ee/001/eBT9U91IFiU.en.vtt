my<00:01:49.590> azumarill<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.939> figure<00:01:51.329> he's<00:01:51.450> an<00:01:51.630> ice

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
my azumarill and I figure he's an ice

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.469 
my azumarill and I figure he's an ice
beam<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.409> that's<00:01:53.369> exactly<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:53.909> he<00:01:54.000> does<00:01:54.210> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
beam and that's exactly what he does and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.959 
beam and that's exactly what he does and
I<00:01:54.930> see<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.170> my<00:01:55.350> HP<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.100> dropping<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.670> lot

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
I see that my HP is dropping a lot

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.149 
I see that my HP is dropping a lot
faster<00:01:57.299> than<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.810> should<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.920> knows

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
faster than it should have so I knows

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.340 
faster than it should have so I knows
it'll<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> crate<00:01:59.790> which<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.960> sucks

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
it'll be a crate which it was that sucks

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.440 
it'll be a crate which it was that sucks
but<00:02:01.560> not<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.670> nice

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
but not really it's all right and nice

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.569 
but not really it's all right and nice
and<00:02:03.659> switches<00:02:03.930> normal<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.799> figured<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and switches normal here I figured that

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.679 
and switches normal here I figured that
he<00:02:05.640> would<00:02:05.670> probably<00:02:06.030> want<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.270> switch<00:02:06.479> out

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
he would probably want to switch out

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.779 
he would probably want to switch out
he'll<00:02:07.229> go<00:02:07.409> for<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.560> Bandit<00:02:08.069> ice<00:02:08.220> punch<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
he'll go for the Bandit ice punch and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.460 
he'll go for the Bandit ice punch and
luckily<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.330> hits<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.690> Venus<00:02:10.050> aura<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
luckily it hits the Venus aura on the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.270 
luckily it hits the Venus aura on the
upcoming<00:02:10.619> switch<00:02:11.400> for

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
upcoming switch for

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.520 
upcoming switch for

with I wanna go for a quick attack here
I<00:03:43.090> figured<00:03:43.780> this<00:03:44.260> might<00:03:44.470> come<00:03:44.709> down<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:45.480> really

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
I figured this might come down to really

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.599 
I figured this might come down to really
mad<00:03:46.660> max<00:03:46.930> damage<00:03:47.170> give<00:03:47.530> or<00:03:47.650> take<00:03:47.829> it'll<00:03:48.549> be

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
mad max damage give or take it'll be

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.400 
mad max damage give or take it'll be
close<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.060> see<00:03:49.239> brutal<00:03:49.480> kill<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:49.989> doesn't

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
close to see brutal kill and it doesn't

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.039 
close to see brutal kill and it doesn't
just<00:03:50.530> low<00:03:50.950> red<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.880> I'm<00:03:51.970> not<00:03:52.120> not<00:03:52.780> really

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
just low red so I'm not not really

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.140 
just low red so I'm not not really
bothered<00:03:53.230> by<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:54.070> I'm<00:03:54.760> gonna<00:03:54.880> go<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.090> my

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
bothered by it but I'm gonna go to my

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.030 
bothered by it but I'm gonna go to my
simulator<00:03:55.660> just<00:03:55.989> play<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.230> safe<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.769> go<00:03:56.890> for

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
simulator just play it safe and go for

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.860 
simulator just play it safe and go for
the<00:03:57.070> Aquajet<00:03:57.459> at<00:03:58.000> these<00:03:58.359> they're<00:03:58.570> gonna<00:03:58.690> take

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the Aquajet at these they're gonna take

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.560 
the Aquajet at these they're gonna take
him<00:03:59.049> out<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.680> figure<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:01.150> would<00:04:01.239> probably

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
him out and I figure it would probably

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.330 
him out and I figure it would probably
hit<00:04:01.630> hard<00:04:01.959> on<00:04:02.109> anything<00:04:02.440> on<00:04:02.650> his<00:04:02.769> team<00:04:03.070> since<00:04:03.280> I

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
hit hard on anything on his team since I

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.150 
hit hard on anything on his team since I
am<00:04:03.489> banded<00:04:03.940> plus<00:04:04.150> huge<00:04:04.570> power<00:04:04.950> except<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.040> the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
am banded plus huge power except to the

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.880 
am banded plus huge power except to the
fact<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.519> I<00:04:06.640> see<00:04:07.030> on<00:04:07.359> this<00:04:07.989> turn<00:04:08.380> that<00:04:08.590> he<00:04:08.769> has

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
fact that I see on this turn that he has

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.220 
fact that I see on this turn that he has
a<00:04:08.920> melodic<00:04:09.760> on<00:04:09.940> his<00:04:10.120> team<00:04:10.359> oh<00:04:10.510> no<00:04:10.600> eh<00:04:10.840> goes<00:04:11.109> to

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
a melodic on his team oh no eh goes to

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.190 
a melodic on his team oh no eh goes to
the<00:04:11.350> Venus<00:04:11.650> or<00:04:11.799> and<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.670> survives<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.480> stealth

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
the Venus or and it survives the stealth

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.009 
the Venus or and it survives the stealth
rocks<00:04:14.470> which<00:04:14.680> really<00:04:15.190> sucked<00:04:15.489> but<00:04:16.019> whatever

azumarill<00:04:47.580> but<00:04:48.569> yeah<00:04:49.020> whatever<00:04:49.610> he<00:04:50.610> gets<00:04:50.849> his

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
azumarill but yeah whatever he gets his

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.420 
azumarill but yeah whatever he gets his
life<00:04:51.210> he's<00:04:51.449> going<00:04:51.750> toxic<00:04:52.590> hurting<00:04:53.039> me<00:04:53.190> but

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
life he's going toxic hurting me but

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.149 
life he's going toxic hurting me but
it's<00:04:53.759> only<00:04:53.909> the<00:04:54.090> first<00:04:54.360> turn<00:04:54.720> so<00:04:55.080> not<00:04:55.770> too<00:04:55.949> bad

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
it's only the first turn so not too bad

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.219 
it's only the first turn so not too bad
he<00:04:56.340> goes<00:04:56.520> for<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:56.819> protect<00:04:57.240> here<00:04:57.630> I<00:04:57.780> guess<00:04:58.199> he

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
he goes for the protect here I guess he

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.839 
he goes for the protect here I guess he
saw<00:04:58.530> my<00:04:58.680> fake<00:04:58.889> out<00:04:59.069> coming<00:04:59.400> already<00:04:59.610> just

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
saw my fake out coming already just

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.629 
saw my fake out coming already just
really<00:05:00.210> wanted<00:05:00.569> more<00:05:00.889> toxic<00:05:01.889> to<00:05:02.039> be<00:05:02.159> racked<00:05:02.400> up

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
really wanted more toxic to be racked up

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.899 
really wanted more toxic to be racked up
so<00:05:02.880> regardless<00:05:03.720> was<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:04.020> good<00:05:04.169> play<00:05:04.349> on<00:05:04.380> him

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
so regardless was a good play on him

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.850 
so regardless was a good play on him
from<00:05:05.909> both<00:05:06.150> perspectives<00:05:06.360> so<00:05:06.960> yep<00:05:07.650> nice

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
from both perspectives so yep nice

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.520 
from both perspectives so yep nice
movement<00:05:08.120> now<00:05:09.120> that<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.509> poison<00:05:09.870> ragging<00:05:10.380> up

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
movement now that the poison ragging up

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.439 
movement now that the poison ragging up
I'm<00:05:10.710> not<00:05:10.860> really<00:05:11.190> that<00:05:11.490> worried<00:05:11.940> because<00:05:12.240> I

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
I'm not really that worried because I

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.629 
I'm not really that worried because I
see<00:05:12.659> that<00:05:12.840> this<00:05:12.960> return<00:05:13.500> does<00:05:14.009> a<00:05:14.039> really<00:05:14.400> good

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
see that this return does a really good

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.939 
see that this return does a really good
chunk<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.419> know<00:05:15.780> it's<00:05:16.110> it's<00:05:16.500> gonna<00:05:16.680> be<00:05:16.919> a

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
chunk you know it's it's gonna be a

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.089 
chunk you know it's it's gonna be a
three<00:05:17.220> hit<00:05:17.430> KO<00:05:17.669> regardless<00:05:18.389> but<00:05:19.259> you<00:05:19.949> know<00:05:20.069> I

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
three hit KO regardless but you know I

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.680 
three hit KO regardless but you know I
really<00:05:20.490> thought<00:05:20.610> this<00:05:20.789> melodic<00:05:21.389> would<00:05:21.569> have

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
really thought this melodic would have

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.180 
really thought this melodic would have
been<00:05:21.810> physically<00:05:22.380> bulky<00:05:22.710> but<00:05:22.889> it<00:05:22.949> ends<00:05:23.130> up

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
been physically bulky but it ends up

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.189 
been physically bulky but it ends up
being<00:05:23.220> special<00:05:23.759> bulky<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:24.270> that<00:05:24.780> works<00:05:25.020> out

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
being special bulky and that works out

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.649 
being special bulky and that works out
really<00:05:25.259> nice<00:05:25.849> he<00:05:26.849> shows<00:05:27.090> me<00:05:27.120> that<00:05:27.360> is<00:05:27.509> to

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
really nice he shows me that is to

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.450 
really nice he shows me that is to
recover<00:05:27.960> this<00:05:28.229> turn<00:05:28.500> that<00:05:28.830> really<00:05:29.159> sucks

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
recover this turn that really sucks

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.010 
recover this turn that really sucks
because<00:05:29.610> he<00:05:30.060> could<00:05:30.180> really<00:05:30.389> just<00:05:30.479> poison

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
because he could really just poison

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.600 
because he could really just poison
stall<00:05:31.229> me<00:05:31.380> out<00:05:31.409> so<00:05:32.009> I<00:05:32.070> want<00:05:32.219> to<00:05:32.250> get<00:05:32.370> out<00:05:32.430> of

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
stall me out so I want to get out of

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.219 
stall me out so I want to get out of
there<00:05:32.789> I'm<00:05:32.849> gonna<00:05:32.969> go<00:05:33.150> back<00:05:33.509> into<00:05:33.719> my<00:05:33.870> zoom

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
there I'm gonna go back into my zoom

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.709 
there I'm gonna go back into my zoom
role<00:05:34.440> here<00:05:34.759> cuz<00:05:35.759> I<00:05:35.820> could<00:05:36.000> possibly<00:05:36.539> take

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
role here cuz I could possibly take

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.450 
role here cuz I could possibly take
everything<00:05:37.259> that<00:05:37.289> it<00:05:37.469> was<00:05:37.560> hit<00:05:37.770> me<00:05:37.830> with<00:05:37.979> there

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
everything that it was hit me with there

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.279 
everything that it was hit me with there
wouldn't<00:05:38.880> be<00:05:39.000> any<00:05:39.210> point<00:05:39.570> of<00:05:39.690> him<00:05:39.810> hitting<00:05:40.050> me

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
wouldn't be any point of him hitting me

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.770 
wouldn't be any point of him hitting me
with<00:05:40.440> toxic<00:05:41.009> since<00:05:41.669> I<00:05:41.820> had<00:05:41.940> a<00:05:41.969> kangaskhan<00:05:42.570> in

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
with toxic since I had a kangaskhan in

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.600 
with toxic since I had a kangaskhan in
so<00:05:43.229> I<00:05:43.259> figured<00:05:43.289> you'd<00:05:43.680> go<00:05:43.889> for<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.159> water<00:05:44.370> move

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
so I figured you'd go for the water move

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.670 
so I figured you'd go for the water move
which<00:05:44.789> he<00:05:44.880> does<00:05:45.060> go<00:05:45.240> through<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.509> surf<00:05:45.750> here<00:05:46.560> I

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
which he does go through the surf here I

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.100 
which he does go through the surf here I
go<00:05:46.800> for<00:05:46.919> the<00:05:46.949> return<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.580> that<00:05:48.030> does<00:05:48.840> I

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
go for the return and that does I

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.830 
go for the return and that does I
believe<00:05:49.560> you<00:05:49.650> told<00:05:49.860> me<00:05:49.919> three<00:05:50.370> damage<00:05:50.610> like<00:05:51.090> it

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
believe you told me three damage like it

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.870 
believe you told me three damage like it
did<00:05:52.139> so<00:05:52.590> low<00:05:52.860> it<00:05:53.069> didn't<00:05:53.340> even<00:05:53.400> look<00:05:53.550> like<00:05:53.669> his

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
did so low it didn't even look like his

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.860 
did so low it didn't even look like his
his<00:05:54.569> HP<00:05:54.810> bar<00:05:55.259> moved<00:05:55.650> so<00:05:56.099> i<00:05:56.479> guess<00:05:57.479> my<00:05:57.630> his<00:05:57.750> room

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
his HP bar moved so i guess my his room

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.540 
his HP bar moved so i guess my his room

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
that my fake out is coming but that's

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.249 
that my fake out is coming but that's
cool<00:06:08.190> no<00:06:08.430> problem<00:06:08.669> of<00:06:08.819> me<00:06:08.940> I<00:06:09.120> go<00:06:09.900> for<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.080> close

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
cool no problem of me I go for the close

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.649 
cool no problem of me I go for the close
combat<00:06:10.530> knowing<00:06:10.949> that<00:06:11.099> I<00:06:11.130> am<00:06:11.310> faster<00:06:11.880> and<00:06:12.090> it

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
combat knowing that I am faster and it

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.939 
combat knowing that I am faster and it
does<00:06:12.990> a<00:06:13.199> nice<00:06:13.889> nice<00:06:14.849> chunk<00:06:15.569> so<00:06:16.500> now<00:06:16.710> I'm

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
does a nice nice chunk so now I'm

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.529 
does a nice nice chunk so now I'm
thinking<00:06:17.190> he<00:06:17.520> might<00:06:17.699> actually<00:06:17.909> go<00:06:18.240> for<00:06:18.419> the

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
thinking he might actually go for the

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.450 
thinking he might actually go for the
surf<00:06:18.780> here<00:06:19.050> because<00:06:19.590> my<00:06:19.620> defenses<00:06:20.219> were

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
surf here because my defenses were

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.800 
surf here because my defenses were
dropped<00:06:20.849> but<00:06:21.090> he<00:06:21.180> actually<00:06:21.330> went<00:06:21.509> for<00:06:21.719> the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
dropped but he actually went for the

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.860 
dropped but he actually went for the
toxic<00:06:22.380> so<00:06:22.680> I<00:06:23.090> don't<00:06:24.090> know

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
toxic so I don't know

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.050 
toxic so I don't know
really<00:06:25.170> sucks<00:06:25.410> on<00:06:25.680> him<00:06:25.890> but<00:06:26.520> he<00:06:26.760> goes<00:06:26.910> to

around<00:06:50.490> much<00:06:50.790> longer<00:06:51.030> especially<00:06:51.810> cuz<00:06:52.140> he

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
around much longer especially cuz he

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.360

goes<00:06:52.320> into<00:06:52.470> a<00:06:52.560> knee<00:06:52.710> looking<00:06:52.980> here<00:06:53.160> and<00:06:53.280> i<00:06:53.340> have

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
goes into a knee looking here and i have

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.070 
goes into a knee looking here and i have
to<00:06:53.670> switch<00:06:53.850> out<00:06:54.060> i<00:06:54.210> figured<00:06:54.690> that<00:06:54.720> the<00:06:54.930> ice

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
to switch out i figured that the ice

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.350 
to switch out i figured that the ice
cream<00:06:55.380> is<00:06:55.410> calming<00:06:55.890> and<00:06:56.070> I<00:06:56.760> thought<00:06:57.000> about<00:06:57.120> the

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
cream is calming and I thought about the

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.960 
cream is calming and I thought about the
time<00:06:57.960> I<00:06:58.050> /<00:06:58.290> /<00:06:58.500> can<00:06:58.710> get<00:06:58.890> it<00:06:59.040> but<00:06:59.250> he<00:06:59.820> actually

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
time I / / can get it but he actually

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.610 
time I / / can get it but he actually
doesn't<00:07:00.330> go<00:07:00.510> for<00:07:00.600> the<00:07:00.690> ice<00:07:00.750> cream<00:07:00.930> he<00:07:01.140> goes<00:07:01.440> for

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
doesn't go for the ice cream he goes for

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.190 
doesn't go for the ice cream he goes for
the<00:07:01.680> sludge<00:07:01.980> way<00:07:02.220> it<00:07:02.850> stab<00:07:03.270> it<00:07:03.300> is<00:07:03.720> stronger

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200 
the sludge way it stab it is stronger

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.420 
the sludge way it stab it is stronger
