Hello, my name’s Arran, I’m 22-years-old 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.820
and I live in Hemel Hempstead – here. 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.220
I’m profoundly deaf, I’ve got a cochlear implant and I 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.580
communicate through lipreading and listening to speech.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:36.600

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.920
My passion is skiing because it gives you a free mind, 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.020
with skiing you can go as fast as you want, you can go off the side,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.880
go through the trees, mountains, through the different lanes,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.400
different levels of paths, it’s just fantastic.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.840
So how I started skiing is with my mum and dad, 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.680
they used to take me to the mountains in France.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.280
My mum was always worried about me skiing and communication barriers 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.580
but in France it’s a different language, they couldn’t speak any English. 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.400
So I just tried going into a hearing skiing group and learnt skiing

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.720
from just following the ski instructor, following their body movements, 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.100
following their skis, copying them and I did well.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.520
When I worked here at the snow centre in the rentals department

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.620
for a few years I saw many ski instructors enjoying teaching

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.700
and I thought “why can’t I do that?” So I spoke to Richard

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.460
who owns his own business called Snowbility, as you can see from my t-shirt, 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.880
and I asked Richard “can I become a ski instructor?” and he said “yes, 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.260
why not. Speak to BASI”, which is the institution that helps you become 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.240
a ski instructor and they said “yes, of course you can 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.780
and if there are any barriers maybe we can adjust the barriers for you”. 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.860
So I went with an interpreter and we communicated really well 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.300
and I didn’t experience any barriers on the course itself 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.320
and I managed to pass the ski instructors course and become fully qualified. 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.000
Many deaf people have always asked “how did you learn to ski? 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.260
Wasn’t communicating a problem?”, 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.960
so they asked me how I learnt to ski and I said “don’t worry,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.460
it’s really easy to pick up and learn”. You follow it once and 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.080
you pick it up, it’s like learning to crawl, then you learn to walk. 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.500
You know, you will remember everything. 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.140
So yes, communication is a problem because the instructor spoke French 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.060
and I spoke English, I couldn’t hear a thing. But then eventually 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.400
I realised that if I was to become a ski instructor it would be a similar type of

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.800
experience for them but I would be able to teach them without barriers because I can sign. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.300
If there is something you dream of – do it! 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.460
Go for it because there is nothing that is impossible. 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.560
Anything you want to do, go and do it, try and achieve what you want, 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.180
like I did here. 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.080
