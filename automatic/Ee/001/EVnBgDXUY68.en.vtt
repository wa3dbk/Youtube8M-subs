00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:13.110
 too much too good in these thin 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.719
 slices of meat like for me the agency 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.760
 from the square area for a little bit like that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.070
 of salt and nothing else and we're going to make some 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.380
 rolls when one says rolled and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:29.099
 opens a center that develops put 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 in everything perfectly 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.550
 in this case, look how simple 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.170
 we have a little bit of chopped garlic 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.390
 that we always keep it in oil like 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.329
 so that it does not rust and as fans 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.149
 bringing the spoon with the oil and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.230
 little garlic to each of the markets 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.940
 we recorded painting 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.520
 for ximena I put it like this with all the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.490
 spoon 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.150
 much much later already a pint of 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.150
 coconut oil 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.510
 and well then we have a cheese that 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.390
 can be perfectly from a cheese to 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.720
 make sandwiches of the so-called incentive 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:16.330
 which machine or well a tambo or a sea 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.460
 of silver or a neighborhood to the sea or a wood 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.130
 the issue is to put it like this 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.050
 little sticks let's put together three songs 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.610
 because you already have us ready 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.530
 a few touches and then with the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.290
 quesito de 6 let's put arugula 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.810
 you know what is the rocket that 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.210
 that purslane that is richer in is 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.250
 so rich that it serves perfectly 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.070
 suddenly for a salad or for a 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.470
 warm confection how many times you 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.470
 he ate a frozen arugula pizza 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.640
 in the mini mini but it has to be left 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.640
 yellowish 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.500
 and now we are going to roll mind 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:10.530
 rolling and in this way and preparing 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:14.110
 about 400 450 of the amount per person 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.640
 and then in a little while when the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.560
 let's finish rolling we're going to put 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.140
 on the griddle to be cooked back 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.600
 and back in a very fast way like 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.650
 the subject if you want you get bad 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:32.980
 and if they do not want or it's not really that 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:35.860
 it goes with the same humidity as the folder 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.220
 a little oil grilled her 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.890
 cook it come thank you very much 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.240
 put together a few to win 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.250
 in rolls of 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.700
 spectacular that inside have a 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.810
 semi-hard cheese and some rocket and this 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.580
 part of the iron 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.430
 and I leave it because after this little 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.599
 pause let's make a scrambled 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.599
