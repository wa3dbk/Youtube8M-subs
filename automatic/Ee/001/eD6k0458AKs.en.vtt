00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello friends we will see 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.900
 the box is next slightly i'm here 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.240
 turned into a squeeze 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.280
 oh well the main thing that came and went 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.699
 I think that there is Patrick codes I do not understand 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.189
 something rumbles morning and let's 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.330
 let's see i guess what's here now 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.140
 let's see because 3 codes sometimes even 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:34.590
 there are sellers change neatly open 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:37.020
 strong box what i think yes it is 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.300
 what I thought this replacement or friends 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.489
 my from this 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.559
 red and have android which after 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.700
 dating with chinese smartphones 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.780
 lost faith in humanity 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.780
 there really are two 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.539
 representative of the star and galaxy 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.829
 gently open and PIN-code is not 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.439
 more than my little red 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.130
 android package side there something 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.080
 fell off oh well here's such here 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.490
 slightly he smeared with something but not 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.850
 scratched and see who and to 1 or 2 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.770
 well, fun toys any here here 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.170
 masks or inserts and do not know what it is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.979
 Now let's see because she was on 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.619
 rushes out so put everything away 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.049
 a box that's what I don't understand is 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.880
 probably stickies to glue them on 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.610
 something is there so they don't stand 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.840
 moved most likely on legs like this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.020
 here to 35 and he will stand here 1 2 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.509
 I can even see it in the face 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.750
 most likely well fell to the floor to 1 but to 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.270
 in fact it doesn't matter 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.240
 the side may come in handy to 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.630
 it was still standing and so who 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.630
 these are 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.310
 quality as for me it is very good 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.860
 supposedly plastic but such plastic is dull 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.170
 not brilliant toys cheap but 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.050
 relatively inexpensive around 10 dollars 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.870
 and that something is not remembered even more expensive but 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.900
 really cool infantry here is 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.650
 here look but the head still rotates well 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.760
 cool looks like this 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.000
 horror movies you know 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.590
 cutting head turns machine all 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.390
 it does not change does not spin from 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.849
 only head on my head will not 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.849
 he has to unscrew but his head 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.959
 spin that is, you can change 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:44.230
 here are two cool directions 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.019
 character but also darth vader right over here 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.380
 leg 2 stick paper the same one more 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.810
 here it is where the light sword turns out 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.970
 red is cool done and such 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.750
 interesting by the principle of league but 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.890
 more interesting 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.190
 head rotates see you can twist 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.489
 the head is not important to twist but q1 here 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.799
 such here are two heroes of star wars on 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.290
 I will finish this 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.150
 here it is even written made in china of course 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.269
