00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello to all in videos 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.820
 previous I showed you how 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.530
 use this type of small accessory 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.130
 therefore a clipboard with a system of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.199
 cloud to be able to achieve this kind of 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.090
 braiding so there a key door to 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.410
 fast scratching so there for what 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.240
 was finishing I had you 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.859
 shown in this video how to use 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.140
 precisely the central part of the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.480
 structure like loop there I have another 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.699
 control system yesterday two finishes 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.260
 which allows a dÃ©bouclage can be a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.369
 little bit faster then it changes a 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.480
 little bit aesthetics there we have some 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.460
 thing that is really very very 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.170
 symmetrical so has it a little system 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.239
 different in terms of the end you 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.309
 always proceed in the same way and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.680
 moment of your last passage so 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.890
 you go inside the three 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.520
 loops of the structure so this 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:56.610
 way you lock your three links 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.890
 to prevent them from escaping and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.890
 then we redo a second pass 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.260
 so inside the three structures 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.820
 in this way is there for the finish 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.820
 simply a little knot 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.950
 so this way 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.710
 so then in terms of tuning 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.530
 structures it's always the same 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.190
 thing one pulls to bring back the surplus 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.190
 on the end here 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:15.230
 So here we have more than cut 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.120
 right here at the base of a justice y this 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.760
 piece of structure and so we get 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.430
 found with two bracelets that are 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.470
 quite on the end of two door 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.450
 keys or two dragons that are all to 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.000
 done on the same principle so a 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.170
 braiding a bit similar a loop a 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.610
 little different but still the same 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.200
 thing 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.819
 the ability to disassemble very 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.920
 quickly to have a reserve 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.140
 so give it there for disassembly 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.209
 very simple we blow the knot on 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.370
 pull the loop twice and then he 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.750
 there's more to disassemble so all the while 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.280
 braiding so that's it for this 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.750
 second technique but listen if you 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.980
 have other ideas for defining 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.390
 braiding ideas do not hesitate to me 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.799
 contact and then else bah like 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.579
 I'll tell you soon 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.579
 for another video
