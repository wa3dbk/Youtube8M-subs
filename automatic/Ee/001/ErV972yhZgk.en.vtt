00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
them are good but there are some that is

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.029 
them are good but there are some that is
kind<00:05:09.610> of<00:05:09.820> actually<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:10.870> kept<00:05:11.260> me<00:05:11.470> say<00:05:11.710> that<00:05:11.889> too

kind of actually I kept me say that too
much<00:05:12.070> g1<00:05:12.699> Vita<00:05:12.910> still<00:05:13.120> I've<00:05:13.240> seen<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:13.840> far<00:05:13.870> so

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
much g1 Vita still I've seen so far so

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.219 
much g1 Vita still I've seen so far so
that's<00:05:14.979> good<00:05:15.360> but<00:05:16.380> um<00:05:18.180> there<00:05:19.180> are<00:05:19.229> notably

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
that's good but um there are notably

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.430 
that's good but um there are notably
some<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:21.310> is<00:05:21.550> kind<00:05:21.940> of<00:05:22.120> like<00:05:22.450> oh<00:05:22.690> it's<00:05:23.289> so

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
some that is kind of like oh it's so

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.500 
some that is kind of like oh it's so
predictable<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:24.430> it's<00:05:24.729> not<00:05:24.880> rendering<00:05:25.300> of

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
predictable and it's not rendering of

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.129 
predictable and it's not rendering of
kind<00:05:26.500> of<00:05:26.590> enough<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.450> sometimes<00:05:28.450> making

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
kind of enough and sometimes making

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.820 
kind of enough and sometimes making
sense<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:29.830> also<00:05:30.789> random<00:05:31.360> but<00:05:32.200> if<00:05:32.289> you<00:05:32.410> go<00:05:32.560> for

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
sense is also random but if you go for

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.790 
sense is also random but if you go for
random<00:05:33.510> then<00:05:34.510> it's<00:05:34.660> predictable<00:05:36.330> No<00:05:37.360> so<00:05:37.800> I'm

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
random then it's predictable No so I'm

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.409 
random then it's predictable No so I'm
not<00:05:38.979> really<00:05:39.160> a<00:05:39.250> fan<00:05:39.580> of<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.880> I<00:05:40.000> prefer

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
not really a fan of that I prefer

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.750 
not really a fan of that I prefer
something<00:05:40.900> that<00:05:41.260> makes<00:05:41.440> sense<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:42.099> it's

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
something that makes sense and it's

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.830 
something that makes sense and it's
random<00:05:43.450> at<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.660> same<00:05:43.810> time<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:46.360> I<00:05:46.449> like<00:05:46.630> it

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
random at the same time and I like it

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.200 
random at the same time and I like it
but<00:05:47.830> if<00:05:47.979> you're<00:05:48.160> going<00:05:48.190> if<00:05:48.699> you're<00:05:48.849> gonna<00:05:48.970> go

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
but if you're going if you're gonna go

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.170 
but if you're going if you're gonna go
for<00:05:49.599> random<00:05:49.870> it's<00:05:50.530> just<00:05:50.830> gonna<00:05:50.979> be<00:05:51.370> so

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
for random it's just gonna be so

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.500 
for random it's just gonna be so
predictable<00:05:52.900> because<00:05:53.110> you<00:05:53.620> know<00:05:53.710> it's<00:05:54.220> random

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
predictable because you know it's random

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.300 
predictable because you know it's random
nothing<00:05:55.510> makes<00:05:55.660> sense<00:05:55.750> and<00:05:56.169> that<00:05:56.770> makes<00:05:57.010> it

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
nothing makes sense and that makes it

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.129 
nothing makes sense and that makes it
very<00:05:57.630> predictable<00:05:59.280> so<00:06:00.280> yeah<00:06:00.490> um<00:06:00.789> if<00:06:01.780> I'm<00:06:01.990> gonna

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
very predictable so yeah um if I'm gonna

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.240 
very predictable so yeah um if I'm gonna
go<00:06:02.289> watch<00:06:02.440> something<00:06:02.650> random

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
go watch something random

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.850 
go watch something random
it<00:06:03.550> will<00:06:03.820> at<00:06:04.060> least<00:06:04.090> have<00:06:04.660> some<00:06:04.720> sense<00:06:05.349> to<00:06:05.680> it

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
it will at least have some sense to it

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.010 
it will at least have some sense to it
like<00:06:06.430> you<00:06:06.520> know<00:06:06.669> how<00:06:06.880> to<00:06:06.940> say<00:06:07.240> you<00:06:07.660> know<00:06:07.810> how

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
like you know how to say you know how

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.339 
like you know how to say you know how
our<00:06:08.289> God<00:06:08.830> is<00:06:09.070> this<00:06:09.400> scene<00:06:09.639> I<00:06:09.849> was<00:06:10.810> guy<00:06:11.020> deny

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
our God is this scene I was guy deny

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.439 
our God is this scene I was guy deny
that<00:06:11.560> he<00:06:11.979> was<00:06:12.160> actually<00:06:12.340> a<00:06:12.639> litter<00:06:12.849> of<00:06:12.970> fucking

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
that he was actually a litter of fucking

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:14.790 
that he was actually a litter of fucking
here<00:06:13.630> but<00:06:13.810> I<00:06:13.840> think<00:06:14.080> he<00:06:14.199> literally<00:06:14.530> was

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
here but I think he literally was

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.310 
here but I think he literally was
working<00:06:15.280> him<00:06:15.460> but<00:06:16.210> anyways<00:06:16.599> let's<00:06:16.900> end<00:06:17.110> this

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
working him but anyways let's end this

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.950 
working him but anyways let's end this
with<00:06:17.620> the<00:06:17.710> face<00:06:17.919> of<00:06:18.160> Gabe<00:06:18.550> Newell<00:06:18.910> thanks<00:06:19.870> for
