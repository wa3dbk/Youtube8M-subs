00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.070 
since you see me I've had my hair cut a
few<00:02:07.710> times<00:02:07.979> now<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.729> cut<00:02:08.910> my<00:02:09.090> hair<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.869> would

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
few times now just cut my hair it would

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
few times now just cut my hair it would
have<00:02:10.200> been<00:02:10.289> much<00:02:10.740> longer<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.880> really<00:02:12.180> would

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
have been much longer it really would

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.050 
have been much longer it really would
all<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:12.810> i<00:02:13.110> figured<00:02:14.010> if<00:02:14.100> i<00:02:14.190> keep<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.550> shorter

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
all but i figured if i keep it shorter
