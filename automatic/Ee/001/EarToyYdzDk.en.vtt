00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
my mental toughness that I've been

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.639 
my mental toughness that I've been
developing<00:00:39.540> over<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> course<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.530> this

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
developing over the course of this

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.680 
developing over the course of this
program<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> keep<00:00:42.210> going<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
program just to just to keep going and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.779 
program just to just to keep going and
get<00:00:42.809> through<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.350> one<00:00:44.219> set<00:00:44.579> after

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
get through and just one set after

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.279 
get through and just one set after
another<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.239> take<00:00:45.420> everything<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.930> rep<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
another and take everything one rep at a

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.840 
another and take everything one rep at a
time<00:00:48.230> really<00:00:49.230> tried<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.340> make<00:00:50.489> sure<00:00:50.700> that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
time really tried to to make sure that

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.150 
time really tried to to make sure that
my<00:00:50.910> form<00:00:51.149> wasn't<00:00:51.420> breaking<00:00:51.690> down<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.980> is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
my form wasn't breaking down but this is

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.910 
my form wasn't breaking down but this is
probably<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.320> workouts<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
probably one of the workouts that I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.350 
probably one of the workouts that I
expected<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> most<00:00:56.760> warm<00:00:56.940> breakdown<00:00:57.329> just

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
expected the most warm breakdown just

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
expected the most warm breakdown just
because<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.109> rep<00:00:58.350> scheme<00:00:58.590> combined<00:00:59.160> with

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
because of the rep scheme combined with

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.920 
because of the rep scheme combined with
the<00:00:59.430> weight<00:00:59.809> I<00:01:02.090> just<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.300> didn't<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.750> how<00:01:03.899> I

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the weight I just I didn't know how I

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.119 
the weight I just I didn't know how I
was<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.439> able<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> keep<00:01:04.860> everything

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
was going to be able to keep everything

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
was going to be able to keep everything
together<00:01:05.720> over<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> course<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.260> long

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
together over the course of this long

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.670 
together over the course of this long
workout<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.869> I<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:10.290> having<00:01:10.530> some

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
workout and I was having some

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.480 
workout and I was having some
frustrating<00:01:11.130> moments<00:01:11.549> there<00:01:11.790> were<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:14.040> clamp

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
frustrating moments there were the clamp

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.080 
frustrating moments there were the clamp
on<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.000> left<00:01:15.180> side<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:16.380> bar<00:01:17.090> kept

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
on the left side of my bar kept

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.800 
on the left side of my bar kept
loosening<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:20.570> there<00:01:21.570> was

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
loosening up and you see that there was

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.390 
loosening up and you see that there was
the<00:01:22.229> weights<00:01:22.439> were<00:01:22.650> rattling<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> little<00:01:23.280> more

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the weights were rattling a little more

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.039 
the weights were rattling a little more
on<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.580> side<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.880> loosening<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.869> it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
on that side and loosening up and so it

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.410 
on that side and loosening up and so it
was<00:01:25.170> causing<00:01:25.799> me<00:01:26.040> kind<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> lean<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.090> in

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
was causing me kind of to lean a bit in

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.319 
was causing me kind of to lean a bit in
favor<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.869> side<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.740> helping

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
favor that side which was not helping

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.190 
favor that side which was not helping
keep<00:01:30.329> me<00:01:30.450> fresh<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.610> today<00:01:32.659> was<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.110> the

other<00:03:52.230> reasons<00:03:52.650> for<00:03:52.830> doing<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.989> had<00:03:54.989> to

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
other reasons for doing this and had to

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.100 
other reasons for doing this and had to
step<00:03:56.250> back<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.930> reassess<00:03:57.930> my<00:03:58.549> motivations

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
step back and reassess my motivations

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.890 
step back and reassess my motivations
for<00:04:01.110> for<00:04:01.590> doing<00:04:01.830> what<00:04:01.920> I'm<00:04:02.040> doing

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
for for doing what I'm doing

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.640 
for for doing what I'm doing
and<00:04:04.299> it's<00:04:05.299> a<00:04:05.450> mental<00:04:05.780> gut-check<00:04:06.170> sometimes

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
and it's a mental gut-check sometimes

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.899 
and it's a mental gut-check sometimes
two<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:08.420> realize<00:04:08.959> that<00:04:09.799> your<00:04:10.189> reasons<00:04:10.610> may<00:04:10.760> not

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
two to realize that your reasons may not

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.630 
two to realize that your reasons may not
be<00:04:11.030> as<00:04:11.150> pure<00:04:11.420> as<00:04:11.799> they<00:04:12.799> were<00:04:13.310> when<00:04:13.489> you<00:04:13.549> started

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
be as pure as they were when you started

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.779 
be as pure as they were when you started
and<00:04:14.239> so<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:15.260> do<00:04:15.319> feel<00:04:15.620> like<00:04:15.769> my<00:04:15.829> my<00:04:16.280> intentions

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
and so I do feel like my my intentions

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.770 
and so I do feel like my my intentions
have<00:04:16.880> gotten<00:04:17.209> back<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.539> where<00:04:17.660> they're

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
have gotten back to where they're

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.390 
have gotten back to where they're
supposed<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.139> be<00:04:18.199> I'm<00:04:18.560> doing<00:04:18.979> this<00:04:19.160> now

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
supposed to be I'm doing this now

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.260 
supposed to be I'm doing this now
because<00:04:19.789> I<00:04:19.820> love<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.299> because<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.430> want<00:04:22.430> to

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
because I love it and because I want to

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.550 
because I love it and because I want to
grow<00:04:23.509> and<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:23.900> want<00:04:24.139> to<00:04:24.350> see<00:04:25.419> my<00:04:26.419> goals<00:04:26.930> be<00:04:27.350> met

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
grow and I want to see my goals be met

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.080 
grow and I want to see my goals be met
and<00:04:29.139> with<00:04:30.139> that<00:04:30.320> here's<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:31.009> fifth<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.060> final

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
and with that here's the fifth and final

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.200 
and with that here's the fifth and final
set<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:33.820> did<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.850> little<00:04:35.000> booboo<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:35.660> lost<00:04:36.050> count

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
set I did a little booboo and lost count

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.330 
set I did a little booboo and lost count
around<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.419> fourth<00:04:38.750> rep<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:39.260> so<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:39.860> end<00:04:40.130> up

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
around the fourth rep and so I end up

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.779 
around the fourth rep and so I end up
getting<00:04:41.210> ready<00:04:41.389> and<00:04:41.660> doing<00:04:42.139> eight<00:04:43.100> reps<00:04:43.490> on

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
getting ready and doing eight reps on

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.460 
getting ready and doing eight reps on
this<00:04:44.120> final<00:04:44.479> set<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.050> when<00:04:45.139> I<00:04:45.199> was<00:04:45.320> only

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
this final set that when I was only

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.920 
this final set that when I was only
supposed<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:45.710> do<00:04:45.830> seven<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:47.300> eighth<00:04:47.570> rep

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
supposed to do seven and the eighth rep

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.120 
supposed to do seven and the eighth rep
is<00:04:48.169> pretty<00:04:48.889> terrible<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:51.050> thought<00:04:51.740> it<00:04:51.889> was<00:04:51.979> my

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
is pretty terrible I thought it was my

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.120 
is pretty terrible I thought it was my
seventh<00:04:52.460> rep<00:04:52.639> and<00:04:52.820> so<00:04:53.030> as<00:04:53.650> is<00:04:54.650> mine<00:04:54.919> now

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
seventh rep and so as is mine now

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.430 
seventh rep and so as is mine now
tradition<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.150> guess<00:04:56.449> I<00:04:56.660> tried<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.960> pause<00:04:57.169> the

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
tradition I guess I tried to pause the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.350 
tradition I guess I tried to pause the
rep<00:04:57.590> at<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.830> bottom<00:04:58.160> and<00:05:01.000> ended<00:05:02.000> up<00:05:02.060> coming

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
rep at the bottom and ended up coming

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.909 
rep at the bottom and ended up coming
forward<00:05:02.780> pretty<00:05:03.050> hard<00:05:03.289> with<00:05:03.410> it<00:05:03.560> right<00:05:03.710> there

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
forward pretty hard with it right there

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.920 
forward pretty hard with it right there
and<00:05:04.099> you<00:05:04.160> saw<00:05:04.370> it<00:05:04.669> was<00:05:04.910> probably<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.840> least

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
and you saw it was probably the least

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.870 
and you saw it was probably the least
least<00:05:08.930> solid<00:05:09.830> rep<00:05:09.979> that<00:05:10.130> I've<00:05:10.220> had<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.400> entire

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
least solid rep that I've had the entire

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.450 
least solid rep that I've had the entire
small<00:05:11.539> off<00:05:11.720> training<00:05:12.050> cycle<00:05:12.440> so<00:05:12.590> far<00:05:12.800> so<00:05:13.010> I<00:05:13.070> was

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
small off training cycle so far so I was

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.800 
small off training cycle so far so I was
pretty<00:05:13.610> unhappy<00:05:13.940> about<00:05:14.180> that<00:05:14.300> then<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:14.630> watched

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
pretty unhappy about that then I watched

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.180 
pretty unhappy about that then I watched
it<00:05:14.960> realized<00:05:15.289> it<00:05:15.410> was<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.530> eighth<00:05:15.710> rep<00:05:15.979> and

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
it realized it was the eighth rep and

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.700 
it realized it was the eighth rep and
was<00:05:16.370> like<00:05:16.460> oh<00:05:16.610> okay<00:05:16.940> well<00:05:17.150> thank<00:05:17.409> goodness<00:05:18.409> it

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
was like oh okay well thank goodness it

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.860 
was like oh okay well thank goodness it
wasn't<00:05:18.889> me<00:05:19.190> looking<00:05:20.060> that<00:05:20.180> terrible<00:05:20.570> on<00:05:20.720> an

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
wasn't me looking that terrible on an

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.170 
wasn't me looking that terrible on an
actual<00:05:21.050> programmed<00:05:21.560> rep<00:05:21.800> so<00:05:22.280> got<00:05:22.699> an<00:05:22.789> extra

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
actual programmed rep so got an extra

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.480 
actual programmed rep so got an extra
some<00:05:23.510> extra<00:05:23.780> work<00:05:23.900> in<00:05:24.169> even<00:05:24.470> if<00:05:24.560> it<00:05:24.710> was<00:05:25.310> not

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
some extra work in even if it was not

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.649 
some extra work in even if it was not
ideal<00:05:26.440> came<00:05:27.440> over<00:05:27.620> to<00:05:27.740> benchpress<00:05:28.389> 280<00:05:29.389> five

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
ideal came over to benchpress 280 five

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.779 
ideal came over to benchpress 280 five
today<00:05:29.990> for<00:05:30.530> seven<00:05:31.370> sets<00:05:31.580> of<00:05:31.669> five<00:05:33.520> was<00:05:34.520> dealing

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
today for seven sets of five was dealing

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.300 
today for seven sets of five was dealing
with<00:05:34.820> a<00:05:34.909> little<00:05:35.210> bit<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:35.590> tendinitis<00:05:36.590> from

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
with a little bit of tendinitis from

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.290 
with a little bit of tendinitis from
holding<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.060> bar<00:05:39.310> it's<00:05:40.310> just<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:41.000> amount<00:05:41.150> of

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
holding the bar it's just the amount of

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.909 
holding the bar it's just the amount of
reps<00:05:41.539> and<00:05:41.870> so<00:05:44.320> usually<00:05:45.320> it<00:05:45.380> only<00:05:45.409> affected<00:05:45.830> me

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
reps and so usually it only affected me

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.230 
reps and so usually it only affected me
on<00:05:46.010> the<00:05:46.099> first<00:05:46.310> step<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.580> actual<00:05:46.880> pressing

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
on the first step the actual pressing

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.360 
on the first step the actual pressing
was<00:05:47.360> fine<00:05:47.570> but<00:05:47.810> the<00:05:48.500> descent<00:05:48.889> on<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.099> first

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
was fine but the descent on the first

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.300 
was fine but the descent on the first
rap<00:05:49.580> of<00:05:49.699> each<00:05:49.820> set<00:05:50.120> was<00:05:50.360> a<00:05:50.389> little<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:52.130> was<00:05:52.280> a

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
rap of each set was a little it was a

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.920 
rap of each set was a little it was a
little<00:05:52.400> less<00:05:53.000> comfortable<00:05:53.210> and<00:05:53.630> I<00:05:53.690> would<00:05:53.840> have

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
little less comfortable and I would have

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.529 
little less comfortable and I would have
enjoyed<00:05:54.110> but<00:05:54.650> I<00:05:54.889> made<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:55.460> through<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:55.940> then

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
enjoyed but I made it through and then

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:57.939 
enjoyed but I made it through and then
was<00:05:56.720> still<00:05:56.930> able<00:05:57.050> to<00:05:57.260> get<00:05:57.380> all<00:05:57.470> my<00:05:57.500> accessory

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949 
was still able to get all my accessory

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.310 
was still able to get all my accessory
work<00:05:58.099> in<00:05:58.280> so<00:05:58.580> I<00:05:58.909> need<00:05:59.210> to<00:05:59.330> do<00:05:59.449> some<00:06:00.460> pretty
