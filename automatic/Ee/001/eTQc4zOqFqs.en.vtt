you<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:19.020> at<00:00:19.349> least<00:00:19.380> see<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.040> is<00:00:20.220> but

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
you can at least see what it is but

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.150 
you can at least see what it is but
basically<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.390> thing<00:00:21.450> is<00:00:21.930> 30<00:00:22.320> bucks<00:00:22.770> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
basically this thing is 30 bucks and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.220 
basically this thing is 30 bucks and
what<00:00:23.399> it<00:00:23.520> does<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.989> little

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
what it does is it's a little

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.409 
what it does is it's a little
contraption<00:00:25.950> that<00:00:25.980> allows<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.029> dry<00:00:27.239> your

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
contraption that allows you to dry your

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.080 
contraption that allows you to dry your
brushes<00:00:27.840> upside<00:00:28.559> down<00:00:28.800> which<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.759> the<00:00:29.910> way

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
brushes upside down which is the way

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.870 
brushes upside down which is the way
that<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.419> should<00:00:30.480> dry<00:00:31.110> your<00:00:31.320> brushes<00:00:31.829> now<00:00:32.099> I

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
that you should dry your brushes now I

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.440 
that you should dry your brushes now I
created<00:00:33.719> something<00:00:34.580> way<00:00:35.580> better<00:00:35.850> than<00:00:36.150> that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
created something way better than that

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.100 
created something way better than that
that<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> think<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.800> cheaper<00:00:38.760> more<00:00:39.360> convenient

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that I think is cheaper more convenient

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.650 
that I think is cheaper more convenient
and<00:00:40.260> easier<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.860> store<00:00:41.220> anywhere<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.150> guess

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and easier to store anywhere and guess

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
and easier to store anywhere and guess
what<00:00:42.900> this<00:00:43.470> cost<00:00:43.920> me<00:00:44.220> zero<00:00:45.060> dollars<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
what this cost me zero dollars but it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.110 
what this cost me zero dollars but it
can<00:00:46.830> cost<00:00:47.040> you<00:00:47.220> like<00:00:47.400> one<00:00:47.640> or<00:00:47.790> two<00:00:47.820> dollars

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
can cost you like one or two dollars

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.560 
can cost you like one or two dollars
honestly<00:00:48.990> it<00:00:49.140> does<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:50.160> cost<00:00:50.520> anything<00:00:50.940> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
honestly it does not cost anything you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.940 
honestly it does not cost anything you
can<00:00:51.720> get<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> materials<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> Dollar<00:00:52.829> Tree

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
can get the materials at the Dollar Tree

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.050 
can get the materials at the Dollar Tree
and<00:00:53.600> basically<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.470> is<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.950> it's<00:00:56.820> this

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
and basically what it is it's it's this

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.660 
and basically what it is it's it's this
like<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.690> got<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> packaging<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.340> that

what you want to look for is those

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.980 
what you want to look for is those
styrofoam<00:01:20.430> things<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.360> sometimes<00:01:21.840> people

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
styrofoam things that sometimes people

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.969 
styrofoam things that sometimes people
put<00:01:22.320> inside<00:01:22.590> vases<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.430> hold<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.799> flowers<00:01:25.799> in

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
put inside vases to hold the flowers in

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.490 
put inside vases to hold the flowers in
place<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.670> there's<00:01:27.510> two<00:01:27.810> kinds<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> they

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
place and there's two kinds of they

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.930 
place and there's two kinds of they
actually<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> store<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.760> there's

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
actually have in the store and there's

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.300 
actually have in the store and there's
one<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:30.360> more<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> squishy<00:01:31.830> foam

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
one that's more like a squishy foam

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.340 
one that's more like a squishy foam
thing<00:01:32.760> and<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.060> push<00:01:33.540> your<00:01:33.720> finger<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.229> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
thing and you push your finger in and it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530 
thing and you push your finger in and it
forms<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.740> shape<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.159> won't<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.909> good<00:01:36.119> because

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
forms a shape that won't be good because

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.620 
forms a shape that won't be good because
once<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.990> form<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:38.070> hole<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.030> fit<00:01:39.210> your<00:01:39.330> brush

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
once you form the hole to fit your brush

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.440 
once you form the hole to fit your brush
it<00:01:39.990> will<00:01:40.680> probably<00:01:40.920> slip<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.880> before<00:01:42.270> of

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it will probably slip out before of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.060 
it will probably slip out before of
course<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.900> can<00:01:43.080> try<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.040> want

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
course you can try it out if you want

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.310 
course you can try it out if you want
but<00:01:44.610> honestly<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.450> wouldn't<00:01:45.810> believe<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.080> it

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
but honestly I wouldn't believe that it

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.410 
but honestly I wouldn't believe that it
would<00:01:46.439> work<00:01:46.680> these<00:01:47.220> ones<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.670> better<00:01:47.850> because

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
would work these ones are better because

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.109 
would work these ones are better because
they<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.380> kind<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.310> form<00:01:50.640> around<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
they can just kind of form around the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.840 
they can just kind of form around the
brush<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.080> hold<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.560> right<00:01:53.100> into<00:01:53.280> place<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
brush and hold it right into place and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.130 
brush and hold it right into place and
you<00:01:53.909> don't<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.270> worry<00:01:54.450> about<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.900> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you don't have to worry about it and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.550 
you don't have to worry about it and
basically<00:01:55.650> this<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.350> it's

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
basically this is what it is and it's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.490 
basically this is what it is and it's
really<00:01:58.860> really<00:01:58.979> easy<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.640> make<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.320> can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
really really easy to make as you can

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.859 
really really easy to make as you can
see<00:02:01.619> how<00:02:01.740> all<00:02:01.770> my<00:02:02.070> brushes<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.610> I'm<00:02:02.869> there

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
see how all my brushes and I'm there

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.719 
see how all my brushes and I'm there
almost<00:02:04.229> dry<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.770> literally<00:02:05.159> watched<00:02:05.490> them

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
almost dry and I literally watched them

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.620 
almost dry and I literally watched them
an<00:02:05.850> hour<00:02:06.000> ago

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
an hour ago

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.199 
an hour ago
they<00:02:06.840> dry<00:02:07.229> way<00:02:07.710> faster<00:02:08.310> way<00:02:08.610> easier<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.119> it's

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
they dry way faster way easier and it's

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.379 
they dry way faster way easier and it's
like<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.659> now<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.709> reason<00:02:11.159> why<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> prefer<00:02:12.329> to

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:12.389 
like this now the reason why I prefer to

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.070 
like this now the reason why I prefer to
me

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
me

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.310 
me
is<00:02:13.350> number<00:02:13.590> when<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.860> saved<00:02:14.160> $30<00:02:14.970> number<00:02:15.900> two<00:02:16.110> is

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
is number when I saved $30 number two is

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.220 
is number when I saved $30 number two is
the<00:02:16.680> actual<00:02:17.160> contraption<00:02:17.910> only<00:02:18.660> allows<00:02:18.930> you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
the actual contraption only allows you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.860 
the actual contraption only allows you
to<00:02:19.350> put<00:02:19.590> probably<00:02:19.800> up<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.400> 15<00:02:21.000> brushes<00:02:21.660> it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
to put probably up to 15 brushes it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.630 
to put probably up to 15 brushes it
doesn't<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.320> lot<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.590> space<00:02:23.010> as<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.460> can

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
doesn't have a lot of space as you can

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.790 
doesn't have a lot of space as you can
expect<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:24.570> with<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.380> make<00:02:25.410> as<00:02:25.620> many

brushes super convenient okay now how I
initially<00:02:36.990> started<00:02:37.050> this<00:02:37.620> was<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.100> have<00:02:38.310> this

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
initially started this was I have this

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.910 
initially started this was I have this
pointy<00:02:39.150> brush<00:02:39.360> right<00:02:39.600> here<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.380> just<00:02:40.410> stuck

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
pointy brush right here and I just stuck

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.310 
pointy brush right here and I just stuck
it<00:02:41.070> in<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.370> made<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.700> holes<00:02:41.970> for<00:02:42.630> each<00:02:42.930> brush

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
it in and made the holes for each brush

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.120 
it in and made the holes for each brush
and<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.600> as<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.840> see<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.380> was<00:02:46.770> lucky<00:02:47.010> and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
and and as you can see I was lucky and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.340 
and and as you can see I was lucky and
had<00:02:47.340> these<00:02:47.520> slits<00:02:47.940> which<00:02:48.300> he<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.630> easily<00:02:49.140> make

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
had these slits which he can easily make

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.610 
had these slits which he can easily make
with<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> knife<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.660> hold<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.320> by

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
with a knife and you can hold it up by

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.160 
with a knife and you can hold it up by
using<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:53.280> water<00:02:53.520> bottle<00:02:54.030> or<00:02:54.209> even<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.690> household

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
using a water bottle or even a household

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.199 
using a water bottle or even a household
spray<00:02:55.500> which<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.130> actually<00:02:56.220> prefer<00:02:56.520> because<00:02:57.090> it

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
spray which I actually prefer because it

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.290 
spray which I actually prefer because it
fits<00:02:57.420> right<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.430> much<00:02:59.580> easier<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.120> there

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
fits right in so much easier and there

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.930 
fits right in so much easier and there
you<00:03:00.420> go<00:03:00.570> now<00:03:00.870> my<00:03:01.800> brushes<00:03:02.010> are<00:03:02.280> gonna<00:03:02.400> be<00:03:02.580> dry

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
you go now my brushes are gonna be dry

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.320 
you go now my brushes are gonna be dry
and<00:03:03.330> probably<00:03:03.840> another<00:03:04.170> hour<00:03:04.820> and<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:06.000> holds

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
and probably another hour and it holds

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.930 
and probably another hour and it holds
it<00:03:06.450> up<00:03:06.630> dries<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.110> right<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:08.430> way<00:03:08.670> better

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
it up dries it right out it's way better

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.390 
it up dries it right out it's way better
to<00:03:09.209> dry<00:03:09.480> your<00:03:09.780> brushes<00:03:10.380> upside<00:03:10.860> down<00:03:11.100> rather

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
to dry your brushes upside down rather

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.210 
to dry your brushes upside down rather
than<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:12.030> because<00:03:12.680> not<00:03:13.680> all<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.920> water

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
than that because not all the water

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.520 
than that because not all the water
comes<00:03:14.700> out<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.300> when<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.630> upside<00:03:16.050> down<00:03:16.080> all

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
comes out and when it's upside down all

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.410 
comes out and when it's upside down all
the<00:03:16.650> water<00:03:16.860> just<00:03:17.160> rinses<00:03:17.670> right<00:03:17.880> out<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
the water just rinses right out and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.600 
the water just rinses right out and
it'll<00:03:18.720> Drive<00:03:18.989> way<00:03:19.260> faster<00:03:19.890> way<00:03:20.400> more

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
it'll Drive way faster way more

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.270 
it'll Drive way faster way more
convenient<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.080> case<00:03:22.470> it's

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
convenient and in this case it's

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.670 
convenient and in this case it's
portable<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.090> it's<00:03:24.330> like<00:03:24.870> small<00:03:25.380> and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
portable and it's like small and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.759 
portable and it's like small and
everything<00:03:25.950> reusable<00:03:26.850> um<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:28.350> don't<00:03:28.500> have<00:03:28.620> to
