00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.890
 I ran over 5 million yen to defeat Suso 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.600
 I 'm the person who entered I want to talk about unicorn stakes in this video 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.760
 think 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.780
 akon stakes is Marlene day 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.550
 The decision between the top popular 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:28.800
 I'm I'm there in quite this way I roughness fast and hard race 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.539
 Oh , it's a place that isn't always popular . 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.360
 Of course this time 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.470
 It is interesting that I am in a horse that seems unlikely yesterday 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.430
 It is good I will this time 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.490
 I think the group is a bit funny 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.600
 In point of interest is it are similar Well 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:51.470
 The first point is an old car 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:55.950
 The stables that manage 7 no good are Murayama Stables and 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:01.070
 But that Murayama Shaya is a space in Tokyo Dart 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:04.760
 It's very good, I tried to summarize it here 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.590
 It is not you were in Tokyo Murayama stables 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.490
 As is it a double win rate you can see is if there Well more than 40% 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:18.590
 S next week fit very configuration 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.390
 I think that one can say is do a little a too high in the tank renovation also But Well this is Kopano 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.520
 Between called Ricky 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:29.200
 One shot usually jumps up a bit, but even if you leave it out 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.060
 I stamp collection it's beyond both 100% 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.990
 With an overall this Tokyo dirt are good at 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.400
 I think that I can say that now Kopanorikkiki is good- 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.800
 Esther waited 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:49.200
 The Legend Fire 6 and 1 vote are broadcast in the scene of 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:54.110
 Especially before you have a good run in battle in front of this Tokyo Dirt 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:58.350
 But although it was a Tokyo it the first time Well, also I this da Long 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.980
 Very love and think about the sound trend of the old car 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.920
 I think it is 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.840
 The previous race has won five million but the horse in the middle of the hide's Imperial has won 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.140
 is not it 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:17.890
 I ran over 5 million yen to defeat Suso 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.780
 Based on that point, I think it could be said that the opponent who fought mixed was never said 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.360
 I will 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.930
 Even in this Murayama stables that the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.420
 I was defeated before Toma 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.400
 Based on the fact that the Imperial has developed a fruit 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.740
 Even if you enter this member 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:40.430
 I think that it might be possible to fight more than the same time 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:46.400
 Unicorn stakes t want to end with the above 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.700
 Hakodate Sprint Stakes is up to another sound video so I hope the mayor also see 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.709
 Please give me 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.709
 Thank you for watching
