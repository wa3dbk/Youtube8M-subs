00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.429 
going to look at though is the Vince
Lombardi<00:00:20.789> playbook<00:00:21.509> the<00:00:22.079> reason<00:00:22.349> this

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
Lombardi playbook the reason this

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.200 
Lombardi playbook the reason this
playbook<00:00:22.800> calls<00:00:23.069> out<00:00:23.249> to<00:00:23.279> me<00:00:23.429> is<00:00:23.640> because<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
playbook calls out to me is because the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.829 
playbook calls out to me is because the
personnel<00:00:25.849> remains<00:00:26.849> consistent<00:00:27.479> from

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839

formation to formation throughout the
entire<00:00:29.550> playbook<00:00:29.789> you'll<00:00:30.149> notice<00:00:30.419> that<00:00:30.449> every

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:31.139 
entire playbook you'll notice that every

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:33.200 
entire playbook you'll notice that every
single<00:00:31.319> formation<00:00:31.919> uses<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> 22<00:00:32.820> series

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
single formation uses a 22 series

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.240 
single formation uses a 22 series
meaning<00:00:33.929> two<00:00:34.289> running<00:00:34.590> backs<00:00:34.620> two<00:00:35.100> wide

receivers<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.940> tight<00:00:36.210> end<00:00:36.859> that's<00:00:37.859> even

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
receivers one tight end that's even

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.950

shotgun formation in this book and it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.299 
shotgun formation in this book and it
actually<00:00:42.170> slightly<00:00:43.170> resembles<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.010> empty

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
actually slightly resembles the empty

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.119 
actually slightly resembles the empty
eagle<00:00:44.730> H<00:00:45.030> shotgun<00:00:45.899> formation<00:00:46.379> from<00:00:46.559> Madden<00:00:46.920> 12

formation<00:00:52.980> such<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> ones<00:00:53.730> we're<00:00:53.909> looking

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
formation such as the ones we're looking

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.759 
formation such as the ones we're looking
at<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.960> double<00:00:55.289> wing<00:00:55.499> and<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
at right here the double wing and the

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.389 
at right here the double wing and the
brown<00:00:56.269> I<00:00:57.269> believe<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.409> called<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.739> brown

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
brown I believe it's called the brown

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.340 
brown I believe it's called the brown
right<00:00:59.670> yes<00:01:00.030> Brent<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> brown<00:01:00.809> double<00:01:01.170> wing

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
right yes Brent in the brown double wing

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.649 
right yes Brent in the brown double wing
and<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:02.519> this<00:01:02.699> offense<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> Vince<00:01:03.539> Lombardi

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
and in this offense the Vince Lombardi

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.350 
and in this offense the Vince Lombardi
offense<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> full-back<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> key<00:01:05.610> cog<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
offense the full-back is a key cog to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.149 
offense the full-back is a key cog to
running<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> ball<00:01:06.960> moving<00:01:07.320> down<00:01:07.500> field<00:01:07.979> in

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
running the ball moving down field in

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.399 
running the ball moving down field in
short<00:01:08.399> increments<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.630> reason<00:01:09.930> being<00:01:09.960> back

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
short increments the reason being back

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
short increments the reason being back
in<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.619> time<00:01:11.070> when<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> power<00:01:11.670> runs

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
in that time when the power runs

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.240 
in that time when the power runs
specifically<00:01:12.899> the<00:01:13.020> power<00:01:13.200> sweep<00:01:13.680> was<00:01:13.920> used

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
specifically the power sweep was used

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.490 
specifically the power sweep was used
the<00:01:14.850> wings<00:01:15.119> got<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.840> edge<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.290> held

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the wings got out on the edge and held

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.069 
the wings got out on the edge and held
block<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> fullback<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.079> Vince

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
block for the fullback and Vince

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.690 
block for the fullback and Vince

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
Lombardi was a big fan of pulling both

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.639 
Lombardi was a big fan of pulling both

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
call it for the full-back to hit you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
call it for the full-back to hit you
know<00:01:27.689> when<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.500> about<00:01:28.560> teams<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
running this you got the power run with

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.370 
running this you got the power run with
Vince<00:01:32.009> Lombardi<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.180> West<00:01:33.539> Coast<00:01:33.780> passing
