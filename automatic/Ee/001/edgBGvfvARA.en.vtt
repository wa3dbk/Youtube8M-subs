00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
Avengers out there we don't need to keep

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.310 
Avengers out there we don't need to keep
iron<00:00:22.740> man<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.480> movies<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.080> know

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
iron man in the the movies like you know

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.720 
iron man in the the movies like you know
they<00:00:25.590> do<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.859> bond<00:00:26.070> where<00:00:26.310> they<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.430> keep

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
they do in bond where they just keep

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.519 
they do in bond where they just keep
getting<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.090> your<00:00:27.180> bonds<00:00:27.599> right<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.050> think<00:00:28.500> that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
getting on your bonds right I think that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.109 
getting on your bonds right I think that
this<00:00:28.890> could<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> sort<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.550> franchise<00:00:29.970> where

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
this could be a sort of franchise where

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970 
this could be a sort of franchise where
people<00:00:30.359> come<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.570> people<00:00:30.750> go<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.349> maybe<00:00:31.470> if

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
people come and people go and maybe if

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.889 
people come and people go and maybe if
this<00:00:32.219> goes<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.640> 10<00:00:32.969> years<00:00:33.239> he<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.570> come<00:00:33.750> in

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
this goes on for 10 years he can come in

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.209 
this goes on for 10 years he can come in
later<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.500> another<00:00:34.680> cameo<00:00:35.040> or

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
later and have another cameo or

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.440 
later and have another cameo or
something<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.090> should<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.270> like

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
something but I think it should be like

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.930 
something but I think it should be like
a<00:00:36.510> revolving<00:00:36.840> door<00:00:37.079> sort<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.070> policy<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
a revolving door sort of policy with the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.970 
a revolving door sort of policy with the
the<00:00:39.270> Marvel<00:00:39.600> Cinematic<00:00:39.629> Universe<00:00:40.110> whatever

to play him I think the Bond franchise
is<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> great<00:00:57.030> comparison<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.930> cycling

it<00:01:52.320> could<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.619> duplicated<00:01:53.159> as<00:01:53.340> well<00:01:53.610> Marvel<00:01:54.149> is

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it could be duplicated as well Marvel is

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.850 
it could be duplicated as well Marvel is
where<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.600> at<00:01:54.780> right<00:01:54.840> now<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.770> not

where it's at right now I think not

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.319 
where it's at right now I think not
because<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.219> iron<00:01:56.640> man<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:57.299> of

we're assuming they'll have Avengers 3
and<00:02:25.280> 4<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.060> other<00:02:26.210> stuff<00:02:26.510> but<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:28.280> don't

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
and 4 and this other stuff but we don't

and 4 and this other stuff but we don't
know<00:02:28.520> if<00:02:28.640> that's<00:02:28.790> going<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> be<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.180> case

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
know if that's going to be the case

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.630 
know if that's going to be the case
there<00:02:29.840> could<00:02:29.870> be<00:02:30.170> other<00:02:30.440> sort<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.860> ensemble

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
there could be other sort of ensemble

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.460 
there could be other sort of ensemble
mashups<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.660> happen<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:32.960> other<00:02:33.200> down<00:02:33.380> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
mashups that happen for other down the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.530 
mashups that happen for other down the
road<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:33.770> don't<00:02:33.920> even<00:02:34.070> have<00:02:34.310> any<00:02:34.640> idea<00:02:35.150> beyond

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
road we don't even have any idea beyond

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.750 
road we don't even have any idea beyond
ant-man<00:02:35.870> what<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.530> Marvel<00:02:36.830> like<00:02:37.100> phase<00:02:37.370> three

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
ant-man what the Marvel like phase three

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.130 
ant-man what the Marvel like phase three
of<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.090> Cinematic<00:02:38.480> Universe<00:02:38.510> could<00:02:38.990> look

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
of the Cinematic Universe could look

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.140 
of the Cinematic Universe could look
like<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.920> just<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.400> think<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:40.910> really

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
like so I just I think that it's really

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.850 
like so I just I think that it's really
hard<00:02:41.360> they've<00:02:41.570> worked<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:41.900> hard<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.590> set<00:02:42.770> up

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
hard they've worked so hard to set up

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.560 
hard they've worked so hard to set up
that<00:02:43.010> these<00:02:43.340> are<00:02:43.640> their<00:02:43.910> characters<00:02:44.360> and

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
that these are their characters and

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.699 
that these are their characters and
these<00:02:44.660> are<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.870> people<00:02:45.110> playing<00:02:45.380> them<00:02:45.560> and

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
these are the people playing them and

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.650 
these are the people playing them and
they've<00:02:45.800> already<00:02:45.920> had<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.280> switch<00:02:46.820> like<00:02:47.270> Mark

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
they've already had to switch like Mark

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.750 
they've already had to switch like Mark
Ruffalo<00:02:48.050> for<00:02:48.350> Edward<00:02:48.980> Norton<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:49.610> think

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
Ruffalo for Edward Norton I just think

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.880 
Ruffalo for Edward Norton I just think
it<00:02:49.820> would<00:02:49.880> be<00:02:50.000> too<00:02:50.030> much<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.510> keep<00:02:50.890> like

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
it would be too much to keep like

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.770 
it would be too much to keep like
switching<00:02:52.400> actors<00:02:52.820> around<00:02:52.970> four<00:02:53.360> characters

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
switching actors around four characters

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.150 
switching actors around four characters
when<00:02:53.959> they<00:02:54.050> could<00:02:54.230> just<00:02:54.410> bring<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.920> other

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
when they could just bring in other

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.680 
when they could just bring in other
interesting<00:02:55.700> characters<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.209> get<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.390> expand

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
interesting characters and get to expand

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.120 
interesting characters and get to expand
on<00:02:56.840> some<00:02:57.020> of<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.290> original<00:02:57.410> casting<00:02:58.010> ideas

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
on some of the original casting ideas

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.640 
on some of the original casting ideas
for<00:02:58.490> iron<00:02:58.730> man<00:02:58.880> was<00:02:59.270> Clive<00:02:59.570> Owen<00:02:59.690> and<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.470> think

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
for iron man was Clive Owen and I think

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.870 
for iron man was Clive Owen and I think
somebody<00:03:00.860> like<00:03:00.980> Clive<00:03:01.160> Owen<00:03:01.190> would<00:03:01.550> do<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.700> good

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
somebody like Clive Owen would do a good

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.110

totally stark I really think that like

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.730 
totally stark I really think that like
by<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.240> point<00:04:23.570> in<00:04:23.720> time<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:24.110> don't<00:04:24.260> know<00:04:24.380> like

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
by that point in time we don't know like

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.080 
by that point in time we don't know like
what<00:04:24.800> they're<00:04:25.040> gonna<00:04:25.160> be<00:04:25.220> doing<00:04:25.310> who's<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.970> say

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
what they're gonna be doing who's to say

there's even going to be an Iron Man 4
in<00:04:27.800> phase<00:04:28.160> 3<00:04:28.550> like<00:04:28.760> I<00:04:28.880> really<00:04:29.210> think<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.420> at

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
in phase 3 like I really think that at

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.430
