00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.200
 Hello, my name is Michael Hapden, Lead Game Designer at Assassin's Creed Rogue. 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.220
 In Rogue, you can see the Assassin's Creed Universe from a new angle, and join the Templar Shay, 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 who sets out to bring down the Assassin Order. And indeed, it's almost done! 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.199
 If you join the Templars, you will get a whole new set of weapons 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.070
 and technologies. 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.590
 On land, you can use Shay's air rifle, a versatile and powerful weapon, 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.150
 which is your best ally in many situations. You value camouflage? Then you can sleep with sleep arrows 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.710
 put individual enemies to sleep while berserker arrows 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.440
 can be immensely useful in crowds. And not just with humans. 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.540
 If you face groups of opponents, you can equip your air rifle with grenades. 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.330
 With destructive Schrappnel grenades you can bring your enemies to ruin. Or force her 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.239
 with sleep gas in his knees. Do not worry, you have a gas mask. 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.429
 The Templars own all the weapons that fit your style of fighting. 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:13.119
 But keep your eyes peeled for the assassins are after you. 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.740
 The wide range of Templertechnologien also affects the naval warfare. 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.210
 Shay's ship, the Morrigan, is one of the fastest and deadliest of its time. Take advantage of the free-flying 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.479
 Puckle rifle (an early form of machine gun) at short range to enemy ships 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.170
 to inflict severe damage on their vulnerabilities. You can also put a trail of burning oil behind you, 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.369
 to trap pursuers in the trap. 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.179
 You need a fully armed and equipped ship 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.450
 to take part in the epic Legendary Battles that take place somewhere in the game world, 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.270
 And on land, the assassins will hunt you at sea. If they succeed, 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.020
 Rammage you, they also board you. So prepare to defend the Morrigan at all costs.
