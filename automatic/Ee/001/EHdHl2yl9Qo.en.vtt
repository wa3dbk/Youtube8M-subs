moving is playing a map card let me
explain<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.630> map<00:02:05.810> cards<00:02:06.169> these<00:02:06.889> cards<00:02:07.340> give

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
explain the map cards these cards give

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.400 
explain the map cards these cards give
you<00:02:07.639> clues<00:02:07.909> of<00:02:07.939> where<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.390> treasure<00:02:08.660> is

you clues of where the treasure is
some<00:02:10.100> might<00:02:10.280> tell<00:02:10.490> you<00:02:10.610> things<00:02:10.880> like<00:02:11.120> it's<00:02:11.570> in

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
some might tell you things like it's in

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.410 
some might tell you things like it's in
a<00:02:11.930> plane<00:02:12.170> or<00:02:12.530> it's<00:02:13.310> not<00:02:13.550> next<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> stone

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
a plane or it's not next to a stone

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.010 
a plane or it's not next to a stone
statue<00:02:15.070> or<00:02:16.070> it's<00:02:16.640> two<00:02:16.970> spaces<00:02:17.330> away<00:02:17.510> from<00:02:17.930> a

statue or it's two spaces away from a
hut<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.920> on<00:02:19.100> as<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:20.060> add<00:02:20.360> clues<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
hut and so on as you add clues to the

hut and so on as you add clues to the
treasure<00:02:21.440> map<00:02:21.710> you<00:02:21.770> eliminate<00:02:22.430> possibilities

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
treasure map you eliminate possibilities

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.960 
treasure map you eliminate possibilities
the<00:02:24.380> cubes<00:02:24.680> are<00:02:24.830> used<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.220> keep<00:02:25.370> track<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.700> all

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
the cubes are used to keep track of all

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.210 
the cubes are used to keep track of all
possible<00:02:26.480> locations<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.560> if<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.800> clue<00:02:27.980> says

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
possible locations so if a clue says

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.710 
possible locations so if a clue says
that<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.550> treasure<00:02:28.820> is<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.330> largest

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that the treasure is in the largest

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.110 
that the treasure is in the largest
mountain<00:02:29.900> range<00:02:30.200> then<00:02:31.040> place<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.370> cube<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:31.880> each

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
mountain range then place a cube in each

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.600 
mountain range then place a cube in each
of<00:02:32.330> those<00:02:32.480> hexes<00:02:33.020> if<00:02:33.260> another<00:02:34.040> card<00:02:34.370> is<00:02:34.460> added

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
of those hexes if another card is added

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.460 
of those hexes if another card is added
there<00:02:34.940> which<00:02:35.120> says<00:02:35.390> it's<00:02:35.690> also<00:02:35.930> next<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.440> a

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
there which says it's also next to a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.350 
there which says it's also next to a
palm<00:02:36.770> tree<00:02:36.800> then<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.520> remove<00:02:37.790> all<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.000> cubes

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
palm tree then you remove all the cubes

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.140 
palm tree then you remove all the cubes
not<00:02:38.660> next<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.230> palm<00:02:39.530> tree<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.940> should

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
not next to the palm tree this should

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.490 
not next to the palm tree this should
give<00:02:41.300> you<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.420> good<00:02:41.630> idea<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:42.050> where<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
give you a good idea of where the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.100 
give you a good idea of where the
treasure<00:02:42.770> of<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.130> color<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.550> located<00:02:44.120> when

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
treasure of that color is located when

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.840 
treasure of that color is located when
you<00:02:45.200> play<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> clue<00:02:45.740> card<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.220> one<00:02:46.460> of<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.700> maps

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
you play a clue card on one of the maps

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.150 
you play a clue card on one of the maps
you<00:02:47.240> also<00:02:47.600> place<00:02:47.810> your<00:02:47.990> color<00:02:48.230> token<00:02:48.740> on<00:02:48.950> it

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
you also place your color token on it

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.580 
you also place your color token on it
when<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.910> play<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> card<00:02:50.450> draw<00:02:50.810> another<00:02:51.140> one<00:02:51.260> in

when you play a card draw another one in

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.040 
when you play a card draw another one in
your<00:02:51.710> turn<00:02:51.920> ends<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:53.090> basically<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.690> can<00:02:53.840> move

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
your turn ends so basically you can move

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.350 
your turn ends so basically you can move
your<00:02:54.170> Jeep<00:02:54.440> or<00:02:54.680> play<00:02:55.220> one<00:02:55.460> of<00:02:55.490> your<00:02:55.640> clue<00:02:55.940> cards

treasures and share the loop when you
end<00:03:00.560> your<00:03:00.770> turn<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.310> hex<00:03:01.580> for<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.880> last

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
end your turn on the hex for the last

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.270 
end your turn on the hex for the last
cube<00:03:02.450> on<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:02.990> color<00:03:03.320> then<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.070> found

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
cube on it of that color then you found

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.160 
cube on it of that color then you found
the<00:03:04.430> treasure<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.030> now<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.450> must<00:03:05.630> be<00:03:05.750> divided

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
the treasure and now it must be divided

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.200 
the treasure and now it must be divided
among<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.530> Explorers<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.580> player<00:03:07.820> who<00:03:07.970> found
