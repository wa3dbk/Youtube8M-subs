00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.210
 features of the company's classic devices 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.250
 blackberry such as physical 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.059
 keyboard and austere design with the latest 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.070
 technology 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.230
 and also presents them unexpected 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.780
 forum factory unlike most 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.710
 smartphones on the market screen 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.120

 which opens from the bottom of the screen 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.440
 typing is impossible without 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.329
 use of the screen because of the large 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.240
 the width of the body of the smartphone to type 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.020
 one hand is almost impossible 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.100
 There is one interesting keyboard 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.140
 feature 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.329
 she has touch sensors 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.489
 which track the position of the fingers 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.980
 thus it can be used in 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.020
 as a touchpad based design 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.120
 smartphone metal chassis in the form of 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.100
 I- beam this gives the device 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.920
 special strength and non-susceptibility 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.110
 bend but this feature is palpable 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.969
 increases the weight of the smartphone rear 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.399
 the surface is made of plastic with 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.979

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.140
 the rear cover is removable under it are 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.200
 micro sd card slots and 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.950
 applied on the rear surface 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.150
 the camera is located and the LED 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.430
 flash 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.290
 on the top there is a connector for 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.600

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.159
 power button on the right side of the two 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.990
 volume buttons and 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.430
 extra key which can 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.479
 perform certain functions in 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.549
 some applications 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.979
 no setting extra key 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.510
 little useful on the bottom is located

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.869
 above the screen is a sensor 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.180
 approximation of the front camera and 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.220
 light event indicator with dot 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.200
 appearance view is the most original 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.970
 smartphone lately but 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.369
 use it is not very convenient 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.409
 because of its size screen diagonal 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.869
 made with hp technology equal to 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.490
 4.5 inches and a resolution of 1 1440 for one 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.380
 1440 pixels to the merits of the screen 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.570
 need to be attributed effectively oleophobic 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.030
 coverage from srgb color gamut and 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.899
 good color balance to flaws 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.610
 low black cat stability 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.739
 no look from the perpendicular to the plane 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.110
 screen quality can be considered 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.370
 high smartphone works under

 notifications 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.129
 it is very convenient to use it though not all 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.349
 interface features intuitively 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.150

 pre-installed maps work 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.680

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.000
 virtually no smartphone have support

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.129
 activities 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.959
 but the usefulness of such an opportunity 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.449
 limits the lack of square 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.030
 monitors and the fact that the video is displayed exactly 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.620
