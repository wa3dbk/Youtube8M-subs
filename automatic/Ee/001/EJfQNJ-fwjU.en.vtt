that that's a pretty cool new feature so
let's<00:01:06.479> take<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> look<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.869> how<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> install<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
let's take a look at how to install it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.039 
let's take a look at how to install it
first<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.760> need<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> pick<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.240> model<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.750> I'm

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
first we need to pick your model so I'm

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.350 
first we need to pick your model so I'm
just<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.409> pick<00:01:10.590> iPhone<00:01:10.950> 3G<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:12.270> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
just going to pick iPhone 3G then you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.940 
just going to pick iPhone 3G then you
choose<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.689> you're<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.900> Windows<00:01:13.200> or<00:01:13.380> Mac<00:01:13.560> now

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
choose if you're on Windows or Mac now

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.010 
choose if you're on Windows or Mac now
these<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.729> same<00:01:15.180> exact<00:01:15.600> steps

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
these are the same exact steps

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.140 
these are the same exact steps
regardless<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.759> need<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.970> push<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
regardless you just need to push a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.670 
regardless you just need to push a
different<00:01:18.509> key<00:01:18.630> combo<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
different key combo so I'm going to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
different key combo so I'm going to
choose<00:01:19.830> Windows<00:01:20.220> first<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.270> need<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
choose Windows first you need to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.080 
choose Windows first you need to
download<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.900> firmware<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.640> download

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
download the firmware so you download

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.600 
download the firmware so you download
that<00:01:24.560> now<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.650> you're<00:01:25.799> choosing<00:01:25.979> an<00:01:26.250> iPhone

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that now if you're choosing an iPhone

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.219 
that now if you're choosing an iPhone
it'll<00:01:26.880> ask<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.390> want<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> normal<00:01:28.049> or

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it'll ask you if you want the normal or

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:28.999 
it'll ask you if you want the normal or
the<00:01:28.259> unlocker

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the unlocker

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.460 
the unlocker
so<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.939> key<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.170> your

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
so the key is for this one is is your

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.230 
so the key is for this one is is your
phone<00:01:31.650> factory<00:01:32.130> unlocked<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> not

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
phone factory unlocked or is it not

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
phone factory unlocked or is it not
that's<00:01:33.750> pretty<00:01:34.049> self-explanatory<00:01:34.590> but

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that's pretty self-explanatory but

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.569 
that's pretty self-explanatory but
basically<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.650> download<00:01:38.280> whichever

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
basically you just download whichever
