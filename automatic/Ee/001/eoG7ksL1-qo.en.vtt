 in itself klaus and 3 16 typical bid and that of 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.410
 dragon variant 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.570
 'in that of Sicilian defense the bid 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.609
 extremely normal as it is by 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.219
 example this p3 I must be me but like 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:38.890
 nowadays the bishop and 2 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.499
 The bid I'm going to show f4 she 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.399
 correct but little played uncommon 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:47.649
 in this position and now where the bid came 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.389
 right here for black 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.789
 everybody could imagine a lot of people 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:55.389
 we could on the 16 treadmills now do 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.899
 G7 right and wrong, the correct bid 

00:00:55.389 --> 00:01:02.319
 it's horses and six with the little position 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.909
 is a clear game is very playable then the two 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:06.990
 sides there's a lot of game there's a lot 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.210
 opportunity and both sides 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.940
 amazingly bends bishop g7 is a 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.280
 very dangerous and most of the 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.150
 players will easily fall into this 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.200
 trap 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.140
 after f4 after throw 6 of drugs is to stay 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.800
 with most of the up good players good 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.200
 make bishop g7 in this position of the minimum 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.670
 black women will be in a difficult position 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.750
 and after that bid 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:40.480
 Let's see now why bet is 5 of 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:44.650
 5f tournaments I took 5 and here comes a small 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.159
 possibility horse h5 then discovered 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.860
 so the bishop check covers the g4 check 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.520
 attacking the horse if it disputed in the bbb5 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.210
 it provoked 165 horses and 6 and fell and fall 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.210
 advantage 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.430
 coming back here a little bit 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.710
 after effect is 5 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.659
 we already saw it, it's over now, we'll see 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.750
 now it's up to g4 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.890
 bishop b5 and here the same theme of the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.099
 previous video 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.680
 if the bishop came to 17 nÃ© the lady is already 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:23.950
 capturing here okawa psg 4 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.050
 if there is a dispute of seven dames thomas g 4 ea 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.130
 lady is not attacked because he 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.620
 is nailed 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:35.709
 apparently the white on the one in the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.980
 house of 5 let's go there with seven heads 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:44.860
 the 7-light also immediately fell 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.590
 4 g of horse spoke 86 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.569
 spectacular a check is discovered in the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.799
 lady, there is no check is the lady and the 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:57.100
 Four horse staff goes up to 6 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:01.030
 the sheik to the king the sheikh double the lady and the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.440
 You will have to take ooo right horse and not 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.410
 for nothing gives a decisive advantage and 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.540
 continuing after chaos and 6 there also theme 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.870
 normal video seen also in video 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:18.540

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.160
 blog attack and water and advantage 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.530
 white advantage and good white advantage 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.390
 in this position, returning here another 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.079
 a little 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.299
 then after five the error then we came f4 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.590
 and super g 7 is the error 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.810
 5 then it is 5f take is 5 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.410
 we have already seen in the consequences of every hour 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.620
 five of horse g 4 is the drawing of 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.200
 new bishop b5 decisive advantage for the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.720
 plates in this position 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.560
 the themes are the same ones already seen 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.819
 ok the best bid after is 5 and I took 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.549
 so I'm 65 is Horse 7 following there 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.980
 exploration is 6 opening lines 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.989
 find the black king neither does this bial take 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.180
 horse will take and 6 lady attack 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.049
 attack is the bishop the black ones who 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.630
 ceded 17 bishops and 3 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.109
 intermediate and autonomous lady dance 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:24.130
 take simple horse attack capon 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:27.340
 mixed of 2 white advantage still after 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.960
 efe tone so with seven horses is 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.440
 last variant that we are looking at 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.110
 It's 6 I've seen in the states. 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.740
 are viruses the consequences of pawn taking 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.230
 and now if you dig the bishop b5 he is 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.540
 very recurrent in this line the pawn is 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.540
 waiting for the house of 7 he can not 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.460
 do that 77 horsepower 16 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.010
 we already saw the car counted the champion for 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:59.130
 horse visited the pawn attacking the king 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:05:01.620
 attack hurries f8 rock city to take is 6 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.030
 again the guard ball will not go 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.430
 leave right 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:10.650
 then after it was ok to 5 king horse 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.880
 to 6 developing piece and trying 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.670
 solve this spy problem here 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.190
 bishops and four horses and 7 nip autonomous 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.960
 and 7 white advantage 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.960
