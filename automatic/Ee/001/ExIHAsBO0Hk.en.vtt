00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:09.799
 we are in the name of watch 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.699
 your sleep 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.849
 your boss 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.169
 besides, I'm going to put it a little bit like that it's easier to see 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.949
 from my point of view 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.949
 the duplex to get around 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.419
 peugeot say that I do it for the first time so 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.930
 the disaster is possible but I think it'll go 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.450
 obviously if you use a simple pen you do not have to do something that's 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.080
 time 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.290
 manipulation that it goes well with the text 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.840
 and that's for you to see since otherwise it'll be a little bit 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.620
 to have a trace and that I'm going to ask 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.640
 that's a good thing 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.460
 we know why completely cooked but it will be very good for the need 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.910
 so I can eat so m 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.760
 we will go anyway 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.760
 always cut at the height of this route 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.510
 at the point of the task he is there 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.440
 he is there it was me who had found a lower inside 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.080
 and there you will see why we have the same color that will allow 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.730
 firefighters here and in relief and then 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.730
 what do we see attributed to this weekend 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.970
 ok so why not the two points of attached we will place a little bit 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.180
 inside for example the bottom 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.410
 Alas 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.560
 key and he's getting the city is already done 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.870
 now 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.570
 That's to buy 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.240
 if you have% and feet that are pretty symmetrical 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.909
 ok it turns out that the age mage the gp of monaco 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.929
 % and I was right because there is still a difference 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:23.119
 however if you do not want to do that and I'm in love with her 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.089
 you simply know how to return 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.079
 like that and we see that it's the same thing 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.619
 and it'll be your 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:38.559
 other parts the one that has not been done yet so be careful if he 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.479
 Please 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.239
 he does not do like that 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.459
 do not make apple falls like that was going I do not see 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.979
 not at all because if you do that you're going to find yourself with 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.009
 both left feet 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.489
 these fools 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.849
 I can not do it because we do not chained during the interview 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.260
 I turn around and I ask myself that you will know it 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.889
 one week 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:04.779
 and it's still more scary
