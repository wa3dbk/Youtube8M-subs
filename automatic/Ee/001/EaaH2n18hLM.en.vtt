00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.240
 I am very clear as usual 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.069
 now for the elder but that's the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.849
 best club player one of the best 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.410
 players of the championship of France 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.259
 maybe the best but in any case 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.580
 at psg there was a bonus at the beach 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.960
 because I followed a little the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.680
 hands free m gentlemen the best and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 nenê 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.570
 after that is nene where he is not 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.650
 always easy me I lived and then 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.779
 from time to time I gave it a little 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 in its place is that it is con there of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.810
 from time to time they accept not so 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.490
 sometimes to be on the bench so that's 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.289
 true that they have to go there he has 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.940
 they had to learn to accept 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.010
 the coach's 10 years what has it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.739
 not done and then after so today 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.030
 so a decision so the club to say ben 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.010
 he does not count on him but also 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.210
 nenê who took away say if bin 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.890
 today we do not count on me at 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.960
 hell so a financial deal with 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.500
 this contract that he signed at qatar you have 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.510
 a threat 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.070
 I think they will take it himself 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.960
 I will go I need them to learn I will go 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.039
 here I am it is 100 of the players who with 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.590
 me therefore necessarily a holder 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.750
 indisputable but but but they 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.280
 do not understand that I'm going to say the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.809
 modern football and especially in the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.230
 very very big club you have to accept the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.120
 competition 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.739
 and today it was early so 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.790
 a situation is new to 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.340
 players who dream big players 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.020
 look pretty that was it said they 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.760
 were in ten direct competitors and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.799
 necessarily that does not change mentalities 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.390
 but it happens the tooth that the comcom 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.799
 Jeremy's in a situation of failure and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.210
 leave our lists because because 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.530
 he is a great player he can bring 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.830
 a lot to the team you do not think that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.470
 these boys like nene like lead it's 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.450
 not healthy competition it's not 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.490
 not loyal because you have elements 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.860
 who's coming in and that's an element that 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.840
 arrive and that passes no but if lahoud 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.850
 do not understand the players and I want 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.290
 say there is a choice that is made in 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.020
 that by the leaders to strengthen 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.520
 the team and issa all the big players 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.450
 they are happy all this in all 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.530
 great clubs in all major clubs 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.440
 even rebels he's replacing at 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.420
 bayern 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.250
 robben and replacing rugby and then 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.840
 especially I mean today what 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.820
 Jeremy because he is in me too 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.650
 do not know if my listening but what I have 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.760
 want to say is that profits 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.890
 today so to have great 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.150
 days by your side so alas you have a 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.500
 beckham that vary for example 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.240
 maybe physically that's more the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.410
 Congolese beckham but in terms 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.000
 exemplary in terms of 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.170
 professionalism and learns and then 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.760
 especially you'll see him accept it 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.320
 to be on the good and then when he goes 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.880
 play it will give the best and six 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.740
 nights he is able to pass I speak 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.760
 de jérémy let go of this cap there 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.900
 is going to be a very great player but 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.190
 today which will block the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.480
 will curb is precisely is attacking 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.820
 without behavior that is not good 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.040
 antoine actually i was player and 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.540
 trainer and more in the Parisian you 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.880
 have seen progressively have players 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.700
 who were stars in their team 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.650
 I take the example lead see neither nose and 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.910
 who in a big squad in big team 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.280
 we are not used to having 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.870
 France is no longer a star and as soon as they 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.060
 are no longer the star of the team 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.830
 automatically he plays differently and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.480
 is it feels that thou hast thou 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.040
 feel that or not at all you think 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.230
 that they can easily blend 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.610
 among the big players is a state of the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.060
 players who can others that they do not 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.950
 can I just say that 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.489
 it is not in terms of quality a quality 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.810
 newspapers 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.580
 he's just on the mental side 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.200
 we are this enough 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.150
 but but but but I was going to say his 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.640
 own a lot of French players and 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.200
 inevitably qu'éloges surprised it is jérémy 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.540
 Jeremy he went to Rome 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.370
 not that he lived so the situation of 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.920
 to be in competition to be on the bench 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.020
 and I thought of myself coming back here so 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.130
 that he flew over and then especially that he 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.959
 was going to serve the experience can to 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.030
 all that was going to make him grow up sure 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.590
 and then I realize that there and 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.580
 that's what I'm going to say but hey 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.650
 there he has a little shit attitude 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.390
 con there but I say it with a lot 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.790
 of affection but on me I had to come 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.160
 me to come in and I said I never say 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.080
 here I am even if you have the feeling 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.850
 strong is an injustice but 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.040
 watch something else it's the fight you 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.930
 and then mostly do not show these people 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.540
 Here you are that you are weak 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.350
 especially not on the contrary fight fight 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.830
 also especially if they manage to get out of 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.200
 this situation 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.610
 he's going to be very very big players so 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.930
 it's a hard time to pass but 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.640
 it's nothing at all he has to go 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.210
 you remember you do not remember 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.090
 Sessegnon it's a bit in the 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.140
 but it looks but sincerity but it's 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.070
 bleeding and they end up they 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.990
 had balls because you're a 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.850
 guy like giuly ludovic giuly who had 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.350
 36 years that they had not only 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.880
 relegated to the bench and I told the 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.170
 but I say but wait and I say stay 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.970
 not your place is so today is a 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.530
 pretty who came back so she did 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.730
 so the summer madness preparation 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.470
 the last was in the time it 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.480
 mounts before starting the season and they 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.790
 had flown over so that's it's lucid and 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.770
 I think it's a question of 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.000
 mental they do not have enough the 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.070
 mental to overcome this kind 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.960
 of tests and situation ie 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.610
 that as soon as there is one that arrives 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.560
 I have the impression that they give up these 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.990
 but here it is changed is that it 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.700
 so of course he is here and there 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.440
 also appeal to the entourage because 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.450
 the entourage is very important to their 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.220
 to say true but my situation that is 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.750
 difficult today but if you 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.880
 fight you hang on frolic tomorrow there 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.920
 will be even stronger at goal especially 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.700
 the coach he will appreciate in 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.330
 the perfect example today is 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.330
