00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.009
 egg falls 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.799
 if the color of the nest and the eggs do not match then 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.350
 she stays there if the color 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.530
 the egg laid coincided with the color of the nest 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.770
 the player picks up all the eggs in his basket 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.680
 lying in this nest second hen 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.009
 the player on the left chooses the third player 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.909
 the one sitting to his left then begins 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.880
 new round 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.030
 chickens get new eggs from the bag and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.969
 everything repeats and as soon as one of 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.909
 players will collect a full basket of eggs he and 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:10.119
 win to complicate the game came up 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.340
 rule grab cock at the beginning of the game 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.040
 each gets 1 egg 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.200
 and in the course of the game and throw two at once 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.290
 dice red and blue 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.670
 if the red rooster fell on blue 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.400
 hands 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.370
 and all the players are trying to grab the figure 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.739
 Rooster the one who had the first set 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.800
 cock on the nearest pile of dung and 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.400
 then chooses a chicken that will carry 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.010
 egg 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.620
 the rest of the hens in this case are not eggs 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.250
 bear the game continues on as 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.530
 usually however if the cock is already dung 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.319
 heap or any other combination 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.500
 it is impossible to miss his cubes 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.459
 if a player makes a mistake he gives 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.769
 one of their eggs in any nest 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.430
 chicken run oh oh oh this is a fun game 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.519
 in memory 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.299
 and with complications itâ€™s also a reaction 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:07.190
 it seems to be the very case when 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.190
 worth putting all your eggs in one basket
