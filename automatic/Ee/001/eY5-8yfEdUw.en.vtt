of sprints this would be a modification
for<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:27.420> basically<00:02:28.710> I'm<00:02:29.710> going<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:29.950> do

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
for you so basically I'm going to do

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.290 
for you so basically I'm going to do
this<00:02:30.130> mod<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.670> reason<00:02:30.880> I'm<00:02:30.970> doing<00:02:31.060> it

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
this mod and the reason I'm doing it

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.810 
this mod and the reason I'm doing it
again<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:32.110> because<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:33.010> don't<00:02:33.130> need<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.610> sense

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
again is because I don't need the sense

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.240 
again is because I don't need the sense
cord<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.480> it's<00:02:34.690> actually<00:02:35.170> probably<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.950> best

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
cord and it's actually probably the best

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.140 
cord and it's actually probably the best
reason<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.850> do<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:38.820> most<00:02:39.820> people<00:02:40.060> who

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
reason to do it is that most people who

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.410 
reason to do it is that most people who
who<00:02:40.480> wear<00:02:40.690> classic<00:02:40.930> will<00:02:41.350> tell<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.740> that<00:02:42.640> when

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
who wear classic will tell you that when

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.810 
who wear classic will tell you that when
they're<00:02:43.570> wearing<00:02:43.810> them<00:02:43.959> just<00:02:44.200> around<00:02:44.470> town

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
they're wearing them just around town

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.040 
they're wearing them just around town
they<00:02:45.820> wear<00:02:46.000> them<00:02:46.120> at<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.300> loosest<00:02:46.690> setting

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
they wear them at the loosest setting

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.360 
they wear them at the loosest setting
you<00:02:47.290> know<00:02:47.410> where<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.770> cinch<00:02:47.980> cord<00:02:48.250> is

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
you know where the cinch cord is

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.870 
you know where the cinch cord is
essentially<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.030> extended<00:02:49.930> as<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.230> can<00:02:50.470> be<00:02:50.880> and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
essentially is extended as it can be and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.760 
essentially is extended as it can be and
you<00:02:52.360> know<00:02:53.080> they<00:02:53.200> don't<00:02:53.260> ever<00:02:53.410> worry<00:02:53.680> about

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
you know they don't ever worry about

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.380 
you know they don't ever worry about
this<00:02:53.920> inch<00:02:54.130> cord<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.760> if<00:02:54.850> you're<00:02:54.970> not<00:02:55.090> using

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
this inch cord and if you're not using

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.540 
this inch cord and if you're not using
the<00:02:55.600> stench<00:02:55.810> cord<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.800> know<00:02:56.920> why<00:02:57.160> have<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.370> on

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
the stench cord you know why have it on

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.100 
the stench cord you know why have it on
there<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.850> sticks<00:02:58.090> out<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.390> back<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.989> know

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
there it sticks out of the back you know

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
there it sticks out of the back you know
kind<00:02:59.440> of<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:01.000> really<00:03:01.300> unnecessary<00:03:02.040> kind<00:03:03.040> of

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
kind of just really unnecessary kind of

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.680 
kind of just really unnecessary kind of
addition<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.550> this<00:03:03.640> fuse<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.180> if<00:03:04.270> you<00:03:04.360> take<00:03:04.540> it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
addition to this fuse and if you take it

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.380 
addition to this fuse and if you take it
off<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.230> lose<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:06.190> little<00:03:06.550> Ridge<00:03:06.760> or<00:03:07.120> bulk

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
off you lose this little Ridge or bulk

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.050 
off you lose this little Ridge or bulk
here<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.440> further<00:03:09.010> reduce<00:03:09.459> any<00:03:09.700> kind<00:03:09.970> of

here and you further reduce any kind of

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.600 
here and you further reduce any kind of
digging<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.660> right<00:03:10.870> here<00:03:11.230> which<00:03:12.100> which<00:03:12.400> can

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
some people complain about with the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.650 
some people complain about with the
classics<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.830> without<00:03:15.010> further<00:03:15.250> ado<00:03:15.700> let<00:03:16.540> me

classics so without further ado let me

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.240 
classics so without further ado let me
let<00:03:16.959> me<00:03:17.020> demonstrate<00:03:17.410> how<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.709> do<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:18.010> mod

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
let me demonstrate how to do this mod

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.550 
let me demonstrate how to do this mod
it's<00:03:18.519> pretty<00:03:18.790> easy<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.930> reason<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:20.200> put<00:03:20.380> guts

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
it's pretty easy the reason I put guts

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.530 
it's pretty easy the reason I put guts
on<00:03:20.799> there<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.070> because<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:22.090> kind<00:03:22.330> of<00:03:22.360> takes

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
on there is because it kind of takes

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.310 
on there is because it kind of takes
some<00:03:22.810> guts<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.650> go<00:03:24.400> through<00:03:24.459> with<00:03:24.700> this<00:03:25.019> so<00:03:26.019> as

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
some guts to go through with this so as

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.830 
some guts to go through with this so as
I<00:03:26.769> won<00:03:26.980> handedly<00:03:27.430> try<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.850> do<00:03:27.970> this<00:03:28.120> mod<00:03:28.390> it's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
I won handedly try and do this mod it's

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.009 
I won handedly try and do this mod it's
that<00:03:29.140> easy<00:03:30.060> look<00:03:31.060> at<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.680> zoom<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:32.950> here

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.080 

darn<00:03:54.310> sure<00:03:55.310> there's<00:03:55.519> something<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.909> could

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
darn sure there's something you could

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.420 
darn sure there's something you could
probably<00:03:56.209> do<00:03:56.750> with<00:03:56.780> these<00:03:57.079> bungee<00:03:57.860> cords<00:03:58.189> now

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
probably do with these bungee cords now

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.350 
probably do with these bungee cords now
that<00:03:58.670> that<00:03:59.450> I've<00:04:00.549> essentially<00:04:01.549> removed<00:04:02.150> them

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
that that I've essentially removed them

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.569 
that that I've essentially removed them
permanently<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:03.470> don't<00:04:04.069> know<00:04:04.159> what<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.400> would

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
permanently I don't know what that would

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.199 
permanently I don't know what that would
be<00:04:04.790> but<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:07.610> know<00:04:07.700> there's<00:04:07.879> something<00:04:08.060> you

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
be but you know there's something you

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.550 
be but you know there's something you
could<00:04:08.269> probably<00:04:08.420> with<00:04:08.690> them<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:09.290> know<00:04:09.379> in<00:04:09.470> the
