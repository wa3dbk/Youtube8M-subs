Washington Redskins they're coming knock

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.450 
Washington Redskins they're coming knock
their<00:01:47.869> best<00:01:48.049> offensive<00:01:48.590> performance<00:01:49.130> of<00:01:49.280> the

the<00:01:51.829> Chicago<00:01:51.859> Bears<00:01:52.429> and<00:01:52.490> we<00:01:52.609> actually<00:01:52.759> have

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
the Chicago Bears and we actually have

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.559 
the Chicago Bears and we actually have
Washington<00:01:53.569> in<00:01:53.719> that<00:01:54.109> ballgame<00:01:54.409> as<00:01:54.859> well

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
Washington in that ballgame as well

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.969 
Washington in that ballgame as well
Denver<00:01:56.569> has<00:01:56.689> failed<00:01:57.079> to<00:01:57.229> cover<00:01:57.439> now<00:01:57.649> three

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
Denver has failed to cover now three

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.139 
Denver has failed to cover now three
straight<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.549> think<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.789> knee-jerk

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
straight and I think the knee-jerk

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.419 
straight and I think the knee-jerk
reaction<00:01:59.749> might<00:01:59.960> be<00:02:00.200> for<00:02:00.889> folks<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.280> go

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
reaction might be for folks to go

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.580 
reaction might be for folks to go
against<00:02:02.240> Denver<00:02:02.630> here<00:02:02.990> they're<00:02:03.170> laying<00:02:03.380> all

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
against Denver here they're laying all

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.139 
against Denver here they're laying all
those<00:02:03.740> two<00:02:03.950> touchdowns<00:02:04.460> against<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.939> team

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
those two touchdowns against the team

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.429 
those two touchdowns against the team
that<00:02:05.179> can<00:02:05.359> score<00:02:05.509> like<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.020> Washington

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
that can score like the Washington

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.569 
that can score like the Washington
Redskins<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:06.950> think<00:02:07.130> that's<00:02:07.280> gonna<00:02:07.399> be<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
Redskins I think that's gonna be the

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.639 
Redskins I think that's gonna be the
wrong<00:02:07.939> move<00:02:08.270> if<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.600> take<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.810> look<00:02:09.050> at<00:02:09.380> how

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
wrong move if you take a look at how

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.850 
wrong move if you take a look at how
teams<00:02:09.979> do<00:02:10.280> off<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.360> loss<00:02:11.810> if<00:02:12.080> they<00:02:12.230> had<00:02:12.410> won<00:02:12.650> the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
teams do off a loss if they had won the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.130 
teams do off a loss if they had won the
previous<00:02:13.370> five<00:02:13.760> games<00:02:14.209> these<00:02:14.690> teams<00:02:14.900> are<00:02:15.020> now

Denver - thirteen overwash and even

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.490 
Denver - thirteen overwash and even
though<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.210> know<00:02:31.330> our<00:02:31.540> g3<00:02:31.930> looks<00:02:32.200> like<00:02:32.350> he's

though you know our g3 looks like he's

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.990 
though you know our g3 looks like he's
playing<00:02:32.710> a<00:02:32.830> lot<00:02:32.980> better<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.520> Denver's

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
playing a lot better and Denver's

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.610 
playing a lot better and Denver's
defense<00:02:34.030> has<00:02:34.540> been<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.720> pretty<00:02:35.020> vulnerable<00:02:35.260> all

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620

I<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:37.510> think<00:02:37.630> divers<00:02:37.990> got<00:02:38.110> too<00:02:38.350> many<00:02:38.530> weapons

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
I just think divers got too many weapons

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.800 
I just think divers got too many weapons
and<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:39.670> just<00:02:39.820> been<00:02:39.970> too<00:02:40.120> consistent<00:02:40.540> you

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
and it's just been too consistent you

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.180 
and it's just been too consistent you
know<00:02:40.840> Washington<00:02:41.350> has<00:02:41.470> been<00:02:41.710> inconsistent

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
know Washington has been inconsistent

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.680 
know Washington has been inconsistent
this<00:02:42.520> year<00:02:42.730> I'm<00:02:42.910> gonna<00:02:43.030> lay<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.300> points<00:02:43.570> with

this year I'm gonna lay the points with

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.390 
this year I'm gonna lay the points with
Denver<00:02:43.900> do<00:02:44.320> you<00:02:44.380> have<00:02:44.470> anything<00:02:44.710> to<00:02:44.950> say<00:02:45.130> any

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
57 and a half here I think it's a

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.140 
57 and a half here I think it's a
