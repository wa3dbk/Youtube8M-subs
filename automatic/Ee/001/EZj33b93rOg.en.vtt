00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.250
 exhausted faces at the Dinamo leadership until after midnight one has 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.089
 sat down with Bernd Maas to decide his expulsion 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.619
 the ex-managing director repeatedly at the expense of the association 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:12.460
 enriched 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.340
 a breach of trust makes further cooperation impossible 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.380
 Chairman of the Supervisory Board Thomas Molands but Maria Happel things one in the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.960
 may require private consumption 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.699
 in for example a euro a repetition 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.199
 such as serve 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.779
 an electronics technician 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.570
 and how to have football, for example 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.160
 for the European Championship 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
 ordered 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.530
 he travels receiver Bernd Maas 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.150
 to use all these things privately as well 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.290
 and that change, and then in a very creative way 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.770
 customized 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.769
 that they entered the club 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.830
 and performance 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.910
 which the club can use, for example 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.240
 Florian Stahel 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.770
 So for example software licenses like for example game Google 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.330
 Disappointments above all bewilderment at the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.219
 Dynamo leadership after all, the club Bernd Maas much to owe 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.919
 the prevented descent and his consequent action against violence in the 

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:16.289
 Stadium that start him and even brought death threats 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.330
 but she herself is put off for me in the fray personally 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.240
 Naturally 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.840
 the absolute disaster 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.010
 I've gone through difficult times in difficult times », said 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.900
 al-thani 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.880
 unconditional program issued 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.600
 what's upset says go 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.890
 is the project, however, that was incomprehensible to me 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.230
 they are on a super good b then I think Marcel Philipp Richter the 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.140
 to be rehabilitated 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.160
 he never really accomplished much that he did that together 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 in this little treasure 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.440
 London dpa 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.970
 in private 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.210
 stands per game 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.060
 now operates 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.759
 by June 2009 at the latest, a new Chief Executive Officer is to be found 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.930
 In the meantime, a transition solution should be run with 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.639
 Sports Director Ralf Minge at the wheel 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.799
 this is this the recent ones are under pressure 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.799
 There are two ways either escape or fight on 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:23.019
 somehow work 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.209
 I decided on the second one 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.219
 because the club is a completely different way of life 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.870
 Although the financial damage was limited 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.900
 for this, the resulting image damage for the club is immense 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:38.769
 Sport Director Ralf Minge is certainly at least on the pitch everything the same 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:39.659
 remains 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.410
 Playing field size Balve Bremer everything stays 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.899
 as it was before 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.959
 if that is the case then of course it is the hospitality of course 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.369
 rübergebracht 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:49.860
 it is in Thuringia 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.839
 Thousands of athletes success 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.839
 may also be helpful 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.889
 This morning Bernd Maas was brought to hospital with the emergency service 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.760
 Nothing is known about the circumstances
