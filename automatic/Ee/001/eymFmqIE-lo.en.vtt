 diversification of the economy in the municipality 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.300

 for a long time tourism here was a 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.780
 informal activity and the major challenge is 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.240
 generating employment and income from 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.410
