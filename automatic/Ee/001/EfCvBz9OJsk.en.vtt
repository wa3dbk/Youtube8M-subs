dude I hope you guys can see that all
right<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:06.990> last<00:00:07.259> one<00:00:07.560> I'm<00:00:07.620> going<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.770> do<00:00:07.970> it's

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
right this last one I'm going to do it's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.350 
right this last one I'm going to do it's
a<00:00:09.000> new<00:00:09.150> fill<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.389> made<00:00:09.630> up<00:00:10.370> I'm<00:00:11.370> left-handed<00:00:12.030> if

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
a new fill I made up I'm left-handed if

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.320 
a new fill I made up I'm left-handed if
you<00:00:12.420> couldn't<00:00:12.660> tell<00:00:12.780> apply<00:00:13.049> open<00:00:13.320> hand<00:00:13.530> and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
you couldn't tell apply open hand and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.450 
you couldn't tell apply open hand and
this<00:00:15.330> one<00:00:15.630> can<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:15.960> 16<00:00:16.470> notes<00:00:16.650> or<00:00:16.830> 32nd<00:00:17.310> notes

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
this one can be 16 notes or 32nd notes

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.519 
this one can be 16 notes or 32nd notes
as<00:00:17.550> well<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.970> starts<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:18.960> left<00:00:19.199> hand<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
as well it starts to the left hand the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.189 
as well it starts to the left hand the
hi-hat<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.970> parallel<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.539> got<00:00:21.689> left

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
hi-hat it's a parallel so you got left

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.730 
hi-hat it's a parallel so you got left
right<00:00:23.039> left<00:00:23.369> left<00:00:24.359> right<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> parallel

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
right left left right so it's a parallel

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.109 
right left left right so it's a parallel
with<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> right<00:00:26.130> afterwards<00:00:26.849> right<00:00:29.090> then<00:00:30.090> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
with the right afterwards right then a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.150 
with the right afterwards right then a
foot<00:00:30.449> foot<00:00:33.170> then<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> same<00:00:34.530> thing<00:00:34.559> happens

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
foot foot then the same thing happens

00:00:35.160 --> 00:01:23.740 
foot foot then the same thing happens
again<00:00:39.950> that's<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> next<00:00:41.219> step<00:00:44.899> so<00:00:46.219> left<00:00:47.219> right

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.999 

you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.899> lose<00:01:25.020> actually<00:01:25.440> get<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> loop<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> if

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
you can lose actually get a loop that if

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:36.050 
you can lose actually get a loop that if
you<00:01:26.130> want

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.170 

right<00:01:37.110> Tom<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.530> can<00:01:39.310> play<00:01:39.460> that<00:01:39.580> too<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:40.030> loop

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
right Tom you can play that too you loop

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:49.630 
right Tom you can play that too you loop
it<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.630> go

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640
