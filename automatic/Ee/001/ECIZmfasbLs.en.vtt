00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
of our computers should there be we said

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.200 
of our computers should there be we said
it<00:00:58.750> it<00:00:59.320> tells<00:00:59.560> us<00:00:59.739> how<00:00:59.950> we<00:01:00.010> do<00:01:00.310> it<00:01:00.430> and<00:01:00.550> we<00:01:01.060> have

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
to read it first and then

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.170 
to read it first and then
there<00:01:03.649> is<00:01:03.770> nothing<00:01:04.070> we<00:01:04.519> leave<00:01:04.699> to<00:01:04.879> memory

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
there is nothing we leave to memory

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.750 
there is nothing we leave to memory
maybe<00:01:05.780> because<00:01:06.229> we're<00:01:06.440> old<00:01:06.620> and<00:01:06.950> we<00:01:07.490> have<00:01:07.640> to

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
maybe because we're old and we have to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.910 
maybe because we're old and we have to
pretend<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:08.210> run<00:01:08.420> out<00:01:08.600> of<00:01:08.630> memory<00:01:08.900> but<00:01:09.590> we<00:01:09.770> did

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
pretend to run out of memory but we did

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.020 
pretend to run out of memory but we did
nothing<00:01:10.100> out<00:01:10.400> of<00:01:10.520> memory

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030
