I think overall like this land tricks

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.850 
I think overall like this land tricks
consistently<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> figure<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.470> thought<00:02:26.830> I

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
go on that pretty good but I think he's

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.400 
go on that pretty good but I think he's
been<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.430> through<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.700> nasty<00:02:31.270> moneymaker<00:02:32.170> at
