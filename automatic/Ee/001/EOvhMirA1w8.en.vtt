00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
down and as you're cutting things might

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.040 
down and as you're cutting things might
shift<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.220> little<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.240> lay<00:01:29.540> your<00:01:29.630> fabric<00:01:29.780> out

project later we're going to simply take

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.670 
project later we're going to simply take
our<00:02:20.520> fabric<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.420> open<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.350> up<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:24.560> lay<00:02:25.560> our

we have a little extra on either side

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.100 
we have a little extra on either side
for<00:02:32.430> our<00:02:32.580> seam<00:02:32.820> allowance<00:02:33.270> now<00:02:33.720> what<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.959> want

for our seam allowance now what you want
to<00:02:34.140> do<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.530> take<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.130> fabric<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:36.080> fold<00:02:37.080> it

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.590 
to do is take the fabric and fold it
over<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.770> top<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.040> your<00:02:38.340> pillow<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.480> it

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
over the top of your pillow so that it

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.660 
over the top of your pillow so that it
hits<00:02:39.989> about<00:02:40.500> two-thirds<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.640> three-quarters

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670

hits about two-thirds to three-quarters
the<00:02:42.390> way<00:02:42.600> from<00:02:43.290> one<00:02:43.470> side<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> pillow

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
the way from one side of the pillow

the way from one side of the pillow
you're<00:02:44.489> going<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.670> take<00:02:44.790> your<00:02:44.940> other<00:02:45.120> side<00:02:45.510> and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
you're going to take your other side and

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.270 
you're going to take your other side and
wrap<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.030> other<00:02:48.060> way<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:49.170> cover<00:02:49.620> the

wrap it going the other way to cover the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.790 
wrap it going the other way to cover the
entire<00:02:50.400> pillow<00:02:51.000> now<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:51.870> want<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.470> raw<00:02:52.769> edge

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
entire pillow now we want this raw edge

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.750 
entire pillow now we want this raw edge
to<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.489> about<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.000> same<00:02:54.269> spot<00:02:54.690> about

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
to be about the same spot about

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.540 
to be about the same spot about
two-thirds<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:57.120> three-quarters<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.200> way

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
two-thirds to three-quarters of the way

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.060 
two-thirds to three-quarters of the way
past<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.820> opposite<00:03:00.480> side<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.900> pillow<00:03:01.140> but

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
past the opposite side of the pillow but

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.100 
past the opposite side of the pillow but
because<00:03:02.640> these<00:03:02.820> edges<00:03:03.209> are<00:03:03.330> raw<00:03:03.540> we<00:03:03.840> want<00:03:04.019> to

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
because these edges are raw we want to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.720 
because these edges are raw we want to
finish<00:03:04.260> them<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.800> our<00:03:04.860> pillow<00:03:05.100> looks<00:03:05.340> very

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
finish them so our pillow looks very

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.120 
finish them so our pillow looks very
professional<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.930> we<00:03:07.170> want<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.440> give<00:03:07.560> an<00:03:07.709> extra

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
professional so we want to give an extra

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.420 
professional so we want to give an extra
two<00:03:08.489> inches<00:03:08.970> about<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.690> either<00:03:10.350> side<00:03:10.830> which

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
two inches about on either side which

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.320 
two inches about on either side which
would<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.730> four<00:03:12.000> inches<00:03:12.120> total<00:03:13.610> for<00:03:14.610> turning

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
would be four inches total for turning

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.009 
would be four inches total for turning
under<00:03:15.510> our<00:03:16.050> raw<00:03:16.440> edges<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.549> we'll<00:03:17.760> just

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
under our raw edges so we'll just

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.530 
under our raw edges so we'll just
estimate<00:03:19.019> about<00:03:19.650> four<00:03:20.070> edges<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.549> as<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.329> can

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
estimate about four edges and as you can

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.420 
estimate about four edges and as you can
see<00:03:21.810> with<00:03:22.110> our<00:03:22.260> yard<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.829> half<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:23.100> fabric

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
see with our yard and a half of fabric

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.610 
see with our yard and a half of fabric
we<00:03:23.610> really<00:03:23.940> don't<00:03:24.120> have<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.540> much<00:03:25.140> extra

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
we really don't have that much extra

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.800 
we really don't have that much extra
left<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.610> if<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.820> want<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.090> can<00:03:27.239> cut<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:27.600> off

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
left so if you want you can cut this off

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.120 
left so if you want you can cut this off
where<00:03:28.079> it's<00:03:28.200> really<00:03:28.320> not<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.680> big<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.980> deal

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
where it's really not that big of a deal

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.410 
where it's really not that big of a deal
you<00:03:29.280> could<00:03:29.459> leave<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.970> don't<00:03:30.150> want<00:03:30.329> to

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
you could leave it if you don't want to

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.210 
you could leave it if you don't want to
cut<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.110> that's<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.440> we've<00:03:31.650> measured<00:03:31.890> and

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
cut it so that's it we've measured and

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.650 
cut it so that's it we've measured and
cut<00:03:32.370> our<00:03:32.519> fabric<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.209> now<00:03:33.299> it's<00:03:33.480> time<00:03:33.630> to

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
cut our fabric and now it's time to

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.680 
cut our fabric and now it's time to
finish<00:03:34.019> off<00:03:34.170> our<00:03:34.200> raw<00:03:34.500> edges
