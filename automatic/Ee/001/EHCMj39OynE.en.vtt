00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.510 
it everything we try first try it I
basically<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.170> every<00:01:28.439> second<00:01:29.430> or

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
basically get it like every second or

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.420 
basically get it like every second or
third<00:01:29.729> try<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.439> takes<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.740> lot<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.920> practice

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
third try so it takes a lot of practice

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.069 
third try so it takes a lot of practice
and<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.880> patients<00:01:33.390> actually<00:01:33.600> when<00:01:33.990> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and a lot of patients actually when you

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.969 
and a lot of patients actually when you
hit<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.400> but<00:01:35.540> again<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.960> could<00:01:37.079> kill<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.590> many

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
hit it but again you could kill a many

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.830 
hit it but again you could kill a many
many<00:01:38.340> many<00:01:38.520> people<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.210> top<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.630> building
