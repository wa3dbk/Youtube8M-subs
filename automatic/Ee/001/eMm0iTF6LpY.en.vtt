00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.290
 This video is about one again 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.740
 small graphics cards test and indeed 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.440
 Let's test it again today 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.150
 290 x3 xo you in far cry 3 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.650
 and I say it now for the first time 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.810
 which test has value with the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.939
 graphics card to use and indeed 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.439
 we see here under the k60 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.810
 water cooling a fx 8350 next to 16 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.780
 gb memory that 's all 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.160
 is located on the asus m5 as 97 r 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.010
 2.0 mainboard and the operating system what 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.140
 in the other windows 7 home premium is 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.399
 is down here just like that 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.780
 play on the 240gb ssd so now 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.520
 can we still go to the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.680
 Graphics settings and that is there 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.420
 a high end card is all zero 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.399
 days we drove we see the full hd 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.070
 resolution with eight times msa as well 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.150
 the graphics quality of ultra as well 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.710
 if only up here 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.560
 it is the highest one here 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.049
 can adjust and up here you see 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 then still msi afterburner there you see 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.909
 on the one hand, the temperature of the graphics card 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.520
 the utilization in percent the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.100
 Fan speed in percent below that 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.500
 load the video save here 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.330
 of course the fps and see the bottom 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.479
 you still the utilization of mine 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.979
 RAM so yes and yes I would 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.110
 I'll say that a bit more 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.920
 on 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.920
 and then we go 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.979
 that was it, too 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.020
