to all the scrillz who cared for me and
this<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.280> achievement<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.910> basically<00:00:12.389> go

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
this to achievement is to basically go

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.720 
this to achievement is to basically go
around<00:00:12.660> slash<00:00:13.500> loving<00:00:13.920> certain<00:00:14.309> critters<00:00:14.610> of

Azeroth now if not done I achieve and
guide<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> while<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.490> thought<00:00:17.730> I'd<00:00:17.820> kick

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
guide for a while so I thought I'd kick

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.240 
guide for a while so I thought I'd kick
it<00:00:18.090> off<00:00:18.240> with<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.539> one<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> make<00:00:20.130> this

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
it off with this one so to make this

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.980 
it off with this one so to make this
achievement<00:00:20.610> easy<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.300> there's<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.750> couple

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
achievement easy to do there's a couple

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.060 
achievement easy to do there's a couple
of<00:00:22.080> methods<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.590> I'm<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> show<00:00:23.009> you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
of methods that I'm going to show you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.029 
of methods that I'm going to show you
now<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.640> first<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.210> make<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.390> macro<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.039> add

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
now the first is to make a macro and add

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.579 
now the first is to make a macro and add
in<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> macro<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.939> slash<00:00:27.240> tar<00:00:27.599> or<00:00:27.869> target<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
in the macro of slash tar or target is a

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.249 
in the macro of slash tar or target is a
tube<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.130> such<00:00:29.490> tar<00:00:29.789> ta<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.080> name<00:00:31.230> of

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
tube of such tar ta are then the name of

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.110 
tube of such tar ta are then the name of
the<00:00:31.439> critter<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.310> Alpine<00:00:32.460> chipmunk

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the critter this is the Alpine chipmunk

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.580 
the critter this is the Alpine chipmunk
this<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.720> first<00:00:33.900> one<00:00:34.079> we're<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> cover

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
this the first one we're going to cover

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.240 
this the first one we're going to cover
and<00:00:35.300> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.329> even<00:00:36.570> go<00:00:36.810> more<00:00:37.170> into<00:00:37.830> it<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.160> do

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and you can even go more into it and do

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.180 
and you can even go more into it and do
slash<00:00:38.640> tower<00:00:38.970> Alpine<00:00:39.660> chipmunks<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.470> then<00:00:40.950> on

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
slash tower Alpine chipmunks and then on

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.010 
slash tower Alpine chipmunks and then on
a<00:00:41.220> new<00:00:41.490> line<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.910> slash<00:00:42.240> look<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.930> will

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
a new line do slash look and it will

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.320 
a new line do slash look and it will
target<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.740> love<00:00:44.130> it<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> you'll<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
target it and love it and you'll have to

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.760 
target it and love it and you'll have to
do<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.720> every<00:00:45.960> single<00:00:45.990> critter<00:00:46.560> there

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
do this for every single critter there

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.190 
do this for every single critter there
it<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.040> fair<00:00:47.340> few<00:00:47.580> of<00:00:47.640> them<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.780> yeah<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it is a fair few of them but yeah it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600 
it is a fair few of them but yeah it
makes<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.530> easier<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.830> target<00:00:50.310> them<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
makes it easier to target them as you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.940 
makes it easier to target them as you
can<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.910> I've<00:00:51.000> target<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.650> target<00:00:52.650> is<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
can see I've target a target is it

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.230 
can see I've target a target is it
straight<00:00:53.280> away<00:00:55.850> now<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:57.060> is<00:00:57.120> another

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
straight away now there is another

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.310 
straight away now there is another
method<00:00:57.630> to<00:00:57.900> this<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.980> use<00:00:59.220> NPCs<00:01:00.090> can

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
method to this and it's to use NPCs can

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.690 
method to this and it's to use NPCs can
NPC<00:01:01.320> scans<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.830> add-on<00:01:02.130> that<00:01:02.310> basically

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
NPC scans and add-on that basically

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.549 
NPC scans and add-on that basically
alerts<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.450> there's<00:01:03.630> a<00:01:03.690> certain<00:01:04.019> NPC<00:01:04.530> or

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
alerts when there's a certain NPC or

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.560 
alerts when there's a certain NPC or
critter<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.250> our<00:01:05.400> case<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.060> area

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
critter in our case in your area

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.080 
critter in our case in your area
the<00:01:07.140> problem<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.590> NPC<00:01:08.310> scan<00:01:08.549> doesn't<00:01:08.910> cover

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the problem is NPC scan doesn't cover

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.730 
the problem is NPC scan doesn't cover
critters<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.750> you'll<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.200> manually<00:01:10.590> add

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
critters so you'll have to manually add

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.110 
critters so you'll have to manually add
them<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.310> when<00:01:11.430> you've<00:01:11.580> got<00:01:11.610> NPCs<00:01:12.090> can

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
them so when you've got NPCs can

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.330 
them so when you've got NPCs can
installed<00:01:12.690> go<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.230> search<00:01:13.500> option<00:01:14.010> under

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
breathing you should be okay if you

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.250 
breathing you should be okay if you
quickly<00:05:55.190> swim<00:05:56.190> up<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:56.640> just<00:05:57.420> basically<00:05:57.990> get

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
quickly swim up and just basically get

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.780 
quickly swim up and just basically get
on<00:05:58.350> your<00:05:58.470> flying<00:05:58.770> mount<00:05:59.040> but<00:05:59.310> it<00:05:59.430> does<00:05:59.610> make<00:05:59.760> it

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
on your flying mount but it does make it

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.070 
on your flying mount but it does make it
a<00:05:59.910> lot<00:06:00.060> easier<00:06:00.090> if<00:06:00.420> you<00:06:00.570> do<00:06:00.690> our<00:06:00.810> water

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
a lot easier if you do our water

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.170 
a lot easier if you do our water
breathing<00:06:01.380> and<00:06:02.300> swimming<00:06:03.300> mouth

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
breathing and swimming mouth
