project was I used an old self motorola

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.480 
project was I used an old self motorola
cell<00:01:17.430> phone<00:01:17.670> charger<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.659> i<00:01:19.619> use<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.220> USB

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
cell phone charger and i use the USB

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.570 
cell phone charger and i use the USB
cable<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.680> when<00:01:22.680> i<00:01:22.710> did<00:01:22.890> was<00:01:23.070> i<00:01:23.280> got<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
cable and when i did was i got the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.789 
cable and when i did was i got the
little<00:01:23.700> wire<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.530> fan

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
little wire little one the little fan

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.740 
little wire little one the little fan
and<00:01:26.100> i<00:01:26.430> put<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.759> straight<00:01:27.119> i<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and i put that straight i think this is

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.700 
and i put that straight i think this is
the<00:01:27.860> CPU<00:01:28.880> Kirk<00:01:29.880> me<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.180> wrong<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.710> it's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the CPU Kirk me if I'm wrong and it's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.399 
the CPU Kirk me if I'm wrong and it's
running<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.159> running<00:01:32.430> relatively<00:01:33.000> cool

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
running it's running relatively cool

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.870 
running it's running relatively cool
cooler<00:01:34.409> than<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.619> was<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.130> would<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.520> right<00:01:35.700> now

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
cooler than it was it would be right now

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.350 
cooler than it was it would be right now
and<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.659> here's<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.900> GPU<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.939> think<00:01:38.939> they

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and then here's the GPU I think they

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.870 
and then here's the GPU I think they
keep<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> Kirk<00:01:40.409> me<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:40.680> wrong<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.670> here's

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
keep you Kirk me if I'm wrong now here's

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.870 
keep you Kirk me if I'm wrong now here's
what<00:01:42.030> i<00:01:42.060> did<00:01:42.270> i<00:01:42.829> got<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> USB<00:01:44.369> cable<00:01:44.399> i

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
what i did i got the USB cable i

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.370 
what i did i got the USB cable i
stripped<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.479> got<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> wires<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
stripped it got the wires out of it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.240 
stripped it got the wires out of it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
black and red is red is eight read his

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.249 
black and red is red is eight read his
current<00:01:57.710> black<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:59.509> what's<00:02:00.509> receiving<00:02:01.079> back

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
current black is what's receiving back

current black is what's receiving back
so<00:02:01.649> continue<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> circuit<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.380> i<00:02:04.549> got<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> wire

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
so continue a circuit and i got the wire

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.910 
so continue a circuit and i got the wire
this<00:02:06.210> thing<00:02:06.479> had<00:02:06.630> wires<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:07.439> yellow<00:02:07.680> was

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
this thing had wires and then yellow was

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.240 
this thing had wires and then yellow was
ground<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.610> don't

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
ground you don't

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.800 
ground you don't
ground<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:11.050> got<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.620> wires<00:02:11.830> out<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.250> it<00:02:12.370> I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
ground but I got the wires out of it I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.330 
ground but I got the wires out of it I
strip<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.930> wires<00:02:14.110> long<00:02:14.680> enough<00:02:14.920> on<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.160> on

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
strip the wires long enough on the on

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.910 
strip the wires long enough on the on
this<00:02:15.640> USB<00:02:16.240> cable<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.870> strip<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> wires<00:02:17.770> long

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
this USB cable I strip the wires long

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.890 
this USB cable I strip the wires long
enough<00:02:18.100> on<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.700> then<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.420> twisted<00:02:19.780> them

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
enough on this and then I twisted them

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.330 
enough on this and then I twisted them
together<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.320> put<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.560> tape<00:02:20.770> over<00:02:21.100> them<00:02:21.220> so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
together and put this tape over them so

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.210 
together and put this tape over them so
it<00:02:21.460> doesn't<00:02:21.700> mess<00:02:22.390> because<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.930> interfere<00:02:23.530> so

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
it doesn't mess because it interfere so

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.850 
it doesn't mess because it interfere so
it's<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.430> USB<00:02:24.910> power<00:02:25.120> fan<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:26.530> will<00:02:26.680> fix

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.320 
a little notch out of it i just use some
tape<00:04:55.180> because<00:04:55.540> it's<00:04:55.750> a<00:04:55.780> quick<00:04:56.020> fix<00:04:56.290> really

still<00:04:58.710> pretty<00:04:59.710> cool<00:04:59.890> now<00:05:00.400> this<00:05:00.550> works<00:05:00.790> is<00:05:00.940> this

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
still pretty cool now this works is this

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.950 
still pretty cool now this works is this
sucks<00:05:01.900> air<00:05:02.110> in<00:05:02.140> through<00:05:02.560> here<00:05:03.540> colder<00:05:04.540> air<00:05:04.570> and

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
sucks air in through here colder air and

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.900 
sucks air in through here colder air and
blows<00:05:05.260> it<00:05:05.290> through<00:05:05.680> this<00:05:05.920> and<00:05:06.220> then<00:05:06.820> the

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
blows it through this and then the

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.080 
blows it through this and then the
regular<00:05:07.270> xbox<00:05:07.510> 360<00:05:08.080> fan<00:05:08.260> blows<00:05:08.560> air<00:05:08.920> out<00:05:09.370> so

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
regular xbox 360 fan blows air out so

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.240 
regular xbox 360 fan blows air out so
it's<00:05:10.210> basically<00:05:10.440> blowing<00:05:11.440> cold<00:05:11.830> air<00:05:11.980> in

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
it's basically blowing cold air in

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.450 
it's basically blowing cold air in
through<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.730> so<00:05:13.210> we<00:05:13.330> can<00:05:13.450> bold<00:05:13.690> like<00:05:14.620> warmish

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
through it so we can bold like warmish

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.910 
through it so we can bold like warmish
air<00:05:15.730> not<00:05:16.030> high<00:05:16.240> air<00:05:16.540> is<00:05:17.110> warm<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.560> share<00:05:17.770> it's

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
air not high air is warm and share it's

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.050 
air not high air is warm and share it's
