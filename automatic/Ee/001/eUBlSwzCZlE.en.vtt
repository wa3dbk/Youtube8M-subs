00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
how to export a completed track to the

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.070 
how to export a completed track to the
No<00:00:04.620> Limits<00:00:04.650> editor<00:00:05.390> so<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.720> track

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
No Limits editor so this is the track

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.900 
No Limits editor so this is the track
the<00:00:07.740> Freestyle<00:00:08.189> track<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.639> I've<00:00:08.730> uploaded

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
the Freestyle track that I've uploaded

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.999 
the Freestyle track that I've uploaded
to<00:00:09.630> my<00:00:09.719> youtube<00:00:10.080> channel<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:11.719> its<00:00:13.009> consists

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
to my youtube channel and its consists

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.650 
to my youtube channel and its consists
of<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.580> total<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.000> 17<00:00:15.509> sections<00:00:17.330> and<00:00:18.330> by<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.510> way

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
of a total of 17 sections and by the way

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.000 
of a total of 17 sections and by the way
you<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.900> actually<00:00:19.050> name<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.560> sections<00:00:19.890> by

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
you can actually name the sections by

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.439 
you can actually name the sections by
right<00:00:20.189> clicking<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:20.820> your<00:00:21.210> name<00:00:21.330> or

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
right clicking on it and your name or

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.730 
right clicking on it and your name or
whatever<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.810> want<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.230> helps<00:00:22.529> in

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
whatever you want and that helps in

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.060 
whatever you want and that helps in
identifying<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.550> later<00:00:24.350> so<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.380> consists<00:00:25.920> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
identifying it later so I consists of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.929 
identifying it later so I consists of
the<00:00:26.519> first<00:00:26.730> section<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.080> station<00:00:28.939> second

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the first section is the station second

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.120 
the first section is the station second
section<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.740> launch<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.690> then<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.840> has

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
section is the launch and then it has

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.420 
section is the launch and then it has
the<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:35.309> part<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> coaster

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
the right part of the of the coaster

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.010 
the right part of the of the coaster
second<00:00:38.430> last<00:00:38.610> section<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> brake<00:00:39.420> run<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
second last section is the brake run and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
second last section is the brake run and
then<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.710> final<00:00:40.860> turn<00:00:41.250> back<00:00:41.760> into<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
then the final turn back into the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.650 
then the final turn back into the
station<00:00:43.640> alright<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.789> now<00:00:44.910> how<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.239> export

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
station alright so now how do we export

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.180 
station alright so now how do we export
this<00:00:45.780> well<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> export<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.950> as

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
this well I'm going to export this as

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.010 
this well I'm going to export this as
four<00:00:47.640> different<00:00:48.200> segments<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:50.160> follows<00:00:51.020> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
four different segments as follows so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.060 
four different segments as follows so
this<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.829> new<00:00:53.010> save<00:00:53.879> element<00:00:54.300> panel<00:00:55.070> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
this is the new save element panel and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
this is the new save element panel and
you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.789> get<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.420> folder<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.870> want<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
you can get the folder that you want to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.029 
you can get the folder that you want to
save<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.609> I've<00:00:59.609> already<00:00:59.760> selected<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:01.039> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
save it in I've already selected it and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.740 
save it in I've already selected it and
name<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.120> case<00:01:03.300> I'm<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
name it in this case I'm just going to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.039 
name it in this case I'm just going to
save<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> station<00:01:05.129> section<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
save just the station section and the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.660 
save just the station section and the
way<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.340> specify

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
way you do that is now you can specify

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.140 
way you do that is now you can specify
the<00:01:08.970> save<00:01:09.299> range<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> save<00:01:11.430> just

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the save range so I want to save just

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.950 
the save range so I want to save just
the<00:01:12.299> station<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.010> I<00:01:14.010> want<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> save<00:01:14.780> from<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the station so I want to save from the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.310 
the station so I want to save from the
station<00:01:16.729> section<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> station<00:01:18.450> sections

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
station section to the station sections

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.320 
station section to the station sections
that's<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:19.979> section<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> save<00:01:21.990> that

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
that's just one section so I save that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.039 
that's just one section so I save that
next<00:01:24.330> I'm<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.900> save<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.380> launch<00:01:27.049> so

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
next I'm going to save the launch so

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.749 
next I'm going to save the launch so
again<00:01:28.320> only<00:01:28.860> save<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> launch<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.640> by

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
again only save the launch just by

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.359 
again only save the launch just by
itself<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:31.110> from<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> launch<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> launch

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
itself so from the launch to the launch

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.069 
itself so from the launch to the launch
and<00:01:32.520> i'll<00:01:32.640> rename<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:34.939> launched<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.909> then<00:01:39.720> i'm

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and i'll rename it launched and then i'm

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.100 
and i'll rename it launched and then i'm
going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.380> save<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:42.090> right<00:01:42.299> part<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:42.990> it's

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
going to save the right part so it's

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.359 
going to save the right part so it's
section<00:01:44.930> 32<00:01:45.930> section<00:01:46.320> 15<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.100> right<00:01:47.250> before

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
section 32 section 15 so right before

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.999 
section 32 section 15 so right before
the<00:01:47.549> break<00:01:47.700> run<00:01:48.320> i'm<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.530> name<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.680> ride

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the break run i'm going to name it ride

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.469 
the break run i'm going to name it ride
and<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:50.670> I'm<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.210> turn<00:01:51.420> on

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and now what I'm going to do is turn on

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.420 
and now what I'm going to do is turn on
track<00:01:51.899> smoothing<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> track<00:01:52.979> smoothing

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
track smoothing so the track smoothing

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.300 
track smoothing so the track smoothing
works<00:01:53.729> much<00:01:54.420> better<00:01:54.450> than<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.930> does<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
works much better than it does and the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.209 
works much better than it does and the
previous<00:01:56.700> version<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.119> Newton<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:59.030> I

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
previous version of Newton and I

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.980 
previous version of Newton and I
typically<00:02:02.219> use<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.430> value<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.939> 5<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.540> make

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
typically use a value of 5 you can make

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.050 
typically use a value of 5 you can make
it<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.200> high<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.439> 25<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.189> if<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.430> really<00:02:05.939> go

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
it as high as 25 but if you really go

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.370 
it as high as 25 but if you really go
that<00:02:06.299> high<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.780> probably<00:02:06.990> should

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that high and you probably should

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.219 
that high and you probably should
rethink<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.950> track<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.690> then<00:02:09.690> taper<00:02:09.959> at<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
rethink your track and then taper at the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.559 
rethink your track and then taper at the
end<00:02:10.379> points<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.009> does<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.220> that

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
end points what that does is that

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.440 
end points what that does is that
gradually<00:02:12.569> turns<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> smoothing

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
gradually turns on the smoothing

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.910 
gradually turns on the smoothing
at<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.780> beginning<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.260> end<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.620> section

at the beginning and end of this section

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.460 
at the beginning and end of this section
of<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.370> segment<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.930> always<00:02:19.080> want<00:02:19.350> this

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
of the segment and you always want this

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.370 
of the segment and you always want this
value<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.130> be<00:02:20.250> higher<00:02:20.490> than<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.660> smooth<00:02:21.960> value

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.530 
value to be higher than the smooth value
in<00:02:22.920> order<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.250> prevent<00:02:23.490> any<00:02:23.670> sort<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.000> kinks<00:02:24.420> at

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
the beginning or end of this segment so

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.570 
the beginning or end of this segment so
again<00:02:27.780> i'm<00:02:27.900> saving<00:02:28.350> from<00:02:28.470> section<00:02:28.920> 32<00:02:29.280> section

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
again i'm saving from section 32 section

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.740 
again i'm saving from section 32 section
15<00:02:29.910> which<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.240> right<00:02:30.360> part<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
15 which is the right part of the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.250 
15 which is the right part of the
section<00:02:31.820> smoothing<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:32.910> at<00:02:33.150> level<00:02:33.480> 5<00:02:33.720> and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
section smoothing it at level 5 and

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.490 
section smoothing it at level 5 and
tapering<00:02:35.300> at<00:02:36.300> level<00:02:36.660> 7<00:02:40.250> all<00:02:41.250> right<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.670> then

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
tapering at level 7 all right and then

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.490 
tapering at level 7 all right and then
I'm<00:02:43.500> going<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.860> save<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:45.750> brake<00:02:45.959> run<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.380> this

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
I'm going to save the brake run so this

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.720 
I'm going to save the brake run so this
is<00:02:46.620> actually<00:02:46.680> gonna<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:46.980> five<00:02:47.190> segments<00:02:47.610> not

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
is actually gonna be five segments not

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.660 
is actually gonna be five segments not
four<00:02:47.940> segments<00:02:49.370> it's<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.550> name<00:02:50.640> it

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
four segments it's going to name it

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.800 
four segments it's going to name it
break<00:02:50.940> I'm<00:02:51.120> going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.300> turn<00:02:51.390> off<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.630> movie

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
break I'm going to turn off this movie

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.510 
break I'm going to turn off this movie
and<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.110> won't<00:02:52.290> lead<00:02:52.560> do<00:02:52.680> anything<00:02:53.040> anyway<00:02:53.459> so

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
and it won't lead do anything anyway so

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.130 
and it won't lead do anything anyway so
might<00:02:54.000> as<00:02:54.060> well<00:02:54.209> turn<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.480> off<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:57.140> finally

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
might as well turn it off and finally

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.410 
might as well turn it off and finally
the<00:02:58.290> last<00:03:00.350> section<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:02.070> break<00:03:02.280> are<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.940> turn

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
the last section the break are the turn

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.479 
the last section the break are the turn
back<00:03:03.840> into<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.140> station<00:03:04.320> when<00:03:04.680> able<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.250> turn

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
back into the station when able to turn

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.280 
back into the station when able to turn
and<00:03:08.360> say<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.660> well<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:09.930> by<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.080> way<00:03:10.230> you

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and say that as well and by the way you

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.350 
and say that as well and by the way you
can<00:03:10.500> also<00:03:10.650> adjust<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.310> segment<00:03:11.970> length<00:03:12.150> now

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
can also adjust the segment length now

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.560 
can also adjust the segment length now
as<00:03:12.600> well<00:03:12.780> two<00:03:13.709> meters<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.190> typically<00:03:14.570> that's

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
as well two meters is typically that's

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.850 
as well two meters is typically that's
the<00:03:15.720> default<00:03:15.870> value<00:03:16.290> that's<00:03:16.410> typically

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
the default value that's typically

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.120 
the default value that's typically
sufficient<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:19.350> can<00:03:19.470> make<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.620> longer<00:03:20.010> if

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
sufficient you can make it longer if

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.850 
sufficient you can make it longer if
your<00:03:20.549> if<00:03:20.820> your<00:03:20.880> track<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.110> very<00:03:22.320> twisted<00:03:22.769> you

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
your if your track is very twisted you

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.250 
your if your track is very twisted you
might<00:03:23.010> need<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.310> go<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.489> one<00:03:23.610> meter<00:03:23.820> but<00:03:24.260> anyway

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
might need to go to one meter but anyway

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.949 
might need to go to one meter but anyway
it's<00:03:25.380> something<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.680> can<00:03:26.040> play<00:03:26.220> with<00:03:26.959> alright

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
it's something you can play with alright

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.360 
it's something you can play with alright
so<00:03:28.110> now<00:03:28.200> we<00:03:28.320> save<00:03:28.530> all<00:03:28.680> our<00:03:28.709> sections<00:03:29.190> now

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
so now we save all our sections now

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.120 
so now we save all our sections now
let's<00:03:29.549> go<00:03:29.670> back<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:31.380> No<00:03:31.500> Limits<00:03:31.530> editor

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
let's go back to the No Limits editor

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.150 
let's go back to the No Limits editor
and<00:03:32.840> that's<00:03:33.840> import<00:03:34.290> our<00:03:34.350> tracks<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:34.890> first

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
and that's import our tracks so first

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.380 
and that's import our tracks so first
thing<00:03:35.670> we<00:03:35.760> need<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.940> do<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.209> make<00:03:36.390> sure<00:03:36.420> that

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
thing we need to do is make sure that

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.330 
thing we need to do is make sure that
the<00:03:39.390> very<00:03:39.750> first<00:03:39.989> vertex<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.799> at<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.010> proper

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the very first vertex is at the proper

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.630 
the very first vertex is at the proper
height<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.940> on<00:03:42.590> 15<00:03:43.590> meters<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:44.160> what<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.370> had<00:03:44.519> it

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
height so on 15 meters is what I had it

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.229 
height so on 15 meters is what I had it
set<00:03:44.880> in<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.209> Newton<00:03:46.670> then<00:03:47.670> we<00:03:47.790> need<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.940> change

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
set in in Newton then we need to change

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:55.100 
set in in Newton then we need to change
the<00:03:48.420> coaster<00:03:48.780> type<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:51.230> hyper<00:03:52.230> coaster<00:03:54.110> then

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
the coaster type to hyper coaster then

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.890 
the coaster type to hyper coaster then
we<00:03:55.260> insert<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:56.610> station<00:03:57.090> that's<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.690> first

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
we insert the station that's the first

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.080 
we insert the station that's the first
one<00:03:59.750> zoom<00:04:00.750> in<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.989> little<00:04:01.110> bit<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:02.060> delete<00:04:03.060> all

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
one zoom in a little bit and delete all

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.060 
one zoom in a little bit and delete all
the<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.970> segments<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.600> then<00:04:07.110> hit<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.620> to

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
the the segments and then hit I to

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.440 
the the segments and then hit I to
straighten<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.910> section<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:10.610> then<00:04:12.470> oops<00:04:13.470> I

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
straighten the section and then oops I

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.630 
straighten the section and then oops I
change<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.600> into<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:16.010> station<00:04:17.010> segment<00:04:17.430> and

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
change that into a station segment and

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.250 
change that into a station segment and
then<00:04:18.479> you'll<00:04:18.600> need<00:04:18.750> adjust<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.109> parameters

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
then you'll need adjust the parameters

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.930 
then you'll need adjust the parameters
of<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.680> station<00:04:20.010> i'm<00:04:20.100> not<00:04:20.220> going<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.430> do<00:04:20.910> that

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
of the station i'm not going to do that

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.290 
of the station i'm not going to do that
here<00:04:21.419> but<00:04:22.370> that's<00:04:23.370> something<00:04:23.490> f<00:04:23.729> doona<00:04:24.030> to

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
here but that's something f doona to

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.270 
here but that's something f doona to
finish<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.780> ride

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
finish the ride

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.280 
finish the ride
and<00:04:26.760> then<00:04:26.880> we'll<00:04:27.000> add<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.240> launch<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:28.110> let<00:04:28.260> me

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
and then we'll add the launch so let me

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.650 
and then we'll add the launch so let me
zoom<00:04:28.500> out<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.710> little<00:04:28.770> bit<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.700> again<00:04:30.540> I'm

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
zoom out a little bit and again I'm

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.260 
zoom out a little bit and again I'm
going<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.870> delete<00:04:30.990> all<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:31.560> nodes<00:04:32.220> in<00:04:32.820> the

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
going to delete all the nodes in the

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.150 
going to delete all the nodes in the
middle<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:34.530> hit<00:04:35.040> I<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:36.650> just<00:04:37.650> straighten<00:04:37.980> it

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
middle and hit I to just straighten it

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.570 
middle and hit I to just straighten it
out<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:38.940> this<00:04:39.540> is<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.810> launch<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:41.430> I'll

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
out and this is the launch so I'll

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.810 
out and this is the launch so I'll
change<00:04:41.820> that<00:04:42.000> into<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.740> transport<00:04:43.740> section<00:04:46.820> and

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
change that into a transport section and

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.560 
change that into a transport section and
then<00:04:48.090> we'll<00:04:49.370> insert<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.520> ride<00:04:50.730> part<00:04:51.360> that's

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
then we'll insert the ride part that's

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.409 
then we'll insert the ride part that's
the<00:04:51.750> middle<00:04:51.960> part<00:04:52.139> of<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:54.000> right<00:04:54.150> section

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
the middle part of the the right section

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:03.140 
the middle part of the the right section
of<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.780> coaster<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.990> then<00:04:58.260> we'll<00:04:58.470> insert<00:05:02.150> now

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
of the coaster and then we'll insert now

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.650 
of the coaster and then we'll insert now
before<00:05:03.720> I<00:05:03.780> do<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:03.930> let<00:05:04.050> me<00:05:04.169> make<00:05:04.710> sure<00:05:04.770> I<00:05:05.660> know

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
before I do that let me make sure I know

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.120 
before I do that let me make sure I know
where<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:06.960> ride<00:05:07.140> ends<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.740> brake<00:05:07.950> run

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
where the ride ends and the brake run

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.990 
where the ride ends and the brake run
begins<00:05:11.600> so<00:05:12.600> again<00:05:13.400> I'll<00:05:14.400> delete<00:05:14.700> all<00:05:14.850> the

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
begins so again I'll delete all the

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.140 
begins so again I'll delete all the
nodes<00:05:15.180> in<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.419> middle<00:05:15.630> for<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:15.780> brake<00:05:15.990> run

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
nodes in the middle for the brake run

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.140 
nodes in the middle for the brake run
and<00:05:18.710> then<00:05:19.710> hit<00:05:20.040> I<00:05:20.070> make<00:05:20.729> sure<00:05:20.880> that<00:05:21.030> it's

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
and then hit I make sure that it's

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.040 
and then hit I make sure that it's
straight<00:05:21.440> it<00:05:22.440> looks<00:05:22.620> like<00:05:22.740> I<00:05:22.860> forgot<00:05:23.040> to<00:05:23.400> save

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
straight it looks like I forgot to save

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:32.469 
straight it looks like I forgot to save
the<00:05:25.050> turn<00:05:27.110> so<00:05:28.110> let<00:05:28.229> me<00:05:28.320> go<00:05:28.860> back<00:05:28.979> and<00:05:29.220> do<00:05:29.310> that

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.340 

all<00:05:33.479> right<00:05:35.330> now<00:05:36.330> we<00:05:36.390> can<00:05:36.630> insert<00:05:36.990> the<00:05:37.140> last

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
all right now we can insert the last

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:45.159 
all right now we can insert the last
section<00:05:40.910> turn<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.950> this<00:05:43.950> will<00:05:44.190> consist<00:05:44.640> of

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
section turn and this will consist of

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.480 
section turn and this will consist of
transport<00:05:46.169> as<00:05:46.289> well<00:05:46.470> so<00:05:47.100> let<00:05:47.190> me<00:05:47.280> go<00:05:47.340> ahead<00:05:47.370> and

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
transport as well so let me go ahead and

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.890 
transport as well so let me go ahead and
do<00:05:47.610> that<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:49.550> finally<00:05:50.550> hit<00:05:50.729> seed<00:05:51.060> connect<00:05:51.720> it

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
do that and finally hit seed connect it

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.840 
do that and finally hit seed connect it
highlight<00:05:52.560> this<00:05:52.800> to<00:05:53.010> make<00:05:53.130> sure<00:05:53.310> hit<00:05:53.669> I<00:05:53.820> just

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
highlight this to make sure hit I just

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.330 
highlight this to make sure hit I just
to<00:05:54.150> make<00:05:54.270> sure<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.539> it's<00:05:54.690> straight<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.340> then

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
to make sure that it's straight and then

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.540 
to make sure that it's straight and then
if<00:05:56.640> we<00:05:58.729> write<00:05:59.729> it<00:05:59.910> you<00:06:00.060> can<00:06:00.180> see<00:06:00.510> in<00:06:00.780> fact<00:06:01.620> lines

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
if we write it you can see in fact lines

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.890 
if we write it you can see in fact lines
up<00:06:02.729> almost<00:06:03.300> perfectly<00:06:03.630> and<00:06:05.539> that's<00:06:06.539> it<00:06:06.750> that's

up almost perfectly and that's it that's

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.390 
up almost perfectly and that's it that's
the<00:06:07.169> complete<00:06:07.350> coaster<00:06:07.800> now<00:06:07.890> I<00:06:07.919> know<00:06:08.130> you<00:06:08.190> need

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
the complete coaster now I know you need

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.120 
the complete coaster now I know you need
to<00:06:08.490> go<00:06:08.760> back<00:06:08.789> and<00:06:08.940> adjust<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.830> parameters<00:06:10.830> of

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
to go back and adjust the parameters of

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.310 
to go back and adjust the parameters of
the<00:06:11.310> different<00:06:11.669> the<00:06:12.300> launch<00:06:12.510> in<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.050> brakes
