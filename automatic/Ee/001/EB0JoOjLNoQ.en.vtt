00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
there's a little build up right here

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.049 
there's a little build up right here
that<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.899> take<00:00:49.110> care<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.320> too<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> it's

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
like four pieces I need to build up

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.680 
like four pieces I need to build up
around<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.789> before<00:00:54.059> i<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.270> actually<00:00:54.390> round

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
around here before i can actually round

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.119 
around here before i can actually round
the<00:00:54.780> handle<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.230> i'm<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.800> soon

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the handle but i'm going to do that soon

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.069 
the handle but i'm going to do that soon
and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:56.969> i<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.210> wrap<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.690> leather

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and then i can wrap it with leather

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.689 
and then i can wrap it with leather
after<00:00:58.500> that<00:01:00.890> that's<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.039> kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.460> laying

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
after that that's right kind of laying

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.850 
after that that's right kind of laying
out<00:01:02.969> how<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> look<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
out how this is going to look I have it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
out how this is going to look I have it
laid<00:01:04.979> out<00:01:05.010> more<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> other<00:01:05.580> side<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.119> this

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
laid out more on the other side but this

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.090 
laid out more on the other side but this
is<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:07.110> bit<00:01:07.350> cleaner<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.979> can

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
is a little bit cleaner so you can

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.039 
is a little bit cleaner so you can
understand<00:01:08.430> what's<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.990> what<00:01:09.990> I'm

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049

understand what's going on what I'm
going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> match<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> cut

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
going to do is match you're going to cut

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.340 
going to do is match you're going to cut
this<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:12.330> I'm<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> angle<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.080> from

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
this down I'm going to angle this from

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.940 
this down I'm going to angle this from
this<00:01:13.560> line<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:15.990> half<00:01:16.259> quarter

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
this line to the to the half quarter

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.920 
this line to the to the half quarter
inch<00:01:17.070> mark<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:18.420> show<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.869> here

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
inch mark so I can show it to you here

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.440 
inch mark so I can show it to you here
is<00:01:19.530> built<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.549> quarter<00:01:21.000> inch<00:01:21.180> layer<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
is built up of a quarter inch layer a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
is built up of a quarter inch layer a
half<00:01:21.750> inch<00:01:21.960> layer<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.380> another<00:01:22.799> quarter<00:01:23.189> inch

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
half inch layer and another quarter inch

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
half inch layer and another quarter inch
layer<00:01:23.549> I'm<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> take<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.020> down

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
layer I'm just going to take it down

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.320 
layer I'm just going to take it down
from<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.680> line<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> angle<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.240> way

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
from that line and angle it all the way

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.080 
from that line and angle it all the way
down<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.720> quarter<00:01:28.200> inch<00:01:28.350> line<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:29.090> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
down to this quarter inch line here so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
down to this quarter inch line here so
that'll<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:30.509> kind<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.810> give<00:01:30.930> an<00:01:31.020> edge<00:01:31.200> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that'll really kind of give an edge and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.010 
that'll really kind of give an edge and
it'll<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> flat<00:01:32.040> part<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.840> all<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> way

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
it'll be a flat part here all the way

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.399 
it'll be a flat part here all the way
around<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.390> will<00:01:36.900> give<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.259> bit

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
around so that will give it a little bit

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.080 
around so that will give it a little bit
of<00:01:37.530> an<00:01:37.650> extra<00:01:37.799> dimension<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.400> course<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.000> then

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
of an extra dimension of course and then

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.210 
of an extra dimension of course and then
I<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.659> tough<00:01:40.200> stuff<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.770> top<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
I have that's tough stuff on top that I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.740 
I have that's tough stuff on top that I
need<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> put<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.329> design<00:01:42.810> wise<00:01:44.750> on

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
need to put on there to design wise on

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.539 
need to put on there to design wise on
the<00:01:45.930> other<00:01:46.020> side<00:01:46.140> I've<00:01:46.530> actually<00:01:46.680> cut<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the other side I've actually cut out the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.200 
the other side I've actually cut out the
the<00:01:48.119> noxious<00:01:49.220> these<00:01:50.220> two<00:01:50.430> pieces<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.970> kind<00:01:51.180> of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the noxious these two pieces I kind of

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.080 
the noxious these two pieces I kind of
shade<00:01:51.420> put<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> piece<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.820> that's<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
shade put a piece in there that's as you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.370 
shade put a piece in there that's as you
try<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.450> me<00:01:54.509> next<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.899> my<00:01:55.020> to-do<00:01:55.350> list

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
try to get me next to my to-do list

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.580 
try to get me next to my to-do list
right<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:56.060> if<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> basic<00:01:57.869> idea<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.380> how

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
right now if I get a basic idea of how

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.120 
right now if I get a basic idea of how
the<00:01:58.649> sword<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.430> look<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.939> shape<00:02:01.130> but

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the sword is going to look the shape but

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.040 
the sword is going to look the shape but
the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.530 
the
real<00:02:04.740> big<00:02:04.950> where<00:02:05.940> all<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.150> efforts<00:02:06.420> been

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
real big where all the efforts been

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
real big where all the efforts been
going<00:02:06.780> lately<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.500> skull<00:02:09.320> trying<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.440> get

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
going lately is the skull trying to get

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.010 
going lately is the skull trying to get
a<00:02:10.590> good<00:02:10.770> read<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.010> how<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.020> skull

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
a good read on how to do the skull

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.710 
a good read on how to do the skull
design<00:02:13.820> which<00:02:14.820> has<00:02:14.970> been<00:02:15.150> really<00:02:15.480> quite<00:02:15.690> a

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
design which has been really quite a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.390 
design which has been really quite a
challenge<00:02:16.170> because<00:02:16.290> right<00:02:16.590> now<00:02:16.620> I'm<00:02:17.070> really

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
challenge because right now I'm really

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.620 
challenge because right now I'm really
struggling<00:02:17.670> with<00:02:17.820> trying<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.180> make<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.480> look

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
struggling with trying to make it look

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.950 
struggling with trying to make it look
like<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.890> cow<00:02:19.890> skull<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.910> steer<00:02:21.300> skull<00:02:21.690> and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
like a cow skull or a steer skull and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.790 
like a cow skull or a steer skull and
not<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.770> not<00:02:23.610> an<00:02:23.700> alien<00:02:23.850> head<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.530> think

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
not a not an alien head and I think

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.070 
not a not an alien head and I think
it'll<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.160> all<00:02:26.340> right<00:02:26.810> especially<00:02:27.810> once<00:02:27.960> I

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it'll be all right especially once I

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.560 
it'll be all right especially once I
actually<00:02:28.200> put<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> horns<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:29.540> when<00:02:30.540> I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
actually put the horns on when I

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.630 
actually put the horns on when I
actually<00:02:30.720> put<00:02:30.990> horns<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.980> be<00:02:32.160> I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
actually put horns on is going to be I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.660 
actually put horns on is going to be I
think<00:02:33.270> that's<00:02:33.390> really<00:02:33.690> gonna<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.290> know<00:02:34.670> there

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
think that's really gonna you know there

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.770 
think that's really gonna you know there
won't<00:02:35.790> be<00:02:35.910> any<00:02:36.060> resemblance<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.570> an<00:02:36.660> alien

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
won't be any resemblance to an alien

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.590 
won't be any resemblance to an alien
skull<00:02:37.200> at<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.590> point<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.190> yeah<00:02:39.000> that's

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
skull at that point so yeah that's

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.420 
skull at that point so yeah that's
pretty<00:02:39.750> much<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.020> it's<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.100> little<00:02:41.310> bit

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
pretty much it it's a little bit

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.210 
pretty much it it's a little bit
modified<00:02:41.880> from<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:43.110> epic<00:02:43.410> weapons<00:02:43.770> model

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
modified from the the epic weapons model

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.240 
modified from the the epic weapons model
but<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:45.270> like<00:02:46.140> what<00:02:46.320> I've<00:02:46.440> done<00:02:46.470> with<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.040> far

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.300 

dimension<00:02:50.250> wise<00:02:50.430> three<00:02:51.180> dimensionally<00:02:52.310> and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
dimension wise three dimensionally and

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.190 
dimension wise three dimensionally and
so<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.000> trick<00:02:54.330> is<00:02:54.360> gonna<00:02:54.690> be<00:02:54.870> getting<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
so the trick is gonna be getting the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.340 
so the trick is gonna be getting the
other<00:02:55.320> one<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.680> look<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.820> know<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:57.210> lot<00:02:58.170> like

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
other one to look you know a lot like

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.150 
other one to look you know a lot like
this<00:02:58.560> one<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:01.320> yeah<00:03:01.440> I'm<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:01.800> playing<00:03:02.070> around

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
this one so yeah I'm just playing around

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.370 
this one so yeah I'm just playing around
with<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.490> trying<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.600> gonna<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:04.110> where

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
with it trying to really gonna get where

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.650 
with it trying to really gonna get where
it<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.620> but<00:03:04.950> also<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.240> kind<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.510> get<00:03:06.630> a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
it is but also you can kind of get a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.630 
it is but also you can kind of get a
sense<00:03:06.720> I've<00:03:07.290> outlined<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:08.040> there<00:03:08.220> but<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.489> can

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
sense I've outlined it there but you can

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.520 
sense I've outlined it there but you can
kind<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.820> get<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> sense<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.360> what<00:03:10.350> it's<00:03:10.470> going

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
kind of get a sense of what it's going

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.810 
kind of get a sense of what it's going
to<00:03:10.650> look<00:03:10.709> like<00:03:10.890> here<00:03:12.290> when<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.459> both<00:03:14.459> skulls

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
to look like here when it both skulls

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.670 
to look like here when it both skulls
are<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.890> there's<00:03:16.890> one<00:03:17.130> half<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.320> just

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
are on there's one half of it so just

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.910 
are on there's one half of it so just
imagine<00:03:19.800> it's<00:03:20.220> gonna<00:03:20.340> be<00:03:20.459> on<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.640> other<00:03:20.760> side

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
imagine it's gonna be on the other side

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.880 
imagine it's gonna be on the other side
so<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:22.950> think<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.370> coming<00:03:23.640> out<00:03:23.790> pretty<00:03:24.060> well<00:03:24.180> I

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
so I think it's coming out pretty well I

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.140 
so I think it's coming out pretty well I
can't<00:03:25.890> see<00:03:26.010> some<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> shadow<00:03:26.520> definition

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
can't see some of the shadow definition

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.090 
can't see some of the shadow definition
in<00:03:27.270> there<00:03:29.030> yeah<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:31.200> as<00:03:31.560> pretty<00:03:31.770> much<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.010> end

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
in there yeah so as pretty much the end

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.430 
in there yeah so as pretty much the end
of<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:33.150> will<00:03:33.360> work<00:03:33.480> in<00:03:33.660> progress<00:03:33.900> as<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.290> can

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
of this will work in progress as you can

is I pretty well finished off the skull
completely<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:57.720> did<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.200> teeth

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
completely I did the teeth

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
you know the nostril piece and I have

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.920 
you know the nostril piece and I have
you<00:04:02.080> can<00:04:02.230> paint<00:04:02.380> of<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.560> eyes<00:04:02.680> but<00:04:03.750> those<00:04:04.750> are

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
you can paint of the eyes but those are

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.560 
you can paint of the eyes but those are
finished<00:04:05.290> as<00:04:05.410> well<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.970> only<00:04:07.120> thing<00:04:07.240> I'd<00:04:07.420> love

finished as well the only thing I'd love

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.360 
finished as well the only thing I'd love
to<00:04:07.690> do<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:07.960> to<00:04:08.110> put<00:04:08.290> corns<00:04:08.740> on<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.130> do<00:04:09.190> like

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370

to do is to put corns on and do like
finish<00:04:09.700> sanding<00:04:10.120> on<00:04:10.210> the<00:04:10.390> whole<00:04:10.540> thing<00:04:11.340> as<00:04:12.340> you

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
finish sanding on the whole thing as you

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.800 
finish sanding on the whole thing as you
can<00:04:12.580> see<00:04:12.760> most<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.150> layering<00:04:13.360> is<00:04:13.570> pretty

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
can see most of the layering is pretty

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.069 
can see most of the layering is pretty
well<00:04:13.960> done<00:04:14.290> i<00:04:14.320> just<00:04:14.710> got<00:04:14.860> a<00:04:14.890> few<00:04:15.780> hill<00:04:16.780> pieces

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
well done i just got a few hill pieces

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.360 
well done i just got a few hill pieces
to<00:04:20.079> match<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.500> other<00:04:20.680> side<00:04:20.920> there<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.220> just

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
to match the other side there and I just

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.580 
to match the other side there and I just
had<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.489> cut<00:04:21.670> those<00:04:21.820> off<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:23.140> can<00:04:23.290> see<00:04:23.440> I've

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
had to cut those off you can see I've

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.110 
had to cut those off you can see I've
drawn<00:04:23.980> out<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.610> spikes<00:04:25.300> on<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.630> side<00:04:25.930> and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
drawn out the spikes on the side and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.140 
drawn out the spikes on the side and
then<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.150> have<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.360> cut<00:04:28.660> those<00:04:30.030> but<00:04:31.030> I've

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
then I have to cut those but I've

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.700 
then I have to cut those but I've
extended<00:04:31.750> those<00:04:32.080> on<00:04:32.350> there<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:35.500> sighs

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
extended those on there to the sighs

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.120 
extended those on there to the sighs
blank<00:04:36.419> but<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:38.169> site<00:04:38.470> like<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.770> said<00:04:38.980> as<00:04:39.100> the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
blank but the site like I said as the

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.710 
blank but the site like I said as the
skulls<00:04:39.460> almost<00:04:39.760> done-ish<00:04:40.030> are<00:04:40.300> drawing<00:04:40.630> out

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
skulls almost done-ish are drawing out

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.409 
skulls almost done-ish are drawing out
the<00:04:40.750> designs<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.650> then<00:04:42.640> for<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.090> handle

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
the designs and then for the handle

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.720 
the designs and then for the handle
itself<00:04:43.600> I<00:04:44.200> started<00:04:44.830> designing<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.310> pommel

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
itself I started designing the pommel

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.440 
itself I started designing the pommel
and<00:04:46.320> I've<00:04:47.320> started<00:04:47.530> layering<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.700> different

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
and I've started layering the different

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.000 
and I've started layering the different
pieces<00:04:49.710> that<00:04:50.710> go<00:04:50.740> on<00:04:51.100> there<00:04:51.480> I<00:04:52.740> have<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.919> do

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
pieces that go on there I have to do

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.550 
pieces that go on there I have to do
this<00:04:54.130> before<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.910> around<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.050> handle<00:04:56.380> because

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
this before I around the handle because

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.560 
this before I around the handle because
around<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.250> handle<00:04:57.669> then<00:04:58.000> it<00:04:58.150> makes<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:58.450> much

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
around the handle then it makes it much

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.560 
around the handle then it makes it much
more<00:04:58.810> difficult<00:04:58.870> to<00:05:00.210> actually<00:05:01.210> wrap

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
more difficult to actually wrap

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.850 
more difficult to actually wrap
something<00:05:01.810> around<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.380> or<00:05:02.590> anything<00:05:02.740> like

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
something around it or anything like

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.909 
something around it or anything like
that<00:05:02.980> to<00:05:03.940> add<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.360> width<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.260> the<00:05:05.350> height<00:05:05.440> to

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
that to add the width and the height to

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.190 
that to add the width and the height to
it<00:05:06.040> so<00:05:06.550> that's<00:05:06.790> just<00:05:07.030> adding<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.660> little<00:05:07.690> bit<00:05:08.110> of

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
it so that's just adding a little bit of

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.230 
it so that's just adding a little bit of
thickness<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.770> whole<00:05:09.010> handle<00:05:09.430> before<00:05:09.970> I

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
thickness to the whole handle before I

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.300 
thickness to the whole handle before I
round<00:05:10.510> everything<00:05:10.990> so<00:05:11.650> then<00:05:11.800> I'll<00:05:11.919> round<00:05:12.130> the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
round everything so then I'll round the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.300 
round everything so then I'll round the
handle<00:05:12.700> piece<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.330> then<00:05:13.570> I'll<00:05:13.750> round<00:05:13.990> the

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
handle piece and then I'll round the

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.730 
handle piece and then I'll round the
bands<00:05:15.310> that<00:05:15.490> go<00:05:15.550> around<00:05:15.729> it<00:05:16.030> as<00:05:16.150> well<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:17.560> that

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
bands that go around it as well and that

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.719 
bands that go around it as well and that
will<00:05:17.860> just<00:05:17.890> make<00:05:18.040> my<00:05:18.250> life<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.550> whole<00:05:18.580> lot

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
will just make my life a whole lot

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.050 
will just make my life a whole lot
easier<00:05:19.800> so<00:05:20.800> that's<00:05:21.010> pretty<00:05:21.550> much<00:05:21.760> it<00:05:21.820> for

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
easier so that's pretty much it for

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.110 
easier so that's pretty much it for
right<00:05:22.450> now<00:05:22.590> just<00:05:23.590> about<00:05:24.550> finished<00:05:25.450> with<00:05:25.600> the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
right now just about finished with the

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.240 
right now just about finished with the
the<00:05:28.120> actual<00:05:28.570> build<00:05:28.990> up<00:05:29.169> of<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.440> sword<00:05:29.770> every

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
the actual build up of the sword every

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.969 
the actual build up of the sword every
all<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.520> Larry<00:05:30.760> and<00:05:30.880> stuff<00:05:31.030> like<00:05:31.120> that<00:05:31.180> and

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
all the Larry and stuff like that and

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.530 
all the Larry and stuff like that and
I'm<00:05:32.979> just<00:05:33.190> about<00:05:33.370> ready<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.790> really<00:05:34.180> start

probably see some of that okay a work in
progress<00:05:43.240> 64<00:05:43.840> frostmourne<00:05:44.940> this<00:05:45.940> is<00:05:46.060> kind<00:05:46.300> of

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
progress 64 frostmourne this is kind of

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.140 
progress 64 frostmourne this is kind of
a<00:05:46.570> short<00:05:46.870> step<00:05:47.140> from<00:05:47.169> where<00:05:47.470> I<00:05:47.530> was<00:05:47.680> last<00:05:47.890> time

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
a short step from where I was last time

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.070 
a short step from where I was last time
kind<00:05:49.150> of<00:05:49.180> giving<00:05:49.390> it<00:05:49.479> to<00:05:49.570> you<00:05:49.630> guys<00:05:49.720> in<00:05:49.900> baby

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
kind of giving it to you guys in baby

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.610 
kind of giving it to you guys in baby
steps<00:05:50.169> i<00:05:50.530> guess<00:05:51.180> but<00:05:52.180> this<00:05:52.390> is<00:05:52.630> pretty<00:05:53.050> much<00:05:53.200> it

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
steps i guess but this is pretty much it

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.260 
steps i guess but this is pretty much it
for

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
for

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.690 
for
the<00:05:56.020> general<00:05:56.380> shape<00:05:56.410> of<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.890> blade<00:05:57.040> this<00:05:57.490> is

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
the general shape of the blade this is

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.490 
the general shape of the blade this is
going<00:05:57.970> to<00:05:58.030> be<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.360> before<00:05:58.690> I<00:05:58.750> start<00:05:59.020> doing<00:05:59.380> any

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
going to be it before I start doing any

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.620 
going to be it before I start doing any
shaping<00:06:00.930> everything's<00:06:01.930> glued<00:06:02.110> on<00:06:03.090> in<00:06:04.090> terms

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
shaping everything's glued on in terms

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.480 
shaping everything's glued on in terms
of<00:06:04.810> banding<00:06:05.440> so<00:06:05.710> you<00:06:06.040> know<00:06:06.160> we<00:06:06.280> have<00:06:06.370> the

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
of banding so you know we have the

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.150 
of banding so you know we have the
band's<00:06:06.700> here<00:06:07.500> all<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.680> layering<00:06:08.950> is<00:06:09.250> glued<00:06:09.550> on

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
band's here all the layering is glued on

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.230 
band's here all the layering is glued on
the<00:06:12.160> skull<00:06:12.430> still<00:06:12.760> just<00:06:12.910> taped<00:06:13.210> down<00:06:13.540> but

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
the skull still just taped down but

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.590 
the skull still just taped down but
basically<00:06:16.240> I<00:06:16.750> mean<00:06:17.230> that<00:06:17.560> you<00:06:18.070> know<00:06:18.550> the<00:06:19.210> basic

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
basically I mean that you know the basic

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.500 
basically I mean that you know the basic
shape<00:06:19.630> is<00:06:20.050> here<00:06:20.260> this<00:06:20.530> is<00:06:20.710> it<00:06:20.920> so<00:06:21.880> from<00:06:22.210> here<00:06:22.360> on

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
shape is here this is it so from here on

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.890 
shape is here this is it so from here on
out<00:06:22.540> I<00:06:23.440> still<00:06:24.310> have<00:06:24.520> to<00:06:24.790> do<00:06:25.680> all<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:27.520> shaping

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
out I still have to do all the shaping

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.540 
out I still have to do all the shaping
in<00:06:28.900> terms<00:06:29.140> of<00:06:30.150> rounding<00:06:31.150> and<00:06:31.300> doing<00:06:31.570> the<00:06:31.750> final

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
in terms of rounding and doing the final

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.370 
in terms of rounding and doing the final
edging<00:06:33.550> of<00:06:33.850> the<00:06:34.000> blade<00:06:34.270> and<00:06:34.300> you<00:06:35.110> know

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
edging of the blade and you know

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.470 
edging of the blade and you know
rounding<00:06:36.010> the<00:06:36.130> handle<00:06:36.640> and<00:06:37.000> the<00:06:37.090> banding<00:06:37.420> on

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
rounding the handle and the banding on

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.010 
rounding the handle and the banding on
the<00:06:37.600> handle<00:06:38.110> and<00:06:39.270> once<00:06:40.270> all<00:06:40.420> the<00:06:40.510> shaping<00:06:40.750> is

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
the handle and once all the shaping is

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.350 
the handle and once all the shaping is
done<00:06:41.490> I<00:06:42.490> then<00:06:43.000> we'll<00:06:43.150> move<00:06:43.300> on<00:06:43.510> to<00:06:44.220> carving<00:06:45.360> I'm

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
done I then we'll move on to carving I'm

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.120 
done I then we'll move on to carving I'm
doing<00:06:46.720> all<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:46.960> little<00:06:47.080> details<00:06:47.350> doing<00:06:48.040> the

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
doing all the little details doing the

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.340 
doing all the little details doing the
details<00:06:48.490> here<00:06:48.610> doing<00:06:49.480> the<00:06:49.630> details<00:06:50.110> on<00:06:50.260> the

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
details here doing the details on the

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.720 
details here doing the details on the
blade<00:06:50.650> and<00:06:52.830> doing<00:06:53.830> the<00:06:53.890> other<00:06:54.010> side<00:06:54.250> of<00:06:54.280> skull

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.730 
blade and doing the other side of skull

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.140 
blade and doing the other side of skull
the<00:06:55.630> other<00:06:55.780> the<00:06:56.470> other<00:06:56.500> skull<00:06:56.950> head<00:06:57.130> and<00:06:57.340> then

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150 
the other the other skull head and then

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.020 
the other the other skull head and then
the<00:06:59.140> horns<00:06:59.530> somewhere<00:06:59.950> in<00:07:00.100> there<00:07:00.280> I'm<00:07:00.520> still

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
the horns somewhere in there I'm still

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.460 
the horns somewhere in there I'm still
kind<00:07:01.240> of<00:07:01.300> fuzzy<00:07:01.540> as<00:07:01.750> to<00:07:01.930> where<00:07:02.080> I'm<00:07:02.290> actually

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
kind of fuzzy as to where I'm actually

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.440 
kind of fuzzy as to where I'm actually
when<00:07:03.340> I'm<00:07:03.430> actually<00:07:03.580> going<00:07:03.820> to<00:07:03.880> work<00:07:03.940> on<00:07:04.300> the

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
when I'm actually going to work on the

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.830 
when I'm actually going to work on the
horns<00:07:04.950> but<00:07:05.950> we'll<00:07:06.220> be<00:07:06.340> in<00:07:06.490> there<00:07:06.730> but<00:07:07.360> so<00:07:07.660> yeah

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
horns but we'll be in there but so yeah

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.570 
horns but we'll be in there but so yeah
you<00:07:08.140> can<00:07:08.290> get<00:07:08.380> a<00:07:08.410> basic<00:07:08.650> idea<00:07:08.950> of<00:07:10.800> what<00:07:11.800> this<00:07:12.160> is

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
you can get a basic idea of what this is

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:19.380 
you can get a basic idea of what this is
going<00:07:13.540> to<00:07:13.600> look<00:07:13.870> like<00:07:17.730> so<00:07:18.730> that's<00:07:18.970> pretty<00:07:19.240> much

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390 
going to look like so that's pretty much

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.540 
going to look like so that's pretty much
it

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.580 

just<00:07:25.550> another<00:07:25.760> real<00:07:26.120> quick<00:07:26.510> for<00:07:27.080> us<00:07:27.170> more<00:07:27.500> an

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590 
just another real quick for us more an

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:33.090 
just another real quick for us more an
update<00:07:29.230> I've<00:07:30.230> started<00:07:30.560> rounding<00:07:31.040> the<00:07:31.400> handles

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.100 
update I've started rounding the handles

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.850 
update I've started rounding the handles
the<00:07:34.100> handle<00:07:34.340> and<00:07:34.430> the<00:07:34.520> bands<00:07:34.880> excuse<00:07:35.570> me<00:07:35.860> yeah

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.860 
the handle and the bands excuse me yeah

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.590 
the handle and the bands excuse me yeah
you<00:07:36.919> can<00:07:37.250> just<00:07:37.280> kind<00:07:37.580> of<00:07:37.610> see<00:07:37.669> the<00:07:38.090> difference

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:38.600 
you can just kind of see the difference

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.240 
you can just kind of see the difference
it<00:07:38.780> makes<00:07:38.990> now<00:07:39.260> that<00:07:39.440> I've<00:07:39.530> rounded<00:07:39.770> up<00:07:40.040> and

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250 
it makes now that I've rounded up and

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.420 
it makes now that I've rounded up and
rounded<00:07:40.610> the<00:07:40.639> band<00:07:40.880> around<00:07:41.030> up<00:07:41.450> and<00:07:42.250> that<00:07:43.250> you

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430 
rounded the band around up and that you

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.300 
rounded the band around up and that you
can<00:07:43.460> see<00:07:43.910> how<00:07:44.300> it<00:07:44.330> would<00:07:45.040> be<00:07:46.040> very<00:07:46.190> difficult

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.310 
can see how it would be very difficult

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.010 
can see how it would be very difficult
to<00:07:46.820> find<00:07:47.440> to<00:07:48.440> actually<00:07:48.560> wrap<00:07:48.980> wood<00:07:49.280> around

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.020 
to find to actually wrap wood around

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.540 
to find to actually wrap wood around
before<00:07:53.650> if<00:07:54.650> I<00:07:54.889> had<00:07:55.010> waited<00:07:55.130> till<00:07:55.400> after

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:55.550 
before if I had waited till after

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.950 
before if I had waited till after
rounding<00:07:56.180> the<00:07:56.270> handle<00:07:56.570> and<00:07:56.630> then<00:07:56.750> tried<00:07:56.930> to

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 
rounding the handle and then tried to

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.860 
rounding the handle and then tried to
bandit<00:07:57.410> it<00:07:57.710> would<00:07:58.070> not<00:07:58.910> come<00:07:59.150> out<00:07:59.270> quite<00:07:59.660> as

00:07:59.860 --> 00:07:59.870 
bandit it would not come out quite as

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.280 
bandit it would not come out quite as
easily<00:08:00.169> done<00:08:00.710> as<00:08:00.890> this<00:08:01.160> so<00:08:01.990> just<00:08:02.990> so<00:08:03.110> you<00:08:03.200> get

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.290 
easily done as this so just so you get

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.540 
easily done as this so just so you get
an<00:08:03.410> idea<00:08:03.650> of<00:08:03.710> what<00:08:03.860> i'm<00:08:03.950> talking<00:08:04.310> about<00:08:04.370> when

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:04.550 
an idea of what i'm talking about when

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.540 
an idea of what i'm talking about when
I'm<00:08:04.880> you<00:08:05.570> know<00:08:05.690> thinking<00:08:06.650> ahead<00:08:06.950> here<00:08:07.370> in

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:07.550 
I'm you know thinking ahead here in

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.020 
I'm you know thinking ahead here in
terms<00:08:07.760> of<00:08:08.650> putting<00:08:09.650> the<00:08:09.890> bands<00:08:10.220> on<00:08:10.370> square

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.030 
terms of putting the bands on square

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:17.980 
terms of putting the bands on square
like<00:08:11.510> so<00:08:12.550> before<00:08:14.410> rounding<00:08:15.410> them<00:08:15.500> over<00:08:16.990> so

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:17.990 
like so before rounding them over so

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.410 
like so before rounding them over so
that's<00:08:18.110> pretty<00:08:18.260> much<00:08:18.350> it
