 and evening and satin and matte textures 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.090
 this shadows with minerals should not be confused 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.879
 mineral shadows and shadows with minerals 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.480
 in detail this topic I opened graze on 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.460
 blog post 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.800
 I will leave a link to it in the description under 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.200
 video shadows with minerals may contain 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.240
 talc that dries centuries and can 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.490
 wrinkles due to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.890
 skin dehydration when used 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.410
 such shadows daily therefore always 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.840
 pay attention to the composition 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.850
 makeup products 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.740
 the shadows are held at the base all day long 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.740
 tarnish without rolling down the crease 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.290
 burgundy 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.560
 if inaccurately shade can 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.289
 show gray dirty then two 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.240
 I don't use pink matte shades 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.960
 since they are not complementary to my 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.330
 skin tone 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.420
 the other colors go together 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.520
 and form many combinations therefore 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.159

 light fresh warm about the spring breeze 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.900

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.609
 sensations cause me perfumed

 water lanvin eclat 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:46.280
 chose the alcohol flavor as it 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.730
 universal option after all essential oils 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.340
 not everyone can like the flavor chosen 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.920
 for romantic tenderness airiness 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.530

 medium resistance up to 4 hours 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.579

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.650
 current today here is this parameter 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.000
 individual fragrance suitable for each 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.920
 day and will create 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.079
 feminine and feeling aroma 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.000
 economical due to the spray 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.889
 which gives copious spraying 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.440
 I will not show so as not to hide 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.200

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.370
 herself 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.709
 but in the last two months i have two 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.910
 parallel seminars courses so i 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.010
 physically do not have time I chose 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.800
 alternative but for those who 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.290
 a similar situation this will be for you this 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.630
 sugar scrub with extracts of mandarin 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.260
 composition if you disassemble the base is 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.670
 coconut triglyceride 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.370
 triglyceride caprylyl is an ester 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.500
 glycerol with coconut fat also in 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.080
 isopropyl palmitate composition 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.910
 derived from fatty acids is intended 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.150
 break down contaminants and sebum 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.239
 is a binder with krabi 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.100
 it may cause an allergic reaction in 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.620
 scrubbing particles 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.990
 Cane sugar plastic packaging 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.570

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.090
 with effort the profiled otdushka gives 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.430
 tangerine jam flavor with cloying 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.790
 you put on a wet skin shade 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.560
 the aroma is barely perceptible but the consistency 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.229
 cost-effective means of dealing with skin 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.780
 converted hydrophilic sugar oil 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.360
 Scrubs without injuring the skin softens it 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.550
 due to the glycerol component and 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.070
 vegetable oils therefore need 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.990
 understand that this means industrial 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.580
 synthetic and added 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.789
 organic ingredients 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.979
