00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
itself

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.779 
itself
the<00:00:21.000> only<00:00:21.570> way<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.779> open<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.769> point<00:00:23.039> is

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the only way to open it at this point is

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.540 
the only way to open it at this point is

little matchbox truck here wedged under
the<00:00:34.399> release<00:00:35.399> lever<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.210> now<00:00:37.309> should<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.340> able

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the release lever and now should be able

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.229 
the release lever and now should be able
to<00:00:38.820> open<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.890> okay<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.579> problem<00:00:41.760> is

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
to open this up okay so the problem is

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.920 
to open this up okay so the problem is
is<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.719> there's<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.200> spring<00:00:43.590> clip<00:00:44.510> snaps<00:00:45.510> into

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
is that there's a spring clip snaps into

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.750 
is that there's a spring clip snaps into
here<00:00:46.410> somehow<00:00:46.730> that's<00:00:47.730> missing<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.170> when

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
here somehow that's missing so that when

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.560 
here somehow that's missing so that when
this<00:00:50.840> pin<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.110> released<00:00:52.680> by<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> lever

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
this pin is released by the lever

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.960 
this pin is released by the lever
the<00:00:55.410> force<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.040> spring<00:00:56.220> will<00:00:56.610> pop<00:00:56.790> the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
the force of the spring will pop the

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.520 
the force of the spring will pop the
door<00:00:57.180> open<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.630> because<00:00:57.900> that's<00:00:58.080> not<00:00:58.290> here

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
door open but because that's not here

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.890 
door open but because that's not here
the<00:00:58.710> door<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.070> sits<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.460> place<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.210> then

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
the door just sits in place and then

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.140 
the door just sits in place and then
releasing<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.830> lever<00:01:02.040> just<00:01:02.130> pushes<00:01:02.700> this<00:01:02.850> pin

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
releasing the lever just pushes this pin

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.130 
releasing the lever just pushes this pin
back<00:01:03.890> through<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.240> boss<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
that fits the the 2012 Corolla I imagine

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.190 
that fits the the 2012 Corolla I imagine
most<00:01:32.340> Toyota's<00:01:32.910> are<00:01:33.180> similar<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:33.990> not<00:01:34.020> the

most Toyota's are similar if not the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.040 
most Toyota's are similar if not the
same<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.920> you'll<00:01:35.100> need<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.720> you<00:01:36.720> know<00:01:36.810> check

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
same but you'll need to you know check

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.600 
same but you'll need to you know check
your<00:01:37.229> application<00:01:37.350> check<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.220> your<00:01:38.310> dealer

or check online you know whatever but

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.350 
or check online you know whatever but
but<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.220> happens<00:01:41.550> to<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.880> part<00:01:42.090> number

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
but this happens to be the part number

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.330 
but this happens to be the part number
for<00:01:42.390> my<00:01:42.720> car<00:01:42.960> anyway<00:01:43.380> which<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.800> 2012

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
for my car anyway which was a 2012

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.969 
for my car anyway which was a 2012
Corolla<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.810> thing<00:01:46.020> only<00:01:46.229> cost<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.890> think

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
Corolla and the thing only cost I think

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.980 
Corolla and the thing only cost I think
was<00:01:47.280> four<00:01:47.490> dollars<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:47.970> seventy<00:01:48.300> seven<00:01:48.479> cents

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
was four dollars and seventy seven cents

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.730 
was four dollars and seventy seven cents
so<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.890> bad<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> dealer<00:01:50.700> item<00:01:51.680> okay<00:01:52.680> so

a piece of plastic with some spring
steel<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.760> it<00:02:00.770> okay<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.010> looks<00:02:02.220> like<00:02:02.280> it

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
steel on it okay and this looks like it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.440 
steel on it okay and this looks like it
just<00:02:02.700> simply<00:02:03.120> fits<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:05.280> round<00:02:06.180> part

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
just simply fits on here this round part

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.229 
just simply fits on here this round part
Clips<00:02:07.050> over<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.470> hinge<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.300> then<00:02:09.300> there's<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
Clips over the hinge and then there's a

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.979 
Clips over the hinge and then there's a
tab<00:02:12.799> on<00:02:13.799> this<00:02:14.040> end<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.730> fits<00:02:15.150> into<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.690> hole

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
tab on this end that fits into this hole

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.680 
tab on this end that fits into this hole
in<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.560> gas<00:02:16.739> door<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.120> should<00:02:18.360> do<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.570> so

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
in the gas door and that should do it so

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.060 
in the gas door and that should do it so
I'm<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.200> use<00:02:19.320> both<00:02:19.500> hands<00:02:19.830> for

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
I'm just going to use both hands for

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.350 
I'm just going to use both hands for
this<00:02:20.190> because<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.580> looks<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.970> needs<00:02:21.150> some

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
this because it looks like it needs some

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.050 
this because it looks like it needs some
forst's<00:02:21.840> okay<00:02:22.799> there<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.489> place<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.000> it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
forst's okay there it is in place and it

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.580 
forst's okay there it is in place and it
went<00:02:24.209> aint<00:02:24.330> easier<00:02:24.630> than<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.840> expected

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
went aint easier than I expected

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.710 
went aint easier than I expected
the<00:02:25.739> gas<00:02:26.340> door<00:02:26.549> just<00:02:26.850> was<00:02:26.970> open<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.390> little<00:02:27.420> too

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
the gas door just was open a little too

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.080 
the gas door just was open a little too
far<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.980> trick<00:02:29.160> was<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.430> had<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.640> close<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
far the trick was I had to close it a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.699 
far the trick was I had to close it a
little<00:02:30.299> bit<00:02:30.480> just<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.080> could<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
little bit just so that I could get the

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.640 
little bit just so that I could get the
round<00:02:32.190> end<00:02:32.519> between<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.780> hinge<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.320> this

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
round end between the hinge and this

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.130 
round end between the hinge and this
piece<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.310> metal<00:02:35.430> here<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.150> then<00:02:36.720> once<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.110> was

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
piece of metal here and then once I was

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.630 
piece of metal here and then once I was
able<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.470> do<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.739> it's<00:02:37.920> clipped<00:02:38.280> right<00:02:38.459> in

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
able to do that it's clipped right in

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.360 
able to do that it's clipped right in
and<00:02:38.940> then<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.180> end<00:02:39.450> has<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:40.110> locking<00:02:40.769> tab<00:02:41.100> as

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
and then this end has a locking tab as

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.900 
and then this end has a locking tab as
well<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:42.390> everything<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.840> clipped<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.910> okay

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
well and everything is clipped in okay

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.050 
well and everything is clipped in okay
so<00:02:44.970> I've<00:02:45.120> got<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.450> wedge<00:02:45.989> removed<00:02:46.980> from<00:02:47.820> the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
so I've got the wedge removed from the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.449 
so I've got the wedge removed from the
lever<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:49.650> functioning<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
lever so this is now functioning the

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.850 
lever so this is now functioning the
locking<00:02:50.820> pin<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.180> functioning<00:02:51.630> as<00:02:52.590> intended

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
locking pin is functioning as intended

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
locking pin is functioning as intended
so<00:02:53.640> now<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.820> should<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.330> able<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:55.880> close

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
so now I should be able to just close

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.640 
so now I should be able to just close
that<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.989> course<00:02:58.049> out<00:02:58.530> won't<00:02:58.860> open

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
that and of course out won't open

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.830 
that and of course out won't open
but<00:03:00.650> if<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.660> pop<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.930> lever<00:03:03.170> here<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.880> works<00:03:05.090> as

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
but if I pop the lever here it works as

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.170 
but if I pop the lever here it works as
intended
