 humanity to all this world and the very 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.840
 the main thing in a moment is almost no love for

 the creator of this is not 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.360
 to the Lord himself 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.450

 which is not really happy 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.950

 educated 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.370
 any images that are around the child 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.890
 around each of us they sate 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.270
 our spiritual axis that is our soul and 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.450
 so we become 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.960
 educated and 3 task to help him in 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.780
 his learning of generally accepted knowledge 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.140
 science skills skill is not easy 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.720
 load the child with knowledge and information 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.390
 but help him break his nature his 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.880
 destinations to help him go deep into 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.480
 those sciences that he has a special 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.760
 addiction 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.050
 interest that we managed to translate in two 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.160
 of the year 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.990
 she still talk about it of course kids 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.290
 happily go to school and absolutely not 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.390
 parents want to go home now 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.920
 learn from their children and teachers 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.370
 become students 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.460
 those children who came to us with 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.410
 comprehensive schools more 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.940
 aggressive than those who started here 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.350
 they communicate very quickly with ours 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.730
 kids who are first class 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.440

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.200
 aggression is now manifested which is not 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.700
 brought with me for now the main thing 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.460
 the fact that the class is more friendly first school 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.410

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.850

 good relationship was but I left because 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.490
 the fact that there was a neglect of each 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.950
 friend each classmates that is, we 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.860
 didn't even care for each other we even 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.250
 despised friend the uniqueness of our school 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.100
 is that it is based on the desire to give 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.920
 children knowledge based on love and in that 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.010
