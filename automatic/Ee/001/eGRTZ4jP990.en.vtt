00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
something that we need to do and I I

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.229 
something that we need to do and I I
know<00:04:19.949> that<00:04:20.039> doesn't<00:04:20.310> sound<00:04:20.549> like<00:04:20.699> a<00:04:20.729> lot<00:04:20.970> 1

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
know that doesn't sound like a lot 1

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.490 
know that doesn't sound like a lot 1
percent<00:04:21.599> of<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.720> vote<00:04:21.750> doesn't<00:04:22.049> sound<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.469> a

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
percent of the vote doesn't sound like a

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.550 
percent of the vote doesn't sound like a
lot<00:04:22.680> but<00:04:22.740> recognize<00:04:23.370> that<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.150> would<00:04:24.360> be

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
lot but recognize that that would be

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.770 
lot but recognize that that would be
seven<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.860> 10<00:04:26.099> times<00:04:26.430> as<00:04:26.729> many<00:04:26.880> votes

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
seven to 10 times as many votes

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.210 
seven to 10 times as many votes
as<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:28.080> Green<00:04:28.260> Party<00:04:28.560> has<00:04:28.680> gotten<00:04:29.010> in<00:04:29.130> the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
as the Green Party has gotten in the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.310 
as the Green Party has gotten in the
last<00:04:29.250> two<00:04:29.610> presidential<00:04:30.030> elections<00:04:30.630> cycles

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
last two presidential elections cycles

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.490 
last two presidential elections cycles
so<00:04:31.860> every<00:04:32.280> step<00:04:32.520> forward<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.290> counts<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.410> that

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
so every step forward I counts and that

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.960 
so every step forward I counts and that
would<00:04:34.590> be<00:04:34.620> many<00:04:34.830> steps<00:04:35.100> forward<00:04:35.490> but<00:04:35.639> say<00:04:35.820> we

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
would be many steps forward but say we

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.250 
would be many steps forward but say we
do<00:04:36.090> better<00:04:36.270> than<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:36.480> say<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.020> we<00:04:37.110> get

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
do better than that say that we get

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.110 
do better than that say that we get
three<00:04:37.470> percent<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:37.980> vote<00:04:38.010> we<00:04:38.790> get<00:04:38.940> three

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
three percent of the vote we get three

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.460 
three percent of the vote we get three
percent<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:39.570> vote<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.750> would<00:04:40.080> be<00:04:40.230> the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
percent of the vote that would be the

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.310 
percent of the vote that would be the
best<00:04:41.240> total<00:04:42.240> for<00:04:42.570> any<00:04:42.720> independent
