when<00:00:00.869> a<00:00:00.900> technology<00:00:01.560> becomes<00:00:02.129> personal<00:00:02.780> when

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
when a technology becomes personal when

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.870 
when a technology becomes personal when
a<00:00:03.810> technology<00:00:04.140> becomes<00:00:04.620> desktop<00:00:05.070> it<00:00:05.520> doesn't

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:05.880 
a technology becomes desktop it doesn't

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.509 
a technology becomes desktop it doesn't
just<00:00:06.150> get<00:00:06.360> cheaper<00:00:07.020> smaller<00:00:07.290> better<00:00:07.620> more

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
just get cheaper smaller better more

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.699 
just get cheaper smaller better more
victus<00:00:08.940> what<00:00:09.540> happens<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.049> that<00:00:10.169> gets<00:00:10.320> used<00:00:10.530> in

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:10.709 
victus what happens is that gets used in

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.470 
victus what happens is that gets used in
different<00:00:11.070> ways<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:11.910> really<00:00:12.150> exciting

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
different ways so it's really exciting

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.400 
different ways so it's really exciting
to<00:00:12.719> me<00:00:13.019> about<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.099> era<00:00:14.579> the<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.660> moment<00:00:16.080> here

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
to me about the era the the moment here

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.280 
to me about the era the the moment here
of<00:00:16.560> desktop<00:00:17.490> manufacturing<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:18.390> not<00:00:18.870> just<00:00:19.200> the

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
of desktop manufacturing is not just the

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.020 
of desktop manufacturing is not just the
tools<00:00:19.530> it's<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:19.980> people<00:00:20.100> will<00:00:20.400> do<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.760> them

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
tools it's what people will do with them

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.410 
tools it's what people will do with them
and<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.840> can't<00:00:22.170> wait<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.590> see<00:00:22.860> is<00:00:23.270> when<00:00:24.270> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
and what I can't wait to see is when you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.720 
and what I can't wait to see is when you
put<00:00:24.720> 3d<00:00:25.140> printers<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.500> every<00:00:25.860> school<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.520> kids

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
put 3d printers in every school the kids

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.070 
put 3d printers in every school the kids
are<00:00:26.820> gonna<00:00:26.910> do<00:00:27.060> things<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.420> can't<00:00:27.630> imagine

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
are gonna do things we can't imagine

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.260 
are gonna do things we can't imagine
they<00:00:28.410> they're<00:00:28.860> good<00:00:29.100> at<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.340> stuff<00:00:29.490> right

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
only put them on the screen but then

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.139 
only put them on the screen but then
print<00:00:43.170> them<00:00:43.289> out<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.649> if<00:00:44.100> they're<00:00:44.219> cool<00:00:44.460> print

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
print them out and if they're cool print

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.930 
print them out and if they're cool print

they're<00:00:59.460> dot<00:00:59.789> matrix<00:00:59.940> printers<00:01:00.389> if<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.629> will

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
they're dot matrix printers if you will

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.899 
they're dot matrix printers if you will
but<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.620> know<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.100> don't<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.579> cast<00:01:02.789> your

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
but you know you don't have to cast your

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.639 
but you know you don't have to cast your
mind<00:01:03.089> forward<00:01:03.389> that<00:01:03.600> far<00:01:03.929> before<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.469> start

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
mind forward that far before you start

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.469 
mind forward that far before you start
to<00:01:04.710> bring<00:01:04.829> in<00:01:04.979> other<00:01:05.159> materials<00:01:05.489> maybe<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to bring in other materials maybe you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.240 
to bring in other materials maybe you
can<00:01:06.600> add<00:01:06.750> electronics<00:01:07.439> into<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.159> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
can add electronics into this and so you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.310 
can add electronics into this and so you
can<00:01:08.369> integrate<00:01:08.670> electronics<00:01:09.570> into<00:01:09.840> an<00:01:09.930> object

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
can integrate electronics into an object

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.380 
can integrate electronics into an object
and<00:01:10.560> now<00:01:10.950> you're<00:01:11.219> starting<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.909> kind

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and now you're starting to get that kind

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.020 
and now you're starting to get that kind
of<00:01:12.479> Star<00:01:12.659> Trek<00:01:12.930> fantasy<00:01:13.439> where<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.820> basically

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
of Star Trek fantasy where you basically

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.560 
of Star Trek fantasy where you basically
ask<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.259> something<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:17.250> know<00:01:17.369> tea<00:01:18.119> Earl<00:01:18.450> Grey
