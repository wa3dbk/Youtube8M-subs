James<00:00:05.069> has<00:00:05.220> been<00:00:05.370> proving<00:00:05.670> just<00:00:05.700> how

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
James has been proving just how

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.360 
James has been proving just how
overrated<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:07.319> real<00:00:07.589> world<00:00:07.830> can<00:00:08.069> be<00:00:08.189> with

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
overrated the real world can be with

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.580 
overrated the real world can be with
SimCity<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.389> virtual<00:00:09.719> universe<00:00:10.080> returns<00:00:10.440> in

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
SimCity the virtual universe returns in

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.110 
SimCity the virtual universe returns in
a<00:00:10.679> big<00:00:10.920> way<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.309> year<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.730> show<00:00:11.880> me<00:00:12.000> more

the game over at the press conference

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.590 
the game over at the press conference
yesterday<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:17.820> introduced<00:00:18.270> loose

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
yesterday but we have introduced loose

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.179 
yesterday but we have introduced loose
of<00:00:18.779> extended<00:00:19.289> version<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> gameplay

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
of extended version of the gameplay

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.279 
of extended version of the gameplay
let's<00:00:21.000> take<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> look<00:00:21.510> right<00:00:21.720> here<00:00:21.779> now<00:00:22.109> at<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
let's take a look right here now at the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.870 
let's take a look right here now at the
brand<00:00:22.680> new<00:00:22.800> SimCity<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.430> let's<00:00:23.580> start<00:00:23.760> by

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
brand new SimCity and let's start by

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.070 
brand new SimCity and let's start by
talking<00:00:24.029> about<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> games<00:00:24.570> look<00:00:24.840> which<00:00:25.050> is

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
talking about the games look which is

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.660 
talking about the games look which is
rather<00:00:25.350> distinct<00:00:26.220> where<00:00:26.369> did<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:26.519> come<00:00:26.640> from

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
rather distinct where did they come from

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 
rather distinct where did they come from
yeah<00:00:27.180> we've<00:00:27.720> been<00:00:27.750> really<00:00:28.080> inspired<00:00:28.529> by

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
yeah we've been really inspired by

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.710 
yeah we've been really inspired by
tilt-shift<00:00:29.070> videos<00:00:29.580> or<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.150> great<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.570> we've

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
tilt-shift videos or so great so we've

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260 
tilt-shift videos or so great so we've
created<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.430> model<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.550> beautiful<00:00:33.030> world

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
created this model like beautiful world

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.060 
created this model like beautiful world
that<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:33.989> players<00:00:34.290> are<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.829> able<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that we players are going to be able to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.280 
that we players are going to be able to
construct<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.820> you're<00:00:35.969> looking<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.290> your

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
construct and so you're looking to your

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.290 
construct and so you're looking to your
city<00:00:37.590> through<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> tilt-shift<00:00:38.489> lens<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.180> we've

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
city through a tilt-shift lens so we've

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.330 
city through a tilt-shift lens so we've
got<00:00:39.450> depth<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> field<00:00:39.989> blur<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.190> just

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
got depth of field blur and it just

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
got depth of field blur and it just
looks<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.640> there's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.910> live<00:00:42.120> model<00:00:42.510> like

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
looks like there's a live model like

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.290 
looks like there's a live model like
world<00:00:43.110> yeah<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.070> doesn't<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.430> look<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:44.940> in

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
world yeah it doesn't just look like in

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.060 
world yeah it doesn't just look like in
a<00:00:45.390> live<00:00:45.570> world<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> guys<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.500> gone<00:00:46.649> above

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
a live world to you guys have gone above

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.619 
a live world to you guys have gone above
and<00:00:47.129> beyond<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> simulation

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and beyond here with the simulation

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.420 
and beyond here with the simulation
aspects<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> make<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> living<00:00:50.039> breathing

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
aspects to make this a living breathing

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.850 
aspects to make this a living breathing
universe<00:00:51.059> right<00:00:51.300> yeah<00:00:51.719> we've<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.680> focused

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
universe right yeah we've really focused

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.250 
universe right yeah we've really focused
on<00:00:53.190> our<00:00:53.340> simulation<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.449> went<00:00:54.629> bananas<00:00:54.930> with

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
on our simulation we went bananas with

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.290 
on our simulation we went bananas with
our<00:00:55.379> new<00:00:55.530> engine<00:00:55.860> powered<00:00:56.190> by<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> glass<00:00:56.670> box<00:00:56.969> so

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
our new engine powered by a glass box so

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.900 
our new engine powered by a glass box so
every<00:00:57.930> sim<00:00:58.170> has<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> home<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> place<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.370> shop<00:00:59.640> they

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
every sim has a home a place a shop they

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930 
every sim has a home a place a shop they
work<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.660> traffic's<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.550> happens<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.699> front

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
work the traffic's just happens in front

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
work the traffic's just happens in front
of<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.270> real-time<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.960> somebody<00:01:04.559> took

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
of you in real-time and somebody took

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.440 
of you in real-time and somebody took
every<00:01:05.400> since<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.670> little<00:01:05.729> guy<00:01:06.090> walking

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
every since this little guy walking

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
every since this little guy walking
right<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.720> got<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> place<00:01:07.229> he's<00:01:07.409> got<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> story

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
right you got a place he's got a story

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
right you got a place he's got a story
exactly<00:01:08.369> each<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.090> has<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> story<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.869> how<00:01:10.080> do

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
exactly each one has a story and how do

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.690 
exactly each one has a story and how do
you<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.350> involved<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.100> how<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you get involved with that how do you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.760 
you get involved with that how do you
micromanage<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.659> how<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> invested

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
micromanage it or how are you invested

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
micromanage it or how are you invested
in<00:01:13.890> we're<00:01:14.520> trying<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> make<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.119> simulation

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
in we're trying to make the simulation

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.999 
in we're trying to make the simulation
super<00:01:15.930> easy<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.409> everything<00:01:16.860> that's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
super easy so everything that's

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.620 
super easy so everything that's
happening<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.700> happening<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.240> front<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.540> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
happening is happening in front of you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.929 
happening is happening in front of you
so<00:01:18.780> everything<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.830> sim<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.790> then

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
so everything you see we sim and then

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.429 
so everything you see we sim and then
we're<00:01:21.090> revealing<00:01:21.420> what's<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.350> your

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
we're revealing what's going on in your

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.350 
we're revealing what's going on in your
city<00:01:22.680> through<00:01:22.950> easy-to-read<00:01:23.580> date<00:01:23.820> data

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
city through easy-to-read date data

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.990 
city through easy-to-read date data
layers<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.710> you're<00:01:26.070> plopping<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.640> buildings

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
layers so you're plopping your buildings

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.280 
layers so you're plopping your buildings
you're<00:01:27.150> placing<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.659> police<00:01:27.869> stations

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
you're placing your police stations

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.719 
you're placing your police stations
you're<00:01:28.530> building<00:01:28.950> schools<00:01:29.159> because<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.579> your

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
you're building schools because all your

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
you're building schools because all your

great work so they're building an
international<00:02:27.900> airport<00:02:28.769> there'll<00:02:29.220> be<00:02:29.250> other

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
international airport there'll be other

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.490 
international airport there'll be other
great<00:02:29.730> words<00:02:29.939> like<00:02:30.239> shuttle<00:02:30.569> launches<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.170> of

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
great words like shuttle launches and of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.839 
great words like shuttle launches and of
course<00:02:31.709> we're<00:02:31.859> bringing<00:02:32.099> arcologies<00:02:32.640> back

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
course we're bringing arcologies back

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.789 
course we're bringing arcologies back
and<00:02:33.209> then<00:02:33.480> those<00:02:33.629> things<00:02:33.900> connect<00:02:34.379> one

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
and then those things connect one

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.170 
and then those things connect one
another's<00:02:35.129> game<00:02:35.400> worlds<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.819> each<00:02:35.879> other<00:02:36.030> so

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
another's game worlds to each other so

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.210 
another's game worlds to each other so
you<00:02:36.269> get<00:02:36.450> Scott<00:02:37.139> but<00:02:37.409> it's<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.799> so<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.159> not

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
you get Scott but it's this so it's not

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.440 
you get Scott but it's this so it's not
competitive<00:02:38.489> it's<00:02:38.819> more<00:02:38.939> of<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> co-op<00:02:39.269> it's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
competitive it's more of a co-op it's

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.020 
competitive it's more of a co-op it's
more<00:02:39.980> cooperative<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.129> we're<00:02:41.310> also<00:02:41.459> building

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
more cooperative but we're also building

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.339 
more cooperative but we're also building
a<00:02:42.299> leaderboard<00:02:42.629> so<00:02:42.989> there<00:02:43.139> is<00:02:43.230> some

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
a leaderboard so there is some
