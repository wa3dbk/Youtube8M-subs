being our own material from that based

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.419 
being our own material from that based
on<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.990> script<00:01:22.259> we've<00:01:22.499> had<00:01:22.649> to<00:01:22.859> take<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
on that script we've had to take a

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.279 
on that script we've had to take a
script<00:01:23.789> and<00:01:23.909> completely<00:01:24.479> cut<00:01:24.779> it<00:01:24.929> up<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
script and completely cut it up and
