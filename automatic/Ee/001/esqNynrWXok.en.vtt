00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.200
 thank you very much for continuing with 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:12.950
 if they knew what to the meat 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.950
 during the meat cut 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.209
 little angels 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.150
 good night let's start with 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.550
 you for you pretty ballerina a 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.010
 lovely black woman have a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.020
 beautiful skin a beautiful body but 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 I consider that in this choreography 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.670
 metieran missed him more energy one 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 little more of that force of that power 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.290
 JUAN ANDRÃ‰S looks really good 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.150
 extraordinary considered that 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.300
 We consider here with my colleagues that 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.310
 you can still risk more in everything 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.380
 because from the first gala until now 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.240
 it is seen that there is a growth at level 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.340
 technical level of expression you have not 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.500
 had but it's better so do not andress 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.040
 go ahead continues itself working 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.560
 because the truth that 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.660
 well you do not have to faint neither the one nor the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.660
 another always at the same time happiness guys 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.260
 guys you would say fast and clear and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.940
 just this is one of the rhythms that 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.070
 more confident I have seen you that better as 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.240
 that you better stay here to take 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.910
 some classes after today as 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.680
 aesthetic teak of course yes but 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.479
 I say after we finish the program 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.870
 could you engage a dancer brother you 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.910
 is English and is a dancer 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.250
 super versatile I've seen it in 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.660
 many rhythms dancing and everything is 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.700
 lacking energy is true what it says 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.560
 then we have batteries with batteries 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.619
 because we lack energy ok I wanted 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.300
 Alejandro continued because he is having 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.820
 William Levy 4 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.820
 yes 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 keep going 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.240
 what a tremendous fan has 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.090
 but good 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.280
 data 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.300
 I'm telling all my classmates what 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.640
 they told you it's true it 's more than obvious 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.060
 try the sneakers even if it's a dance 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.190
 urban you have to do it all the leaf 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.420
 tipped so it does not look like that for 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:35.340
 give aesthetics to the dance on the other hand 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.680
 look and you can give a lot more 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.080
 It has improved a lot but if she 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.080
 I help make 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.940
 Alejandro says karen that if you improve 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.940
 will recruit for your dance body 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.550
 very good, although we are ready 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.030
 I tried in the vote is left of the 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.030
 Following way 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:11.569
 karen 7.5 marian 9 alejandro 8 and cardan 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:16.530
 9.5 gives them an average of 8.5 very well 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:19.670
 guys and cheerful 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.810
 I want I want Juan Andres grow 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.209
 them worrying me a choreography 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.030
 where I'm going to dance like I dance but I do not 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.459
 I want to go out and dance strong and that 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.830
 they would see the famous one he missed I prefer that 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.209
 Tell me, but I want to generate 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.959
 famous grow more and when he is in the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.959
 level that is 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.220
 there he is carving silver and with much 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.350
 honey I tell you the way to do 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.110
 to grow your famous is to challenge him in your 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.820
 level is taking your dance and your 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.310
 conditions to another level he says wow 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.019
 I have such a good dancer that if I do not 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.660
 I do it to another level I'm going to unleash 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.780
 You are the one who should set the standard 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.560
 in the dance will what coach would take 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.560
