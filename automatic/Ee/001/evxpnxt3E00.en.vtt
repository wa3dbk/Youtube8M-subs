took a engineers teleporter to a very
nice<00:01:09.180> vantage<00:01:09.630> spot<00:01:09.900> actually<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.560> this

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
up I started swinging and I managed to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.640 
up I started swinging and I managed to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
get to challenge us three and there's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.080 
get to challenge us three and there's
the<00:01:19.710> flip<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.850> area<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:22.009> yeah<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.580> getting

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the flip so area and yeah so getting

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.910 
the flip so area and yeah so getting
kills<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.630> weapon<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.500> easy<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
kills with this weapon is not easy it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.620 
kills with this weapon is not easy it
actually<00:01:26.250> doesn't<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.820> much<00:01:26.880> damage<00:01:27.060> I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
actually doesn't do that much damage I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.249 
actually doesn't do that much damage I
think<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.710> shot<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.400> sniper<00:01:30.180> once<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
think I one shot a sniper once but I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.359 
think I one shot a sniper once but I
think<00:01:31.530> he<00:01:31.680> might<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:31.860> been<00:01:32.040> low<00:01:32.159> health

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
think he might have been low health

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
think he might have been low health
already<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:33.329> I'm<00:01:33.450> pretty<00:01:33.600> sure<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
already because I'm pretty sure the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.730 
already because I'm pretty sure the
sword<00:01:34.200> only<00:01:34.409> does<00:01:34.560> 65<00:01:35.100> damage<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:37.500> could<00:01:37.710> be

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
sword only does 65 damage so it could be

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.620 
sword only does 65 damage so it could be
a<00:01:37.829> challenge<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.579> quite<00:01:38.850> nice<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.479> get

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
a challenge it's quite nice that you get

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.270 
a challenge it's quite nice that you get
your<00:01:39.659> health<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.049> return<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.770> helps<00:01:41.040> for

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
your health on return it helps for

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.300 
your health on return it helps for
streaks<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.710> generally<00:01:43.710> getting<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.009> kill<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
streaks but generally getting a kill the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.800 
streaks but generally getting a kill the
first<00:01:44.490> place<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> pain<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.390> butt<00:01:45.540> like
