my pilot pen I have a 0.5 thin black pen
and<00:01:15.880> I<00:01:15.910> just<00:01:16.210> do<00:01:16.540> these<00:01:16.900> diagonal<00:01:17.619> lines<00:01:18.690> very

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
and I just do these diagonal lines very

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.029 
and I just do these diagonal lines very
good<00:01:20.080> this<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:20.950> close-up<00:01:21.280> now<00:01:21.820> I'll<00:01:22.690> just

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
good this is a close-up now I'll just

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.330 
good this is a close-up now I'll just
color<00:01:24.039> in<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.640> hearts<00:01:25.330> with<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.380> red<00:01:26.590> marker

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
color in the hearts with the red marker

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.120 
color in the hearts with the red marker
I<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:28.570> recommend<00:01:28.770> erasing<00:01:29.770> all<00:01:30.009> the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
I really recommend erasing all the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.639 
I really recommend erasing all the
guidelines<00:01:30.369> before<00:01:31.330> you<00:01:31.420> start<00:01:31.810> coloring<00:01:32.170> in

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
guidelines before you start coloring in

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.550 
guidelines before you start coloring in
because<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.420> won't<00:01:34.570> be<00:01:34.780> able<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:35.080> erase<00:01:35.350> it

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
because you won't be able to erase it

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.499 
because you won't be able to erase it
probably<00:01:36.190> after<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:37.090> color<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:40.000> just

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
probably after you color it so just

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.889 
probably after you color it so just
color<00:01:40.990> in<00:01:41.170> all<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.800> hearts<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.000> then<00:01:43.240> go<00:01:43.420> over

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
color in all the hearts and then go over

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.350 
color in all the hearts and then go over
the<00:01:45.090> long<00:01:46.090> lines<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:47.200> divide<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:48.430> card<00:01:48.789> into

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
the long lines that divide the card into

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.030 
the long lines that divide the card into
these<00:01:49.649> sections

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.560
