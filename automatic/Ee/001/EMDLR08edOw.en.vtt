 Now I have already recorded radio 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.920
 and the most important thing is this rader 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 Module protects your vehicle before getting 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.520
 the claw decides to do this 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.009
 to end up at school or 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.850
 to drill or mechanically open the cart 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.200
 to crack or a slice 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.009

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.930
 not to touch at all 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.340
 I believe it is here again 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.840
 navi professional in it 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.280
 The customers would be right now 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.659
 third time clown but that has become 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.299
 decided that now in his 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.979
 street in his settlement in other 3er 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.540
 bmw of the dose and he no longer so 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.070
 he has now decided to 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.600
 to come to hamburg this system 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.310
 to be installed 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.259
 who drives such a vehicle and the 250th 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.430
 euro for the fighting system i have left 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.110
 must be stupid because the damage 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.630
 from the bmw it always goes between 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.070
 seven and 15,000 euros sometime says 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.000
 we have no insurance 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.500
 more on it loses it 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.880
 insurance protection and moreover it is 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.930
 Of course, annoying that you always 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.299
 the co-investment has 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.729
 the partial insurance time value 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.619
 subtracts and of course are partial 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.140
 do not share or the vehicle 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.400
 is for weeks at the dealer for it 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.510
 to get back in shape because of the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.220
 insurance the damage 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.700
 Julia also protects the alarm system 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.739
 In addition to the vehicle mechanically 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.329
 here about the shock sensor if I have 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.099
 now, for example, to take a hard hit 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.930
 would with a short amplitude then 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.159
 The alarm system would do the same immediately 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.450
 with a full length you will be me 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.400
 now come with the poland key 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.079
 I mean, I 'm quite smart now 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.030
 recommended key the alarm system 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.280
 can not be disabled over here 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.890
 that did not close the box just here 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.489
 let's go on the thing yes and what 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.970
 the alarm system will pass the war 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.440
 whole with full long on the fall alone 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.260
 is now a few seconds interrupts 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.400
 that now at this point 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.739
 At the same time the customer receives from now 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.810
 the empire attracts 200 gsm gps 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.829

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.609
 Of course he can, of course 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.230
 ask at any time an sms where the 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.690
 vehicle is located and in which status 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.620
 the location system is located and 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.159

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.400
 play the log of your new one 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.290
 vehicle and then you can do that in 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.609
 Reuse the new vehicle if 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.410

 Complete everything with the sensors 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:45.440
 they probably have emergency power, for example 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.970

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.659
 wade through the on-board diagnosis 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.859
 unfortunately it is that every day too 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.780
