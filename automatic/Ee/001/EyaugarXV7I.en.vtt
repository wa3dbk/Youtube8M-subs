Hi there, thank you for tuning with BuenProvechoTV

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.540
in this video we are going to show you how to make chicken tostadas

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.280
for this recipe we will need 3 pounds of chicken breast

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:27.520
a pack of sazon goya with saffron, a garlic clove, a small onion, powdered chicken broth,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:40.780
we will also need lettuce, this green sauce for which we will give you a link in the description

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:51.080
re-fried beans for which we are also including a link

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:59.580
we also need tostadas and grated cotija cheese

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.380
here we have our chicken in 4 cups of water

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.180
we will add a generous tablespoon of powdered chicken broth

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:24.420
then add the diced onion, garlic clove and the pack of sazon

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:42.940
stir to combine ingredients then cover and cook for half an hour in medium heat

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.720
here is our chicken after half an hour

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.520
we tasted for salt and determined it needed some more therefore we are adding

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.980
we used about a tablespoon of salt but remember to season to your taste

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.460
our chicken is ready and now we are shredding it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.280
ok my dear friends, here we have everything ready to start putting together our tostadas

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.220
we have our shredded chicken, lettuce, re-fried beans and our sauce

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.560
remember we are leaving you links for the re-fried beans and green sauce recipes

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:52.660
the first thing we do is add the bean paste on our tostada

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.540
now we proceed to add our chicken

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.720
now the lettuce

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.520
and finally our green sauce

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.660
this one is very spicy with plenty of serrano peppers

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:51.800
to finish and add a touch of flavor and garnish we will be adding our cotija cheese

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.380
and that's it

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.960
now we are ready to enjoy our tostadas

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.560
they are just awesome

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.400
