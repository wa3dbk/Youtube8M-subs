 the note that I do if you do not agree 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.380
 with the note that you have taken in the 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.660
 exam 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.940
 you will have two review modalities the 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.730
 first of them is the claim and the 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.040
 second is a second correction in the 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.230
 claim modality of the note is 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.080
 will only look for type errors 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.330
 formal for it will be added again 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.330
 all the grades obtained in 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.699
 each section of the exam 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.280
 in the note that will prevail will be the most 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:28.400
 high either obtained after 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.860
 claim or the original in the 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.409
 second revision if you correct them again 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.080
 the exam by teachers other than 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:38.900
 the previous ones in this case does not prevail 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.210
 the highest note but you get a 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.430
 mean of the two therefore the note 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:47.150
 final that you can get will be superior 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.460
 to the original or inferior well either the 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.330
 has understood and now what is that of the 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.430
 pre-registration 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.039
 once you have passed the test 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.180
 of access to university studies 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:00.060
 the most important thing that you have to do 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.530
 is the pre-registration for this 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.750
 you will have all the information available 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.280
