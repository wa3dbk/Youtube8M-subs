00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.080
 Oh 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.789
 well that's it everyone said to me j 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.759
 so why says yes because 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.230
 now i changed my name is dizy 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:24.169
 because in fact yes if they were 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.730
 really very much taken as like those 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.680
 of jeans found by his sleeping friend 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.720
 all this and each time we did not do 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.390
 not so ten think of passing for me but 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.290
 when they are people who made no tricks 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.730
 that every time on mac the road on 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.449
 insulted me big shit or stuff 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.489
 like that so 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.620
 so here's yes I know there is a small 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.910
 thing so everything if I do a little 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.140
 video as his quick with the phone 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.400
 it's just to explain to you because I 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.089
 acquires a catfish there was 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.010
 two there are pretty much how good the 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.479
 weeks around and just I 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.650
 did not get a good sign I was forced 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.119
 to go see tutorials on youtube who 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.460
 explained how to do but simply 

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:57.500
 he redeems a cable and therefore j 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.629
 found the way to avoid you from 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.180
 buy back in coop which costs 30 euros for 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.989
 plug your CV so special and 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.549
 she had 2 what is it for 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.330
 those who do not dare despite I think 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.030
 that everyone knows 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.369
 so it's a gaming headset with a sound 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.759
 7.1 which is really very comfortable 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.460
 which is also really very tense 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.680
 we hear really well is not everything 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.270
 that's it so I'll also 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.230
 also talked about my inactivity then 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.550
 why I was inactive 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.870
 because just as we can 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.450
 so see where I play but this 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.950
 beautiful all that I have more orders 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.030
 is more avermedia gardener because in 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.290
 did I resold it to buy myself 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.110
 a hd settlement and when I wanted 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.110
 buy small worry is that there was 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.300
 more than one startup of in stock and so 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.440
 that's why I found myself bit is 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.180
 in a way so it's been a month 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.500
 I could not do video, but there 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.850
 my mother ordered my clothing 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.409
 rage as soon as I should get saturated 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.979
 so saturday obliged I make you from this 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.140
 quarter 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.260
 as if it's worse so here is 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.700
 now we will get to the heart of the subject 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.070
 so how to plug it in 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.680
 it's very simple you take everything 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.049
 first your siberia v2 helmet that 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.760
 here is 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.290
 and you take it's a marathon and 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.030
 pascaline no it's not easy at all 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.430
 so you take this tip so the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.430
 fly that you connect to the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:20.390
 remote control of this one I plug everything 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:22.250
 that's it is connected without continuation you 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.890
 get pop so you can you can 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:30.250
 follow it all when one is jostled in 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.250
 scrum as you take the usb cable 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.019
 as he was showing here 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.340
 this usb cable that you plug in to one 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.420
 usb ports of your console years that 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.530
 I lie that to be that the front port 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.660
 because back hopper which I know 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.170
 not on the xbox arcade but I know that 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:50.989
 on the xbox elite because I have 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:53.090
 match changes hands that's because I 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.830
 know that actually on the xbox arcade and 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.370
 mrdja him but I saw my readers this 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.349
 poor man 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.319
 the call of duty black ops for recognizes 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.120
 the geeks here it is not the man I 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.100
 know I do not know about the xbox arcade 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.660
 if you can connect m is safe 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.160
 xbox elite in any case we can not 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.760
 plugged in behind because that gives in 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.580
 do so then we want you to 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.340
 have spent here you take the cable handles 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.350
 here at the end of your usb cable 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.140
 so I show you everything to oppose the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.510
 usb cables you have another end then 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.550
 this one listen well the only one is that that 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.590
 will not become complex but 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.340
 that's where the solution lies then in 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.310
 just plug into this cable 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:43.520
 so which site is the red and white laugh 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:47.090
 associate so you connect it so a 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.510
 Once it's plugged in, here you are 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.010
 world is there then these so here it is 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.320
 there just need to have a room 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.090
 but leading everyone out there you 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.240
 just have this so that's it 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.790
 simply the cable that came with the xbox 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.030
 360 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.240
 original so with the three cables the 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.340
 three cables the three color caps 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.660
 what is it you too need to 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.190
 cost behind so it must be that 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.810
 of origin so nan it may be possible 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.970
 not go at least a heading that is 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.830
 branch on the xbox and you just need 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.390
 behind you will have a little black tip 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.000
 plastic here so we see very well the 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.530
 traces that I cut and it must be cut 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.510
 to be able to connect it to 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.220
 the backside 360 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.280
 so look because actually the cable 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.120
 hdmi I explain here block 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.350
 helicopter the little black tip and 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.440
 is blocking so it's just enough that you 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:47.030
 plug that cable in and once it's 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.790
 plugged in you take only I say 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.300
 well only red 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.169
 merd his a resident of the xbox console 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.530
 you can only red and the 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.470
 white that you connect to the back of the 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:10.289
 red and white cable of your everyday 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:15.610
 of cable the games branch this is it 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:16.659
 do we have orders here and a 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.909
 times that these have to brew so 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.770
 it's very simple then you just need 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:23.229
 to connect everything behind your screen 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:28.000
 so less the heart too I postulate of 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:32.469
 new in the audio ports on branch 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.409
 the red and a big white hair and 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:37.509
 this is where your helmet is and 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.590
 then plugged my name into the 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.699
 xbox settings frames and I connect 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.240
 groan that I'm good and we had 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:50.969
 managed to hack my account so that's it 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.969
 so the time it connects has it 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.969
 then here you just go 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:05.550
 all right us and in settings 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:07.810
 system settings of the audio console 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.050
 digital output let you in so 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.680

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.620
 do your xbox or middle key 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.139
 you go on preference settings 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.940
 voice and you put us here you are 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.469
 set your likes as you want and 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.440
