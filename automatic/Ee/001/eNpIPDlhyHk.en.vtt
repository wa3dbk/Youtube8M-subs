I see playing in the foreseeable future
i'm<00:04:52.740> also<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.430> thing<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.000> liked<00:04:54.300> is<00:04:54.570> you

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
i'm also the thing that I liked is you

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.770 
i'm also the thing that I liked is you
don't<00:04:55.650> really<00:04:55.830> lose<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.370> lot<00:04:56.640> when<00:04:56.910> ravnica

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
don't really lose a lot when ravnica

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.610 
don't really lose a lot when ravnica
rotates<00:04:58.170> out<00:04:59.540> you<00:05:00.540> don't<00:05:00.690> lose<00:05:01.140> much<00:05:01.350> at<00:05:01.500> all

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620
