xbox one it has to come to xbox one in
my<00:03:43.320> opinion<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.860> cannot<00:03:44.160> just<00:03:44.220> be<00:03:44.459> for<00:03:44.730> this

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
my opinion it cannot just be for this

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.479 
my opinion it cannot just be for this
the<00:03:45.120> ps4<00:03:45.420> because<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:46.110> then<00:03:46.489> that's

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
the ps4 because if it is then that's

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.040 
the ps4 because if it is then that's
gonna<00:03:47.670> be<00:03:47.760> crazy<00:03:47.880> man<00:03:48.270> I'm<00:03:48.480> gonna<00:03:48.690> have<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:48.959> get
