00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:06.110
 I wish everyone knew peculiar housing united where government the coti 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.649
 this version 4 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.360
 by the way we have to wait for m 40 and what I did not hear about st 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.939
 we should play with music 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:21.489
 Well, my answer is that everyone can obviously choose one hundred 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.419
 but they already give my opinion for 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.080
 therefore, luck 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.119
 music motivates a hundred whatever the level 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.630
 of deduction music for a hundred 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.840
 it is always good to have a computation motivation that explains why it motivates 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.430
 for example she who took a long time in this 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.040
 it's from this world 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.249
 is if 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:46.789
 as you are a montage you want to play tells us what clip 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:47.479
 sensible 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.529
 it belongs came in I also give me I must put on stage not go and put a little 

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:54.870
 of music and books kind a little more no 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990
 and vicente 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.470
 It motivates me 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.840
 I for example or 100 as I have to listen to the footsteps of the enemies 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.770
 the musical theme at a normal level and also very high nor very low 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.229
 simply to listen to it but I must also listen to the steps of the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.910
 enemies not then I personally always played with music 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.660
 If I do not play with musical, I'm always talking about the state. 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.280
 percent and never really played concentrated pd if it's not in the the challenges 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.340
 percent a theme the challenges of letting play challenges because m in triples will 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.380
 I was playing but 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.390
 one month ago 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.880
 percent 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.409
 the direct monkey points out that these because he 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.560
 precisely because it did not work then in 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.320
 I stopped playing challenges not 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.030
 and I've dedicated myself to doing 100 more in temple and shoot for time is on 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 and I no more channels 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 so who shook me new montage 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.460
 7 I do not know if the secret goes up on this face to the summer say yes had them 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.980
 per hundred because a tecme toaster you miss the day the proposals of 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.979
 other channels so if you want to say melo 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.980
 the captain is because before in English and such but good a montage not 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.120
 it is lent from square 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.140
 If you want to see it say good and passed it tomorrow or the past can not be worth 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.599
 in what hamas 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.609
 the topic of eta that I prefer because I know that lately he is giving the subject 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.759
 this one from pompeya will play a game 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.139
 What I prefer is whether or not I really prefer 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.660
 I have always always looked 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.010
 in the aim 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.150
 let's understand, games must one hundred percent of precision 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:44.200
 it still did not reach that level divine millet and I believe in everything 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.710
 the one that stays empty heading to fail very very very few shots 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.819
 percent if I thought about doing a challenge of a 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.169
 someone someone has to be able to do it 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:58.979
 so of course the wing is the connection to the mines on sale to fail more 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.459
 He highlighted the decision that although the work of the work is estimated to be 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.759
 anything 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.489
 and good percent I was thinking about making a challenge among all the Spaniards 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.869
 that we are someone has to be able to not 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:16.740
 portion or will comment the comments fed up seems and such 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.880
 He said it's just a thought 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.209
 And of course 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.969
 whoever did it 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.969
 I already say that I had a prize 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.409
 that is, quite fat 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.869
 of the game is already about to end is quite fast 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:36.119
 remy and maps by itunes attack me not there is the other death I hope that you 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:39.099
 have liked this city ticul neighbors are based always lived a lot
