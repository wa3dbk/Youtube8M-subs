I<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.370> little<00:00:14.639> bit<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.940> different

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
I have a little bit of a different

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.640 
I have a little bit of a different
technique<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.660> actually<00:00:15.839> use<00:00:16.170> Clippers

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
technique I actually use Clippers

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.200 
technique I actually use Clippers
instead<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.160> scissors<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> feel<00:00:18.029> like<00:00:18.119> it

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
instead of scissors and I feel like it

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.480 
instead of scissors and I feel like it
gives<00:00:18.330> me<00:00:18.600> more<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.500> blunt<00:00:19.740> line<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.189> as<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
gives me more of a blunt line and as you

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.660 
gives me more of a blunt line and as you
can<00:00:20.609> also<00:00:20.850> probably<00:00:21.420> tell<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> am<00:00:21.980> very<00:00:22.980> sick<00:00:23.430> so

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
everything that I say this is actually

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700 
everything that I say this is actually
really<00:00:33.450> really<00:00:33.570> easy<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.200> lot<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.590> guys

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
really really easy a lot of you guys

really really easy a lot of you guys
have<00:00:34.860> asked<00:00:35.100> me<00:00:35.219> how<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.820> there's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
have asked me how I do it and there's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.600 
have asked me how I do it and there's
really<00:00:36.480> not<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.899> huge<00:00:37.050> trick<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.829> think

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
really not a huge trick to it I think

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.430 
really not a huge trick to it I think
most<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.840> using<00:00:40.140> clippers

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
most of what is in it is using clippers

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.740 
most of what is in it is using clippers
versus<00:00:40.860> scissors<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.460> um<00:00:42.649> let's<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.739> started

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
versus scissors so um let's get started

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
versus scissors so um let's get started
okay<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.780> I'm<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> start<00:00:46.440> by<00:00:46.760> sectioning

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.290 
my hair which I've already done a little

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
because then when you start cutting in

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.789 
because then when you start cutting in
you're<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> actually<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.200> cutting<00:01:16.500> into

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
going to bobby pin it up and then I'm

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.310 
going to bobby pin it up and then I'm
going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> pull<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> rest<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> hair<00:01:25.049> back

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.490 

okay<00:01:47.940> so<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.300> almost<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> point<00:01:49.350> of

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
okay so it's almost at the point of

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.040 
okay so it's almost at the point of
being<00:01:49.770> completely<00:01:50.190> dry<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.540> keep<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.930> just

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
being completely dry and I keep it just

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.899 
being completely dry and I keep it just
a<00:01:52.200> little<00:01:52.530> bit<00:01:52.650> wet<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.520> gives<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
a little bit wet because it gives it a

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.460 
a little bit wet because it gives it a
little<00:01:54.180> bit<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.450> weight<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.320> it's

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
little bit of weight to it so it's

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.740 
little bit of weight to it so it's
easier<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.040> I'm<00:01:56.190> actually<00:01:56.430> cutting<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.270> so

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
easier when I'm actually cutting it so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.870 
easier when I'm actually cutting it so
now<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> put<00:01:58.380> down<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.950> paper<00:01:59.640> towel

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
now I'm going to put down a paper towel

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.219 
now I'm going to put down a paper towel
under<00:02:00.330> where<00:02:00.510> I'm<00:02:00.600> heading<00:02:00.900> because<00:02:01.110> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
under where I'm heading because you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.810 
under where I'm heading because you
don't<00:02:01.380> want<00:02:01.530> hair<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:02.009> over<00:02:02.040> your<00:02:02.369> bathroom

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
don't want hair all over your bathroom

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.520 
don't want hair all over your bathroom
and<00:02:03.420> now<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.050> give<00:02:04.200> my<00:02:04.320> bangs

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and now I'm just going to give my bangs

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.590 
and now I'm just going to give my bangs
an<00:02:04.830> initial<00:02:05.250> trim<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.150> I<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.360> actually

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
an initial trim so that I can actually

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.760 
an initial trim so that I can actually
see<00:02:07.050> what<00:02:07.080> I'm<00:02:07.259> doing

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
see what I'm doing

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.160 
see what I'm doing
so<00:02:08.220> I'm<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.490> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> cut<00:02:08.940> them<00:02:09.590> long<00:02:11.150> and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
so I'm just going to cut them long and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.050 
so I'm just going to cut them long and
don't<00:02:13.170> pull<00:02:13.410> too<00:02:13.620> hard<00:02:13.650> on<00:02:14.010> them<00:02:14.220> because<00:02:14.880> you

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
don't pull too hard on them because you

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.800 
don't pull too hard on them because you
don't<00:02:15.209> want<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:16.670> have<00:02:17.670> them<00:02:17.850> turn<00:02:18.090> out<00:02:18.120> way

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
don't want to have them turn out way

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.140 
don't want to have them turn out way
shorter<00:02:19.290> than<00:02:19.470> they're<00:02:19.590> supposed<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.370> did

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
shorter than they're supposed to I did

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.940 
shorter than they're supposed to I did
this<00:02:21.480> when<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.780> was<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.020> Warped<00:02:22.320> Tour<00:02:22.380> last

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
this when I was on Warped Tour last

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.670 
this when I was on Warped Tour last
summer<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.850> mistake<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.269> made<00:02:24.480> was<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:25.050> pulled

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
summer and a mistake I made was I pulled

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.830 
summer and a mistake I made was I pulled
them<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.130> twist<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.000> looked<00:02:27.300> down<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
them and twist it and I looked down and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.900 
them and twist it and I looked down and
then<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.470> trimmed<00:02:28.800> them<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.310> when<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.580> looked<00:02:29.760> up

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
then I trimmed them and when I looked up

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.780 
then I trimmed them and when I looked up
they<00:02:30.420> were<00:02:30.480> really<00:02:31.140> really<00:02:31.440> really<00:02:31.590> short<00:02:32.370> way

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
they were really really really short way

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.259 
they were really really really short way
too<00:02:32.850> short<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.690> don't<00:02:34.590> do<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:36.000> now<00:02:36.209> you

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
too short so don't do that so now you

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.560 
too short so don't do that so now you
can<00:02:36.810> actually<00:02:36.930> see<00:02:37.140> what<00:02:37.620> you're<00:02:37.650> doing<00:02:38.570> just

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
can actually see what you're doing just

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.449 
can actually see what you're doing just
comb<00:02:39.870> them<00:02:40.140> how<00:02:40.350> they<00:02:40.530> will<00:02:40.680> fall<00:02:40.890> naturally

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
comb them how they will fall naturally

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.970 
comb them how they will fall naturally
and<00:02:41.820> then<00:02:42.570> I'm<00:02:42.810> going<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:42.989> take<00:02:43.140> clippers<00:02:43.620> and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
and then I'm going to take clippers and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.479 
and then I'm going to take clippers and
make<00:02:44.970> sure<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.420> they're<00:02:46.040> all<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.340> way<00:02:47.370> to

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
make sure that they're all the way to

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.030 
make sure that they're all the way to
the<00:02:47.700> shortest<00:02:48.180> setting<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.650> they<00:02:49.709> really<00:02:49.950> get

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
the shortest setting so they really get

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.160 
the shortest setting so they really get
those<00:02:50.220> little<00:02:50.370> hairs<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.720> then<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:52.019> just

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
those little hairs and then I'm just

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:02.170 
those little hairs and then I'm just
going<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.410> start<00:02:52.680> trimming

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.309 

I'd<00:03:03.180> be<00:03:03.299> really<00:03:03.659> careful<00:03:03.989> when<00:03:04.079> you're<00:03:04.200> doing

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
I'd be really careful when you're doing

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.830 
I'd be really careful when you're doing
this<00:03:04.560> not<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.640> get<00:03:05.790> your<00:03:05.939> eyebrows<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.659> don't

your bangs or an even you can go through
I<00:05:07.449> don't<00:05:08.379> suggest<00:05:08.590> using<00:05:09.129> the<00:05:09.370> Clippers<00:05:09.669> after

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
I don't suggest using the Clippers after

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.939 
I don't suggest using the Clippers after
your<00:05:10.240> bangs<00:05:10.449> have<00:05:10.780> been<00:05:10.990> curled<00:05:11.590> under<00:05:11.800> like

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
your bangs have been curled under like

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.619 
your bangs have been curled under like
this<00:05:12.129> because<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:12.940> may<00:05:13.090> have<00:05:13.120> curled

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:13.629 
this because you may have curled

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.330 
this because you may have curled
unevenly<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.229> so<00:05:14.620> when<00:05:14.770> you<00:05:14.860> trim<00:05:15.129> with<00:05:15.280> the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
unevenly and so when you trim with the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.279 
unevenly and so when you trim with the
Clippers<00:05:15.639> you<00:05:15.669> may<00:05:15.879> actually<00:05:16.060> be<00:05:16.289> trimming

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
Clippers you may actually be trimming

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.589 
Clippers you may actually be trimming
your<00:05:17.530> bangs<00:05:17.740> more<00:05:18.400> uneven<00:05:19.030> you<00:05:19.449> can

your bangs more uneven you can

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:20.879 
your bangs more uneven you can

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
definitely go through with scissors if

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.800 
definitely go through with scissors if
you<00:05:20.979> have<00:05:21.159> like<00:05:21.370> weird<00:05:22.030> long<00:05:22.389> hairs<00:05:22.629> or
