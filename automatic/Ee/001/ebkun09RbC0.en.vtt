I think he flukes one still but so like

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.510 
I think he flukes one still but so like
most<00:04:17.540> people<00:04:17.870> after<00:04:18.230> having<00:04:18.380> two<00:04:18.830> half<00:04:19.160> beers

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
just completely lose all motor function

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.310 
just completely lose all motor function
yeah<00:04:25.280> or<00:04:25.520> girls<00:04:26.180> who<00:04:26.300> drink<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.810> neck<00:04:27.050> of<00:04:27.230> a

yeah I'm admiring your trick shots here
where<00:04:35.270> you're<00:04:35.450> kind<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.140> throwing<00:04:36.440> down<00:04:36.920> words

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
where you're kind of throwing down words

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.350 
where you're kind of throwing down words
as<00:04:37.400> fast<00:04:37.640> as<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:37.910> can

putting them in but I've got to explore

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.750 
putting them in but I've got to explore
the<00:04:46.970> physics<00:04:47.510> engine<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:48.200> game<00:04:48.440> just<00:04:48.890> put

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760

the physics engine in this game just put
it<00:04:49.880> through<00:04:49.970> all<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.240> motions<00:04:50.390> and<00:04:50.950> yeah

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
it through all the motions and yeah

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.810 
it through all the motions and yeah
really<00:04:52.100> test<00:04:52.490> it

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
really test it

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.210 
really test it
yeah<00:04:53.660> it's<00:04:54.050> clear<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.290> lot<00:04:54.590> of<00:04:54.710> work<00:04:54.890> went<00:04:55.130> into

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
yeah it's clear a lot of work went into

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.390 
yeah it's clear a lot of work went into
developing<00:04:55.760> this<00:04:55.880> physics<00:04:56.270> engine<00:04:56.620> yeah<00:04:57.620> dude

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
developing this physics engine yeah dude

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.190 
developing this physics engine yeah dude
I<00:04:58.520> almost<00:04:58.910> don't<00:04:59.240> even<00:04:59.390> want<00:04:59.690> to<00:04:59.750> ask<00:04:59.900> this

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
I almost don't even want to ask this

mm-hmm this is not cool yeah you can see
the<00:05:43.910> the<00:05:44.090> computers<00:05:44.480> pretty<00:05:45.260> much<00:05:45.410> trashed

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
the the computers pretty much trashed

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.610 
the the computers pretty much trashed
yeah<00:05:46.790> they're<00:05:47.570> almost<00:05:47.840> as<00:05:48.080> bad<00:05:48.230> as<00:05:48.260> you<00:05:48.500> are

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.660 

you<00:05:51.620> get<00:05:51.770> actually<00:05:52.070> yeah<00:05:52.190> you<00:05:52.220> can<00:05:52.460> shoot

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
you get actually yeah you can shoot

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.060 
you get actually yeah you can shoot
backwards<00:05:53.180> if<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.390> really<00:05:53.600> want<00:05:53.810> can<00:05:54.740> you<00:05:54.770> can

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
backwards if you really want can you can

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.410 
backwards if you really want can you can
you<00:05:55.130> just<00:05:55.310> like<00:05:55.430> drop<00:05:55.730> it<00:05:55.910> right<00:05:55.940> into<00:05:56.300> your

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
you just like drop it right into your

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.860 
you just like drop it right into your
own<00:05:56.600> cup<00:05:57.100> I<00:05:58.100> almost<00:05:58.730> do<00:05:59.150> in<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.480> next<00:05:59.720> shot

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
own cup I almost do in the next shot

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.500 
own cup I almost do in the next shot
okay<00:06:00.530> so<00:06:00.590> what<00:06:01.220> units<00:06:01.670> are<00:06:01.760> those<00:06:02.000> it<00:06:02.210> says<00:06:02.390> you

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
okay so what units are those it says you

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.960
