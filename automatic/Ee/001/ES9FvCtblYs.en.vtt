oh<00:00:12.769> and<00:00:13.769> we've<00:00:13.919> had<00:00:14.039> two<00:00:14.339> new<00:00:14.579> night<00:00:14.820> maps

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
oh and we've had two new night maps

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.200 
oh and we've had two new night maps
appear<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.749> CTE<00:00:16.470> now<00:00:17.099> these<00:00:17.310> are<00:00:17.670> CTE

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
appear on CTE now these are CTE

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.660 
appear on CTE now these are CTE
prototypes<00:00:19.170> which<00:00:19.470> means<00:00:19.740> they<00:00:19.949> are<00:00:20.220> probably

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
prototypes which means they are probably

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.419 
prototypes which means they are probably
months<00:00:21.390> away<00:00:21.720> from<00:00:21.960> releasing<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.099> the<00:00:23.220> live

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.269 
months away from releasing to the live
game<00:00:23.599> so<00:00:24.599> anything<00:00:25.050> that's<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.320> CT<00:00:25.650> prototype

bit of a problem on certain maps even on
the<00:01:18.360> live<00:01:18.600> game<00:01:19.250> vehicles<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.490> have

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the live game vehicles now have

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.300 
the live game vehicles now have
headlights<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.600> taillights<00:01:21.900> although<00:01:22.860> not

the<00:01:28.200> jets<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:28.620> helicopters<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:29.340> well<00:01:29.690> but<00:01:30.690> it

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the jets and helicopters as well but it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.290 
the jets and helicopters as well but it
is<00:01:31.020> looking<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:31.620> good<00:01:32.190> it's<00:01:32.490> still<00:01:32.850> quite

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
is looking very good it's still quite

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.380 
is looking very good it's still quite
bright<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.200> map<00:01:34.440> at<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.650> moment<00:01:35.390> but

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
bright on this map at the moment but

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.180 
bright on this map at the moment but
dice<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.900> realized<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.740> moon<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
dice have realized that the moon is a

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.740 
dice have realized that the moon is a
bit<00:01:38.490> bright<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.150> are<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> be

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
bit bright and they are going to be

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
bit bright and they are going to be
working<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.860> problem<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> moon

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
working on it the problem with the moon

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
working on it the problem with the moon
is<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.300> if<00:01:42.450> they<00:01:42.750> treat<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> single

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
is that if they treat it is a single

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.800 
is that if they treat it is a single
light<00:01:44.220> source<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.940> it<00:01:45.060> has<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.510> quite

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
light source then it has to be quite

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620 
light source then it has to be quite
bright<00:01:46.229> because<00:01:47.010> it's<00:01:47.520> designed<00:01:48.120> to<00:01:48.240> model

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
bright because it's designed to model

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
bright because it's designed to model
the<00:01:48.780> Sun<00:01:49.140> instead<00:01:50.010> what<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:50.820> need<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.270> is

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the Sun instead what they need to do is

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.810 
the Sun instead what they need to do is
a<00:01:51.510> more<00:01:51.810> diffused<00:01:52.440> all<00:01:52.799> over<00:01:53.280> light<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
a more diffused all over light and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.450 
a more diffused all over light and
that's<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:54.540> they're<00:01:54.750> working

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
that's what they're working

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.840 
that's what they're working
on<00:01:55.640> this<00:01:56.000> CTA<00:01:56.479> build<00:01:57.159> they've<00:01:58.159> added<00:01:58.490> quite<00:01:58.820> a

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
on this CTA build they've added quite a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.760 
on this CTA build they've added quite a
bit<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.240> mist<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.720> fog<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.320> map<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:00.740> well

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
bit of mist and fog to the map as well

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.430 
bit of mist and fog to the map as well
and<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.460> diffuse<00:02:01.970> lighting<00:02:02.299> along<00:02:03.140> with<00:02:03.350> the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
and that diffuse lighting along with the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.080 
and that diffuse lighting along with the
mist<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:03.800> fog<00:02:04.010> is<00:02:04.369> what's<00:02:04.640> causing

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
mist and fog is what's causing

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.600 
mist and fog is what's causing
everything<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:06.140> look<00:02:06.320> very<00:02:06.350> gray<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.369> washed

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
everything to look very gray and washed

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.359 
everything to look very gray and washed
out<00:02:07.909> but<00:02:08.539> hopefully<00:02:09.319> that<00:02:09.560> will<00:02:09.679> be<00:02:09.740> sorted<00:02:10.100> in

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
out but hopefully that will be sorted in

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.130 
out but hopefully that will be sorted in
the<00:02:10.459> next<00:02:10.729> past<00:02:11.000> when<00:02:11.300> they<00:02:11.480> sort<00:02:11.750> out<00:02:11.959> and

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
the next past when they sort out and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.430 
the next past when they sort out and
moon<00:02:12.700> but<00:02:13.700> as<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.000> first<00:02:14.360> pass<00:02:14.630> at<00:02:14.690> Goldman<00:02:15.290> at

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440

moon but as a first pass at Goldman at
night<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.489> really<00:02:16.760> impressive<00:02:17.300> they've

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
night this is really impressive they've

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.020 
night this is really impressive they've
obviously<00:02:18.080> learned<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.739> lot<00:02:18.980> from<00:02:19.040> doing<00:02:19.700> siege

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
obviously learned a lot from doing siege

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.449 
obviously learned a lot from doing siege
of<00:02:20.209> Shanghai<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.020> gold<00:02:21.950> was<00:02:22.130> looking<00:02:22.430> very

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
of Shanghai and gold was looking very

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.449 
of Shanghai and gold was looking very
nice<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:24.050> second<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.560> new<00:02:24.709> night<00:02:24.950> maps<00:02:25.220> is

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
nice the second of the new night maps is

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.960 
nice the second of the new night maps is
about<00:02:26.090> 311<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.140> again<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:27.800> map<00:02:28.100> has<00:02:28.370> no<00:02:28.730> name

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
about 311 and again this map has no name

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.330 
about 311 and again this map has no name
yet<00:02:29.239> but<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:30.050> does<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.590> same<00:02:30.769> problems

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
yet but it does have the same problems

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.580 
yet but it does have the same problems
with<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.670> moon<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:32.840> washing<00:02:33.260> out

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
with the moon in that it's washing out

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.040 
with the moon in that it's washing out
all<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.190> backgrounds<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.120> it's<00:02:35.570> turning<00:02:35.840> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
all the backgrounds and it's turning the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.380 
all the backgrounds and it's turning the
mist<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.410> fog<00:02:36.650> effects<00:02:37.070> into<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.459> strange<00:02:37.910> gray

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
mist and fog effects into a strange gray

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.560 
mist and fog effects into a strange gray
filter<00:02:39.110> but<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.980> map<00:02:40.190> itself<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.850> looking

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
filter but the map itself is looking

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.830 
filter but the map itself is looking
really<00:02:41.870> good<00:02:42.610> closing<00:02:43.610> all<00:02:44.120> those<00:02:44.450> effects

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
really good closing all those effects

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.530 
really good closing all those effects
disappear<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:46.130> it's<00:02:46.550> really<00:02:47.000> when<00:02:47.390> you're

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
disappear so it's really when you're

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.810 
disappear so it's really when you're
looking<00:02:47.959> at<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.350> panorama<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.400> see<00:02:49.640> the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
looking at the panorama that you see the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.880 
looking at the panorama that you see the
problems<00:02:50.390> when<00:02:50.989> you're<00:02:51.110> actually<00:02:51.230> playing<00:02:51.650> on

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
problems when you're actually playing on

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.100 
problems when you're actually playing on
it<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.250> doesn't<00:02:52.910> look<00:02:52.970> as<00:02:53.269> bad<00:02:53.330> as<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.840> does

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
it it doesn't look as bad as it does

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.699 
it it doesn't look as bad as it does
when<00:02:54.620> you've<00:02:54.860> got<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.220> larger<00:02:55.700> view<00:02:55.940> distance

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
when you've got a larger view distance

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.870 
when you've got a larger view distance
but<00:02:57.709> I'm<00:02:57.769> not<00:02:57.890> going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.069> go<00:02:58.220> into<00:02:58.340> what<00:02:58.640> these

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
but I'm not going to go into what these

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.970 
but I'm not going to go into what these
maps<00:02:59.209> play<00:02:59.570> like<00:02:59.840> until<00:03:00.440> they've<00:03:00.680> actually

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
maps play like until they've actually

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.520 
maps play like until they've actually
gone<00:03:01.430> through<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.970> couple<00:03:02.329> of<00:03:02.540> iterations<00:03:02.720> as

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
gone through a couple of iterations as

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.949 
gone through a couple of iterations as
we<00:03:03.950> saw<00:03:04.130> on<00:03:04.340> siege<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.820> Shanghai<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:05.750> map

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
we saw on siege of Shanghai the map

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.229 
we saw on siege of Shanghai the map
changed<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.560> great<00:03:06.590> deal<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.549> between<00:03:08.000> its

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
changed a great deal in between its

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.020 
changed a great deal in between its
first<00:03:08.570> versions<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.380> what<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:10.160> now<00:03:10.370> its<00:03:10.579> 10th

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
first versions and what is now its 10th

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.050 
first versions and what is now its 10th
version<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:12.380> all<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.070> do<00:03:13.489> is<00:03:13.519> give<00:03:13.910> you<00:03:14.030> a

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
version so all I do is give you a

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.210 
version so all I do is give you a
general<00:03:14.239> overview<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:15.170> what<00:03:15.380> these<00:03:15.560> maps<00:03:15.890> look

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
general overview of what these maps look

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.449 
general overview of what these maps look
like<00:03:16.549> how<00:03:17.090> they<00:03:17.329> feel<00:03:17.660> I'm<00:03:18.410> not<00:03:19.040> going<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.310> go

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
like how they feel I'm not going to go

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.370 
like how they feel I'm not going to go
into<00:03:19.579> how<00:03:19.850> they<00:03:20.060> play<00:03:20.390> until<00:03:20.959> they've<00:03:21.170> gone

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
into how they play until they've gone

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.710 
into how they play until they've gone
through<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.890> few<00:03:22.010> more<00:03:22.489> changes<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.299> they've

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
through a few more changes and they've

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.370 
through a few more changes and they've
sorted<00:03:24.170> out<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.380> moon<00:03:24.829> and<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.130> mist<00:03:25.640> effects

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
sorted out the moon and the mist effects

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.350 
sorted out the moon and the mist effects
but<00:03:27.380> what<00:03:27.530> these<00:03:27.739> two<00:03:28.040> new<00:03:28.310> maps<00:03:28.519> do<00:03:28.880> show<00:03:29.150> is

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
but what these two new maps do show is

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.750 
but what these two new maps do show is
the<00:03:29.780> amount<00:03:30.079> of<00:03:30.350> work<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.920> takes<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.519> actually

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
the amount of work it takes to actually

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.600 
the amount of work it takes to actually
get<00:03:32.150> these<00:03:32.390> night<00:03:32.660> maps<00:03:32.959> up<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.500> running<00:03:33.890> so

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
get these night maps up and running so

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.060 
get these night maps up and running so
doing<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.180> simple<00:03:35.450> passive<00:03:36.200> just<00:03:36.440> changing<00:03:36.950> it

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
doing a simple passive just changing it

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.400 
doing a simple passive just changing it
from<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.790> Sun<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.329> moon<00:03:38.660> from<00:03:39.019> day<00:03:39.350> to

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
from the Sun to the moon from day to

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.990 
from the Sun to the moon from day to
night<00:03:40.150> doesn't<00:03:41.150> make<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.570> maps<00:03:41.840> work<00:03:43.000> every

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
night doesn't make the maps work every

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.180 
night doesn't make the maps work every
piece<00:03:44.209> of<00:03:44.239> lighting<00:03:44.989> on<00:03:45.140> these<00:03:45.470> maps<00:03:45.769> has<00:03:45.980> had

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
piece of lighting on these maps has had

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.880 
piece of lighting on these maps has had
to<00:03:46.340> be<00:03:46.489> rebuilt<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.660> all<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.140> lighting<00:03:48.410> towers

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
to be rebuilt so all the lighting towers

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.979 
to be rebuilt so all the lighting towers
are<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.609> lights<00:03:49.820> inside<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.480> building's

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
are the lights inside the building's

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
pretty good I think once they get the

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.810 
pretty good I think once they get the
moon<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.470> moon<00:04:26.530> light<00:04:26.950> set<00:04:27.280> just<00:04:27.640> right

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820
