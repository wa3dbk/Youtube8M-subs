hey guys now we're gonna tackle Stone
Hill<00:00:02.490> which<00:00:02.760> is<00:00:03.290> essentially<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.410> first

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
Hill which is essentially the first

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.280 
Hill which is essentially the first
level<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.220> game<00:00:05.600> it's<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.690> one<00:00:07.140> that's

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
level of the game it's the one that's

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.480 
level of the game it's the one that's
mostly<00:00:07.950> shown<00:00:08.309> off<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.210> though<00:00:10.490> well

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
mostly shown off and this is though well

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.759 
mostly shown off and this is though well
the<00:00:12.030> whole<00:00:12.210> demo<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.900> Spyro<00:00:13.230> featured<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
the whole demo of Spyro featured the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.620 
the whole demo of Spyro featured the
whole<00:00:13.920> first<00:00:14.250> area<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.940> think<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.360> can<00:00:15.509> do

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
whole first area I think you can do

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.810 
whole first area I think you can do
anything<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:16.020> playing<00:00:16.410> toasty<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.190> know<00:00:17.580> if

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
anything but playing toasty I know if

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.519 
anything but playing toasty I know if
you<00:00:17.880> do<00:00:18.000> town<00:00:18.330> square<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.320> this

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
you do town square and I think this

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.950 
you do town square and I think this
level<00:00:19.910> which<00:00:20.910> actually<00:00:21.210> seems<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.510> lot<00:00:21.750> I

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
level which actually seems like a lot I

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.330 
level which actually seems like a lot I
don't<00:00:22.199> remember<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.560> demo<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.949> play

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
don't remember what the demo is play

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.980 
don't remember what the demo is play
crash<00:00:23.670> 3<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.390> actually<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> demo

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
crash 3 and you can actually have a demo

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.170 
crash 3 and you can actually have a demo
of<00:00:25.140> spire<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.920> pretty<00:00:26.400> neat<00:00:26.699> they<00:00:27.060> had

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
of spire which is pretty neat they had

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.630 
of spire which is pretty neat they had
such<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> nice<00:00:27.689> relationship<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:29.310> would<00:00:29.460> have

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
such a nice relationship you would have

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.749 
such a nice relationship you would have
crash<00:00:30.330> 3<00:00:30.779> crash<00:00:31.230> team<00:00:31.470> racing<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.070> crash<00:00:32.369> bash

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
crash 3 crash team racing and crash bash

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.630 
crash 3 crash team racing and crash bash
and<00:00:33.230> Spyro<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.500> two<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.829> three<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.489> each

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and Spyro one two and three and in each

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.040 
and Spyro one two and three and in each
of<00:00:35.730> those<00:00:35.850> games<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.329> would<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> demo<00:00:36.899> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
of those games you would have a demo of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.479 
of those games you would have a demo of
the<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.590> released<00:00:37.800> close<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the one that was released close to the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.910 
the one that was released close to the
same<00:00:38.700> time<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> lot<00:00:40.230> better<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.800> having

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
same time it was a lot better for having

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.280 
same time it was a lot better for having
crash<00:00:41.370> games<00:00:41.670> because<00:00:42.120> having<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> demo<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
crash games because having a demo of a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.000 
crash games because having a demo of a
full<00:00:44.120> action-adventure<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.300> spiral<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.710> lot

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
full action-adventure of spiral is a lot

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.950 
full action-adventure of spiral is a lot
better<00:00:47.250> than<00:00:47.399> having<00:00:47.520> crash<00:00:48.329> three<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.750> one

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
better than having crash three in one

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.690 
better than having crash three in one
game<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.770> game<00:00:49.829> there's<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> crash<00:00:50.460> loot

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
game in this game there's a crash loot

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.479 
game in this game there's a crash loot
demo<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.989> spiral<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.250> spire

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
demo and then in spiral and the spire

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.920 
demo and then in spiral and the spire
two<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.820> three<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> racing<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
two and three you have a racing and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
two and three you have a racing and
minigames<00:00:56.690> yeah<00:00:58.160> now<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.370> passed<00:00:59.879> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
locked chest that is basically we are

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.609 
locked chest that is basically we are
there's<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> key<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.840> level<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.439> need

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
there's a key in this level and we need

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.929 
there's a key in this level and we need
to<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> find<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.610> bring<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.909> back

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
to need to find it and bring it back

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.590 
to need to find it and bring it back
down<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:08.280> levels<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.180> level<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
down there the levels like this level is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.230 
down there the levels like this level is
actually<00:01:09.900> really<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.409> small<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.909> levels

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
actually really really small the levels

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.969 
actually really really small the levels
actually<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:12.930> pretty<00:01:13.229> huge<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
actually got to be pretty huge and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.130 
actually got to be pretty huge and
especially<00:01:14.960> tree-tops

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
especially tree-tops

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.200 
especially tree-tops
is<00:01:16.439> probably<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> biggest<00:01:17.070> level<00:01:17.400> we're

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
is probably the biggest level we're

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.530 
is probably the biggest level we're
actually<00:01:18.420> playing<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.560> treetops<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.540> that's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
actually playing on treetops and that's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.780 
actually playing on treetops and that's
really<00:01:21.780> annoying<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.650> that's<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.580> until

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
really annoying but that's not until

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.390 
really annoying but that's not until
later<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> game<00:01:24.560> we<00:01:25.560> rescued<00:01:25.890> Linda<00:01:26.250> our

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
later in the game we rescued Linda our

no doubt in my mind that I think the

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.809 
no doubt in my mind that I think the
PlayStation<00:04:43.770> did<00:04:43.949> totally<00:04:44.340> better<00:04:44.520> than<00:04:44.610> the

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
PlayStation did totally better than the

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.059 
PlayStation did totally better than the
n64<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.659> had<00:04:45.779> so<00:04:46.050> many<00:04:46.259> better<00:04:46.529> games<00:04:46.860> the

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
n64 it had so many better games the

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:48.709 
n64 it had so many better games the
graphics<00:04:47.550> actually<00:04:47.909> didn't<00:04:48.180> seem<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.569> they

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
graphics actually didn't seem that they

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.119 
graphics actually didn't seem that they
were<00:04:48.779> holding<00:04:49.050> up<00:04:49.259> to<00:04:49.349> the<00:04:49.379> potential<00:04:49.800> of<00:04:50.009> the

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
were holding up to the potential of the

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.719 
were holding up to the potential of the
64<00:04:51.289> but<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.439> games<00:04:52.710> are<00:04:53.069> just<00:04:53.249> there<00:04:53.550> the

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
64 but the games are just there the

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.100 
64 but the games are just there the
games<00:04:53.909> are<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.090> lot<00:04:54.240> more<00:04:54.270> memorable<00:04:54.750> at<00:04:54.930> least

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
games are a lot more memorable at least

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.709

in<00:04:55.229> my<00:04:55.349> opinion<00:04:55.529> that's<00:04:56.419> probably<00:04:57.419> different

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
in my opinion that's probably different

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:59.990 
in my opinion that's probably different
for<00:04:57.870> all<00:04:57.960> everyone<00:04:58.289> else<00:04:58.469> oh<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:59.520> just<00:04:59.669> need<00:04:59.909> to

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
hell is that

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.950 
hell is that
stupid<00:05:23.550> portal<00:05:23.909> because<00:05:24.330> we're<00:05:24.599> gonna<00:05:24.749> get

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
stupid portal because we're gonna get

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.070 
stupid portal because we're gonna get
out<00:05:25.139> of<00:05:25.289> here<00:05:26.240> and<00:05:27.240> we're<00:05:27.659> actually<00:05:27.750> going<00:05:27.990> to

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
out of here and we're actually going to

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.140 
out of here and we're actually going to
go<00:05:28.199> back<00:05:28.439> because<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:28.889> think<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.610> thing<00:05:29.939> I<00:05:30.060> was

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
go back because I think the thing I was

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.490 
go back because I think the thing I was
trying<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:30.330> do<00:05:30.419> before<00:05:30.750> with<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.020> pedestal

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
trying to do before with the pedestal

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.679 
trying to do before with the pedestal
should<00:05:31.740> be<00:05:31.830> open<00:05:32.129> right<00:05:32.159> now<00:05:32.310> which<00:05:33.270> leads<00:05:33.569> to

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689 
should be open right now which leads to

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.019 
should be open right now which leads to
a<00:05:33.810> flying<00:05:34.289> minigame<00:05:34.979> which<00:05:35.250> you'll<00:05:35.460> see<00:05:35.849> later

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029 
a flying minigame which you'll see later

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.189 
a flying minigame which you'll see later
on<00:05:37.639> that's<00:05:38.639> probably<00:05:38.969> the<00:05:39.149> last<00:05:39.360> objective<00:05:40.080> I

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
on that's probably the last objective I

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.689 
on that's probably the last objective I
do<00:05:40.259> in<00:05:40.589> this<00:05:40.680> homeworld<00:05:41.099> but<00:05:41.279> I<00:05:41.310> want<00:05:41.520> to<00:05:41.580> see
