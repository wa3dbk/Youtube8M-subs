00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.600
 Hello 

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:13.250
 in this video 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.640
 I want to show you that you have a 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.530
 the reader of the pagseguro and sometimes have 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.940
 claimed that the voter gives an error 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.110
 It is very wrong when you make the 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:29.210
 but you want to demonstrate that the error 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:30.910
 is not a common mistake that will prevent 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.350
 Do you make sales? 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.309
 so here I am with this reader of the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.309
 Pays insurance is good. 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.139
 the letter of the pagseguro and where I used it in the 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.780
 smartphone 

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:47.559
 when you will be ironing your 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.799
 credit for this voter that will happen 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.519
 automatically it will give an error is 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.839
 you win again it will make a mistake again 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.019
 if he passes the card again he will give 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.229
 too much wrong you can not 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.270
 make your sale 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:08.270
 but I discovered a simple way 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:12.020
 If I give it to you on my device, in case 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.410
 smartphone is fine and if I give it that 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.290
 problem and you follow me here on 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.990
 computer screen that started recording 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.640
 alone did not have conditions to use 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.540
 equipment that this camera is 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.260
 here you are seeing on the screen of your 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.390
 computer here until a sale is scheduled 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:39.320
 in case it will be digital value 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.060
 Then you go and ask for it. 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.590
 put the reader 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.650
 There you program it on this little screen here. 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.420
 How many times do you want to be seen? 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:57.380
 Okay , you 'll give it a go , you 'll give it 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.840
 card you just do not pass the card on the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.159
 The first time I go back here, 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.430
 same screen that everything was programmed 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:13.209
 even though you spoke with the numbers 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.209
 You come and give it okay. 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.220
 will ask you to pass the card 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.620
 right now you can 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.030
 pass the card that your sale will be 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.130
 made without error 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.830
 How many times do you want to make the sale? 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.440
 you do this function 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.660
 will be all right and you will not stay 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.190
 more upset with the unit is good 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.930
 see a lot of head to make 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.800
 this same iphone running device 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.560
 I sent the device back there, people who 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.050
 I sold him that is in the case PagSeguro 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.610
 and even sent the device back, but with 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.360
 the error continues until you discover this 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.580
 business 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.410
 so let's recap that I'm using 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.590
 a device with android is fine 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.270

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.730

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:07.790
 computer you will get the following 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.080

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.260
 put here the value you want 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.260
 sell 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.410
 there is so much that you can fit this device 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.150
 up here at the moment if you do not 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.360

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.950
 Here you come, it's a good device, you? 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.989

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.040
 in installment 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.510
 you decide and remember you do not need 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.980
 with this unit being placed on top 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.650
 It's still not good, it's you in a click. 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.989
 He sends you up there and you pass the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.910
 right card make card 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.370
 if you insist on passing the card 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.720
 now it's going to happen and you're not going 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.010
 able to make the sale with the client 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.730
 you get nervous 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:02.239
 so what you do is you are here 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:05.150

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.290

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.610
 change that you will have down here in your 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.750

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:22.430
 Well, it started to show on the screen 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.850
 computer can not really hold me then there 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.530
 You press ok, you talk about your card. 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.050
 that's exactly where you pass the card 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.940
 at this moment it was 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.900

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.570

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.880

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.140
 He has to send the card and you do not 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.990
 you pass back in the same line of 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.540
 Your device comes back to you. 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.210
 Then when you 're on that screen are you? 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.090
 give an ok again then he'll fall into this 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.380
 earth were you pass the card you can 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.210

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.550
 Good, it's a hug for you in 1783 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.880
 a touch for you that has a reader of the 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.680
 because I suffered a lot from the 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.240
 how to make my sale the 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.770
 device is very wrong 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.060
 I still could not get away from here. 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.230
 from above and ends up spoiling his 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.050
 smartphone 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.620
 so if you do this procedure 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.530
 you can make lots of sales and 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.440
 without passing nervous jewelry because it will not 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.960
 give a hug to you spoke in 1783 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.450

 It's about the reader's pay insurance is a good one. 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.590
 It's a device he would not do 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.090
 no but you have to learn how to use 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.090
 A big hug, see you later
