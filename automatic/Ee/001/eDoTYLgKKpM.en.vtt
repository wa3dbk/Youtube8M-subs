00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
starting off on this battle i saw that
he<00:00:48.870> did<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> altar<00:00:49.680> lyst<00:00:49.890> portrait<00:00:50.280> so

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
he did have the altar lyst portrait so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.450 
he did have the altar lyst portrait so
he's<00:00:50.910> been<00:00:51.149> playing<00:00:51.360> lots<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.920> zerg<00:00:52.920> vs<00:00:53.309> our

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
he's been playing lots of zerg vs our

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
he's been playing lots of zerg vs our
game<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.780> off<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> bat<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.469> kind<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
game so right off the bat I was kind of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.500 
game so right off the bat I was kind of
scared<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> don't<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:56.879> how<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.270> battle

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
scared so I don't see how this battle

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.139 
scared so I don't see how this battle
ends<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:59.219> we'll<00:00:59.399> probably<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.760> do

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
ends up going so we'll probably just do

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.810 
ends up going so we'll probably just do
I<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.379> thinking<00:01:01.500> maybe<00:01:01.800> he's<00:01:02.100> got<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.609> many

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I I was thinking maybe he's got so many

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
I I was thinking maybe he's got so many
wins<00:01:03.120> because<00:01:03.300> he<00:01:03.570> does<00:01:03.690> lots<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.049> Russia's

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
wins because he does lots of Russia's

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.460 
wins because he does lots of Russia's
but<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.710> doesn't<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.010> make<00:01:05.549> win<00:01:05.850> so

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
but that doesn't really make win so

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.510 
but that doesn't really make win so
that's<00:01:07.470> kind<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.710> scared<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> went

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
that's kind of scared so I think I went

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.270 
that's kind of scared so I think I went
for<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.729> better<00:01:08.850> 12<00:01:09.360> cool<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:09.960> we'll<00:01:10.110> see<00:01:10.350> I'm

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
for a better 12 cool but we'll see I'm

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.640 
for a better 12 cool but we'll see I'm
sending<00:01:11.610> my<00:01:11.640> Overlord<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
sending my Overlord now more in the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.440 
sending my Overlord now more in the
servers<00:01:14.040> deserve<00:01:14.280> battle<00:01:14.700> more<00:01:15.060> into<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
servers deserve battle more into the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
servers deserve battle more into the
middle<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> path<00:01:16.590> wave<00:01:16.860> where<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:17.220> come

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
middle of the path wave where they come

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.370 
middle of the path wave where they come
across<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.960> when<00:01:19.200> they're

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
across just so I can see when they're

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.679 
across just so I can see when they're
going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.860> coming<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.430> attacking<00:01:20.580> me<00:01:21.119> so

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
going to be coming and attacking me so

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.270 
going to be coming and attacking me so
here<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> could<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:22.979> put<00:01:23.189> down

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
here I could see that you just put down

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.300 
here I could see that you just put down
a<00:01:23.340> spawning<00:01:23.729> pool<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.630> 12<00:01:24.990> cool<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.530> he's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.620 
little late on spawning pool but I don't
think<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.880> make<00:01:33.030> too<00:01:33.210> much<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
think that's going to make too much of a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.929 
think that's going to make too much of a
difference<00:01:33.960> right<00:01:34.259> now<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.700> got<00:01:35.850> in

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
difference right now so I just got in

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.300 
difference right now so I just got in
his<00:01:36.060> base<00:01:36.210> didn't<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.869> see<00:01:37.079> too<00:01:37.350> much<00:01:37.650> just

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
his base didn't really see too much just

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.240 
his base didn't really see too much just
a<00:01:38.460> spawning<00:01:38.729> pool<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.960> extractor<00:01:40.770> really

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
a spawning pool the extractor really

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550 
a spawning pool the extractor really
nothing<00:01:41.579> much<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.090> he's<00:01:42.210> getting<00:01:42.560> he's

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
nothing much going I he's getting he's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.100 
nothing much going I he's getting he's
actually<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> be<00:01:44.100> getting<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.549> queen<00:01:45.420> out

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
actually going to be getting a queen out

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.859 
actually going to be getting a queen out
and<00:01:46.590> looking<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:47.640> production<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.840> really

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and looking at production not not really

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
and looking at production not not really
too<00:01:49.290> much<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.799> I'm<00:01:50.340> probably<00:01:50.610> hopefully

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
too much going on I'm probably hopefully

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.969 
too much going on I'm probably hopefully

because<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> last<00:01:56.610> couple<00:01:56.820> games<00:01:57.030> that

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
because on the last couple games that

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.060 
because on the last couple games that
i've<00:01:57.420> been<00:01:57.450> playing<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.079> didn't<00:01:58.770> make<00:01:58.920> enough

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
i've been playing I didn't make enough

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.810 
i've been playing I didn't make enough
drones<00:01:59.520> and

drones and

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.220 
drones and
it<00:02:01.120> really<00:02:01.480> sucks<00:02:01.780> when<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:01.990> don't<00:02:02.110> make

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
it really sucks when you don't make

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.760 
it really sucks when you don't make
enough<00:02:02.440> rounds<00:02:02.760> such<00:02:03.760> a<00:02:03.790> pathetic<00:02:04.000> floss

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
enough rounds such a pathetic floss

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.790 
enough rounds such a pathetic floss
anyways<00:02:05.770> we<00:02:06.220> can<00:02:06.430> see<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:07.590> he's<00:02:08.590> actually

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
anyways we can see that he's actually

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.680 
anyways we can see that he's actually
gonna<00:02:09.070> be<00:02:09.220> getting<00:02:09.490> some<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.179> tablet<00:02:10.479> boost

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
gonna be getting some the tablet boost

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.550 
gonna be getting some the tablet boost

should go for zerglings to mu list or if

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
should go for zerglings to mu list or if
I<00:02:20.260> stress<00:02:20.560> go<00:02:20.800> for<00:02:21.280> roaches<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:23.350> we'll<00:02:23.860> see<00:02:24.040> i'm

I stress go for roaches so we'll see i'm

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.040 
I stress go for roaches so we'll see i'm
actually<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.580> good<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.300> get<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.630> second

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
actually a good to get a second

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
well and i'm getting muting my hat tree

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.199 
well and i'm getting muting my hat tree
into<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.660> layer<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.709> case<00:02:35.890> um<00:02:36.250> see<00:02:37.060> what

into a layer just in case um see what

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.790 
into a layer just in case um see what
happens<00:02:37.540> he<00:02:37.690> actually<00:02:37.840> has<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.110> lahzar<00:02:38.530> cleans

right now back to production I'm going
to<00:02:49.330> be<00:02:49.420> building<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.750> lot<00:02:49.870> more<00:02:50.020> germs<00:02:50.290> than<00:02:50.380> he

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
to be building a lot more germs than he

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.710 
to be building a lot more germs than he
is<00:02:50.739> at<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.040> moment<00:02:51.430> but<00:02:51.760> he<00:02:52.000> has<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.480> many

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
is at the moment but he has so many

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.740 
is at the moment but he has so many
Earthlings<00:02:53.260> right<00:02:53.470> now<00:02:53.760> whoa<00:02:54.760> those<00:02:55.540> are<00:02:55.600> a

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
Earthlings right now whoa those are a

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.210 
Earthlings right now whoa those are a
lot<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.080> zerglings<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.800> don't<00:02:56.920> know<00:02:57.010> what<00:02:57.100> he's

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
lot of zerglings I don't know what he's

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.650 
lot of zerglings I don't know what he's
doing<00:02:57.400> there<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.610> guess<00:02:57.820> he<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:57.940> stopped<00:02:58.390> take

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
doing there I guess he just stopped take

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.710 
doing there I guess he just stopped take
a<00:02:58.690> little<00:02:58.870> break<00:03:00.269> but<00:03:01.269> that's<00:03:01.450> all<00:03:01.690> the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
a little break but that's all the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.080 
a little break but that's all the
surface<00:03:02.140> because<00:03:02.410> i<00:03:02.530> have<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.160> i<00:03:03.489> decided<00:03:03.820> i

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
surface because i have and i decided i

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.210 
surface because i have and i decided i
had<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.360> lot<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.660> minerals<00:03:04.959> so<00:03:05.440> i<00:03:05.680> decided<00:03:06.100> to

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
had a lot of minerals so i decided to

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.140 
had a lot of minerals so i decided to
put<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.400> battery<00:03:06.660> but<00:03:07.660> um<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:09.580> looks<00:03:09.610> like<00:03:09.940> his

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
put a battery but um it looks like his

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.080 
put a battery but um it looks like his
arm<00:03:10.360> he's<00:03:10.540> actually<00:03:10.720> quite<00:03:10.959> bigger<00:03:11.230> than<00:03:11.410> mine

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
arm he's actually quite bigger than mine

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.020
