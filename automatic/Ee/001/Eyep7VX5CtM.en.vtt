00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.970
 lots and oat pis welcome to all 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.760
 pokemon trainers 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 today I am going for a request 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.859
 to a question with a short video in 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.910
 difficulty in sion where everything you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.289
 will call it a little like you 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.599
 so I want to take advantage of it for me 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.489
 ask how are you me it's going 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.180
 I have fishing and so we will go 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.149
 directly on gts then for you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.050
 ensure you have an internet connection 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:46.399
 even a certain precisely because I 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.399
 see where I come from 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.250
 it takes a bit then 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.140
 here's once you're done 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.250
 going to say is you're going back 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.250
 directly in the jt s 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.060
 here you go, you 're a pokemon 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.330
 then that you directly from the boxes 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.930
 pokemon 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.930
 if the earth 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.490
 exchange is then usually what 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.040
 works well I noticed online 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.320
 it is to exchange pokemon the 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.070
 starter startups usually a lot 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.880
 rawbank and and for the most part 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.540
 they leave to those who 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.690
 participate 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:58.659
 for example here with filed for example 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.670
 we see your exchange be done in 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.630
 immediately 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:08.810
 not bad starter near evolution 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.239
 which puts serve as currency of exchange 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.340
 to see the day then here we go 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.349
 look for a guest yesterday because I 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.150
 can not yet so I drop you off 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:23.239
 I'm going to drop precisely so here is 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.380
 you searched for you targeted the 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.360
 alphabets of the beginning of pokemon here you 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.180
 see that there is no crowd yesterday we have 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.090
 make the return 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.970
 and that's all and then we'll go I 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.660
 seized obviously help you on 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.569
 Internet 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.370
 I had plenty of sites 1 to write 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.090
 correctly spelling the pokemon to 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.630
 the shadow it's not the uppercase 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.030
 when you write here it's empty 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.799
 beyer you know when spelling 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.069
 is not perfect but here I think 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.450
 that even if he put ok that's it 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.069
 the computer or correct then once 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.340
 that you put an entry you do not have 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.430
 not obviously the choice of sex option or 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.930
 still bursine you like but she what 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.850
 that we do not choose it 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.040
 and put conditions on it then 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.160
 I'll put a nice little message to you 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.519
 I put a little message of and a 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.660
 lina girl rose to do 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.900
 understand that I would like to have a 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:32.600
 pokemon it works or it does not work it 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.239
 because they are so afraid then here 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.600
 so once all this is done that 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.570
 you wrote them will be sets disjointed 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.140
 with the requested criteria then change 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.140
 knows himself 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:01.900
 the valley then here the harm they get 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.760
 were pulling in the gts and your 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.629
 operation is complete simply more 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.840
 than wait 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:11.800
