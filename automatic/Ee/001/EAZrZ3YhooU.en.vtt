00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.070
 google chrome and 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:21.140
 the rules are far from going 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.310
 I guess I'm missing you soothe 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:36.230
 Yes exactly 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:38.910
 go everything is ready everything is unlikely 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.550
 unsaline mystery dancing is not difficult to put 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.470
 because it seems to me that while there is a 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.260
 absolutely 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.520
 teamwork and not that not difficult 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.600
 very interesting the whole process 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 coming up with ideas 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.550
 emotions are able to dance we will try 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.269
 think together we are cooking now 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.710
 quick step 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:07.050
 and we have the image of a celentano, I personally am far away 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.120
 and Ornella Muti tapes 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.980
 but we are terrible so shabby they are beautiful 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.970
 but I would honestly I would have a quick-step 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.860
 I wanted to dance that is probably in exactly 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.110
 perekida pins shoes and topped 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.299
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.790
 ta but maybe mary poppins maybe 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.549
 Well, something is fabulous because 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.110
 quick step for me it is very difficult dance 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.570
 of all that i had here i 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.090
 complained and even really do not understand 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.159
 that even my makeup and hairstyle aren't 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.500
 need to do because I have already peeled off 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.479
 15 seconds before the mystery goes 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.790
 when you are now running at full strength and 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:00.750
 two things i hear 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.750
 bottom down makes such 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:13.900
 the top part is funny well actually 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.239
 despite the fact that he is very complex physical 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.250
 dance and we really want to be 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:26.260
 off on it to get here is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:27.489
 the pleasure of fire wood and e 100 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.660
 percent canvases i 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.450
 I would survive at the beginning of the tin 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.970
 support for the center I thought up myself not 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.540
 didnâ€™t agree after me too 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.870
 must sin not to agree 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:03:05.769
 support such who dream at all 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:03:08.519
 any support sure that you have 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.519
 everything will work out 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:45.520
 try just that forever 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.750

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.170
 just support 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.790

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.120
 what people are really for us 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.610
 worried because they are attentive 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.560
 watching all our dances 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.450
 they notice the details they notice even 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.740
 such details are couture and none see 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.310
 the jury and so for us 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.680
 for me the most pleasant thing for me 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.290
