00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
different disciplines what we need to do

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.150 
different disciplines what we need to do
is<00:00:51.930> project<00:00:52.379> teams<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.920> provide<00:00:53.610> management<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
is project teams is provide management a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.470 
is project teams is provide management a
number<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> decisions<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.940> scenarios

number of decisions and scenarios

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.349 
number of decisions and scenarios
because<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.199> take<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> drug<00:00:58.680> forward<00:00:59.190> in

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
because you can take a drug forward in

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.240 
because you can take a drug forward in
hundreds<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.449> different<00:01:00.570> directions<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:02.100> we

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
hundreds of different directions but we

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.979 
hundreds of different directions but we
want<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> present<00:01:02.640> them<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.030> three<00:01:03.660> or<00:01:03.780> four

want to present them with three or four
or<00:01:04.140> five<00:01:04.350> options<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.510> try<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> give<00:01:07.290> them

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
or five options and we try to give them

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500

all the information that they need to

coming in on a regular basis and you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.859 
coming in on a regular basis and you
have<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.710> assess<00:01:20.009> okay<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.330> put<00:01:21.689> this

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
have to assess okay if I just put this

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
have to assess okay if I just put this

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the best strategy or should I be

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
the best strategy or should I be
combining<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.680> other<00:01:25.860> molecule
