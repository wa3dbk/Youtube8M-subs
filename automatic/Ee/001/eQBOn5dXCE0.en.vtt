00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
the trade block all the reason I do that

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.310 
the trade block all the reason I do that
is<00:01:33.340> when<00:01:33.700> you<00:01:33.729> remove<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.300> from<00:01:34.929> the<00:01:35.020> trade

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
is when you remove it from the trade

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.600 
is when you remove it from the trade
block<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.820> puts<00:01:37.720> it<00:01:37.899> like<00:01:38.080> auto<00:01:38.460> into<00:01:39.460> the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
block it puts it like auto into the

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.980 
block it puts it like auto into the
active<00:01:39.909> cars<00:01:40.149> it's<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.390> only<00:01:40.630> card<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.929> will

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990
