00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.830
 today if I do not see it I do not think so 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.410
 we will talk about the drones that is a drone 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.510
 A drone is an aerial vehicle that does not 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.550
 is manned by no one these 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.679
 Flying vehicles can be handled 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.960
 via remote control or using your 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.550
 own software exist mainly 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.380
 two types of drones those that have shape 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 of aircraft and others that have the form of 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 Helicopter latter are those who 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.780
 they are being used more by their 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.060
 ability to remain static in the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.580
 air were created for use in 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.350
 wars but today companies 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.630
 couriers use them to carry 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.240
 out your deals quickly and 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.400
 automated other companies like those of 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.320
 electric power they use to review 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.240
 the state of the power line and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.950
 they are also used in the 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.010
 news to fumigate pests of 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.899
 mosquitoes 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.150
 and other uses they already have on the 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.159
 forest fire control expand 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.710
 the internet signal to places that 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.470
 they lack it apply pesticides in 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.210
 the crops and even have pulses with 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.220
 social purposes as it can be 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.500
 transport life jackets to the place where 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.450
 they are necessary but without a doubt the most 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.220
 interesting about the drones are the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.530
 prototypes that are supposed to be 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.690
 manufacturing for the future on the one hand 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.580
 larger drones like cars or 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.360
 helicopters that could circulate from 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.000
 autonomous form 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.190
 on the other hand, such small drones 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.619
 being able to appear even in size and 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.509
 look to a mosquito 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.340
 these insect-shaped drones are 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.159
 are developing mainly for 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.619
 be little spies have the ability 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.780
 of flying in buildings accessing areas 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.030
 complicated take photos perform 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.190
 recordings and also have other uses 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.959
 that really scare and can perform 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.330
 with the same ease as if 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.850
 you explain in a common mosquito how can 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.409
 be to perform DNA extractions or 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.869
 inject any type of substance 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.549
 lethal though all this is a science 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.690
 fiction everything we have told until 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.970
 here is present 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.550
 Now I invite you to imagine that I could 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.320
 occur certain technology of the future will 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.000
 will encompass as much as to be able to be 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.040
 consumed by any citizen of 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.230
 walking 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.069
 so it has been interesting for 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.069
 favor of the light 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.310
 and writes 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.760
 ah 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.760
 ah
