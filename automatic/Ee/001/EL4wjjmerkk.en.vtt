00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
instructions say but a good thing that I

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.830

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
the back I think it would look better on

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.270 
the back I think it would look better on
underneath<00:04:18.830> gonna<00:04:19.830> change<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.280> for<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.489> guys

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
and yeah I mean looks more like a

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.190 
and yeah I mean looks more like a
jetpack<00:04:28.140> exactly<00:04:29.120> yeah<00:04:30.410> just<00:04:31.410> my<00:04:31.620> opinion

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
jetpack exactly yeah just my opinion

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.400 
jetpack exactly yeah just my opinion
okay<00:04:34.200> like<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:35.010> he<00:04:35.190> can<00:04:35.570> actually<00:04:36.570> walk<00:04:37.050> with

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
okay like that he can actually walk with

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.000 
okay like that he can actually walk with
it<00:04:37.790> yeah<00:04:38.790> unless<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:40.050> remove<00:04:40.260> this<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.860> just

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
it yeah unless you remove this and just

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.290 
it yeah unless you remove this and just
like<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:42.919> so<00:04:43.919> basically<00:04:44.640> you<00:04:44.940> will<00:04:45.090> the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
like that so basically you will the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.610 
like that so basically you will the
figure<00:04:45.960> first<00:04:47.419> then<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.570> jetpack<00:04:49.020> take<00:04:49.440> a

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
figure first then the jetpack take a

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.620 
figure first then the jetpack take a
business<00:04:49.979> this<00:04:50.310> you're<00:04:51.030> going<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.270> connect

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
business this you're going to connect

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.330
