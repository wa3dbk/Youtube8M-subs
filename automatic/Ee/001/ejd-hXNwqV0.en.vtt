00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.930
 in what I sometimes hope that 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.490
 find a wonder they already know that I 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.840
 I am jet lag and today we are going to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.240
 talk about a topic completely 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.700
 different because today we will talk about the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.859
 color of the dress so once I'll go 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.289
 to give later to the video 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.820
 what color it is but let's start with the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.470
 story yesterday I was not there 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.910
 as usual, bailing the wall in 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.130
 facebook quietly when 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.750
 suddenly go this thousand thousand jet image 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.730
 times on all the walls in all the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.380
 States had to know why I 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.960
 I was just wondering why the fuck 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.790
 That dress where the hell it came from 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.800
 result too many questions of who 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.960
 it's where he's from who created him 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.360
 he met no no not too many questions 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.100
 for the main question was what 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.020
 color is the dress almost all 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.610
 states said this question then I 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.320
 I said to myself can be white with 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.820
 golden there is no problem when 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.649
 suddenly of little shrink the comments 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.200
 and some people see it blue with black 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.180
 vÃ­ctor for that lighter of his blues 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.190
 is a white and that is a golden like 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.390
 can confuse and so I asked myself 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.000
 what they see in a different color 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.339
 I see another one, he did not explain to me 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.649
 He started to investigate slowly and I found 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.159
 a very interesting page that already said 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.689
 what had 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.819
 Recent studies by a university 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.039
 very famous created by the apes 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:15.960
 wise thinkers of tomorrow which 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.490
 they mentioned that if you see this dress 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.079
 blue with black means that you 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.700
 you find a bit sad you find 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.210
 they are so disturbed by that with 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.430
 you today look 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.469
 the players in the skin 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.119
 lie but it is true that he said that 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.100
 if you see that blue dress with black 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.020
 it means that you tell yourself a little bit about 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.210
 your side a little sad some problem 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.860
 recent and if you see it white condemned 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.940
 it means that you are very 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.480
 well very happy very 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.410
 when the cool thing that had been the 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.940
 better to walk here and in chilito 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.550
 edict but the motive and the truth of 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.170
 this video is that it does not matter what you see 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.780
 outside and maybe the next image 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.000
 I explained to you that it does not matter if you 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.010
 you see blue with black or white with gold 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.750
 what matters is what is inside 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.120
 yourself so if you find yourself 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.340
 sad relieved lifts your spirits and if 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.650
 You are here, well, small 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.810
