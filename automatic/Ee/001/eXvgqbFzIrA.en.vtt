00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 Unlimited turn &lt;Verbatped draft: Li Mingjuan's manuscript: Li Tanku&gt; 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.800
 &lt;&lt;Action demonstration&gt;&gt; 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.960
 Dear friends, everyone, we have to teach "infinite turn" in this class. 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.100
 Infinitely, it has the same meaning as it is, it can be turned all the way, and the bell will not knot! 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:29.280
 Let's see it once! Try it five times in a row, and the bell will not be knotted. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.180
 &lt;&lt;Basic skills&gt;&gt; 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.000
 Basic skills: "Fish jump gantry" this action must be very skilled! 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.220
 &lt;&lt;Slow motion demonstration&gt;&gt; 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.140
 Key point: This action starts from the beginning to the end... "There is no change in both hands!" 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.180
 The right hand has been grabbing the right stick, and the left hand has been grabbing the left stick. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.340
 There is no change of action from start to finish, or the action of changing sticks. 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.200
 &lt;&lt;Decomposition teaching&gt;&gt; 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.880
 &lt;Step 1 decomposition exercise&gt; 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.280
 1. First pick a fish apex, this time the bell will hit a knot 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.740
 2. Take the right hand stick to the bottom of the left hand stick. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.520
 3. Open the right thumb and index finger, cross the stick above our left hand, and take the right hand stick from above. 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.860
 4. After getting it, release the three fingers behind your right hand and pull the stick out from the front. 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.960
 5. When you take it out, you will find that the following "Fish Leap Dragon Gate" knot is untied and you return to the empty bell. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.460
 &lt;Read another angle] 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.500
 1. First pick a fish apex, this time the bell will hit a knot 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.800
 2. Take the right hand stick to the bottom of the left hand stick. 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.480
 3. Open the right thumb and index finger, cross the stick above our left hand, and take the right hand stick from above. 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.860
 4. After getting it, release the three fingers behind the right hand and pull the stick out from the front. 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.760
 5. When you take it out, you will find that the following "Fish Leap Dragon Gate" knot is untied and you return to the empty bell. 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.540
 &lt;Directly come to a circle&gt; 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:42.360
 The part that comes directly is just like it. Just when you are doing it, you need to do the fish leaping gantry while doing the action of taking the Kunzi. 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.760
 Let's see it again 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.160
 &lt;The third part is turning infinitely! &gt; 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.420
 After you are cooked, you can try to do it all the time, donâ€™t stop 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.360
 Practice can be very smooth, the goal is more than ten consecutive times 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.840
 There is no problem with this action, you can continue to see our extended action! 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.640
 &lt;&lt;Extension action&gt;&gt; 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.420
 Extended action: "Evolutionary version", this can always be done all the time, the speed reminder is very fast! 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.860
 Interested people can study by themselves 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:41.480
 In this version, only the thumb is opened, and the stick is placed between the thumb and the index finger to rotate inside the circle. 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.280
 Extended action: "Fancy double throw". You can also do a lot of extensions in conjunction with throwing, of course, you must be familiar with the bell! 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.940
 We have gotten here this class, class! 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.360
