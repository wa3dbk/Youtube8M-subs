runescape<00:03:09.800> would<00:03:10.250> spend<00:03:10.610> around<00:03:10.760> 500<00:03:11.600> k

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
runescape would spend around 500 k

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.620 
runescape would spend around 500 k
buying<00:03:12.739> everything<00:03:13.100> I<00:03:13.340> think<00:03:13.400> no<00:03:13.940> wasn't<00:03:14.360> that

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
buying everything I think no wasn't that

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.979 
buying everything I think no wasn't that
we'd<00:03:15.350> spend<00:03:15.709> around<00:03:15.860> 100k<00:03:16.580> yeah<00:03:17.030> beer<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.660> think

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
we'd spend around 100k yeah beer I think

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.110

somewhere<00:03:18.380> around<00:03:18.470> there<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:19.670> after<00:03:20.060> you

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
somewhere around there and after you

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.790 
somewhere around there and after you
spent<00:03:20.390> that<00:03:20.510> one<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.810> okay<00:03:21.050> you<00:03:21.110> should<00:03:21.380> make

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
spent that one and okay you should make

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.620

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
that you make money on runescape on the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.539 
that you make money on runescape on the
stores<00:03:32.470> now<00:03:33.470> there<00:03:33.650> are<00:03:33.830> some<00:03:33.860> amount<00:03:34.340> you

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
you get out watch out for just for

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.140 
you get out watch out for just for
example<00:03:39.560> just<00:03:39.830> for<00:03:40.100> if<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.640> don't<00:03:40.790> know<00:03:40.940> if<00:03:41.060> it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
example just for if you don't know if it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.479 
example just for if you don't know if it
makes<00:03:41.330> me<00:03:41.480> money<00:03:42.140> or<00:03:42.230> not<00:03:42.440> just<00:03:42.680> buy<00:03:42.799> one<00:03:43.069> and

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
makes me money or not just buy one and

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.280 
makes me money or not just buy one and
then<00:03:43.730> price<00:03:44.030> check<00:03:44.390> it<00:03:44.569> seemed<00:03:44.810> like<00:03:45.019> a<00:03:45.049> dip

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
then price check it seemed like a dip

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.050 
then price check it seemed like a dip
the<00:03:45.500> bucket<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:46.100> didn't<00:03:46.610> know<00:03:46.670> if<00:03:46.819> they<00:03:47.000> were

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
the bucket I didn't know if they were

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.580 
the bucket I didn't know if they were
more<00:03:47.480> than<00:03:47.510> one<00:03:48.319> more<00:03:48.830> than<00:03:49.780> two<00:03:50.780> GP<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.230> thought

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
more than one more than two GP I thought

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.140 
more than one more than two GP I thought
there<00:03:51.769> might<00:03:51.950> be<00:03:51.980> just<00:03:52.340> less<00:03:52.580> so<00:03:52.850> that's<00:03:53.030> why

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
there might be just less so that's why

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.900 
there might be just less so that's why
only<00:03:53.299> about<00:03:53.540> one<00:03:54.160> not<00:03:55.160> really<00:03:55.489> all<00:03:55.640> there<00:03:55.819> is

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
only about one not really all there is

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.420 
only about one not really all there is
to<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.269> guide<00:03:56.620> just<00:03:57.620> make<00:03:57.799> sure<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:58.010> buy<00:03:58.370> the

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
to the guide just make sure you buy the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.449
