00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
K so that's down but I think that was

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.440 
K so that's down but I think that was
really<00:05:16.310> effective<00:05:16.610> for<00:05:16.760> aerials<00:05:17.090> he's<00:05:17.210> gotten

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
really effective for aerials he's gotten

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.409 
really effective for aerials he's gotten
the<00:05:17.479> gas<00:05:17.660> up<00:05:17.870> he<00:05:17.960> needed<00:05:18.169> to<00:05:18.620> produce<00:05:18.770> a<00:05:19.010> lot<00:05:19.250> a

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
the gas up he needed to produce a lot a

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.510 
the gas up he needed to produce a lot a
good<00:05:20.419> group<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:20.720> vultures<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.169> would<00:05:21.290> assume

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
good group of vultures I would assume

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.680 
good group of vultures I would assume
I've<00:05:22.520> got<00:05:22.729> to<00:05:22.790> assume<00:05:22.940> he's<00:05:23.090> been<00:05:23.210> storing<00:05:23.450> gas

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690

didn't have anything to do any spotting
so<00:06:06.590> a<00:06:06.650> lot<00:06:06.800> of<00:06:06.830> them<00:06:06.979> getting<00:06:07.130> wiped<00:06:07.310> out

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
so a lot of them getting wiped out

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.010 
so a lot of them getting wiped out
they're<00:06:07.700> finally<00:06:08.030> in<00:06:08.120> a<00:06:08.180> radiate<00:06:08.450> going<00:06:08.690> off

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
they're finally in a radiate going off

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.330 
they're finally in a radiate going off
on<00:06:09.169> a<00:06:09.320> single<00:06:09.650> one<00:06:09.770> of<00:06:09.800> them<00:06:09.890> thought<00:06:10.070> it<00:06:10.220> was<00:06:10.310> a

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
on a single one of them thought it was a

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.130 
on a single one of them thought it was a
very<00:06:10.430> nice<00:06:11.090> exchange<00:06:11.510> for<00:06:11.660> aerials<00:06:11.960> once

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
very nice exchange for aerials once

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.610 
very nice exchange for aerials once
again

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
if they're more about there are more

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.840 
if they're more about there are more

science<00:06:26.150> vessels<00:06:26.419> would<00:06:26.539> be<00:06:26.660> down<00:06:26.810> would<00:06:27.110> be

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
science vessels would be down would be

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.120 
science vessels would be down would be
down<00:06:27.350> now<00:06:27.500> it<00:06:27.560> looks<00:06:27.680> like<00:06:27.740> there's<00:06:27.950> gonna<00:06:28.039> be

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
down now it looks like there's gonna be

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.529 
down now it looks like there's gonna be
a<00:06:28.220> push<00:06:28.370> at<00:06:28.490> the<00:06:28.520> 12<00:06:28.760> o'clock<00:06:28.880> location<00:06:29.300> only

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
a push at the 12 o'clock location only

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:31.029 
a push at the 12 o'clock location only
two<00:06:29.720> lurks<00:06:29.930> waiting<00:06:30.229> there<00:06:30.380> but<00:06:30.770> there<00:06:30.890> are

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
two lurks waiting there but there are

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.010 
two lurks waiting there but there are
some<00:06:31.250> Zerg<00:06:31.430> eggs<00:06:31.640> hatching<00:06:32.030> and<00:06:32.390> actually<00:06:32.900> no

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
some Zerg eggs hatching and actually no

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.540 
some Zerg eggs hatching and actually no
looks<00:06:33.200> like<00:06:33.320> exhaie<00:06:33.680> is<00:06:33.830> in<00:06:33.979> fact<00:06:34.159> holding<00:06:34.430> up

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
looks like exhaie is in fact holding up

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.370 
looks like exhaie is in fact holding up
and<00:06:34.760> now<00:06:35.030> honestly<00:06:35.780> I<00:06:35.840> think<00:06:36.020> it's<00:06:36.110> too<00:06:36.229> late

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
and now honestly I think it's too late

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.899 
and now honestly I think it's too late
for<00:06:36.440> X<00:06:36.680> K<00:06:36.890> he's<00:06:37.070> got<00:06:37.220> a<00:06:37.250> lot<00:06:37.430> of<00:06:37.550> a<00:06:37.700> lot<00:06:37.849> of

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
for X K he's got a lot of a lot of

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:39.910 
for X K he's got a lot of a lot of
ultros<00:06:38.270> have<00:06:38.419> been<00:06:38.539> produced<00:06:38.810> alongside

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
ultros have been produced alongside

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.290 
ultros have been produced alongside
also<00:06:40.100> some<00:06:40.250> lurks<00:06:40.460> also<00:06:40.850> a<00:06:40.880> lot<00:06:41.000> of<00:06:41.030> Ling's

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
also some lurks also a lot of Ling's

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.030 
also some lurks also a lot of Ling's
looks<00:06:41.720> like<00:06:41.840> there<00:06:41.960> is<00:06:42.080> finally<00:06:42.320> an<00:06:42.470> SUV<00:06:42.770> Scout

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040 
looks like there is finally an SUV Scout

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.960 
looks like there is finally an SUV Scout
gonna<00:06:43.190> check<00:06:43.400> the<00:06:43.490> upper<00:06:43.610> left-hand<00:06:43.850> corner

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
gonna check the upper left-hand corner

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.510 
gonna check the upper left-hand corner
but<00:06:44.600> XK<00:06:45.320> by<00:06:45.350> the<00:06:45.530> time<00:06:45.860> he<00:06:45.950> moves<00:06:46.160> out<00:06:46.280> there

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
but XK by the time he moves out there

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.100 
but XK by the time he moves out there
honestly<00:06:46.880> he's<00:06:47.000> gonna<00:06:47.090> get<00:06:47.270> over<00:06:47.330> on<00:06:47.540> finally

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
honestly he's gonna get over on finally

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.690 
honestly he's gonna get over on finally
putting<00:06:48.320> down<00:06:48.470> his<00:06:48.620> minimal<00:06:49.100> only<00:06:49.280> expansion

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
putting down his minimal only expansion

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.100 
putting down his minimal only expansion
but<00:06:49.850> I<00:06:49.880> think<00:06:50.060> it's<00:06:50.150> a<00:06:50.180> little<00:06:50.240> late<00:06:50.480> aerials

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
but I think it's a little late aerials

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.050 
but I think it's a little late aerials
just<00:06:51.290> has<00:06:51.440> a<00:06:51.470> huge<00:06:52.070> group<00:06:52.340> of<00:06:52.580> ultralisk

just has a huge group of ultralisk

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.090 
just has a huge group of ultralisk

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
circlings and lurkers out in the middle

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.290 
circlings and lurkers out in the middle
of<00:06:55.190> the<00:06:55.250> field<00:06:55.370> and<00:06:55.580> looks<00:06:55.790> like<00:06:55.850> he's<00:06:56.030> pushing

be drawn back one lurker going down
looks<00:07:07.460> like<00:07:07.580> a<00:07:07.610> second<00:07:07.910> lurker<00:07:08.090> it<00:07:08.390> doesn't

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
looks like a second lurker it doesn't

has<00:07:11.870> been<00:07:12.080> finished<00:07:12.260> for<00:07:12.470> the<00:07:12.530> ultralisks

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:12.920 
has been finished for the ultralisks

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.650 
has been finished for the ultralisks
doesn't<00:07:13.670> look<00:07:13.760> like<00:07:13.910> the<00:07:14.060> and<00:07:14.300> it<00:07:14.420> does<00:07:14.540> look

doesn't look like the and it does look
like<00:07:14.810> they've<00:07:14.960> been<00:07:14.990> speed<00:07:15.230> upgraded<00:07:15.590> routes

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
like they've been speed upgraded routes

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.170 
like they've been speed upgraded routes
well<00:07:15.920> it<00:07:16.070> looks<00:07:16.190> like<00:07:16.280> it's<00:07:16.400> a<00:07:16.430> full<00:07:16.610> control

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180 
well it looks like it's a full control

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.240 
well it looks like it's a full control
group<00:07:17.360> of<00:07:17.450> ultralisk<00:07:17.840> on<00:07:18.560> the<00:07:18.740> field<00:07:18.980> here<00:07:19.130> and

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250 
group of ultralisk on the field here and
