00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.170
 it will be healthy to eat the eggs to me 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.170
 love the egg yolk ranch 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.630
 they must be orange and not yellow 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.060
 like those of the super I choose the eggs 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.210
 by the color of the yolk while more 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.789
 orange will better look if the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.650
 they paint or not and if they paint the yolks of 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.279
 eggs as if they are inside the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.769
 shell now it can not be impossible if 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.430
 the eggs are painted for example if in 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.350
 some region we prefer eggs more 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.829
 good orange you put a little 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.600
 more than orange dye in the feed of 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.899
 the chickens and ready 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.300
 If we're going to these little things, they 'll paint the 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.760
 egg yolks facing or blue 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.949
 clear if the market asks for it if the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.730
 Market calls there is natural pigments 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.280
 and there are artificial pigments for example 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.359
 to little retinol kantak santina up or 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.100
 caroteno citromax antina there is also 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.560
 natural dyes if a producer 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.060
 he wants the egg to be well painted 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.399
 ok orange just gives it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.130
 eat a little bit of cempasuchil to your 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.259
 chickens and want it to be even more red 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.420
 I could eat a little chili 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.310
 reds or a little shrimp is a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.770
 ask little chicken 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.590
 normal conditions I would eat shrimp 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.450
 you would do below the idea and take out 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.240
 your shrimp is a question those that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.460
 they think that the more orange the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.789
 more natural egg is so wrong 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.250
 because the more the chicken is locked 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.619
 in a cage for example more orange 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.770
 tend to be the yolks of your eggs the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.770
 industry uses this metro color here 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.380
 determines what game color you like 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.229
 the people and depending on that he paints them 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.509
 today we clarify with the color that does not have 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.880
 nothing to do with the healthy or not healthy that 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.429
 it's the egg it's just a painting 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.909
 that they add to the egg to satisfy 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.909
 to the market 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.250
 for example the color of this egg 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.720
 has number 13 on the scale of roche 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.849
 it means that they put a little 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.950
 more than painting the front of the singing 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.410
 they think they eat frog eggs 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.810
