line of demarcation been lying right

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.369 
line of demarcation been lying right
there<00:00:47.980> in<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.430> middle<00:00:48.700> the<00:00:49.480> hair<00:00:49.750> tends<00:00:50.110> to

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
there in the middle the hair tends to

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.479 
there in the middle the hair tends to
break<00:00:50.649> why<00:00:51.360> well<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:53.199> relaxed<00:00:53.920> here<00:00:54.129> is

break why well the relaxed here is

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.420 
break why well the relaxed here is
weaker<00:00:55.270> than<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.660> natural<00:00:55.899> hair<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.860> relaxer

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
weaker than the natural hair the relaxer

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.740 
weaker than the natural hair the relaxer
has<00:00:57.670> been<00:00:57.879> processed<00:00:58.629> it's<00:00:59.609> older<00:01:00.609> it<00:01:01.329> has

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
has been processed it's older it has

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.689 
has been processed it's older it has
been<00:01:01.989> through<00:01:02.379> more<00:01:02.590> manipulation<00:01:03.280> and

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
been through more manipulation and

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.639 
been through more manipulation and
things<00:01:03.910> like<00:01:04.089> that<00:01:04.149> so<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:05.080> hair<00:01:05.289> strand

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
things like that so the hair strand

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.340 
things like that so the hair strand
itself<00:01:06.009> is<00:01:06.250> weaker<00:01:06.789> then<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.720> natural<00:01:08.200> hair

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
itself is weaker then the natural hair

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.490 
itself is weaker then the natural hair
that<00:01:08.619> is<00:01:08.649> a<00:01:08.860> newer<00:01:09.630> unprocessed<00:01:10.630> there's<00:01:11.140> no

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
that is a newer unprocessed there's no

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.190 
that is a newer unprocessed there's no
chemical<00:01:12.039> breakdown<00:01:12.220> of<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.880> so<00:01:13.509> right<00:01:13.899> there

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
chemical breakdown of it so right there

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.710 
chemical breakdown of it so right there
were<00:01:14.410> those<00:01:14.619> two<00:01:15.009> meet<00:01:15.369> is<00:01:15.670> where<00:01:16.209> lots<00:01:16.539> of
