00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.560
 we are in the midday assistance with 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.280
 sergio vallejo after four stretches 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.700
 good a lot of problems when 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.700
 had to give 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.030
 and nothing 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.740
 I was wearing maybe a tad long 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.410
 degraded and a very fast way in 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.830
 fifth table and the truth that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.990
 I was afraid to make a big sinister but 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.539
 good luckily we went for it to the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.759
 road giving boats 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.759
 and we fell on the road miracle 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.580
 and the rear wheel was punctured if it is 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.580
 that the movie is long 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.230
 for let's change the wheel and when 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.130
 I put the spare time 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.380
 there must be some impurity something not 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.390
 centered well and did not fix tight 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.210
 everything we could we followed a little more 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.160
 later we noticed that it was loosening we lowered 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.260
 to try to squeeze 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.590
 we went on but it kept moving weird and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.840
 in a very near goal the wheel came out 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.920
 flying 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.950
 so I had to do everything 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.780
 a number raise the cat back with 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.189
 car he just could not get lift 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.090
 in front and remove the wheel in front of 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.460
 bracelet back to put the cat 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.490
 then I could put the cat badly but 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.799
 more or less 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.240
 I put the whole wheel back and then 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.079
 I wanted him to take all that time 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.399
 looking for the wheel and did not find it 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.930
 we took a spare nut already had 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.040
 the nut all prepared but with the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.530
 wheel did not appear 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.300
 and well I was watching and more or less I saw 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.760
 the suitcase that was as well as stepped on and 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.540
 there following the footprint of the middle the 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.659
 mount the bouquet style I found it with 20 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.539
 meters in the middle of these 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.060
 and we put it to the goal we went back to 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.189
 re to tighten it because it would not be in some 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.880
 piece aluminum something or a stone I do not know 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.530
 what he would do but 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.810
 if it had been fixed from the beginning 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.789
 we had lost two or three minutes 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.990
 it's changed pretty fast less than two 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.750
 but 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.929
 in short so are things now will try 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.930
 see if we catch any point if it's 11 and 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.300
 there are 22 who are now where we arrived 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.170
 Well, encouragement and good luck and for those 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.170
