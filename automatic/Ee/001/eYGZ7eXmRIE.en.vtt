here<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:28.270> course<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.840> higher<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.140> bit<00:01:29.229> rate

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
here of course the higher the bit rate

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.980 
here of course the higher the bit rate
the<00:01:29.470> less<00:01:29.770> time<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:30.009> have<00:01:30.130> in<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.340> cards<00:01:30.670> but

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the less time you have in the cards but

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.389 
the less time you have in the cards but
gives<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.020> a<00:01:32.079> lot<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.229> options<00:01:32.500> now<00:01:33.189> it's

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
gives you a lot of options now it's

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.800 
gives you a lot of options now it's
really<00:01:33.490> important<00:01:33.909> for<00:01:33.970> me<00:01:34.119> for<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.600> green

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
really important for me for the green

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.690 
really important for me for the green
screen<00:01:34.840> because<00:01:35.259> I<00:01:35.680> could<00:01:36.009> take<00:01:36.159> that<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.520> and

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
screen because I could take that in and

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.270 
screen because I could take that in and
record<00:01:37.479> an<00:01:37.630> XD<00:01:38.170> camp<00:01:38.350> for<00:01:38.590> 2<00:01:38.710> -<00:01:38.890> I<00:01:38.920> want<00:01:39.159> with

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
record an XD camp for 2 - I want with

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.800 
record an XD camp for 2 - I want with
the<00:01:39.340> long<00:01:39.490> gap<00:01:39.700> 160<00:01:40.270> because<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:40.570> should<00:01:40.720> be

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
the long gap 160 because that should be

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.170 
the long gap 160 because that should be
the<00:01:40.899> highest<00:01:41.049> quality<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:42.460> wanted<00:01:42.939> to<00:01:43.000> see

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
the highest quality and I wanted to see

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.340 
the highest quality and I wanted to see
what<00:01:43.299> it<00:01:43.390> looked<00:01:43.540> like<00:01:43.570> in<00:01:43.750> Final<00:01:44.020> Cut<00:01:44.049> but

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
what it looked like in Final Cut but

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.359 
what it looked like in Final Cut but
just<00:01:44.500> before<00:01:44.710> we<00:01:44.799> go<00:01:44.890> look<00:01:45.070> at<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.219> footage

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
just before we go look at the footage

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.100 
just before we go look at the footage
that<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.700> recorded<00:01:46.090> on<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.479> bottom<00:01:46.750> here<00:01:46.930> just

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
that I recorded on the bottom here just

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.830 
that I recorded on the bottom here just
to<00:01:47.170> see<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.560> have<00:01:47.860> an<00:01:47.950> SDI<00:01:48.280> input<00:01:48.759> an<00:01:48.939> SDI<00:01:49.299> out<00:01:49.570> so

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
to see I have an SDI input an SDI out so

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.569 
to see I have an SDI input an SDI out so
I<00:01:49.869> loop<00:01:50.049> through<00:01:50.079> I<00:01:50.530> also<00:01:50.799> have<00:01:50.950> an<00:01:51.009> HDMI<00:01:51.310> in

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
I loop through I also have an HDMI in

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.910 
I loop through I also have an HDMI in
and<00:01:51.729> out<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.509> can<00:01:52.689> actually<00:01:52.869> send<00:01:53.229> HDMI<00:01:53.740> in

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
and out that I can actually send HDMI in

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.830 
and out that I can actually send HDMI in
and<00:01:54.189> then<00:01:54.310> spit<00:01:54.729> on<00:01:54.850> SDI<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:55.450> it's<00:01:55.600> great<00:01:55.810> for

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
and then spit on SDI so it's great for

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.179 
and then spit on SDI so it's great for
that<00:01:56.079> as<00:01:56.200> well

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
that as well

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.039 
that as well
the<00:01:57.700> bottom<00:01:57.969> also<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.240> have<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.420> power<00:01:58.659> plug<00:01:59.020> here

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
the bottom also I have a power plug here

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.620 
the bottom also I have a power plug here
it's<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.530> 4<00:01:59.740> pin<00:01:59.979> it'll<00:02:00.159> take<00:02:00.369> a<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.700> 12<00:02:01.149> volt<00:02:01.420> or

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
it's the 4 pin it'll take a a 12 volt or

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.899 
it's the 4 pin it'll take a a 12 volt or
as<00:02:01.840> low<00:02:02.049> as<00:02:02.079> a<00:02:02.229> 7<00:02:02.530> volt<00:02:02.740> input<00:02:02.950> there<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.579> I

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
as low as a 7 volt input there and I

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.580 
as low as a 7 volt input there and I
have<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.090> little<00:02:04.270> remote<00:02:04.570> pin<00:02:04.869> here<00:02:05.079> as<00:02:05.200> well

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
have a little remote pin here as well

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.319 
have a little remote pin here as well
they<00:02:05.829> can<00:02:05.979> plug<00:02:06.189> timecode<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:06.820> for<00:02:06.969> embedding

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
they can plug timecode in for embedding

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.029 
they can plug timecode in for embedding
and<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:07.600> on<00:02:07.750> so<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.530> really<00:02:08.619> versatile

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
and so on so it's a really versatile

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.440 
and so on so it's a really versatile
little<00:02:09.250> box<00:02:09.520> but<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.030> don't<00:02:10.180> show<00:02:10.270> you<00:02:10.330> how<00:02:10.420> I

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
little box but I don't show you how I

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.180 
little box but I don't show you how I
used<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.900> by<00:02:11.050> bringing<00:02:11.350> in<00:02:11.530> permanent<00:02:12.010> footage

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
used it by bringing in permanent footage

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.980 
used it by bringing in permanent footage
into<00:02:12.340> Final<00:02:12.610> Cut<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.090> comparing<00:02:13.570> what<00:02:13.930> I

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
into Final Cut and comparing what I

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.980 
into Final Cut and comparing what I
recorded<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.500> my<00:02:14.560> cam

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
recorded on my cam

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.040 
recorded on my cam
and<00:02:15.350> xdcam<00:02:15.890> ex<00:02:15.920> with<00:02:16.820> what<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.030> recorded<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
and xdcam ex with what I recorded on the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.000 
and xdcam ex with what I recorded on the
nano<00:02:18.230> flash<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.630> 160<00:02:20.630> megabit<00:02:21.020> longer<00:02:21.470> as

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
nano flash in the 160 megabit longer as

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.980 
nano flash in the 160 megabit longer as
well<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.550> it's<00:02:22.850> like<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.030> final<00:02:23.300> cut<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.690> see

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
well so it's like a final cut and see

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.110 
well so it's like a final cut and see
what<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.140> have

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
what I have

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.120 
what I have
okay<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.180> here<00:02:26.480> we<00:02:26.510> are<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:26.960> Final<00:02:27.560> Cut<00:02:27.590> Pro<00:02:27.740> and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
okay so here we are in Final Cut Pro and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.520 
okay so here we are in Final Cut Pro and
I've<00:02:28.250> loaded<00:02:28.430> up<00:02:28.610> two<00:02:28.910> clips<00:02:29.450> one<00:02:30.170> called

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
I've loaded up two clips one called

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.760 
I've loaded up two clips one called
green-screen<00:02:31.130> nano<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:32.470> another<00:02:33.470> called

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
green-screen nano and another called

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.330 
green-screen nano and another called
green-screen

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
green-screen

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.030 
green-screen
x1<00:02:35.060> these<00:02:35.570> are<00:02:35.720> my<00:02:35.840> two<00:02:35.900> clips<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.920> I've

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
x1 these are my two clips that I've

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.160 
x1 these are my two clips that I've
captured<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.610> Gregor<00:02:38.480> goofing<00:02:38.780> around<00:02:38.840> before

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
captured of Gregor goofing around before

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.320 
captured of Gregor goofing around before
we<00:02:39.320> started<00:02:39.620> our<00:02:39.740> shoot<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.700> can<00:02:40.790> see<00:02:41.060> if<00:02:41.270> I

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
we started our shoot you can see if I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.260 
we started our shoot you can see if I
play<00:02:41.540> them<00:02:41.780> they<00:02:42.080> look<00:02:42.260> very<00:02:42.290> much<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.940> same

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
play them they look very much the same

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.130 
play them they look very much the same
and<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.600> hard<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.870> tell<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.050> difference

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
and it's hard to tell the difference

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.840 
and it's hard to tell the difference
until<00:02:45.860> we<00:02:46.490> compare<00:02:46.940> them<00:02:47.260> with<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.320> key<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.820> I

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
until we compare them with a key so I

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.010 
until we compare them with a key so I
want<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.090> put<00:02:50.300> them<00:02:50.390> on<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.570> same<00:02:50.720> timeline

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
want to put them on the same timeline

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.120 
want to put them on the same timeline
together<00:02:51.320> here<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.180> put<00:02:53.180> them<00:02:53.240> side-by-side

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
together here and put them side-by-side

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.810 
together here and put them side-by-side
with<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.250> X<00:02:55.550> on<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.940> left<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:57.310> here<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.640> Nano

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
with the X on the left and here the Nano

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.840 
with the X on the left and here the Nano
flash<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.360> right<00:02:59.540> so<00:02:59.780> again<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:01.100> X<00:03:01.310> on<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
flash on the right so again the X on the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.160 
flash on the right so again the X on the
left<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:04.150> I'll<00:03:05.150> flash<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.780> right<00:03:05.960> I've

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
left and I'll flash on the right I've

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.480 
left and I'll flash on the right I've
just<00:03:06.200> mirrored<00:03:06.710> them<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.100> can<00:03:07.250> see<00:03:07.400> them

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
just mirrored them so I can see them

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.380 
just mirrored them so I can see them
side<00:03:07.700> by<00:03:07.760> side

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
side by side

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.030 
side by side
and<00:03:08.480> then<00:03:08.990> I'm<00:03:09.110> going<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.440> go<00:03:09.590> ahead<00:03:09.710> and<00:03:09.950> apply

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
and then I'm going to go ahead and apply

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.910 
and then I'm going to go ahead and apply
a<00:03:10.640> chroma<00:03:11.330> key<00:03:11.630> on<00:03:11.870> my<00:03:12.320> X<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:13.030> copy<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.330> and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
a chroma key on my X and copy that and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.680 
a chroma key on my X and copy that and
paste<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.220> on<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.670> my<00:03:16.880> Nana<00:03:17.090> flash<00:03:17.360> now<00:03:17.540> this

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
paste it on to my Nana flash now this

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.810 
paste it on to my Nana flash now this
isn't<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.990> great<00:03:18.170> key<00:03:18.470> she's<00:03:19.280> really<00:03:19.460> quick<00:03:19.670> and

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
isn't a great key she's really quick and

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.480 
isn't a great key she's really quick and
dirty<00:03:19.970> but<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.480> gives<00:03:20.630> us<00:03:20.720> an<00:03:20.900> idea<00:03:21.280> now<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.310> have

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
dirty but it gives us an idea now I have

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.400 
dirty but it gives us an idea now I have
them<00:03:22.550> side<00:03:22.760> by<00:03:22.790> side<00:03:22.940> I'm<00:03:23.480> gonna<00:03:23.960> go<00:03:24.080> ahead<00:03:24.200> and

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
them side by side I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.780 
them side by side I'm gonna go ahead and
zoom<00:03:24.740> in<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.330> this<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.810> see<00:03:27.430> what<00:03:28.430> has<00:03:28.760> happened

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
zoom in to this to see what has happened

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.780 
zoom in to this to see what has happened
when<00:03:29.330> we<00:03:29.390> go<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.540> 200%<00:03:29.990> there<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.680> right<00:03:31.460> away

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
when we go to 200% there and right away

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.600 
when we go to 200% there and right away
on<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.300> zoom<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:32.600> I<00:03:32.720> can<00:03:32.900> see<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.400> have<00:03:34.580> a

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
on the zoom and I can see that I have a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.050 
on the zoom and I can see that I have a
little<00:03:34.880> more<00:03:35.150> stair<00:03:36.080> stepping<00:03:36.500> on<00:03:36.860> my<00:03:37.190> ax<00:03:37.670> as

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
little more stair stepping on my ax as

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.520 
little more stair stepping on my ax as
well<00:03:38.270> as<00:03:38.420> some<00:03:38.600> other<00:03:38.750> issues<00:03:38.990> going<00:03:39.170> on<00:03:39.350> in

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
well as some other issues going on in

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.530 
well as some other issues going on in
here<00:03:39.740> but<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:40.280> don't<00:03:40.400> necessarily<00:03:40.610> have<00:03:41.210> on<00:03:41.450> my

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
here but I don't necessarily have on my

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.840 
here but I don't necessarily have on my
Nano<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:41.960> let<00:03:42.110> me<00:03:42.200> step<00:03:42.380> forward<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:43.010> little<00:03:43.730> bit

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
Nano so let me step forward a little bit

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.250 
Nano so let me step forward a little bit
through<00:03:44.270> my<00:03:44.300> timeline<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.820> again<00:03:46.820> I<00:03:47.260> find

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
through my timeline and again I find

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.390 
through my timeline and again I find
spots<00:03:48.740> where<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.880> I<00:03:50.300> saw<00:03:50.960> right<00:03:51.230> there<00:03:51.400> where

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
spots where the I saw right there where

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.960 
spots where the I saw right there where
the<00:03:52.610> X<00:03:52.940> has<00:03:53.240> one<00:03:53.780> blocking<00:03:54.110> artifacts<00:03:54.680> as<00:03:54.980> well

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
the X has one blocking artifacts as well

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.730 
the X has one blocking artifacts as well
as<00:03:56.120> just<00:03:56.360> other<00:03:56.570> issues<00:03:57.020> of<00:03:57.230> stair<00:03:57.470> stepping

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
as just other issues of stair stepping

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.560 
as just other issues of stair stepping
that<00:03:58.070> I<00:03:58.100> don't<00:03:58.310> have<00:03:58.490> in<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.760> Nano<00:03:58.970> flash<00:03:59.240> so

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
that I don't have in the Nano flash so

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.170 
that I don't have in the Nano flash so
this<00:04:00.410> is<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> really<00:04:01.190> good<00:04:01.460> indication<00:04:01.850> to<00:04:02.150> me

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
this is a really good indication to me

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.300 
this is a really good indication to me
that<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.080> Nano<00:04:03.410> is<00:04:03.470> going<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.710> hold<00:04:03.860> up<00:04:04.070> better

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
that the Nano is going to hold up better

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.960 
that the Nano is going to hold up better
and<00:04:05.320> with<00:04:06.320> my<00:04:06.470> key<00:04:06.740> overall<00:04:07.250> when<00:04:07.490> I<00:04:07.550> get<00:04:07.730> it
