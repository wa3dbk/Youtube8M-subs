the way of this extinction that wiped
out<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> dinosaurs<00:00:58.650> if<00:00:59.449> we<00:01:00.449> take<00:01:01.050> action<00:01:01.470> now

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
out the dinosaurs if we take action now

out the dinosaurs if we take action now
if<00:01:02.339> we<00:01:03.150> don't<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:05.000> it's<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
if we don't then it's going to be a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
if we don't then it's going to be a
terrible<00:01:06.780> thing<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.049> say<00:01:07.440> to<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.979> children

large-scale extinction technology will
help<00:04:01.410> us<00:04:01.560> understand<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.340> problem<00:04:02.790> better

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
help us understand the problem better

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.930 
help us understand the problem better
but<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.720> not<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.170> Silver<00:04:04.530> Bullet<00:04:04.940> second

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.790 
but it is not the Silver Bullet second
we<00:04:06.480> need<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.750> educate<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.440> general<00:04:07.590> public

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
we need to educate the general public

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.010 
we need to educate the general public
better<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:09.000> we<00:04:09.090> all<00:04:09.300> understand<00:04:09.900> the

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
better so that we all understand the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.270 
better so that we all understand the
immediacy<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.950> breadth<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.690> extinction

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
immediacy and breadth of extinction

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.890 
immediacy and breadth of extinction
finally<00:04:14.280> we<00:04:14.640> need<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:14.940> get<00:04:15.210> governments<00:04:15.750> to

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
finally we need to get governments to

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.860 
finally we need to get governments to
focus<00:04:16.380> on<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.890> problem<00:04:17.340> I'm<00:04:18.120> convinced<00:04:18.840> that

the<00:04:19.020> road<00:04:19.200> we're<00:04:19.410> on<00:04:19.560> will<00:04:19.859> lead<00:04:20.040> us<00:04:20.220> to

the road we're on will lead us to
