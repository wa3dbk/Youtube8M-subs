00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
of a lovely holiday tale but there's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.190 
of a lovely holiday tale but there's
some<00:01:48.090> sadness<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:48.810> right<00:01:48.930> there

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
some sadness in there right there

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.289 
some sadness in there right there
because<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.979> about<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.310> family<00:01:50.909> basically

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
because it's about a family basically

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.600 
because it's about a family basically
and<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> think<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> only<00:01:51.960> thing<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:53.430> all

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and I think the only thing that we all

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.240 
and I think the only thing that we all
share<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.930> whole<00:01:55.079> family<00:01:55.560> dynamic<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
share is the whole family dynamic and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.499 
share is the whole family dynamic and
you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.490> look<00:01:56.579> at<00:01:56.700> other<00:01:56.850> people's<00:01:57.149> families

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you can look at other people's families

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.940 
you can look at other people's families
and<00:01:57.540> think<00:01:57.810> we're<00:01:58.200> quite<00:01:58.320> normal<00:01:58.770> in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and think we're quite normal in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.469 
and think we're quite normal in
comparison<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.030> other<00:02:00.180> people's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
comparison and then other people's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.959 
comparison and then other people's
families<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> think<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.439> must<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.829> nutty<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.670> you

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
families I think we must be nutty so you

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.700 
families I think we must be nutty so you
know<00:02:03.060> we're<00:02:03.210> all<00:02:03.240> bonkers<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.530> those

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
know we're all bonkers and all those

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.649 
know we're all bonkers and all those
family<00:02:05.100> dynamics<00:02:05.670> are<00:02:05.850> really<00:02:05.880> interesting

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
think the thing about being ripped off

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.140 
think the thing about being ripped off
is<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.590> some<00:03:08.799> places<00:03:09.099> it<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.549> a<00:03:09.579> pleasure<00:03:10.000> to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
is that some places it is a pleasure to

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.479 
is that some places it is a pleasure to
be<00:03:10.269> ripped<00:03:10.540> off<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:11.530> know<00:03:11.829> you're<00:03:12.340> gonna

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489

go in there and you're gonna have some

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.409 
go in there and you're gonna have some
kind<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.400> fantastic<00:03:15.910> service<00:03:16.150> but<00:03:16.299> you're
