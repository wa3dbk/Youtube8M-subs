first<00:01:18.229> time<00:01:18.409> I<00:01:18.560> came<00:01:18.740> round<00:01:18.950> I<00:01:19.159> saw<00:01:19.880> Abram

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
first time I came round I saw Abram

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.450 
first time I came round I saw Abram
climbing<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.079> people<00:01:21.439> trying<00:01:21.859> to<00:01:21.950> have<00:01:22.429> a

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
climbing the people trying to have a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.400 
climbing the people trying to have a
good<00:01:22.579> how<00:01:23.450> much<00:01:23.630> damage<00:01:23.810> there<00:01:24.079> was

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.430 

after<00:01:32.410> that<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.590> think<00:01:33.180> cushion<00:01:34.260> cover<00:01:35.260> Lee

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
after that I think cushion cover Lee

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.050 
after that I think cushion cover Lee
very<00:01:35.650> well<00:01:35.890> everything<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.460> potentially

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
very well everything that potentially

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.250 
very well everything that potentially
could<00:01:37.600> happen<00:01:37.960> happen<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:40.180> leave<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.020> cockpit

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
could happen happen we leave the cockpit

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.900 
could happen happen we leave the cockpit
I<00:01:41.650> mean<00:01:41.770> they're<00:01:41.920> making<00:01:42.280> adjustments<00:01:42.370> for

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
I mean they're making adjustments for

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.330 
I mean they're making adjustments for
the<00:01:43.030> fit<00:01:43.410> with<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.500> engine<00:01:44.800> mapping<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.190> so

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
the fit with the engine mapping and so

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.280 
the fit with the engine mapping and so
on<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.640> so<00:01:45.670> forth<00:01:45.760> we<00:01:46.420> did<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.690> cockpit<00:01:47.110> what

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
on and so forth we did the cockpit what

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.070 
on and so forth we did the cockpit what
sort<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:48.450> adjustments<00:01:49.450> were<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:49.660> having<00:01:49.960> to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
sort of adjustments were you having to

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.960 
sort of adjustments were you having to
make<00:01:50.229> reports<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.800> compensations<00:01:51.790> and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
make reports of compensations and

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.170 
make reports of compensations and
changes<00:01:52.300> your<00:01:52.450> driving<00:01:52.870> style<00:01:54.180> with

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
changes your driving style with

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.350 
changes your driving style with
hindsight<00:01:55.540> obviously<00:01:56.670> he<00:01:57.670> was<00:01:57.790> ready<00:01:58.030> it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
hindsight obviously he was ready it

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.440 
hindsight obviously he was ready it
allows<00:01:58.630> very<00:01:59.020> quickly<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.440> come<00:01:59.740> back

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
allows very quickly to come back

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.180 
allows very quickly to come back
surprise

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.880 

again<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.750> knew<00:02:11.349> that<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.680> race<00:02:11.830> is<00:02:13.890> very

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
again I knew that the race is very

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.619 
again I knew that the race is very
quickly<00:02:15.130> again

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:26.130 

other

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.330 

after<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.410> rest<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.740> still<00:02:27.890> very<00:02:28.070> long

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
after that the rest is still very long
