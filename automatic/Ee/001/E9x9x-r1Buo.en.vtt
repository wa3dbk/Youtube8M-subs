I<00:00:25.170> was<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> bit<00:00:25.590> delayed<00:00:25.830> there<00:00:26.070> because<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
I was a bit delayed there because of the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.859 
I was a bit delayed there because of the
lag<00:00:26.760> but<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.119> should<00:00:27.269> buy<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.449> as<00:00:27.660> soon<00:00:27.840> as

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
flag you need to go to and that will be

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.530 
flag you need to go to and that will be
the<00:00:32.790> flag

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the flag

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.630 
the flag
if<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.440> spawn<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> right<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.430> map

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
if you spawn on the right in this map

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.430 
if you spawn on the right in this map
you<00:00:35.969> go<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> flag<00:00:36.600> obviously<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you go to the flag obviously in the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
you go to the flag obviously in the
middle<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.860> which<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.360> same<00:00:39.570> distance

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
middle there which is the same distance

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.119 
middle there which is the same distance

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to the enemy spawn from that flag so

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
to the enemy spawn from that flag so
whoever<00:00:44.610> gets<00:00:44.760> there<00:00:45.000> first<00:00:45.030> gets<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.079> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
as the USA team I do prefer the regular

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.029 
as the USA team I do prefer the regular
squad<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.719> assault<00:01:01.199> squad<00:01:01.440> most<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
squad to the assault squad most of the
time<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.270> m1<00:01:03.660> Garands<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
time because of the m1 Garands and the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.210 
time because of the m1 Garands and the
BA<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.860> pretty<00:01:05.580> good<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:05.880> well<00:01:07.189> compared<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
BA are pretty good as well compared to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.620 
BA are pretty good as well compared to
the<00:01:08.340> Germans<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.850> definitely<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.479> because

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the Germans I definitely like it because

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.660 
the Germans I definitely like it because
of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> M<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.229> hands<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.189> also<00:01:11.369> go

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of the M on your hands and I also go

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
of the M on your hands and I also go
single<00:01:12.090> rifleman<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> bit<00:01:13.320> more

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
single rifleman just to get a bit more

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590

numbers in the initial shoot ups and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.609 
numbers in the initial shoot ups and
they<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.580> basically<00:01:17.580> tie<00:01:17.759> me<00:01:17.939> down<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.810> till

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
thing a balance that I don't know why

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.540 
thing a balance that I don't know why
they<00:05:25.000> don't<00:05:25.120> fix<00:05:25.330> I've<00:05:25.570> told<00:05:25.750> them<00:05:25.900> many<00:05:25.990> times

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
they don't fix I've told them many times

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.920 
they don't fix I've told them many times
this<00:05:27.550> is<00:05:27.700> why<00:05:27.820> -<00:05:27.880> these<00:05:28.210> are<00:05:28.360> useless<00:05:28.510> and

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
this is why - these are useless and

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.480 
this is why - these are useless and
that's<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.260> whole<00:05:29.380> point<00:05:29.530> of<00:05:29.650> it<00:05:29.770> I<00:05:30.040> don't

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
that's the whole point of it I don't

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.430 
that's the whole point of it I don't
understand<00:05:30.940> why<00:05:31.120> they're<00:05:31.390> not<00:05:31.510> doing<00:05:31.780> it

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
understand why they're not doing it

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.710 
understand why they're not doing it
that's<00:05:32.620> fine<00:05:32.830> by<00:05:33.010> me<00:05:33.160> I'm<00:05:33.700> not<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.330> maker<00:05:34.600> of

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
that's fine by me I'm not the maker of

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.910 
that's fine by me I'm not the maker of
the<00:05:34.840> game<00:05:34.960> I'll<00:05:35.170> let<00:05:35.380> them<00:05:35.500> do<00:05:35.590> whatever<00:05:35.740> they

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
the game I'll let them do whatever they

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.060 
the game I'll let them do whatever they
want<00:05:36.220> but<00:05:36.460> that's<00:05:37.210> just<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.510> thing<00:05:37.660> I<00:05:38.070> suggested

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
want but that's just a thing I suggested

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.680 
want but that's just a thing I suggested
and<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:39.670> can<00:05:39.820> see<00:05:40.000> there<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:40.330> is<00:05:40.450> quite

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
and you can see there it is quite

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.300 
and you can see there it is quite
overpowered<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:43.890> counter<00:05:44.890> killing<00:05:45.130> countless

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
overpowered a counter killing countless

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.130 
overpowered a counter killing countless
again<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.730> bazooka<00:05:46.090> in<00:05:46.330> 20<00:05:46.630> say<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:46.870> can<00:05:46.990> see

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
again the bazooka in 20 say you can see

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.140 
again the bazooka in 20 say you can see
only<00:05:47.950> because<00:05:48.130> of<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:48.310> p3<00:05:48.640> they're<00:05:48.820> just

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
only because of the p3 they're just

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.310 
only because of the p3 they're just
getting<00:05:49.300> some<00:05:49.480> defense<00:05:49.780> in<00:05:49.900> case<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.170> piece

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
getting some defense in case the piece

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.400 
getting some defense in case the piece
here<00:05:50.470> comes<00:05:50.620> charging<00:05:50.860> up<00:05:51.130> I<00:05:51.310> can<00:05:51.850> take<00:05:52.000> it<00:05:52.120> out

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
here comes charging up I can take it out

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.540 
here comes charging up I can take it out
and<00:05:53.410> that's<00:05:53.620> pretty<00:05:53.860> much<00:05:53.950> for<00:05:54.010> the<00:05:54.190> game<00:05:54.340> ends

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
and that's pretty much for the game ends

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.710 
and that's pretty much for the game ends
and<00:05:54.760> it<00:05:54.850> crashes<00:05:55.060> so<00:05:55.270> would<00:05:55.390> it<00:05:55.450> mean<00:05:55.510> a<00:05:55.600> good

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
and it crashes so would it mean a good

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.090 
and it crashes so would it mean a good
castles<00:05:56.140> gonna<00:05:56.200> cast<00:05:56.530> the<00:05:56.650> whole<00:05:56.680> game<00:05:56.920> but<00:05:57.040> I

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
castles gonna cast the whole game but I

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.600 
castles gonna cast the whole game but I
was<00:05:57.190> thinking<00:05:57.460> now<00:05:59.100> because<00:06:00.100> Greek<00:06:00.340> crashed

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
was thinking now because Greek crashed

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.150 
was thinking now because Greek crashed
I'll<00:06:00.820> just<00:06:01.000> have<00:06:01.570> to<00:06:01.780> do<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.560> as<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:02.770> start

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
I'll just have to do it as a start

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160 
I'll just have to do it as a start
