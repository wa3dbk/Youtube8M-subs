00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
some of you asked if the HTC Desire 820

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.549 
some of you asked if the HTC Desire 820
is<00:00:07.649> capable<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.490> doing<00:00:09.000> games<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.990> will<00:00:10.320> show

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
is capable of doing games so I will show

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.759 
is capable of doing games so I will show
you<00:00:10.620> today<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.730> trigger<00:00:12.150> 2<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.719> asphalt<00:00:13.500> 8

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
you today that trigger 2 and asphalt 8

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.010 
you today that trigger 2 and asphalt 8
so<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.580> can<00:00:14.880> decide<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:15.630> yourself

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
so that you can decide for yourself

so that you can decide for yourself
first<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.070> should<00:00:17.130> know<00:00:17.310> okay<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.260> 5.5<00:00:19.260> inch

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
first you should know okay it's 5.5 inch

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.509 
first you should know okay it's 5.5 inch
display<00:00:20.359> octa-core<00:00:21.359> bat<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.949> Snapdragon

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
display octa-core bat it's a Snapdragon

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.210 
display octa-core bat it's a Snapdragon
615<00:00:24.359> meaning<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.050> only<00:00:25.289> four<00:00:25.769> cores

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
615 meaning you have only four cores

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.390 
615 meaning you have only four cores
with<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.849> point<00:00:27.180> zero<00:00:27.539> gigahertz<00:00:28.170> all<00:00:28.710> our

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
with one point zero gigahertz all our

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.700 
with one point zero gigahertz all our
cortex<00:00:29.970> a53<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.500> only<00:00:32.430> four<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.840> 1.5

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
cortex a53 and only four with up to 1.5

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.990 
cortex a53 and only four with up to 1.5
gigahertz<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.180> these<00:00:36.690> last<00:00:37.170> fours<00:00:38.000> what

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
gigahertz so these last fours what

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.720 
gigahertz so these last fours what
you're<00:00:39.210> seeing<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:40.050> these<00:00:40.290> four<00:00:40.680> cores<00:00:41.100> you

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
you're seeing here these four cores you

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.750 
you're seeing here these four cores you
can<00:00:41.969> see<00:00:42.149> down<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.960> frequency<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
can see down here the frequency and and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.660 
can see down here the frequency and and
these<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> ones<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:47.090> are<00:00:48.090> capable<00:00:48.870> for

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
these are the ones that are capable for

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.189 
these are the ones that are capable for
games<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.329> it'll<00:00:51.780> let<00:00:51.870> me<00:00:52.020> go<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
games like this one it'll let me go a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.500 
games like this one it'll let me go a
little<00:00:52.289> bit<00:00:52.620> closer<00:00:52.949> now<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:54.030> see<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
little bit closer now we will see the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.250 
little bit closer now we will see the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
graphics for yourself and in real time

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
graphics for yourself and in real time
how<00:00:58.739> much<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.170> four<00:01:01.170> cores<00:01:01.800> worth<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.670> 1.5

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
how much the four cores worth up to 1.5

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.929 
how much the four cores worth up to 1.5
gigahertz<00:01:04.729> are<00:01:06.680> how<00:01:07.680> much<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.670> work

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
gigahertz are how much they have to work

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.980 
gigahertz are how much they have to work
and<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.080> graphics<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.710> okay<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.580> not<00:01:11.990> and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.720 
corner here you will see that yeah there
are<00:02:33.330> some<00:02:33.720> times<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:34.650> only<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> few

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
are some times but only for a few

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.030 
are some times but only for a few
seconds<00:02:36.330> where<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.810> cores<00:02:37.140> are<00:02:37.290> going<00:02:37.680> up<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
seconds where the cores are going up to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.650 
seconds where the cores are going up to
1.5<00:02:38.670> gigahertz<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.710> normal<00:02:41.660> situations

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
1.5 gigahertz but in normal situations

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.260 
1.5 gigahertz but in normal situations
like<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.170> one<00:02:43.470> here<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.490> most<00:02:44.760> cases<00:02:45.030> you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
like this one here you in most cases you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.340 
like this one here you in most cases you
will<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.450> 1.1<00:02:46.440> 1.2<00:02:47.340> gigahertz<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.170> no

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
will have 1.1 1.2 gigahertz so it's no

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.780 
will have 1.1 1.2 gigahertz so it's no
problem<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:50.460> all<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.420> Snapdragon<00:02:52.140> 615<00:02:53.010> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
problem at all for the Snapdragon 615 to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.320 
problem at all for the Snapdragon 615 to
do<00:02:53.940> those<00:02:54.330> graphics<00:02:54.870> yeah<00:02:55.880> let<00:02:56.880> me<00:02:56.910> have<00:02:57.270> that

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
do those graphics yeah let me have that

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.160 
do those graphics yeah let me have that
last<00:02:58.370> jump<00:02:59.370> over<00:02:59.820> here<00:03:02.090> okay<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.870> show<00:03:04.110> you

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.860 
especially on that that trigger 2 game
there<00:04:13.739> is<00:04:13.770> no<00:04:13.920> problem<00:04:14.520> for<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.880> CPU<00:04:15.450> at<00:04:15.600> all

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
there is no problem for the CPU at all

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.099 
there is no problem for the CPU at all
and<00:04:16.459> concerning<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.609> price<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.239> recommended
