00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.570
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.919
 Come on, I'm fine 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.179
 that today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:18.400
 new video on ben especially hold 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.609
 because we will continue the series the 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.900
 early start team series so these 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.580
 gone today we are attacking the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.499
 series to a series team at 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.410
 so I saw that on the series at ago 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.960
 very few players of a very little 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.039
 untied 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.160
 but we will still propose this 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.920
 team there because it's a team to 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.910
 small budget so it's gone so in 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.230
 goalkeeper a goalkeeper goalkeeper 2 of Milan 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:54.160
 ac abbiati of the other stats really 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.879
 correct 84 dive 84 reflexes 79 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.820
 of opposition 73 2 games to the manna that 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:05.619
 very correct we will go to the defenders 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:09.310
 central with bonucci to bonnici very 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.759
 very good 72 speed card 77's 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.880
 defense and 84 of head a very very good 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:19.000
 player on the map 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.350
 by his side a player who was a kind 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.189
 and who has gone to gold solves this 79 of 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:31.030
 79 speed of expenditure 82 head a player 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.939
 very very fast tested but I think 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.979
 that it will please many people so 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.670
 in right defender to concots the French 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.140
 who is always so good on his map 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.020
 86 head speed 77 defense 72 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.329
 79 2 passes and 79 dribbles left 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.320
 we did not have much choice 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.539
 milan constant 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.829
 83 speed very very good very game 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:03.009
 solid enough fast 83 speed 77's 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.979
 defense 79 2 passes in 18 dribbles he 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.860
 is very very complete in defensive 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.929
 we have our series our series no 2 of 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.690
 milan ac 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.970
 really it has dropped a bit but 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.459
 still as complete perhaps the most 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.290
 it's 72 after 74 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.500
 it goes up to seventy-eight for the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.079
 speed and for defense so he has 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.180
 seem to be so good 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.069
 the other player is a player that any 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.500
 the world likes in France it's for 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.180
 the low poc 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.599
 for baba look at his stats at a 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.160
 monster at 75.2 fast and s80 of driouch 76 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.500
 all strikes were defensive stops 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.299
 82 passes 80 to two heads 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.400
 this player is just a monster we're going 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.129
 to move to the offensive midfielder after we go 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.500
 to make the wingers we bet me diamanti 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.750
 diamanti for his shoots from afar 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.810
 pass his dribbling he's really very 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.910
 very good this player looks like carlito 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.540
 with his hair but he is very very 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:09.040
 good so here's this one so we're going 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.030
 move on to the right winger who is ppe 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.400
 did not have much choice 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.420
 now know nothing I told you 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.150
 there are more choices on the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.160
 Grandpa sides still beats the casinos a 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.269
 stage he had on was 13 but 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.109
 now she's gone into quarters 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.910
 rare gold so his 84 speed 80's 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:30.190
 dribbles 76 pass a very very good 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.290
 winger on the other side we have a Belgian a 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.840
 bed which is merhtens mertens which was 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.130
 transferred to naples during this transfer window 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.130
 summer so mersen cecos a very very good 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.250
 player 83 speed 83 dribbling 76 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.989
 to hit 75 pass a very very good 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.549
 player 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.849
 so we'll go to the scorer who is 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.430
 edited last year who thinks is going 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:58.690
 to be so this year matured muriel 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.390

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.250
 of dribbles 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.130
 really one day it's very complete 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:11.569
