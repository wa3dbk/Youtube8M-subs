vertically<00:01:57.430> across<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.720> nail<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.380> does<00:01:59.680> take

vertically across the nail it does take

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.070 
vertically across the nail it does take
some<00:02:00.070> practice<00:02:00.130> so<00:02:01.030> if<00:02:01.300> this<00:02:01.540> is<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:01.780> bit<00:02:01.900> too

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
some practice so if this is a bit too

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.070 
some practice so if this is a bit too
difficult<00:02:02.560> for<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:02.979> can<00:02:03.750> replace<00:02:04.750> the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
difficult for you you can replace the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.440 
difficult for you you can replace the
stripes<00:02:05.410> with<00:02:05.740> more<00:02:06.250> flowers<00:02:06.759> or<00:02:06.970> polka<00:02:07.180> dots

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
stripes with more flowers or polka dots

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.170 
stripes with more flowers or polka dots
or<00:02:07.750> something<00:02:08.500> else<00:02:08.649> that's<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.979> lot<00:02:09.100> easier

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.940 

so<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.209> common<00:02:16.599> question<00:02:17.019> that<00:02:17.049> I<00:02:17.230> get<00:02:17.409> is<00:02:17.799> how
