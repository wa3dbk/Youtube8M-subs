hey<00:00:07.290> we're<00:00:07.470> over<00:00:07.500> here<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:07.770> Las<00:00:07.980> Vegas<00:00:08.010> at<00:00:08.580> CES

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
hey we're over here in Las Vegas at CES

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.910 
hey we're over here in Las Vegas at CES
and<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:09.870> got<00:00:10.019> something<00:00:10.320> pretty<00:00:10.410> cool<00:00:10.559> here

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
and we got something pretty cool here

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.049 
and we got something pretty cool here
well<00:00:11.040> something<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.370> think<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.670> pretty<00:00:11.820> big

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
well something I think is a pretty big

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.999 
well something I think is a pretty big
deal<00:00:12.240> something<00:00:12.630> I've<00:00:12.719> wanted<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.769> really

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
deal something I've wanted for a really

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.550 
deal something I've wanted for a really
long<00:00:14.040> time<00:00:14.250> it's<00:00:14.790> wireless<00:00:15.420> power<00:00:15.839> believe<00:00:16.440> it

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
long time it's wireless power believe it

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.429 
long time it's wireless power believe it
or<00:00:16.650> not<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:17.640> hours<00:00:17.940> for<00:00:18.119> power<00:00:18.330> mass<00:00:18.600> we

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
or not we hours for power mass we

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.769 
or not we hours for power mass we
wirelessly<00:00:20.220> charge<00:00:20.340> your<00:00:21.270> favorite<00:00:21.660> devices

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
wirelessly charge your favorite devices

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.380 
wirelessly charge your favorite devices
without<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.800> tangled<00:00:23.550> wires<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.210> see

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
without the tangled wires that you see

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.179 
without the tangled wires that you see
in<00:00:24.480> your<00:00:24.570> home<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.170> basically<00:00:26.010> our

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
in your home and basically our

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.339 
in your home and basically our
technology<00:00:26.849> were<00:00:27.060> using<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.869> magnetic

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
technology were using is magnetic

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.830 
technology were using is magnetic
induction<00:00:28.500> right<00:00:29.279> okay<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.000> what<00:00:30.720> we're

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
induction right okay and what we're

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.849 
induction right okay and what we're
really<00:00:30.929> doing<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.289> we're<00:00:31.470> transferring

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
really doing is we're transferring

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.400 
really doing is we're transferring
energy<00:00:32.300> orthosis<00:00:33.300> power<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:33.870> what's<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
energy orthosis power now what's the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.229 
energy orthosis power now what's the
distinction<00:00:34.710> between<00:00:35.010> energy<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.550> power<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
distinction between energy to power the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.030 
distinction between energy to power the
distinction<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> when<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.649> transfer

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
distinction is is that when you transfer

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
distinction is is that when you transfer
energy<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.790> things<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.180> drive

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
energy you can do things like drive

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.650 
energy you can do things like drive
power<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.219> illuminate<00:00:41.700> these<00:00:41.820> LEDs<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.329> are

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
power to illuminate these LEDs that are

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.389 
power to illuminate these LEDs that are
sitting<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:42.989> water<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.739> know<00:00:43.829> usually<00:00:44.010> water

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
sitting in water you know usually water

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.270 
sitting in water you know usually water
electricity<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.780> know<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.770> right<00:00:46.980> so

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
electricity you know what out right so

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
electricity you know what out right so
this<00:00:47.489> table<00:00:47.850> right<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.329> lined<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.870> with

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this table right now is lined up with

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.930 
this table right now is lined up with
your<00:00:49.440> technology<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.489> yeah

like in a bigger picture thing like
eventually<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.710> line<00:01:34.950> our<00:01:35.189> homes<00:01:35.640> with

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
eventually if we line our homes with

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.640 
eventually if we line our homes with
this<00:01:36.060> kind<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.299> stuff<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:37.170> could<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.439> have

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
this kind of stuff we could just have

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.530 
this kind of stuff we could just have
wireless<00:01:38.250> everything<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.240> put<00:01:39.450> your

actually<00:01:47.070> tremendous<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.970> some<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.360> our

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
actually tremendous we have some of our

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.240 
actually tremendous we have some of our
own<00:01:48.540> proprietary<00:01:48.780> technology<00:01:49.740> because

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250

one<00:02:31.420> very<00:02:31.990> cool<00:02:32.170> stuff<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.920> right<00:02:33.460> now

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
one very cool stuff in and right now

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.280 
one very cool stuff in and right now
you're<00:02:34.150> going<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.360> start<00:02:34.600> by<00:02:34.720> selling<00:02:34.990> these

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
you're going to start by selling these

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.380 
you're going to start by selling these
receivers<00:02:36.070> these<00:02:36.490> little<00:02:36.760> receivers<00:02:37.210> like

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
receivers these little receivers like

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.970 
receivers these little receivers like
this<00:02:37.570> is<00:02:37.690> what<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.900> looks<00:02:38.080> like<00:02:38.290> absolutely

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
this is what it looks like absolutely

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.280 
this is what it looks like absolutely
eventually<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.820> think<00:02:40.060> if<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.300> could<00:02:40.480> get

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
eventually you think if you could get

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.470 
eventually you think if you could get
people<00:02:41.620> thinking<00:02:42.400> about<00:02:42.820> this<00:02:42.940> stuff<00:02:43.209> like

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
people thinking about this stuff like

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.940 
people thinking about this stuff like
Apple<00:02:43.900> for<00:02:44.080> instance<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.560> could<00:02:44.650> get<00:02:44.830> it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
Apple for instance you could get it

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.680 
Apple for instance you could get it
embedded<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:45.550> their<00:02:45.670> laptops<00:02:46.209> just<00:02:46.420> shipped

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
embedded in their laptops just shipped

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.120 
embedded in their laptops just shipped
in<00:02:46.870> them<00:02:47.050> right<00:02:47.260> absolutely<00:02:47.740> Brian<00:02:47.950> we

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
in them right absolutely Brian we

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.800 
in them right absolutely Brian we
actually<00:02:48.520> have<00:02:48.670> an<00:02:48.850> example<00:02:49.270> of<00:02:49.300> other<00:02:49.450> areas

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
actually have an example of other areas

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.020 
actually have an example of other areas
of<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.990> booth<00:02:50.140> where<00:02:50.440> we<00:02:50.560> have<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:51.040> laptop<00:02:51.550> with

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
of the booth where we have a laptop with

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.270 
of the booth where we have a laptop with
the<00:02:52.180> technology<00:02:52.570> built-in<00:02:53.200> we<00:02:53.620> have<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:54.010> phone

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
the technology built-in we have a phone

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.610 
the technology built-in we have a phone
blackberry<00:02:55.000> phone<00:02:55.480> at<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.959> technology<00:02:56.410> built

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
blackberry phone at the technology built

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.730 
blackberry phone at the technology built
in<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.130> technology<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:58.540> be<00:02:58.690> scaled<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
in the technology can be scaled to the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.640 
in the technology can be scaled to the
same<00:03:00.130> thickness<00:03:00.490> as<00:03:00.820> a<00:03:00.880> piece<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.420> tape<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:02.410> we

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
same thickness as a piece of tape so we

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.470 
same thickness as a piece of tape so we
don't<00:03:02.800> have<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.070> go<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.280> device<00:03:03.760> makers<00:03:04.240> and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
don't have to go to device makers and

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.210 
don't have to go to device makers and
tell<00:03:04.660> them<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.110> they<00:03:05.650> need<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.800> make<00:03:05.980> their

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
tell them that they need to make their

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.699 
tell them that they need to make their
device<00:03:06.670> larger<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.270> accommodate<00:03:07.300> our<00:03:07.930> system

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
device larger to accommodate our system

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.380 
device larger to accommodate our system
so<00:03:09.100> we<00:03:09.130> believe<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.610> in<00:03:09.940> terms<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.270> the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
so we believe that in terms of the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.940 
so we believe that in terms of the
future<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.840> where<00:03:11.019> technology<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.590> going<00:03:11.709> we

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
future of where technology is going we

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.350 
future of where technology is going we
think<00:03:12.130> we<00:03:12.220> have<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.400> best<00:03:12.550> technology<00:03:13.090> right

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
think we have the best technology right

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.000 
think we have the best technology right
so<00:03:13.660> how<00:03:14.230> much<00:03:14.350> would<00:03:14.500> something<00:03:14.560> like<00:03:14.890> this

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
so how much would something like this

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.680 
so how much would something like this
cost<00:03:15.190> when<00:03:15.670> you're<00:03:15.790> first<00:03:15.910> starting<00:03:16.030> what<00:03:16.600> you

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
cost when you're first starting what you

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.100 
cost when you're first starting what you
want<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.959> pay<00:03:17.190> yeah<00:03:18.190> it's<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:19.120> match<00:03:19.600> our<00:03:19.840> about

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
want to pay yeah it's a match our about

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.970 
want to pay yeah it's a match our about
a<00:03:20.140> hundred<00:03:20.290> dollars<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:23.260> receivers

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
a hundred dollars and the the receivers

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.680 
a hundred dollars and the the receivers
are<00:03:24.220> going<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.550> cost<00:03:24.700> about<00:03:24.880> thirty<00:03:25.300> dollars

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
are going to cost about thirty dollars

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.470 
are going to cost about thirty dollars
