00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
a laggy screen which is why I'm using

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.250 
a laggy screen which is why I'm using
the<00:00:08.910> most<00:00:09.030> powerful<00:00:09.330> stuff<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.110> why

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
better strategies so here I'm going to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.010 
better strategies so here I'm going to
be<00:00:14.340> doing<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.549> play<00:00:14.790> by<00:00:14.969> play<00:00:15.030> telling<00:00:15.929> you

probably could have easily been avoided
if<00:00:25.410> I'd<00:00:25.680> been<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> little<00:00:26.130> bit<00:00:26.310> more<00:00:26.490> careful

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
if I'd been a little bit more careful

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.550 
if I'd been a little bit more careful
except<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.269> wasn't<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:27.689> expecting<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
though he probably took two or three

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.529 
though he probably took two or three
bullets<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.920> kill<00:00:43.950> me<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.430> still<00:00:45.090> felt<00:00:45.329> like<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
bullets to kill me if still felt like I

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.600 
bullets to kill me if still felt like I
died<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.110> shot<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
died in one shot and that's going to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.340 
died in one shot and that's going to
realize<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:47.910> Hawaiian<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.840> game<00:00:49.020> was

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
realize that Hawaiian this game was

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.869 
realize that Hawaiian this game was
horrible<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:50.010> me<00:00:50.219> especially<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
horrible for me especially on the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.990 
horrible for me especially on the
connection<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.989> i<00:00:52.340> decided<00:00:53.340> i<00:00:53.520> need<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.789> adapt

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
connection so i decided i need to adapt

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
connection so i decided i need to adapt
my<00:00:54.180> strategy<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.020> hang<00:00:55.379> back<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> little

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
my strategy you know hang back a little

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
my strategy you know hang back a little
bit<00:00:56.219> more<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.670> really<00:00:57.030> really<00:00:57.120> careful<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
bit more be really really careful the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.180 
bit more be really really careful the
only<00:00:58.079> thing<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.320> could<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.500> done<00:00:58.590> definitely

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
only thing I could have done definitely

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
only thing I could have done definitely
I<00:00:59.219> think<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.730> situation<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.420> known<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
I think in that situation is known the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.260 
I think in that situation is known the
spawn<00:01:01.559> space<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> actually<00:01:02.309> did<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> video

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
spawn space that I actually did a video

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.299 
spawn space that I actually did a video
on<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.899> map<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.680> actually<00:01:04.830> showed<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
on this map and I actually showed a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.800 
on this map and I actually showed a
spawn<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.790> was<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> bottom<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.450> montage

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.350 
spawn that was at the bottom of montage
I<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.380> guy<00:01:07.530> most<00:01:08.310> likely<00:01:08.610> spawned<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
I with that guy most likely spawned and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.320

let's just move on alright this is a
really<00:01:17.640> interesting<00:01:17.720> situation<00:01:18.720> coming<00:01:18.900> up

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
really interesting situation coming up

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.450 
really interesting situation coming up
you<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.619> guy<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> corner<00:01:20.130> right

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
there I didn't see him and that's

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.080 
there I didn't see him and that's
because<00:01:22.380> he<00:01:22.590> isn't<00:01:22.710> moving<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.369> believe<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
just spawned there and that's why I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.300 
just spawned there and that's why I
always<00:01:25.380> put<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:25.650> Claymore<00:01:26.070> though<00:01:26.189> because

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
always put my Claymore though because

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.640 
always put my Claymore though because
that's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.610> fairly<00:01:26.850> common<00:01:27.090> spawn<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.380> don't

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
that's a fairly common spawn but I don't

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's a fairly common spawn but I don't
think<00:01:28.799> he's<00:01:28.920> moving<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.670> he's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
think he's moving because I think he's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.370 
think he's moving because I think he's
changing<00:01:30.299> class<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.110> really<00:01:31.259> sure

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
changing class or if I'm not really sure

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.469 
changing class or if I'm not really sure
I<00:01:31.799> don't<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.520> him<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.880> game<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.299> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
I don't really see him in game so I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.940 
I don't really see him in game so I
proceeded<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.110> go<00:01:34.229> around<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> corner<00:01:34.530> where

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
know if he even tagged through one

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.209 
know if he even tagged through one
pistol<00:01:57.090> shot<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.600> may<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.380> been<00:01:58.439> dead<00:01:58.770> however

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
pistol shot I may have been dead however

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.670 
pistol shot I may have been dead however
it<00:01:59.310> turned<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.869> timing<00:02:01.500> between

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it turned out that the timing between

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
it turned out that the timing between
the<00:02:01.860> shore<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> flashbang<00:02:03.210> because

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the shore and the flashbang because

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.389 
the shore and the flashbang because
flashbang<00:02:04.320> steel<00:02:04.560> damaging<00:02:05.070> would<00:02:05.219> stop

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
flashbang steel damaging would stop

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.340 
flashbang steel damaging would stop
regeneration<00:02:06.060> attainment<00:02:06.450> between<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.840> was

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
regeneration attainment between that was

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.460 
regeneration attainment between that was
about<00:02:07.590> six<00:02:07.890> seconds<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:10.020> pretty<00:02:10.229> good

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
about six seconds so it was pretty good

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.170 
about six seconds so it was pretty good
I<00:02:10.709> was<00:02:11.250> feeling<00:02:11.849> generated<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.660> was<00:02:12.930> quite

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
I was feeling generated I was quite

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.780 
I was feeling generated I was quite
lucky<00:02:13.359> situation<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.109> survive<00:02:14.409> of<00:02:14.590> a-<00:02:14.799> so

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
lucky situation to survive of a- so

lucky situation to survive of a- so
after<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.180> series<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.900> fortunate<00:02:17.170> events<00:02:17.829> I

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
to repeat the guy instead of going to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.099 
to repeat the guy instead of going to
the<00:02:42.340> same<00:02:42.549> place<00:02:42.609> I<00:02:43.120> just<00:02:43.480> flank<00:02:43.780> around<00:02:43.930> the

the same place I just flank around the

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.069 
the same place I just flank around the
rock<00:02:44.290> pillar<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.769> get<00:02:45.700> him<00:02:45.849> and<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.720> may<00:02:46.959> have

rock pillar and get him and it may have

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.349 
rock pillar and get him and it may have
made<00:02:47.169> a<00:02:47.200> difference<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.620> might<00:02:47.919> not<00:02:48.359> but

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
made a difference it might not but

shooting out where is he looking he's
looking<00:02:59.859> down<00:02:59.950> towards<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.430> tree<00:03:00.669> stump<00:03:00.909> away

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
looking down towards the tree stump away

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.330 
looking down towards the tree stump away
from<00:03:01.450> me<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.629> there's<00:03:01.810> another<00:03:02.019> guy<00:03:02.260> over<00:03:03.159> by

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
from me and there's another guy over by

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.089 
from me and there's another guy over by
the<00:03:03.400> whale<00:03:03.700> entrance<00:03:04.510> he's<00:03:05.200> looking<00:03:05.590> towards

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
the whale entrance he's looking towards

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.039 
the whale entrance he's looking towards
me<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:06.519> I'd<00:03:06.609> say<00:03:06.790> for<00:03:06.939> the<00:03:07.030> switch<00:03:07.239> targets<00:03:07.540> at

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
me so I'd say for the switch targets at

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.899 
me so I'd say for the switch targets at
the<00:03:08.200> last<00:03:08.409> second<00:03:08.829> and<00:03:08.950> get<00:03:09.370> him<00:03:09.549> before<00:03:09.730> he

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
the last second and get him before he

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.550 
the last second and get him before he
starts<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.419> shoot<00:03:10.629> at<00:03:10.750> me<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.230> that's

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
starts to shoot at me and that's

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.869 
starts to shoot at me and that's
probably<00:03:11.769> one<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.189> big<00:03:12.280> differences<00:03:12.489> I

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
probably one of the big differences I

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.330 
probably one of the big differences I
mean<00:03:13.030> sure<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.329> lost<00:03:13.719> that<00:03:13.840> first<00:03:14.169> kill<00:03:14.469> but<00:03:15.189> I

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
mean sure I lost that first kill but I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.969 
mean sure I lost that first kill but I
gained<00:03:15.849> him<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.329> I<00:03:16.419> gained<00:03:16.900> my<00:03:16.930> life<00:03:17.409> as<00:03:17.739> well

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:17.979 
gained him and I gained my life as well

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.520 
gained him and I gained my life as well
and<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.970> know<00:03:19.060> he<00:03:19.329> lost<00:03:19.479> his<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.379> could

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
and you know he lost his and that could

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.110 
and you know he lost his and that could
have<00:03:20.680> really<00:03:20.919> made<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.099> huge<00:03:21.159> difference<00:03:21.639> in

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
have really made a huge difference in

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.409 
have really made a huge difference in
how<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:22.659> game<00:03:22.840> played<00:03:23.349> out<00:03:23.940> okay<00:03:24.940> let's<00:03:25.209> move

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
how this game played out okay let's move

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.629 
how this game played out okay let's move
on<00:03:25.599> to<00:03:25.629> a<00:03:25.810> more<00:03:25.870> useful<00:03:26.440> part<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.159> the<00:03:27.280> gameplay

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
on to a more useful part of the gameplay

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.520 
on to a more useful part of the gameplay
I<00:03:27.669> actually<00:03:27.909> spent<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.329> lot<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.569> this<00:03:28.810> game

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
I actually spent a lot of this game

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.250 
I actually spent a lot of this game
trying<00:03:30.099> to<00:03:30.310> devise<00:03:30.519> a<00:03:31.090> how<00:03:31.599> to<00:03:31.659> change<00:03:32.019> my

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
trying to devise a how to change my

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.890 
trying to devise a how to change my
strategies<00:03:32.859> in<00:03:32.979> a<00:03:33.069> way<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.849> would<00:03:33.970> benefit

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
strategies in a way that would benefit

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.809 
strategies in a way that would benefit
me<00:03:35.109> because<00:03:35.680> of<00:03:35.919> the<00:03:36.069> horrible<00:03:36.250> connection

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
me because of the horrible connection

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.670 
me because of the horrible connection
that<00:03:36.939> was<00:03:37.090> on<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.139> turned<00:03:38.409> out<00:03:38.620> that

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
that was on and it turned out that

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.219 
that was on and it turned out that
staying<00:03:39.280> along<00:03:39.549> this<00:03:39.699> back<00:03:40.000> area<00:03:40.359> of<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.989> cave

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
staying along this back area of the cave

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.319 
staying along this back area of the cave
is<00:03:41.530> actually<00:03:42.129> one<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.370> best<00:03:42.699> things<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.090> do

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
is actually one of the best things to do

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.210 
is actually one of the best things to do
not<00:03:43.870> only<00:03:44.019> for<00:03:44.259> a<00:03:44.290> bad<00:03:44.470> connection<00:03:44.709> but<00:03:45.040> just

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
not only for a bad connection but just

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.640 
not only for a bad connection but just
in<00:03:45.310> general<00:03:45.689> improve<00:03:46.689> my<00:03:46.900> strategy<00:03:47.379> from

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
in general improve my strategy from

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.740 
in general improve my strategy from
because<00:03:48.459> when<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:48.849> phone<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.359> i<00:03:49.389> was<00:03:49.569> going

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
because when I phone that i was going

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.499 
because when I phone that i was going
here<00:03:50.199> and<00:03:50.379> the<00:03:51.099> original<00:03:51.459> strategy<00:03:51.699> I'd<00:03:52.180> be

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:52.509 
here and the original strategy I'd be

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.860 
here and the original strategy I'd be
instantly<00:03:53.019> killed<00:03:53.379> from<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.159> well<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.870> that

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
instantly killed from the well and that

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.259 
instantly killed from the well and that
was<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.019> huge<00:03:56.409> issue<00:03:56.709> with<00:03:57.189> it<00:03:57.370> because<00:03:57.669> you're

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
was a huge issue with it because you're

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.569
