00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello everyone with you gameplay review on 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.910
 game for galkin dt south this game is made 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.010
 respectively based on the series 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.889
 which I have never watched but 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.839
 but thinks the show is quite popular and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.260
 many will be interested to look at this 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.119
 the game is presented here like this 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.970
 missions that is here now we have this 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.830
 episode 1 and here it is a whole bunch 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.920
 various missions that you need 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.710
 go through there is a level 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.829
 complexity is easy and let's 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.890
 look at the second mission and play in 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.050
 her so here we are shown what 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 we need to drag the character behind 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.460
 which we will play, that is, we can 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.719
 play for several characters 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.539
 at the same time this game is not action can not 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.239
 say but rather some kind of tactical 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.520
 probably the strategy is true here with us 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.039
 there will be only 2 characters now in this 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 the mission for the first time was only one and 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.299
 now we can give commands to two and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.299
 most effectively destroy zombareas 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.549
 who will want to destroy you so 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.549
 here our goal is to survive save the surviving 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.890
 and kill 40 zombies after this mission 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.500
 will be completed here and so 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.210
 choosing for example one character and give 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.079
 he has the command to go so true here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.229
 here we are still learning 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.770
 for example so that the whole group is gone 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.900
 need to hold will be a finger like 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.140
 and I hate all these learning here as 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.930
 they really interfere with me so much 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.090
 stopped all these damn learning I 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.520
 finally completed and now we let's 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.329
 enjoy the game to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.690
 moving the whole team is necessary 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:01.150
 hold on for a long time 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.300
 on the finger screen area and then into that 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.640
 the point will go our characters 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.350
 probably in fact you can walk and one of 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.660
 them, that is, here is such a double tap 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.760
 we press and give the command to one of 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.160
 their weapons are here to change like this 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.260
 manner accordingly fire 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.320
 weapons more than the usual radius 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.440
 so here you need to consider this too and 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.320
 so here there are various objects with 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.300
 where we can interact 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.610
 for example machines that can be turned on 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.120
 signaling music in them and thereby 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.820
 distract zombies 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.330
 here by the way two characters to play 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.220
 much better and more comfortable that's how i already 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.070
 probably said don't know cut off from or 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.080
 No, that is, a long tap, we press and the whole 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.950
 group move if we press 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.050
 double tap 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.450
 then only selected will move 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.600
 we have a character in general 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.940
 the toy is basically interesting enough 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.130
 play done relatively in 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.290
 black and white style and think a lot 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.650
 especially like 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.370
 fans of this series so 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.880
 download not be lazy and the game is in principle 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.880
 quality and interesting
