00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
though they didn't get the result they

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.070 
though they didn't get the result they
wanted<00:03:42.850> I<00:03:43.000> thought<00:03:43.210> the<00:03:43.360> performance<00:03:43.510> was

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080

there<00:03:44.470> they<00:03:44.950> were<00:03:45.070> much<00:03:45.280> better<00:03:45.490> second<00:03:45.880> our

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
there they were much better second our

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.180 
there they were much better second our

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
child didn't really get the qualities

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.560 
child didn't really get the qualities
and<00:03:50.620> wide<00:03:50.860> areas<00:03:51.310> with<00:03:51.580> improved<00:03:52.030> second<00:03:52.450> half
