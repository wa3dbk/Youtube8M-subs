 Of course we are happy. I believe that 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.420
 is also in German interest if the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.239
 German economy is on the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.710

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.040
 Of course , something unusual 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.770

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.960
