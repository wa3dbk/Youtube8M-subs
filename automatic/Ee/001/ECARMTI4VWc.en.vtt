00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the whole room but for best effect you'd

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.870 
the whole room but for best effect you'd
want<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.630> close<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> wall<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.490> corner

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
want it as close to a wall or a corner

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.200 
want it as close to a wall or a corner
as<00:01:42.030> possible<00:01:43.070> because<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.490> sound<00:01:44.880> waves

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
as possible because the sound waves

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.219 
as possible because the sound waves
bounce<00:01:45.659> back<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.820> give<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.899> like<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> bigger

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229

boom you know versus standing in the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.060 
boom you know versus standing in the
middle<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> room<00:01:53.729> something<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.390> that
