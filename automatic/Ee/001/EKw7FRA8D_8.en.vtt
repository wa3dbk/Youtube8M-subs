00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 and they were followed to the mission 47 gates and 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.280
 they started missions to be row but 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.380
 to perform your missions first 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.120
 we must buy the rc insurance store 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.370
 which is just behind our garage 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.070
 endoworm if you come to the property 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.100
 bought or sharon with ringworm back by the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.029
 store there are quite interesting things 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.390
 here 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.539
 if there are toys tank toys 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.599
 the suites are dolls also dolls 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.850
 of manhunt and also dolls 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.130
 washington on the set and it will not take time 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.030
 to discuss that later well 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.910
 after having spent a while 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.980
 After a turn we will receive 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.390
 a call and the person who is us 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.210
 calling is just sure 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.770
 follow and say good to our present 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.450
 at the moment you enter the 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.840
 property and good are you going to explain us 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.970
 quickly that is in other matters 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.579
 true but after a small 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.180
 explanation of a small talk that 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.379
 makes the promise to go visit him and 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.110
 good to also start missions 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.790
 there is just the red marker well 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.580
 now we do start the missions for their 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.920
 gnaw well there you are and gnaws crouched 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.390
 arranging his things we also see well 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.759
 there you are entering the store 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.710
 tenacious and then we're always going to see well 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.229
 as it is always going to be a little 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.130
 crestfallen a little worried a bit 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.220
 sad a little depressed sometimes 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.640
 we are also going to listen to the philosophy 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.039
 philosophize and good if I was going to think that 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.979
 is smoked think to think that is 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.619
 drugged you have to lower the dose and 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.370
 all that but partly the worry 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.340
 of ciu is real at least for him 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.370
 then after a small 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.310
 explanation if ross is going to happen to us 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.400
 explain what is your problem and your 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.140
 problem is called verb remember in the 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.300
 first mission of san fierro when a 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.060
 truth was helping us gather people 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.550
 to enter to work in the garage and 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.980
 if he was not the last person in which 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.740
 we picked up and just that moment while 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.190
 he was playing with his control toy 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.580
 remote name in your name remember said 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.640
 berg then this see click is the same 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.940
 yes berklee 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.370
 to seem to resent ciro 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.440
 because if oak won in a contest 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.920
 scientific a science fair and now 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.250
 wants to eliminate it action or if it is 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.930
 revenge uy right now they sound about 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.470
 true bleep that's see play then 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.870
 now yes row is going to explain what is it 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.930
 that is going to be berkeley in berkeley is 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.739
 putting together a whole strategy for 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.340
 knock down or destroy all 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.440
 Shutdown transmitters just come in 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.630
 toys that is but that is driving 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.120
 those toys that are airplanes but that 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.620
 they have bombs those bombs are going to be 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.300
 thrown in what are the transmitters 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.920
 and we have to avoid them and destroy them 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:11.150
 with a minimum good 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.340
 we have three minutes a little more 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.459
 three minutes to eliminate them 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.380
 we have to be quite precise that yes 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.840
 yes and fast too 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.030
 As I'm going to tell you, they have bombs and those 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.370
 are going to be thrown into the antennas are 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.460
 the transmitters and that's how to look at a 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.170
 bar there is a signal bar which 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.860
 is full now and which you have to 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.510
 prevent it from emptying completely if that 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.540
 is your goal to bring down all 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:45.000
 airplanes all the toys and take care of 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.470
 signal that does not get to empty well 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.920
 look at the planes as they are in the 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.680
 radar are those with the red symbol 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.129
 the red triangle 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.439
 and preferably I tell you to eliminate 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.420
 those who are behind us 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.060
 to those on the left side of 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.040
 we who are in the direction of what 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.879
 what is he 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.890
 the parquet those do not come so fast yes 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.079
 although it comes in a group but you can not 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.019
 forget more easily instead those that 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.669
 are behind for example this one you have to 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.199
 eliminate it from what are on the side 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.240
 like this one you also have to remove it 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.740
 because they move faster but yes 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.980
 because as you see here in a group we can 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.900
 help easily if so here too 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.280
 and here you can also forget to delete 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.560
 easily 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.270
 those assholes from here back come 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.130
 quick to you can distract you with what 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.810
 they are in front and back and at 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.370
 side advance as quickly as possible and 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.500
 they can throw the bombs and they can 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.270
 destroy what transmitters are 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.520
 I wish and that does not suit us because of that 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.900
 we have to eliminate them are behind 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.540
 us in what they are lying on 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.910
 we're fine now if we move forward 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.730
 with those in front of them 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.880
 assholes here and is one minute 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.040
 little bit more but that's how patience I know that 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.990
 this fire mission can cost you 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.820
 It may seem complicated but the 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.240
 practice as everyone says to the 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.450
 teacher if then practice a lot 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.430
 practice your aim especially if the 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.750
 mouse is very big you are going a little bit 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:21.630
 complicate that of preference to use 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.060
 a small mouse if it's an advice that you 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.900
 could give that is the biggest thing you occupy 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.280
 hand and you may not be very comfortable 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.810
 but good is a detail nothing more 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.850
 well then those that are on the side and 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.070
 they are behind remember what they are at 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.510
 front was the park they come in 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.300
 group but you can remove it more 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.360
 easily these types if they are well 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.000
 fast and these how are you distracted with 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.889
 the front come from behind study as 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.310
 cowards and you throw the bombs so 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.660
 you have to be pretty fast and precise 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.590
 in this asshole here we are going to 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.060
 eliminate already left 13 is game group 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.620
 always then we are going to offer the well 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.620
 do not worry much about them 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:10.980
 There's the back just almost lance 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.080
 we have to be fast well here good 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.340
 weather 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.919
 and we have protected well what are the 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.169
 then all transmitters close 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.599
 quiet for now say it is 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.879
 quiet , he was a little bit 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:28.759
 concern and in the end I made a 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:32.750
 nonsense that is nonsense to say but 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:35.689
 well then we have helped efficient and 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.969
 effectively doing it all has come out very 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.990
 ok well there is transmission 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:40.729
 overcome 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.680
 dale life right now do not tell us in the next 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.680
 video followed the friends 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.990
 remember to visit my new guide channel 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.910
 instants networks where would be 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.199
 uploading missions from other games the 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.490
 link you will be able to find in the
