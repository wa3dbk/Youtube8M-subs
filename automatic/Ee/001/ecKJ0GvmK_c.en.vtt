yourlust of creative selfie us out and

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.169 
yourlust of creative selfie us out and
open<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.319> you<00:01:30.499> can<00:01:30.740> create<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.159> four<00:01:31.490> wide<00:01:31.759> set

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
open so you can create a four wide set

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.660 
open so you can create a four wide set
by<00:01:32.600> not<00:01:32.869> taking<00:01:33.109> you<00:01:33.439> off<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.799> field<00:01:34.039> exactly

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
by not taking you off the field exactly

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.190 
by not taking you off the field exactly
instead<00:01:34.999> of<00:01:35.119> three<00:01:35.329> wides<00:01:35.569> in<00:01:35.719> a<00:01:35.810> tight<00:01:35.990> end

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
instead of three wides in a tight end

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.050 
instead of three wides in a tight end
you<00:01:36.319> become<00:01:36.619> basically<00:01:36.799> reduces<00:01:37.429> or<00:01:37.549> kings<00:01:37.880> or

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
you become basically reduces or kings or

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.940 
you become basically reduces or kings or
exactly<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:38.929> offers<00:01:39.170> versatility<00:01:39.799> is<00:01:39.859> the

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
exactly and it offers versatility is the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.379 
exactly and it offers versatility is the
fact<00:01:40.189> that<00:01:40.280> we<00:01:40.460> were<00:01:40.549> able<00:01:40.609> to<00:01:40.789> come<00:01:40.969> in<00:01:41.119> block

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:41.389 
fact that we were able to come in block

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:43.179 
fact that we were able to come in block

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
backfield a few times yep make them

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.169 
backfield a few times yep make them
heavier<00:01:48.530> open<00:01:49.100> or<00:01:49.280> even<00:01:49.579> down<00:01:49.729> on<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:49.999> wing

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
and that gives you a little bit of

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.959 
and that gives you a little bit of
motion<00:01:51.560> maybe<00:01:51.770> check<00:01:52.039> if<00:01:52.310> it's<00:01:52.520> man<00:01:52.729> or<00:01:52.939> zone

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
motion maybe check if it's man or zone

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.760 
motion maybe check if it's man or zone
sometimes<00:01:53.359> yeah<00:01:53.689> yep<00:01:54.049> we<00:01:54.170> have<00:01:54.259> a<00:01:54.289> couple<00:01:54.469> sets

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770

we<00:01:56.060> have<00:01:56.149> motion<00:01:56.299> we're<00:01:56.569> swinging<00:01:56.840> across

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
we have motion we're swinging across

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.779 
we have motion we're swinging across
stuff<00:01:57.409> like<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.590> coming<00:01:58.039> back<00:01:58.189> across<00:01:58.609> the

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
stuff like that coming back across the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:59.919 
stuff like that coming back across the
line<00:01:58.939> think<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.270> guy<00:01:59.359> didn't<00:01:59.569> kick-out<00:01:59.779> block
