00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
several years till they're 11 or 12 how

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.730 
several years till they're 11 or 12 how
does<00:02:52.520> orthodontic<00:02:52.940> treatment<00:02:53.420> work<00:02:53.740> well

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
does orthodontic treatment work well

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.590 
does orthodontic treatment work well
what<00:02:55.010> we<00:02:55.100> do<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.280> being<00:02:55.790> teeth<00:02:56.000> through<00:02:56.360> bone

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
what we do is being teeth through bone

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.070 
what we do is being teeth through bone
so<00:02:57.290> if<00:02:57.440> we<00:02:57.530> use<00:02:57.560> very<00:02:57.920> light<00:02:58.910> gentle<00:02:59.420> pressures

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
so if we use very light gentle pressures

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.590 
so if we use very light gentle pressures
but<00:03:00.410> if<00:03:00.620> their<00:03:00.800> continuous<00:03:01.370> pressures<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:02.420> can

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
but if their continuous pressures we can

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.960 
but if their continuous pressures we can
actually<00:03:02.990> get<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:04.100> teeth<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.790> move

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
actually get the the teeth to move

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.760 
actually get the the teeth to move
through<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.450> solid<00:03:05.630> bone<00:03:05.960> what<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:06.650> the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
through the solid bone what is the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.640 
through the solid bone what is the
duration<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.640> treatment<00:03:08.500> generally<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
duration of the treatment generally the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.440 
duration of the treatment generally the
treatment<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.100> about<00:03:10.310> two<00:03:10.610> years<00:03:10.910> but<00:03:11.360> it

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
treatment is about two years but it

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.610 
treatment is about two years but it
could<00:03:11.570> be<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.720> little<00:03:11.870> bit<00:03:12.020> lesser<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.350> little
