setting and the mysticism of the world
the<00:03:32.420> concept<00:03:32.840> was<00:03:32.989> this<00:03:33.500> elf<00:03:33.859> flight<00:03:34.430> plan

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
the concept was this elf flight plan

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.629 
the concept was this elf flight plan
trace<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.540> early<00:03:36.379> on<00:03:36.530> there<00:03:36.920> were<00:03:37.069> humans

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.349 
with pointy ears and plant accessories
and<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.790> was<00:03:40.909> really<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.209> first

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
and that was really the first

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.020 
and that was really the first
incarnation<00:03:42.079> with<00:03:42.950> all<00:03:43.129> of<00:03:43.159> those<00:03:43.370> concepts

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
incarnation with all of those concepts

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.039 
incarnation with all of those concepts
of<00:03:44.299> what<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.900> Suvari<00:03:45.260> was<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:46.549> sylvari<00:03:47.090> are<00:03:47.510> a

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
of what the Suvari was the sylvari are a

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.259 
of what the Suvari was the sylvari are a
mystic<00:03:48.650> race<00:03:48.919> who<00:03:49.430> have<00:03:49.639> come<00:03:49.909> from<00:03:50.150> the

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
mystic race who have come from the

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.140 
mystic race who have come from the
depths<00:03:50.629> of<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.840> forest<00:03:51.159> they<00:03:52.159> are<00:03:52.579> an

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
depths of the forest they are an

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.000 
depths of the forest they are an
expression<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.019> land<00:03:54.290> as<00:03:54.680> much<00:03:54.859> as

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
expression of the land as much as

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.879 
expression of the land as much as
anything<00:03:55.250> else<00:03:55.519> so<00:03:56.450> we<00:03:56.900> really<00:03:57.169> wanted<00:03:57.439> to<00:03:57.590> try

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
anything else so we really wanted to try

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.800 
anything else so we really wanted to try
to<00:03:57.950> address<00:03:58.099> this<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:59.180> really<00:03:59.450> wanted<00:03:59.659> to

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
to address this and I really wanted to

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.539 
to address this and I really wanted to
invade<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:00.230> plant<00:04:00.620> like<00:04:00.889> qualities<00:04:01.370> and

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
invade the plant like qualities and

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.129 
invade the plant like qualities and
really<00:04:01.790> come<00:04:01.969> up<00:04:02.000> with<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.269> design<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:02.719> was<00:04:03.079> a

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
really come up with a design that was a

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.629 
really come up with a design that was a
marriage<00:04:03.409> of<00:04:03.560> those<00:04:03.739> two<00:04:03.980> aesthetics<00:04:04.459> and

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
marriage of those two aesthetics and

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.220 
marriage of those two aesthetics and
this<00:04:05.120> is<00:04:05.239> where<00:04:05.389> I<00:04:05.419> first<00:04:05.510> came<00:04:05.870> up<00:04:06.049> with<00:04:06.079> a

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
this is where I first came up with a

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.690 
this is where I first came up with a
little<00:04:06.590> bit<00:04:06.739> more<00:04:06.919> of<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.219> design<00:04:07.549> that

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
little bit more of the design that

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:21.950 
little bit more of the design that
you're<00:04:07.819> going<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.120> be<00:04:08.209> seeing<00:04:08.359> now

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.180 

as<00:04:22.960> for<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.229> redesign<00:04:23.620> when<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.800> first<00:04:24.039> tried

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
as for the redesign when I first tried

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.920 
as for the redesign when I first tried
to<00:04:24.430> pick<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:24.699> up<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.240> thing<00:04:25.419> that<00:04:25.539> I<00:04:25.600> really

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
to pick it up the thing that I really

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.719 
to pick it up the thing that I really
wanted<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.289> make<00:04:26.620> different<00:04:27.070> about<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.340> was

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
wanted to make different about it was

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.460 
wanted to make different about it was
their<00:04:27.970> Anatomy<00:04:28.509> I<00:04:28.660> didn't<00:04:29.050> want<00:04:29.139> just<00:04:29.380> a

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
their Anatomy I didn't want just a

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.560 
their Anatomy I didn't want just a
painted<00:04:29.800> human<00:04:30.100> with<00:04:30.220> pointy<00:04:30.580> ears<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
painted human with pointy ears the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.990 
painted human with pointy ears the
sylvari<00:04:32.199> are<00:04:32.500> born<00:04:32.830> from<00:04:33.039> a<00:04:33.160> tree<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:33.520> over

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
sylvari are born from a tree and over

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.240 
sylvari are born from a tree and over
the<00:04:34.090> course<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.539> the<00:04:34.650> 250<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.800> more<00:04:35.949> years

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
the course of the 250 and more years

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.640 
the course of the 250 and more years
that<00:04:36.430> have<00:04:36.550> passed<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:37.570> tree<00:04:37.840> has<00:04:38.139> become

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
that have passed the tree has become

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.129 
that have passed the tree has become
sort<00:04:39.009> of<00:04:39.070> sentient<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.699> 25<00:04:40.479> years<00:04:40.690> ago<00:04:40.840> the

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
sort of sentient and 25 years ago the

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.749 
sort of sentient and 25 years ago the
first<00:04:41.289> so<00:04:41.530> far<00:04:41.680> i<00:04:41.710> blossomed<00:04:41.979> from<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.550> tree

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
first so far i blossomed from the tree

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.090 
first so far i blossomed from the tree
and<00:04:43.060> went<00:04:43.419> forth<00:04:43.660> into<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.960> world<00:04:44.139> and<00:04:44.440> so

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
and went forth into the world and so

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.060 
and went forth into the world and so
they<00:04:45.580> are<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.090> anatomy<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:47.380> creation<00:04:47.740> of

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
they are the anatomy of this creation of

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.740 
they are the anatomy of this creation of
plants<00:04:48.430> coming<00:04:48.610> together<00:04:48.820> for<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.300> human<00:04:49.539> de

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
plants coming together for a human de

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.620 
plants coming together for a human de
Tosh<00:04:49.960> so<00:04:50.349> if<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.590> have<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:51.130> brow<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:52.300> would<00:04:52.509> be

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
Tosh so if you have a brow that would be

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.360 
Tosh so if you have a brow that would be
on<00:04:52.750> your<00:04:52.870> character<00:04:53.349> yes<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:53.889> face<00:04:54.070> will<00:04:54.340> look

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
on your character yes the face will look

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.450 
on your character yes the face will look
human<00:04:55.360> but<00:04:55.570> it's<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:55.960> lot<00:04:56.139> less<00:04:56.320> human<00:04:56.740> than<00:04:56.770> the

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
human but it's a lot less human than the

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.749 
human but it's a lot less human than the
last<00:04:57.639> design<00:04:58.150> but<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:58.930> brow<00:04:59.199> is<00:04:59.590> not<00:05:00.430> created

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
last design but that brow is not created

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.909 
last design but that brow is not created
because<00:05:01.060> there<00:05:01.389> is<00:05:01.509> an<00:05:01.630> eyebrow<00:05:02.050> as<00:05:02.320> part<00:05:02.830> of

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
because there is an eyebrow as part of

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.430 
because there is an eyebrow as part of
the<00:05:03.009> face<00:05:03.190> it's<00:05:03.849> actually<00:05:04.060> created<00:05:04.750> as<00:05:04.930> five

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440
