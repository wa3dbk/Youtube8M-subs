00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.030
 I note for the presentation of a box 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.280
 so in fact I was subscribed to the soup 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.110
 but she stopped and for the 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.130
 last boxing is first because 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.889
 it's a three month subscription 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:21.380
 it's actually secret from us that has 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:24.970
 taken back like that so that's the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.970
 first I get 2nd and the last 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:38.960
 looks like that so that's the 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:40.280
 menu so I will not watch it star 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:48.589
 to see this case of dengue but I'm going to 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:57.500
 keep aside in the event or we 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:59.570
 find a little really like that I 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.670
 think about following 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:07.070
 so what do we have so we have a 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.409
 special offer for years subscribers 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.299
 at the box 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:19.520
 so I look at me they make us a 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.109
 offer with prices for it be a little 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.619
 cheaper that we continue to subscribe to 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.750
 their box 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.039
 so I do not think I subscribe 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.920
 it was just like that to test a 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.469
 missing and so that's a map we have 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.719
 I find it too beautiful 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:37.670
 it's too much he had a little bottle 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:40.429
 mustache me so I love it I 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:50.569
 I'll put it on my board 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:53.460
 in this film there a pencil is a 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:58.440
 grimoire cause 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.440
 so a black pencil 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:16.590
 this works well building 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:22.739
 so then we have a little gift like 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:34.440
 that without damaging the little sticker case 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:37.709
 where it's great it's my gift then 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:45.810
 this is the map of the shop from where that 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:52.410
 go out and in it we have a wave a little 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:57.079
 big around I will not a fan 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:00.739
 I do not like the admr to go there 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.739
 she will be constrained 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:17.290
 the windlass then we have a 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:20.230
 bookmark amelie we do not know it's 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:27.370
 for them a Corsican and the shoes 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.910
 which folds in the evening to work 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.400
 car 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.709
 this father thing is your solution 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.840
 understands it's a moment 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.110
 well I do not understand that then 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.560
 then we have accounts worried about 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.560
 the moustache 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.500
 this is the con there are two small 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:04:01.650
 cookie earrings is too cabbage 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:04:14.939
 then we have that we do not know 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:20.669
 and then we have a funny blaze 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:23.820
 looks like a monster and that's 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.850
 everything and nothing if it's not fair that 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.990
 that's a lot so it's actually all 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.840
 what I left a rescuer and 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:36.620
 goodies and that's boxing 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.050
 bah is whatever is in the box 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.070
 I think I'm a little disappointed it's not 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.990
 because it's not the ring I'm 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.699

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.740
 pretty but I think it's cool and 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:54.810
 I do not really like the curls 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.340
 ears there that I will give to 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.229
 lola the earrings I do not know 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.960

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.919

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.180
