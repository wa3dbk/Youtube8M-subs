you<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.339> electronics<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.150> come<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.629> far

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
you know electronics have come so far

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.539 
you know electronics have come so far
even<00:00:13.379> over<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.860> last<00:00:13.889> couple<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.490> years

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
even over just the last couple of years

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.630 
even over just the last couple of years
now<00:00:15.259> instead<00:00:16.259> of<00:00:16.320> just<00:00:16.410> standard<00:00:16.920> sonar<00:00:17.400> we're

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
now instead of just standard sonar we're

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.089 
now instead of just standard sonar we're
using<00:00:17.820> structure<00:00:18.480> scan<00:00:18.630> technology<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.680> we

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
using structure scan technology and we

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.400 
using structure scan technology and we
got<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> question<00:00:20.750> through<00:00:21.750> Twitter<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.259> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
got a question through Twitter just the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.080 
got a question through Twitter just the
other<00:00:22.529> day<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.740> said<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.550> guy<00:00:23.700> had

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
other day that said this guy had

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.470 
other day that said this guy had
invested<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.169> all<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.980> new<00:00:26.160> electronics<00:00:27.059> but

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
invested in all the new electronics but

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.359 
invested in all the new electronics but
he<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.689> frustrated<00:00:28.380> because<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.919> picture

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
he was frustrated because the picture

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.010 
he was frustrated because the picture
that<00:00:29.550> he<00:00:29.640> was<00:00:29.759> seeing<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.149> his<00:00:30.329> electronics

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
that he was seeing on his electronics

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.810 
that he was seeing on his electronics
wasn't<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> same<00:00:31.980> as<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.279> he<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.489> seeing<00:00:32.700> in

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
wasn't the same as what he was seeing in

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.459 
wasn't the same as what he was seeing in
though<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.300> book<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:34.350> the

and he's gonna show me one of the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.600 
and he's gonna show me one of the
biggest<00:00:44.850> problems<00:00:45.570> about<00:00:46.380> getting<00:00:47.220> your

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
biggest problems about getting your

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.910 
biggest problems about getting your
electronics<00:00:48.239> dialed<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.200> transducer

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
electronics dialed in is the transducer

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.010 
electronics dialed in is the transducer
you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.340> spend<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.030> much<00:00:51.210> money<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.690> want

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you can spend as much money as you want

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.350 
you can spend as much money as you want
to<00:00:52.200> but<00:00:52.380> if<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.560> don't<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.950> this<00:00:53.280> dialed<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
to but if you don't have this dialed in

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.790 
to but if you don't have this dialed in
you're<00:00:54.899> not<00:00:54.989> gonna<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> right<00:00:55.530> image

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you're not gonna see the right image

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.590 
you're not gonna see the right image
that<00:00:56.010> writes<00:00:56.220> correct<00:00:56.610> that's<00:00:56.850> right<00:00:57.060> so<00:00:57.390> show

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
that writes correct that's right so show

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.120 
that writes correct that's right so show
me<00:00:57.630> show<00:00:58.050> me<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.200> we<00:00:58.470> got<00:00:58.649> here

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
me show me what we got here

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.920 
me show me what we got here
so<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> come<00:00:59.880> down<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.450> look<00:01:00.660> what

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
so if you come down here and look what

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.189 
so if you come down here and look what
this<00:01:01.290> is<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.100> first-generation

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
this is is the first-generation

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.649 
this is is the first-generation
structure<00:01:04.199> scan<00:01:04.549> transducer<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.509> of<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
structure scan transducer and one of the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.389 
structure scan transducer and one of the
most<00:01:06.899> important<00:01:07.380> things<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> has<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> do

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
most important things that it has to do

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.969 
most important things that it has to do
is<00:01:08.579> be<00:01:08.759> parallel<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> bottom<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
is be parallel with the bottom of the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:11.990 
is be parallel with the bottom of the
boat<00:01:11.189> okay

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
boat okay

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.740 
boat okay
even<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.659> slight<00:01:12.810> down<00:01:13.259> tilt<00:01:13.909> like<00:01:14.909> I've<00:01:15.420> seen<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
even a slight down tilt like I've seen a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.420 
even a slight down tilt like I've seen a
lot<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.140> boats<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> mounted<00:01:17.250> up

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
lot of boats they have a mounted up

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.390 
lot of boats they have a mounted up
above<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:17.970> waterline<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.810> get

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
above the waterline so you get

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.530 
above the waterline so you get
cavitation<00:01:20.400> leaving<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> back<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> boat

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
cavitation leaving the back of the boat

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
cavitation leaving the back of the boat
and<00:01:21.690> once<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.260> air<00:01:22.470> bubbles<00:01:22.890> over<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and once you get air bubbles over the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
and once you get air bubbles over the
face<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.820> deucer<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.810> won't

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
face of that deucer then it won't

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.380 
face of that deucer then it won't
perform<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.560> well<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.100> should<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.729> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
perform as well as it should right so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.060 
perform as well as it should right so
and<00:01:27.840> then<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> also<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> look<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.040> front

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and then you also have to look in front

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.430 
and then you also have to look in front
of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> transducer<00:01:30.330> is<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.690> a<00:01:30.720> pickup<00:01:31.080> or

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
of the transducer is there a pickup or

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.560 
of the transducer is there a pickup or
something<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.010> can<00:01:32.190> cause<00:01:32.430> cavitation<00:01:33.060> huh

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
something that can cause cavitation huh

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.350 
something that can cause cavitation huh
on<00:01:34.080> this<00:01:34.350> boat<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:34.830> have<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.010> stepped<00:01:35.400> also<00:01:36.000> will

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
on this boat we have a stepped also will

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.200 
on this boat we have a stepped also will
not<00:01:36.659> work<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.140> any<00:01:37.350> type<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.830> speed<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.060> we

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
not work at any type of speed but all we

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.550 
not work at any type of speed but all we
want<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> work<00:01:39.780> good<00:01:40.080> is<00:01:40.260> at<00:01:40.439> your

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
want this to work good is at your

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
want this to work good is at your
trolling<00:01:40.860> speeds<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.549> know<00:01:41.670> under<00:01:42.000> 10<00:01:42.210> miles

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
trolling speeds you know under 10 miles

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.050 
trolling speeds you know under 10 miles
an<00:01:42.750> hour<00:01:42.869> okay<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.310> looks<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> good

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
an hour okay but this looks like a good

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.359 
an hour okay but this looks like a good
installation<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.619> know<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.010> you<00:01:47.130> ever

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
installation and you know if you ever

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.130 
installation and you know if you ever
hit<00:01:47.700> something<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.270> water<00:01:48.600> sometimes

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
hit something in the water sometimes
