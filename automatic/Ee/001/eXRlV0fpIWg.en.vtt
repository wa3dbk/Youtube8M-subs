00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.970
 a good tutorial you should already know the 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:12.670

 a cell phone a device or tablet 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.480
 android 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.760
 good what they can do is go to 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.580
 configurations synchronize devices 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.730
 they will seem to train 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.180
 youtube.com is the pair enter this 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.610
 code to synchronize are going to be is in 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.220
 your cell phone or tablet 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.200
 and whether they do it from the browser 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.200
 or simply from the application 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:48.000
 it's very easy florida on the menu 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.860
 and youtube will ask for the code 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.160
 synchronization and that you assign a 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.160
 first name 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.730
 your television station they are going to connect me 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.540
 I've already done it so I will not do it and I 'll 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.540
 they give here in ready 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.420
 It takes me a while to move and record at 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.229
 Same time 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.229
 now for example 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.160
 I here and my liquid process 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.160
 synchronized 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.990
 and I put the 60th position on my screen 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.720
 connected to 360 I'm looking for a video to 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.740
 live on the television 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:38.080
 for example this black ops 2 exter 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.080
 easter egg nectar in 2025 online 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.610
 you can add it to the queue to see 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.610
 when I am 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.930
 and they can give you project 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.820
 automatically here as you can see 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.659
 is loading 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.010
 2 and hysterical lockdown 2025 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.870
 of 2013 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.970
 good and it will load 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.780
 hello roasters how are you here 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.780
 next to all of you 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.260
 what they were where our command would be 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.220
 the cell phone or the tablet what has not 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.220
 we can advance the video 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:39.120
 and right there he went ahead 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:42.830
 yesterday it was not going to load and until the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.830
 minute they passed it 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.890
 because I repeat that if we leave not 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.870
 can carry out 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.280
 this map application 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.090
 so like since I thought he 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.090
 marcelito this too 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.950
 so when we finish 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.120
 and they can not 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.770
 they can pass 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.430
 from 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.950
 with remote favorite bakers 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.110
 and I dont know 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.310
 and I 'm late which I'm the last one 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.310
 it puts to play but 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:40.060
 and then see your facebook though 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.660
 It's amazing how inside 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.660
 you can see 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.770
 well, good 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.510
 and I also 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.800
 until juan da vida and beige adriana with 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.500
 the little screen and they change automatically 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.920
 those people have to give him play but he's 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.850
 very useful when commenting on 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.850
 example may be fine 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.420
 when in a like 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.819
 anything serves many applications 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.890
 and some added for money 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.849
 the bad thing is that at night time 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.849
 to get to the church 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.500
 where you need the queue to see them 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.540
 it can be 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.440
 well that I also come for the color 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.440
 lover you can tell them 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:56.300
 as I told you this would be fine with the 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:06.250
 expression device synchronization 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:06.250
 very good favorites to square
