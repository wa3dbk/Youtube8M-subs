so<00:00:03.360> here's<00:00:03.540> my<00:00:03.600> sump<00:00:04.130> located<00:00:05.130> right<00:00:05.460> below<00:00:05.670> my

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
so here's my sump located right below my

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.950 
so here's my sump located right below my
tank<00:00:06.470> you<00:00:07.470> can<00:00:07.770> see<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.040> water<00:00:08.630> this<00:00:09.630> over

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
tank you can see the water this over

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.640 
tank you can see the water this over
here<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.200> where<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.790> water<00:00:11.790> comes<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
here is where the water comes in and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.860 
here is where the water comes in and
then<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.799> goes<00:00:14.009> down<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.490> filter<00:00:14.790> bag<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.750> case

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
then it goes down the filter bag in case

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.200 
then it goes down the filter bag in case
there's<00:00:16.080> any<00:00:16.170> big<00:00:16.410> chunks<00:00:16.619> or<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.880> case<00:00:18.029> my

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
there's any big chunks or in case my

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.439 
there's any big chunks or in case my
pipefish<00:00:18.690> decides<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.830> swim<00:00:20.070> down<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.460> then<00:00:21.119> he

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
pipefish decides to swim down it then he

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.150 
pipefish decides to swim down it then he
won't<00:00:21.600> end<00:00:21.779> up<00:00:21.900> getting<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.890> getting

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
won't end up getting in here and getting

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.009 
won't end up getting in here and getting
sucked<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.550> by<00:00:23.670> something<00:00:23.910> else<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.869> my

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
sucked up by something else this is my

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.359 
sucked up by something else this is my
protein<00:00:25.410> skimmer<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:27.060> suds<00:00:27.859> take<00:00:28.859> up<00:00:29.070> any

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
protein skimmer the suds take up any

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.380 
protein skimmer the suds take up any
dirt<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.380> bring<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.470> up<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.890> over<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.090> it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
dirt and bring it up and over and it

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.660 
dirt and bring it up and over and it
goes<00:00:33.600> into<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.899> container<00:00:34.250> this<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
goes into this container this is the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.750 
goes into this container this is the
water<00:00:36.559> that's<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.190> back<00:00:38.370> into<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
water that's going up and back into the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.209 
water that's going up and back into the
tank<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:39.570> i<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.379> block<00:00:40.680> in

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
tank right here i have a little block in

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.180 
tank right here i have a little block in
case<00:00:41.629> when<00:00:42.629> i<00:00:42.660> turn<00:00:42.899> off<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.140> pump<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.980> way

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
case when i turn off the pump that way

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.670 
case when i turn off the pump that way
it<00:00:44.370> doesn't<00:00:44.660> siphon<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.840> into<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> tank

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it doesn't siphon back into the tank

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.709 
it doesn't siphon back into the tank
here<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.539> overflow<00:00:49.160> lots<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.309> creatures

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
here and overflow lots of creatures

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.360 
here and overflow lots of creatures
going<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.340> got<00:00:53.340> some<00:00:54.920> sponges<00:00:55.920> i<00:00:56.160> guess

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
going in there got some sponges i guess

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.750 
going in there got some sponges i guess
is<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.550> they're<00:00:56.760> called<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.660> probably

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
is what they're called and probably

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.389 
is what they're called and probably
little<00:00:59.760> teeny<00:01:00.059> anemones<00:01:01.070> think<00:01:02.070> i<00:01:02.190> say<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
little teeny anemones think i say that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.910 
little teeny anemones think i say that
right<00:01:03.049> i'm<00:01:04.049> quite<00:01:04.379> sure<00:01:05.270> over<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.920> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
right i'm quite sure over here is the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.710 
right i'm quite sure over here is the
calcium<00:01:08.460> reactor<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:09.030> kind<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> hard<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> see

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
calcium reactor it's kind of hard to see

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.010 
calcium reactor it's kind of hard to see
i<00:01:09.750> couldn't<00:01:10.290> fit<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.530> inside<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.010> bottom

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
i couldn't fit it inside the bottom

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.300 
i couldn't fit it inside the bottom
underneath<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.320> tank<00:01:13.560> i<00:01:14.299> get<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.360> flashlight

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
underneath the tank i get a flashlight

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.030 
underneath the tank i get a flashlight
point<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:18.119> there's<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.689> granules<00:01:19.619> there

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
point it see there's the granules there

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.110 
point it see there's the granules there
and<00:01:22.460> top<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:25.430> this<00:01:26.430> over<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.240> co2

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
and top of it this over here is the co2

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.980 
and top of it this over here is the co2
helps<00:01:30.070> with<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.130> calcium<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.000> right<00:01:32.690> there

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
helps with the calcium and right there

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.450 
helps with the calcium and right there
is<00:01:33.290> the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
is the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.000 
is the
calcium<00:01:35.240> drip

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
calcium drip

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.690 
calcium drip
into<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.520> Sun

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.639 

and<00:01:41.360> then<00:01:41.479> over<00:01:41.750> here<00:01:42.020> we<00:01:42.700> have<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:44.649> water

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
and then over here we have the water

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.669 
and then over here we have the water
cooling<00:01:46.130> system<00:01:47.710> with<00:01:48.710> those<00:01:49.130> how<00:01:49.520> lasers<00:01:50.060> to

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
cooling system with those how lasers to

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.389 
cooling system with those how lasers to
think<00:01:51.679> there<00:01:51.890> are<00:01:52.100> 150<00:01:52.520> watt<00:01:52.850> halides<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:55.189> kind

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
think there are 150 watt halides it kind

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.520 
think there are 150 watt halides it kind
of<00:01:55.520> warms<00:01:55.820> up<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:55.939> water<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.689> this<00:01:57.289> thing

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
of warms up the water so this thing

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.990 
of warms up the water so this thing
turns<00:01:57.829> on<00:01:58.039> every<00:01:58.310> now<00:01:58.429> and<00:01:58.579> then<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:58.789> cool<00:01:58.970> down

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
turns on every now and then to cool down

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.919 
turns on every now and then to cool down
the<00:01:59.270> water<00:01:59.450> you<00:02:00.170> can<00:02:00.319> see<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.619> algae<00:02:01.929> purple

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
the water you can see the algae purple

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.639 
the water you can see the algae purple
algae<00:02:03.289> red<00:02:03.590> algae<00:02:03.799> growing<00:02:04.700> in<00:02:04.939> there<00:02:05.649> that's

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
algae red algae growing in there that's

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.949 
algae red algae growing in there that's
definitely<00:02:07.189> a<00:02:07.250> good<00:02:07.460> thing<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:08.360> also<00:02:08.569> see

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
definitely a good thing and also see

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.890 
definitely a good thing and also see
some<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.819> growing<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.330> side<00:02:11.540> thereof

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
some of it growing on the side thereof

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.570 
some of it growing on the side thereof
my<00:02:12.049> tank<00:02:14.769> like<00:02:15.769> good<00:02:15.950> thing<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:16.190> get<00:02:16.340> I've<00:02:16.400> only

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
my tank like good thing I get I've only

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.620 
my tank like good thing I get I've only
got<00:02:16.760> some<00:02:16.970> brown<00:02:17.239> algae<00:02:17.540> too<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:19.700> kind<00:02:20.329> of<00:02:20.360> mixed

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
got some brown algae too I kind of mixed

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.430 
got some brown algae too I kind of mixed
the<00:02:20.750> sand<00:02:20.989> up<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.260> little<00:02:21.500> bit<00:02:22.630> but<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:24.110> can<00:02:24.260> see

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
the sand up a little bit but you can see

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.170 
the sand up a little bit but you can see
the<00:02:24.560> brown<00:02:24.739> algae<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.250> coming<00:02:25.640> out<00:02:25.790> because<00:02:25.970> I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the brown algae is coming out because I

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.550 
the brown algae is coming out because I
put<00:02:26.360> some<00:02:26.569> new<00:02:27.019> sand<00:02:27.319> in<00:02:27.530> their<00:02:29.319> substrate

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.710 

this<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.680> my<00:02:33.890> cat's<00:02:34.640> eye<00:02:34.849> over<00:02:35.120> here<00:02:35.360> he's<00:02:35.540> not

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
this is my cat's eye over here he's not

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.420 
this is my cat's eye over here he's not
doing<00:02:36.019> too<00:02:36.049> well<00:02:36.200> he's<00:02:36.769> not<00:02:36.950> putting<00:02:37.310> his

one as well this appears a UV when I had

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.140 
one as well this appears a UV when I had
that<00:04:46.419> kick<00:04:46.660> issue<00:04:47.050> I<00:04:47.200> was<00:04:47.410> going<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.800> use<00:04:48.150> this

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
that kick issue I was going to use this

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.570 
that kick issue I was going to use this
as<00:04:49.360> a<00:04:49.390> last<00:04:49.630> resort<00:04:49.990> but<00:04:50.680> I've<00:04:50.830> heard<00:04:51.010> this<00:04:51.250> can

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
as a last resort but I've heard this can

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.940 
as a last resort but I've heard this can
kill<00:04:51.940> some<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.510> good<00:04:52.690> algae<00:04:53.080> that's

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
kill some of the good algae that's

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.440 
kill some of the good algae that's
floating<00:04:54.430> in<00:04:54.550> your<00:04:54.700> water<00:04:54.850> so<00:04:55.150> I'm<00:04:55.210> glad<00:04:55.419> I

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
floating in your water so I'm glad I

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.440 
floating in your water so I'm glad I
didn't<00:04:55.750> have<00:04:55.810> to<00:04:55.930> use<00:04:56.140> it<00:04:56.320> but<00:04:56.350> I<00:04:57.180> did<00:04:58.180> pick<00:04:58.330> it

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
didn't have to use it but I did pick it

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.950 
didn't have to use it but I did pick it
up<00:04:58.570> just<00:04:58.690> in<00:04:58.870> case<00:04:58.900> so<00:04:59.410> now<00:04:59.620> I'm<00:04:59.710> using<00:04:59.860> it<00:05:00.130> to

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.060 
up just in case so now I'm using it to
filter<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.140> water<00:05:02.169> here<00:05:02.820> in<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:04.000> RO<00:05:04.180> system

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
filter the water here in the RO system

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.440 
filter the water here in the RO system
because<00:05:06.070> it<00:05:06.100> kind<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.490> sits<00:05:06.880> for<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.330> while

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
because it kind of sits for a while

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.750 
because it kind of sits for a while
sometimes<00:05:07.890> but<00:05:10.590> using<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.740> inside<00:05:12.100> of<00:05:12.220> it<00:05:12.370> I

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
sometimes but using the inside of it I

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.400 
sometimes but using the inside of it I
got<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:15.300> heater<00:05:16.300> down<00:05:16.419> there<00:05:16.870> and<00:05:17.200> it's<00:05:18.130> on<00:05:18.430> a

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
got the heater down there and it's on a

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.360 
got the heater down there and it's on a
floater<00:05:20.410> system<00:05:21.220> so<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:23.560> fills<00:05:23.770> up<00:05:23.919> to<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.190> top

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
floater system so it fills up to the top

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.080 
floater system so it fills up to the top
it<00:05:24.640> stops<00:05:24.940> filling<00:05:25.750> it's<00:05:25.930> really<00:05:26.260> slow<00:05:26.590> though

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
it stops filling it's really slow though

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.210 
it stops filling it's really slow though
it<00:05:28.090> takes<00:05:28.240> like<00:05:28.479> two<00:05:28.660> days<00:05:28.840> actually<00:05:29.830> probably

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
it takes like two days actually probably

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.750 
it takes like two days actually probably
took<00:05:30.430> about<00:05:31.590> three<00:05:32.590> days<00:05:32.800> for<00:05:33.160> this<00:05:33.310> to<00:05:33.520> fill

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
took about three days for this to fill

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.290 
took about three days for this to fill
up<00:05:33.940> at<00:05:35.010> still<00:05:36.010> definitely<00:05:36.280> worth<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:36.760> but<00:05:37.270> I

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
up at still definitely worth it but I

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.300 
up at still definitely worth it but I
got<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.720> don't<00:05:38.500> know<00:05:38.650> what<00:05:38.770> to<00:05:38.890> do<00:05:39.010> without<00:05:39.130> it

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
got it don't know what to do without it

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:47.719 
got it don't know what to do without it
I<00:05:39.610> can<00:05:40.060> make<00:05:40.150> my<00:05:40.300> own<00:05:40.330> salt<00:05:40.690> water

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729
