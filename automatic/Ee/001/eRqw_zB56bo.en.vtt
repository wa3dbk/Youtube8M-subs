00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
15 seconds it will deal 30 live life

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
15 seconds it will deal 30 live life
points<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.140> damage<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.530> every<00:01:16.890> monster<00:01:17.340> around

yet but I've noticed that it's not
really<00:02:55.670> necessary<00:02:55.820> so<00:02:56.329> why<00:02:56.480> not<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.900> if<00:02:57.380> I

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
really necessary so why not and if I

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.410 
really necessary so why not and if I
ever<00:02:57.590> get<00:02:58.010> around<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.400> binding<00:02:59.030> more<00:02:59.239> i'll

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.140 
walk around like a tank and I might
switch<00:04:18.620> this<00:04:18.739> out<00:04:18.860> by<00:04:19.010> like<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.220> primal<00:04:19.940> helm

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
and a primal Plex later if I actually

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.810 
and a primal Plex later if I actually
get<00:04:23.600> those<00:04:23.750> binds<00:04:24.110> but<00:04:24.260> as<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.410> said<00:04:24.530> before<00:04:24.820> I'm
