see how this is starting to let me get
my<00:01:52.340> shadow<00:01:52.549> out<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.030> way<00:01:53.150> there<00:01:54.080> we<00:01:54.170> go

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
my shadow out of the way there we go

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.289 
my shadow out of the way there we go
okay<00:01:54.680> that's<00:01:54.799> better<00:01:55.009> you<00:01:55.670> could<00:01:55.820> see<00:01:56.090> how

okay that's better you could see how

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.749 
okay that's better you could see how
this<00:01:56.479> material<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.470> starting<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.579> bond<00:01:59.619> to<00:02:00.759> the

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
this material is starting to bond to the

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.700 
this material is starting to bond to the
surface<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.540> that's<00:02:02.840> what<00:02:03.020> it'll<00:02:03.170> do<00:02:03.439> it'll

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
surface and that's what it'll do it'll

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.670 
surface and that's what it'll do it'll
eventually<00:02:04.420> completely<00:02:05.420> bond<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.470> any

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
eventually completely bond to any

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.639 
eventually completely bond to any
surface<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.400> it<00:02:07.520> touches<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.239> seal<00:02:09.110> up<00:02:09.380> any

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
surface that it touches and seal up any

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.339 
surface that it touches and seal up any
kind<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.160> holes<00:02:10.459> nails<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.750> go<00:02:11.959> through<00:02:12.319> it

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
kind of holes nails that go through it

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.990 
kind of holes nails that go through it
will

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
will

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.440 
will
the<00:02:14.540> material<00:02:15.470> was<00:02:15.590> steel<00:02:15.860> around<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.460> so

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the material was steel around that so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.580 
the material was steel around that so
what<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:18.080> do<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.740> strip<00:02:19.460> this<00:02:19.640> siding<00:02:19.970> off<00:02:20.590> as

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
what we do is strip this siding off as

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.340 
what we do is strip this siding off as
you<00:02:21.860> can<00:02:22.040> see<00:02:22.310> we<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.090> run<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.960> ice<00:02:24.140> and

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
you can see we like to run the ice and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.000 
you can see we like to run the ice and
water<00:02:24.560> up<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.580> wall<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.410> then<00:02:27.410> we'll<00:02:27.740> follow

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
water up this wall and then we'll follow

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.820 
water up this wall and then we'll follow
this<00:02:28.490> with<00:02:29.590> apron<00:02:30.590> flashing<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.940> will<00:02:32.830> again

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
this with apron flashing that will again

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.790 
this with apron flashing that will again
go<00:02:34.100> behind<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.700> siding<00:02:35.030> here<00:02:35.690> go<00:02:36.380> behind<00:02:36.710> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
go behind the siding here go behind the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.250 
go behind the siding here go behind the
siding<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.850> then<00:02:38.150> our<00:02:38.480> shingles<00:02:38.900> will<00:02:39.050> come

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
siding and then our shingles will come

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.160 
siding and then our shingles will come
up<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.790> apron<00:02:41.120> flashing<00:02:41.240> will<00:02:41.720> come<00:02:41.930> out

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
up and the apron flashing will come out

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.590 
up and the apron flashing will come out
over<00:02:42.680> our<00:02:42.710> shingles<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.580> then<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.120> siding

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
over our shingles and then the siding

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.900 
over our shingles and then the siding
goes<00:02:44.720> over<00:02:45.050> top<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.830> makes<00:02:46.580> a

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
goes over top of it that makes a

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.560 
goes over top of it that makes a
complete<00:02:47.660> seal<00:02:48.650> where<00:02:49.490> water<00:02:50.150> cannot

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
complete seal where water cannot

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.060 
complete seal where water cannot
penetrate<00:02:51.940> through<00:02:52.940> there<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:54.440> do<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.830> same

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
penetrate through there we do that same

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.520 
penetrate through there we do that same
process<00:02:55.370> around<00:02:55.790> these<00:02:56.120> skylights<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:57.350> can

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
process around these skylights you can

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.280 
process around these skylights you can
see<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:59.050> skylights<00:03:00.050> how<00:03:00.650> this<00:03:00.860> material<00:03:01.490> is

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
see the skylights how this material is

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.850 
see the skylights how this material is
is<00:03:03.310> again<00:03:04.450> comes<00:03:05.450> down<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.840> roof<00:03:06.020> we<00:03:06.470> roll<00:03:06.710> it

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
is again comes down the roof we roll it

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.110 
is again comes down the roof we roll it
up<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.400> skylight<00:03:08.180> we<00:03:08.870> fold<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.950> corners<00:03:10.430> so

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
up the skylight we fold the corners so

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.680 
up the skylight we fold the corners so
virtually<00:03:11.870> no<00:03:12.350> way<00:03:12.620> water<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:14.060> penetrate

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
virtually no way water and penetrate

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.120 
virtually no way water and penetrate
into<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.170> skylight<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:17.620> like<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.739> said<00:03:18.800> when

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
into this skylight and like I said when

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.460 
into this skylight and like I said when
this<00:03:19.250> stuff<00:03:19.459> bonds<00:03:20.020> there<00:03:21.020> you<00:03:21.110> go<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.320> can

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
this stuff bonds there you go you can

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.460 
this stuff bonds there you go you can
see<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:21.890> it's<00:03:22.820> already<00:03:23.330> starting<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.959> bond<00:03:24.200> and

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
see it it's already starting to bond and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.370 
see it it's already starting to bond and
it's<00:03:24.650> about<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.400> don't<00:03:25.970> know<00:03:26.150> 35<00:03:26.570> degrees<00:03:27.050> here

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
it's about I don't know 35 degrees here

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.580 
it's about I don't know 35 degrees here
now<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.010> maybe<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.090> little<00:03:29.120> warmer<00:03:29.420> this<00:03:30.260> will

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
now so maybe a little warmer this will

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.340 
now so maybe a little warmer this will
not<00:03:30.770> leak<00:03:31.040> arm<00:03:31.510> these<00:03:32.510> skylights<00:03:33.050> have<00:03:33.320> a

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
not leak arm these skylights have a

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.220 
not leak arm these skylights have a
flashing<00:03:34.220> kit<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.270> goes<00:03:35.420> around<00:03:35.630> those<00:03:36.020> we

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
flashing kit that goes around those we

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.840 
flashing kit that goes around those we
did<00:03:36.440> not<00:03:36.560> replace<00:03:36.950> these<00:03:37.160> skylights<00:03:37.670> they're

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
did not replace these skylights they're

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.530 
did not replace these skylights they're
in<00:03:37.970> pretty<00:03:38.120> good<00:03:38.330> condition<00:03:39.110> so<00:03:40.090> as<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.390> can

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
in pretty good condition so as you can

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.370 
in pretty good condition so as you can
see<00:03:42.489> those<00:03:43.489> are<00:03:43.790> two<00:03:44.030> main<00:03:44.390> issues<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:45.019> we

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
see those are two main issues that we

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.360 
see those are two main issues that we
see<00:03:45.709> where<00:03:46.810> porch<00:03:47.810> rooms<00:03:48.200> are<00:03:48.500> added<00:03:49.010> at<00:03:49.310> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
see where porch rooms are added at a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.670 
see where porch rooms are added at a
later<00:03:49.730> date<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.410> transitions<00:03:52.840> from<00:03:53.840> the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
later date that the transitions from the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.490 
later date that the transitions from the
new<00:03:55.489> structure<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.420> old<00:03:56.630> structure<00:03:57.350> is

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
new structure to the old structure is

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.570 
new structure to the old structure is
really<00:03:58.100> not<00:03:58.519> done<00:03:58.940> properly<00:03:59.660> and<00:04:00.290> if<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.400> do

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
really not done properly and if you do

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.640 
really not done properly and if you do
not<00:04:01.760> do<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.390> way<00:04:02.570> we<00:04:02.870> are<00:04:03.080> showing<00:04:03.470> you

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
not do it the way we are showing you

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.060 
not do it the way we are showing you
here<00:04:04.220> then<00:04:04.730> you<00:04:04.940> will<00:04:05.090> have<00:04:05.269> problems<00:04:06.230> down

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
here then you will have problems down

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.400 
here then you will have problems down
the<00:04:07.280> road<00:04:07.310> for<00:04:08.000> years<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.690> come<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:11.140> this<00:04:12.140> gives

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
the road for years to come so this gives

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.740 
the road for years to come so this gives
you<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.590> good<00:04:12.769> idea<00:04:12.800> of<00:04:13.459> how<00:04:14.239> this<00:04:14.480> process

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
you a good idea of how this process

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.810 
you a good idea of how this process
looks<00:04:15.410> how<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.650> works<00:04:16.130> um<00:04:18.519> here<00:04:19.519> on<00:04:19.700> this

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
looks how it works um here on this

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.740 
looks how it works um here on this
corner<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:21.560> can<00:04:22.070> see<00:04:22.310> our<00:04:22.490> guy<00:04:22.729> he's<00:04:23.120> running

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
corner you can see our guy he's running

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.790 
corner you can see our guy he's running
those<00:04:23.900> shoes

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
those shoes

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.870 
those shoes
up<00:04:25.800> around<00:04:26.280> there<00:04:28.190> this<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> landmark

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
up around there this is a landmark

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:38.240 
up around there this is a landmark
pewter<00:04:35.630> over<00:04:36.630> on<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:36.930> elevation<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.800> my<00:04:37.950> far

pewter over on that elevation to my far

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.510 
pewter over on that elevation to my far
left<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.990> can<00:04:40.020> see<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.590> difference<00:04:41.040> in<00:04:41.220> the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
left you can see the difference in the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.590 
left you can see the difference in the
underlayment<00:04:42.120> where<00:04:42.840> at<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.170> eve<00:04:43.910> we<00:04:44.910> run<00:04:45.180> ice

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
underlayment where at the eve we run ice

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.250 
underlayment where at the eve we run ice
and<00:04:45.870> water<00:04:46.050> there<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.620> then<00:04:47.900> Rupert<00:04:48.900> select

felt paper goes up higher from there one

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.260 
felt paper goes up higher from there one
of<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.680> other<00:04:55.860> issues<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.730> we<00:04:56.880> took<00:04:57.060> this

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
of the other issues is we took this

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.520 
of the other issues is we took this
gutter<00:04:57.570> down<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:59.420> the<00:05:00.420> gutter<00:05:00.840> was<00:05:01.080> draining

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
gutter down and the gutter was draining

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.340 
gutter down and the gutter was draining
right<00:05:02.100> over<00:05:02.430> into<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.760> corner<00:05:03.390> so<00:05:03.570> all<00:05:04.200> of

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
right over into that corner so all of

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.330 
right over into that corner so all of
the<00:05:04.440> water<00:05:04.880> was<00:05:05.880> flowing<00:05:06.360> right<00:05:07.200> to<00:05:07.500> probably

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
the water was flowing right to probably

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.160 
the water was flowing right to probably
the<00:05:08.490> worst<00:05:08.760> place<00:05:09.150> that<00:05:09.390> it<00:05:09.480> could<00:05:09.660> go<00:05:09.870> right

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
the worst place that it could go right

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.590 
the worst place that it could go right
in<00:05:10.320> that<00:05:10.440> corner<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.130> then<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.970> lower<00:05:12.210> gutter

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
in that corner and then the lower gutter

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.020 
in that corner and then the lower gutter
there<00:05:12.900> was<00:05:13.110> collecting<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:13.890> water<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:14.520> then

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
there was collecting that water and then

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.690 
there was collecting that water and then
coming<00:05:15.420> over<00:05:15.570> to<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.230> spout<00:05:16.800> coming<00:05:17.490> down

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
coming over to the spout coming down

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.380 
coming over to the spout coming down
here<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.960> what<00:05:19.169> we're<00:05:19.380> going<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.620> do<00:05:19.860> is

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
here so what we're going to do is

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.080 
here so what we're going to do is
install<00:05:21.390> a<00:05:21.450> new<00:05:21.720> gutter<00:05:22.220> tap<00:05:23.220> it<00:05:23.430> off<00:05:23.580> on<00:05:23.880> that

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
install a new gutter tap it off on that

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.760 
install a new gutter tap it off on that
end<00:05:24.360> where<00:05:24.690> his<00:05:25.500> foot<00:05:25.800> basically<00:05:26.430> is<00:05:26.640> and<00:05:27.000> then

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
end where his foot basically is and then

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.530 
end where his foot basically is and then
install<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.800> downspout<00:05:29.400> over<00:05:30.060> there

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
install a downspout over there

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.140 
install a downspout over there
on<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:31.080> left<00:05:31.590> side<00:05:31.800> we<00:05:32.520> want<00:05:32.700> to<00:05:32.760> keep<00:05:32.940> that

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
on the left side we want to keep that

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.440 
on the left side we want to keep that
water<00:05:33.450> away<00:05:33.750> from<00:05:34.410> this<00:05:35.040> corner<00:05:36.030> which<00:05:36.270> is<00:05:36.419> a

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
water away from this corner which is a

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.520 
water away from this corner which is a
very<00:05:37.130> sensitive<00:05:38.130> critical<00:05:38.880> area<00:05:39.530> here's

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
very sensitive critical area here's

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.680 
very sensitive critical area here's
another<00:05:40.770> good<00:05:41.040> shot<00:05:41.370> how<00:05:42.060> we're<00:05:42.240> running<00:05:42.540> that

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
another good shot how we're running that

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.469 
another good shot how we're running that
ice<00:05:42.930> and<00:05:43.169> water<00:05:43.350> up<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.800> wall<00:05:44.300> we're<00:05:45.300> going<00:05:45.419> to

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
ice and water up the wall we're going to

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.650 
ice and water up the wall we're going to
get<00:05:45.600> all<00:05:45.780> that<00:05:45.810> taped<00:05:46.320> up<00:05:46.590> arm<00:05:47.270> so<00:05:48.270> if<00:05:48.450> there's

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
get all that taped up arm so if there's

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.680 
get all that taped up arm so if there's
any<00:05:48.900> penetration<00:05:49.290> of<00:05:50.010> water<00:05:50.550> around<00:05:51.390> these

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
any penetration of water around these

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.740 
any penetration of water around these
windows<00:05:52.220> siding<00:05:53.220> or<00:05:53.760> whatever<00:05:54.270> it's<00:05:54.510> been

years<00:05:55.650> of<00:05:55.950> just<00:05:56.130> problems<00:05:56.760> someone<00:05:57.180> is<00:05:57.330> caught

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
years of just problems someone is caught

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.060 
years of just problems someone is caught
numerous<00:05:58.770> times<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:01.080> idea<00:06:01.560> is<00:06:01.890> we<00:06:02.460> will<00:06:04.070> tape

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
numerous times the idea is we will tape

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.510 
numerous times the idea is we will tape
this<00:06:05.340> area<00:06:05.820> down<00:06:06.090> here<00:06:06.740> so<00:06:07.740> there's<00:06:07.979> virtually

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
this area down here so there's virtually

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.600 
this area down here so there's virtually
no<00:06:08.700> way<00:06:08.910> water<00:06:09.240> can<00:06:09.510> run<00:06:09.720> down<00:06:10.050> and<00:06:10.800> get<00:06:11.430> behind

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
no way water can run down and get behind

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.090 
no way water can run down and get behind
our<00:06:14.479> icing<00:06:15.479> off<00:06:15.630> water<00:06:15.960> shield<00:06:16.410> and<00:06:16.890> our
