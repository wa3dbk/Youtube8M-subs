00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
using with the thermo I think it the

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.260 
using with the thermo I think it the
default<00:01:29.030> scope<00:01:29.270> is<00:01:29.420> just<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:30.670> mean<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.940> Lynx

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
default scope is just I mean the Lynx

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.590 
default scope is just I mean the Lynx
has<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:33.110> know<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.850> pretty<00:01:34.850> shitty<00:01:35.240> scope

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
has a you know a pretty shitty scope

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.330 
has a you know a pretty shitty scope
it's<00:01:36.110> really<00:01:36.590> big<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.160> clunky<00:01:38.260> but<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.470> vks

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
it's really big and clunky but the vks

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.280 
it's really big and clunky but the vks
it's<00:01:40.640> just<00:01:40.880> awkward<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.390> weird<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:41.960> don't<00:01:42.200> know
