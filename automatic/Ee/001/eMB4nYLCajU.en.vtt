00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.450 
I'd much rather rely on a solid metal
four-wheel<00:02:03.990> Jack<00:02:04.380> than<00:02:04.619> those<00:02:04.770> flimsy<00:02:05.100> little

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
four-wheel Jack than those flimsy little

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.630 
four-wheel Jack than those flimsy little
cranks<00:02:06.060> they<00:02:06.210> give<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.950> know<00:02:07.950> everyone<00:02:08.399> hates

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
cranks they give you know everyone hates

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.450 
cranks they give you know everyone hates
being<00:02:08.940> stranded<00:02:09.240> with<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> flat<00:02:09.810> tire<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.130> put

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
being stranded with a flat tire so I put

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.130 
being stranded with a flat tire so I put
one<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:11.670> these<00:02:11.760> little<00:02:12.060> husky<00:02:12.450> pumps<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.900> every

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
one of these little husky pumps in every

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.040 
one of these little husky pumps in every
car<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.410> own<00:02:14.120> they<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.360> plug<00:02:15.600> into<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
car I own they just plug into the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.800 
car I own they just plug into the
cigarette<00:02:16.290> lighter<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.360> they<00:02:18.360> have<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.510> cord

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
cigarette lighter and they have a cord

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.759 
cigarette lighter and they have a cord
long<00:02:19.080> enough<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.530> reach<00:02:19.680> any<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.040> your<00:02:20.190> tires

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
long enough to reach any of your tires

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.920 
long enough to reach any of your tires
they<00:02:22.459> even<00:02:22.640> have<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.819> built-in<00:02:23.239> pressure<00:02:23.510> gauge

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
they even have a built-in pressure gauge

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.289 
they even have a built-in pressure gauge
so<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.290> don't<00:02:24.439> even<00:02:24.590> need<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.829> tire<00:02:25.099> gauge<00:02:25.459> and

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
so you don't even need a tire gauge and

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.390 
so you don't even need a tire gauge and
even<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.599> tiny<00:02:26.840> little<00:02:27.200> pump<00:02:27.439> like<00:02:27.650> this<00:02:27.680> it'll

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
even a tiny little pump like this it'll

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.399 
even a tiny little pump like this it'll
fill<00:02:28.579> an<00:02:28.760> empty<00:02:28.909> tire<00:02:29.329> up<00:02:29.659> in<00:02:29.840> as<00:02:29.930> little<00:02:30.290> as

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
fill an empty tire up in as little as

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.990 
fill an empty tire up in as little as
four<00:02:30.709> minutes<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.769> course<00:02:34.010> don't<00:02:34.730> forget

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
four minutes and of course don't forget

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.910 
four minutes and of course don't forget
