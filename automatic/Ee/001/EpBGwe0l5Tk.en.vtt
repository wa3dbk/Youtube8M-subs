we are not in vanilla minecraft we are

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.559 
we are not in vanilla minecraft we are
indeed<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.859> feed<00:00:55.159> the<00:00:55.339> beast<00:00:55.519> so<00:00:55.999> if<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.359> guys

were<00:00:56.749> wondering<00:00:57.109> it's<00:00:58.100> not<00:00:58.370> quite<00:00:58.609> possible

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
were wondering it's not quite possible

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.979 
were wondering it's not quite possible
to<00:00:59.179> do<00:00:59.269> this<00:00:59.389> on<00:00:59.600> vanilla<00:00:59.809> minecraft<00:01:00.019> yet

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
to do this on vanilla minecraft yet

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.969 
to do this on vanilla minecraft yet
still<00:01:02.989> looking<00:01:03.049> for<00:01:03.440> ways<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.589> do<00:01:03.859> it

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
still looking for ways to do it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.140 
still looking for ways to do it
hopefully<00:01:04.159> they'll<00:01:04.549> implement<00:01:04.790> something

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
hopefully they'll implement something

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.340 
hopefully they'll implement something
where<00:01:05.630> we<00:01:05.720> can<00:01:05.840> do<00:01:05.960> something<00:01:06.200> such<00:01:06.800> as<00:01:06.830> this

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
where we can do something such as this

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.380 
where we can do something such as this
but<00:01:09.350> uh<00:01:09.380> yeah<00:01:09.830> like<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:10.250> said<00:01:10.280> this<00:01:10.610> is<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.820> fully

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
but uh yeah like I said this is a fully

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.030 
but uh yeah like I said this is a fully
automatically<00:01:12.580> reloading<00:01:13.580> TMT<00:01:14.210> cannon<00:01:15.040> this

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
automatically reloading TMT cannon this

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.250 
automatically reloading TMT cannon this
isn't<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.430> most<00:01:16.690> long-range<00:01:17.690> design<00:01:18.110> or

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
isn't the most long-range design or

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.570 
isn't the most long-range design or
anything<00:01:18.530> like<00:01:18.650> this<00:01:18.800> this<00:01:18.980> is<00:01:19.040> proud<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.460> this

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
anything like this this is proud of this

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.520 
anything like this this is proud of this
I<00:01:19.790> try<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.060> make<00:01:20.300> it<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:20.480> its<00:01:20.600> simplest<00:01:20.930> form<00:01:21.200> as

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
I try to make it in its simplest form as

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.440 
I try to make it in its simplest form as
possible<00:01:22.010> what<00:01:22.790> you're<00:01:22.880> going<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.060> need<00:01:23.210> is

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
possible what you're going to need is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.980 
possible what you're going to need is
some<00:01:23.810> deployers<00:01:24.850> lever<00:01:25.850> I<00:01:26.210> mean<00:01:26.570> not<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.750> lever

some deployers lever I mean not a lever

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.530 
some deployers lever I mean not a lever
but<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.230> button<00:01:27.530> not<00:01:28.310> industrial<00:01:28.880> TNT<00:01:29.180> regular

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
but a button not industrial TNT regular

and I'd like to grab a stone slab real
quick<00:01:37.970> here<00:01:38.180> for<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.420> tutorial<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.500> like<00:01:39.680> you

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
quick here for the tutorial so like you

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.670 
quick here for the tutorial so like you
saw<00:01:40.010> all<00:01:40.400> I<00:01:40.460> do<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:40.970> press<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.600> button<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:41.960> bam

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
saw all I do is press the button and bam

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.430 
saw all I do is press the button and bam
it's<00:01:43.070> automatically<00:01:43.670> loaded<00:01:43.970> and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
it's automatically loaded and

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.770 
it's automatically loaded and
automatically<00:01:45.440> ready<00:01:46.159> for<00:01:46.370> shot<00:01:46.550> so<00:01:47.180> it

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
automatically ready for shot so it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.240 
automatically ready for shot so it
doesn't<00:01:48.110> take<00:01:48.230> any<00:01:48.380> longer<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.770> fighter<00:01:49.040> than

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
doesn't take any longer to fighter than

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.180 
doesn't take any longer to fighter than
normal<00:01:49.550> CMT<00:01:49.880> Canada<00:01:50.300> except<00:01:51.050> it's<00:01:51.770> shorter

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
normal CMT Canada except it's shorter

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.520 
normal CMT Canada except it's shorter
because<00:01:52.430> you<00:01:52.640> don't<00:01:52.760> have<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:52.940> reload<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:53.960> I'm

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
because you don't have to reload so I'm

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.990 
because you don't have to reload so I'm
sure<00:01:54.620> you<00:01:54.890> could<00:01:54.980> add<00:01:55.159> second<00:01:55.550> layers<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.880> this

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
sure you could add second layers to this

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.490 
sure you could add second layers to this
make<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.240> long<00:01:56.480> range<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.960> i'll<00:01:57.020> probably<00:01:57.230> do

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
make it long range and i'll probably do

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.210 
make it long range and i'll probably do
a<00:01:57.530> tutorial<00:01:57.740> video<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.570> later<00:01:59.570> on<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.740> as

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
a tutorial video on that later on but as

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.830 
a tutorial video on that later on but as
of<00:02:01.490> today<00:02:01.550> just<00:02:02.330> going<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.510> show<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.659> how<00:02:02.750> to

of today just going to show you how to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.589 
of today just going to show you how to
make<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:02.990> bad<00:02:03.260> boy<00:02:03.440> real<00:02:03.800> simple<00:02:07.599> 123456789

make this bad boy real simple 123456789

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.350 
make this bad boy real simple 123456789
just<00:02:09.590> nine<00:02:10.719> could<00:02:11.719> be<00:02:11.840> longer<00:02:12.049> but<00:02:12.469> done<00:02:13.069> half

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
just nine could be longer but done half

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.060 
just nine could be longer but done half
to<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:13.540> then<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.080> make<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.380> normal<00:02:14.770> you

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
to be then just make the normal you

to be then just make the normal you
shape<00:02:15.340> like<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.790> do<00:02:15.910> for<00:02:16.090> candy<00:02:16.420> cannons<00:02:16.750> and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
shape like you do for candy cannons and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.360 
shape like you do for candy cannons and
just<00:02:18.460> make<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.030> one<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.640> A<00:02:22.300> one<00:02:22.330> two<00:02:22.980> whoops<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
just make a one and A one two whoops and

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.390 
just make a one and A one two whoops and
a<00:02:24.520> 12<00:02:25.270> them<00:02:26.110> right<00:02:26.290> here<00:02:26.320> one<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.950> these<00:02:27.040> and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
a 12 them right here one of these and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.430 
a 12 them right here one of these and
then<00:02:27.850> just<00:02:28.030> bring<00:02:28.150> another<00:02:28.480> layer<00:02:28.750> over<00:02:29.290> like

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
then just bring another layer over like

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.160 
then just bring another layer over like
this<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.030> that's<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.450> that's<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.960> main

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
this and that's the that's the main

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.840 
this and that's the that's the main
structure<00:02:32.590> also<00:02:32.950> forgot<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.550> put<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.670> half

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
structure also forgot to put the half

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.270 
structure also forgot to put the half
slab<00:02:34.120> right<00:02:34.480> there<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.770> put<00:02:36.190> your
