that<00:02:01.240> way<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.770> joints<00:02:03.130> don't<00:02:03.310> go<00:02:03.430> bad<00:02:03.670> anymore

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
that way you joints don't go bad anymore

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.680 
that way you joints don't go bad anymore
or<00:02:04.510> I<00:02:04.540> don't<00:02:04.630> have<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:04.930> pinion<00:02:05.400> go<00:02:06.400> bad<00:02:06.610> she<00:02:07.600> had

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
or I don't have a pinion go bad she had

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.660 
or I don't have a pinion go bad she had
to<00:02:07.720> rebuilt<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.380> rear<00:02:08.860> end<00:02:09.039> rebuild<00:02:09.399> on<00:02:09.550> this

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
to rebuilt the rear end rebuild on this

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.960 
to rebuilt the rear end rebuild on this
thing<00:02:09.880> just<00:02:10.119> did<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.390> last<00:02:10.660> year

like<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.730> said<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.180> kit<00:02:39.690> comes<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.140> new

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
like I said this kit comes to new

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.620 
like I said this kit comes to new
hardware<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:46.280> that's<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.520> there's<00:02:48.270> two<00:02:48.450> of

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
hardware and that's it there's two of

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.280 
hardware and that's it there's two of
them<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:52.200> basically<00:02:52.590> what<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.250> does<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:55.020> that

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
them and basically what it does is that

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.490 
them and basically what it does is that
points<00:02:55.770> your<00:02:56.460> rear<00:02:57.150> end<00:02:57.360> at<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.750> downward<00:02:58.140> angle

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
points your rear end at a downward angle

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.610 
points your rear end at a downward angle
at<00:02:59.460> three<00:02:59.790> to<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> ninj

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
at three to the ninj

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.010 
at three to the ninj
to<00:03:01.620> line<00:03:01.830> up<00:03:01.980> your<00:03:02.010> youto<00:03:02.460> in<00:03:02.640> subway<00:03:03.020> there's

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
to line up your youto in subway there's

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.940 
to line up your youto in subway there's
less<00:03:04.290> angle<00:03:04.710> you<00:03:05.490> got<00:03:05.610> two<00:03:05.850> degrees<00:03:06.210> or<00:03:06.420> less

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
less angle you got two degrees or less

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.230 
less angle you got two degrees or less
of<00:03:07.950> an<00:03:08.100> angle<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.640> u-joints<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.120> you

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
of an angle on the u-joints and you

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.400 
of an angle on the u-joints and you
don't<00:03:09.390> have<00:03:09.510> bad<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.900> don't<00:03:10.050> skill<00:03:10.320> that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
don't have bad you don't skill that
