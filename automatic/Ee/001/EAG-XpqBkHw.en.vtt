two-way stretch material also carries

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.340 
two-way stretch material also carries
around<00:01:20.700> from<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> front<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> give

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
around from the front it's going to give

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
around from the front it's going to give
you<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.530> good<00:01:22.710> mobility<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.580> mean<00:01:24.030> they're

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you that good mobility I mean they're

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090 
you that good mobility I mean they're
gonna<00:01:24.360> use<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> same<00:01:24.750> nylons<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> backs

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
gonna use the same nylons in the backs

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.399 
gonna use the same nylons in the backs
here<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.119> once<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.630> into<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> back<00:01:28.200> of

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
here but once we get into the back of

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
here but once we get into the back of
the<00:01:28.530> legs<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> ventilated<00:01:30.030> mesh

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the legs they use a ventilated mesh

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
the legs they use a ventilated mesh
material<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
material so you can kind of see it is a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
material so you can kind of see it is a
little<00:01:32.729> see-through<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.600> gonna<00:01:33.750> let<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
little see-through it's gonna let the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.050 
little see-through it's gonna let the
heat<00:01:34.229> escape<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> back<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.880> also
