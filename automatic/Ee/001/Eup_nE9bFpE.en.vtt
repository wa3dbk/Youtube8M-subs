00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.690 
to go I think that that's not very
sturdy<00:05:06.380> because<00:05:06.800> I<00:05:06.920> don't<00:05:07.070> think<00:05:07.310> her<00:05:07.460> stuff

think<00:05:11.000> it<00:05:11.120> will<00:05:11.210> fall<00:05:11.450> off<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:14.300> maybe<00:05:14.510> it<00:05:14.720> just

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
think it will fall off so maybe it just

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.810 
think it will fall off so maybe it just
