00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.820
 hello people i have recently 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.180
 my new graphics card indulged and indeed 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.230
 here 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:30.719
 the geforce gtx 79 I build the map in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:35.430
 my pc a railing because user per 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:38.640
 frances system can be cooler here 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.350
 as an option select who um 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:48.150
 a graphics card from here on gpu 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.570
 to look at edges and nothing 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.700
 happens instead of what happens 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.720
 up here bug cuda binary channel 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:02.880
 four of the graphics scart compute capability 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.170
 5 point to not found okay that was yes 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.460
 First of all a shock because I 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.259
 I had the video card actually 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.920
 mainly countries are bought what 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.799
 can you do it and how by luck 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.079
 I read in an online forum 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.639
 how to handle it all 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.310
 the problem solving is actually 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:23.069
 pretty easy to switch first if 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.030
 one the windows explorer and navigate 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:34.670
 then the following path programs 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:34.670
 blenderfoundation countries 2711 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.590
 cycles, here are some files 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:49.270
 What interests us is down here 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.250
 last ksm 50 around the error now too 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.350
 we have to fix the principle now only 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.689
 change the name of this file and that 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.909
 instead of 50 52 we go on 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.909
 we can confirm that now 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:09.549
 close close the folder again 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.440
 Also blender and start it again 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:16.299
 because here we are now opening our first 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:21.090
 everything is already set on file 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:23.380
 gpu wonderful and if we now marginalize 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.060
 works without problems and 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.910
 really fast that so much for this 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.440
 the topic is, I think, is 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.660
 a mistake I think now with 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.329
 new graphics cards maybe more often 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.459
 can arise here just the method 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.930
 how it is gefixed and in the forum 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.230
 I also read that 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.670
 Error in version blender 2.7 three 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.680
 to be corrected 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.019
 that means also in the test picture the now 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.090
 after the version 2.7 two come out 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.370
 this function is probably already 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.450
 be implemented and the problem even 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.880
 no longer occur 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.630
 so much for the version anyway 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.900
 2.7 1 by 2.7 2 thanks for 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.900
 watch
