 the company is constituted in the same 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.130
 Chamber of Commerce present you with a 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.020
 format to fill out which 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.580
 it's also going to radial for everything 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.970
 that has to do with the runt with the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.590
 root forgiveness and there is expedited the process 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.780
 of that same information should be 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.640
 report once is in camera 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.479
 trade and before the day that is only one 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.640
 diligence on camera is to that root that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.709
 will deliver the dia to the operator 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.200
 that you start paying for 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.209
 that worker is going to inform you that 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.390
 you have that benefit and the operator 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.120
 battery and automatically you will 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.709
 start charging over the parafiscal 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.150
 the percentages according to the year 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.160
 corresponding that is on the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.470
 first year you will not collect on the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.319
 second 25 percent then 50 percent 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.420
 hundred of the 75 etc. etcetera and 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.970
 then 100 percent finally already 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.570
 that is the procedure is very simple 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.330
 and for some reason it 's possible that 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.490
 Although six months ago he had a 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.560
 worker who had the right to 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.570
 benefits not only of income but 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.110
 in parafiscal but the company by 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.570
 error is paying for prosecutors as not 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.120
 matter can do at this time the 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.730
 application if you have it reported 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.860
 obviously before the day does that 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.480
 information is relayed 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.450
 linden operator to from 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.450
 now the benefit is welcome ok that's not 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.720
 this whole issue has more complication 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.720
 okay 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.849
