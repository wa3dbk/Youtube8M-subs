but a lot of it is just that I don't
think<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.769> lot<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> editors<00:00:41.600> like<00:00:42.600> multi-panel

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
think a lot of editors like multi-panel

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.729 
think a lot of editors like multi-panel
or<00:00:43.530> wordy<00:00:43.980> stuff<00:00:44.690> some<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.780> them<00:00:45.839> told<00:00:46.500> me<00:00:46.619> that

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
or wordy stuff some of them told me that

editorial<00:00:49.650> cartoon<00:00:50.010> which<00:00:50.250> i<00:00:50.369> think<00:00:50.430> is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
editorial cartoon which i think is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.759 
editorial cartoon which i think is
literally<00:00:51.239> impossible<00:00:51.449> because<00:00:52.049> of<00:00:52.229> its

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
literally impossible because of its

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.140 
literally impossible because of its
another<00:00:52.979> tour<00:00:53.190> no<00:00:53.250> cartoon<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:53.820> definition

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
I'd like to change that mentality I

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.310 
I'd like to change that mentality I
think<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:24.180> were<00:01:24.330> slowly<00:01:24.750> moving<00:01:25.170> away

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
think that you were slowly moving away

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
think that you were slowly moving away
from<00:01:25.410> that<00:01:25.650> now<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.100> guess<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
from that now but I guess you know I

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.850 
from that now but I guess you know I
think<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.710> 80s<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.340> 90s<00:01:29.370> it<00:01:29.940> was<00:01:29.970> like

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
think in the 80s and 90s it was like

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.220 
think in the 80s and 90s it was like
modernization<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.980> styles<00:01:32.430> towards<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
modernization of styles towards that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
modernization of styles towards that
because<00:01:34.230> it<00:01:34.350> was<00:01:34.440> what<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.770> getting<00:01:35.010> people

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
because it was what was getting people

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.020 
because it was what was getting people
reprints<00:01:35.730> and<00:01:35.940> prizes<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:37.050> all<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.430> why

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
reprints and prizes and all that so why

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.790 
reprints and prizes and all that so why

that came out of that or idea maybe was

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.930 
that came out of that or idea maybe was
um<00:02:35.410> Paul<00:02:36.410> fell<00:02:36.650> who<00:02:37.040> was<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> panelist<00:02:37.610> in<00:02:37.790> Ted

um Paul fell who was a panelist in Ted

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.370 
um Paul fell who was a panelist in Ted
role<00:02:38.120> as<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.300> moderator<00:02:38.630> both<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.140> that<00:02:39.290> they

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
role as the moderator both so that they

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.180

on<00:05:47.809> a<00:05:47.869> lot<00:05:47.959> of<00:05:48.019> issues<00:05:48.259> and<00:05:48.559> I<00:05:48.619> don't<00:05:48.979> fees

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:49.189 
on a lot of issues and I don't fees

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:50.379 
on a lot of issues and I don't fees
progressive<00:05:49.639> enough<00:05:49.819> and<00:05:49.969> I<00:05:49.999> think<00:05:50.179> that<00:05:50.269> he's

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
progressive enough and I think that he's

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.409 
progressive enough and I think that he's
really<00:05:50.599> adopting<00:05:51.139> a<00:05:51.199> lot<00:05:51.349> of<00:05:51.469> Bush's<00:05:52.459> policies

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
really adopting a lot of Bush's policies

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.769 
really adopting a lot of Bush's policies
especially<00:05:53.959> on<00:05:55.029> national<00:05:56.029> security<00:05:56.179> and

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:56.779 
especially on national security and

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.779 
especially on national security and
secrecy<00:05:57.259> and<00:05:57.619> things<00:05:57.799> like<00:05:57.919> that<00:05:57.979> and<00:05:58.309> I<00:05:58.519> don't

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
secrecy and things like that and I don't

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.539 
secrecy and things like that and I don't
think<00:05:58.939> he<00:05:58.999> gets<00:05:59.119> cold<00:05:59.479> cold<00:06:00.079> on<00:06:00.229> it<00:06:00.409> as<00:06:00.529> much<00:06:00.769> if

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:01.549 
think he gets cold cold on it as much if

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:05.920 
think he gets cold cold on it as much if
it<00:06:01.669> were<00:06:01.759> say<00:06:01.999> John<00:06:02.509> McCain<00:06:03.489> anything<00:06:04.489> dad
