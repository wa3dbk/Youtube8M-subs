00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.070 
actually going to be called SP rotator I
have<00:05:52.540> it<00:05:52.660> disabled<00:05:53.700> so<00:05:54.700> obviously<00:05:55.300> what<00:05:55.960> does

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
have it disabled so obviously what does

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.300 
have it disabled so obviously what does
our<00:05:56.470> deal<00:05:56.500> I<00:05:56.919> just<00:05:57.010> rotate<00:05:57.640> your<00:05:57.790> springboard

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.249 

now<00:06:02.310> I<00:06:02.610> know<00:06:02.729> the<00:06:03.030> iPad<00:06:03.449> can<00:06:03.690> do<00:06:03.810> this<00:06:04.050> without

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
now I know the iPad can do this without

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.040 
now I know the iPad can do this without
beating<00:06:04.889> it<00:06:04.949> up<00:06:05.069> broken<00:06:05.400> but<00:06:05.669> this<00:06:06.330> is<00:06:06.509> new<00:06:06.750> for

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
beating it up broken but this is new for

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.100 
beating it up broken but this is new for
the<00:06:07.259> iPhone<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:08.009> iPod<00:06:08.340> could<00:06:09.210> why<00:06:09.360> we<00:06:09.750> are<00:06:09.870> not

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
the iPhone and iPod could why we are not

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.369 
the iPhone and iPod could why we are not
allowed<00:06:10.349> to<00:06:10.470> do<00:06:10.590> this<00:06:10.849> so<00:06:11.849> now<00:06:12.030> I<00:06:12.060> do<00:06:12.379> recommend

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:13.379 
allowed to do this so now I do recommend

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.159 
allowed to do this so now I do recommend
you<00:06:13.759> install<00:06:14.759> this<00:06:15.240> and<00:06:15.479> this<00:06:15.569> is<00:06:15.720> pretty<00:06:15.900> cool

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
you install this and this is pretty cool

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.960 
you install this and this is pretty cool
if<00:06:16.349> you<00:06:16.379> like<00:06:16.530> to<00:06:17.190> rotate<00:06:17.580> your<00:06:17.759> of

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
if you like to rotate your of

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.119 
if you like to rotate your of
springboard<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:19.470> other<00:06:19.620> thing<00:06:19.770> that<00:06:19.800> I<00:06:19.919> found

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:20.129 
springboard the other thing that I found

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:21.680 
springboard the other thing that I found
pretty<00:06:20.250> cool<00:06:20.550> was<00:06:20.729> that<00:06:20.759> you<00:06:21.060> can<00:06:21.210> rotate<00:06:21.449> your

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
pretty cool was that you can rotate your

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.939 
pretty cool was that you can rotate your
lockscreen

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.860 

so<00:06:28.949> if<00:06:29.490> you<00:06:29.639> want<00:06:29.849> this<00:06:30.060> you<00:06:30.449> can<00:06:30.599> just<00:06:30.629> go

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
so if you want this you can just go

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.379 
so if you want this you can just go
ahead<00:06:30.990> and<00:06:31.229> go<00:06:31.349> into<00:06:31.560> Cydia<00:06:32.490> and<00:06:32.759> search<00:06:32.969> LS

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
ahead and go into Cydia and search LS

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.189 
ahead and go into Cydia and search LS
rotate<00:06:33.840> it<00:06:33.960> and<00:06:34.169> let's<00:06:34.590> be<00:06:34.800> rotated<00:06:36.199> CLS
