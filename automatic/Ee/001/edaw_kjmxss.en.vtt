00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.920
 I am very happy that you visit me again, Now we are going to look at an example in which we will apply 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.070
 the knowledge acquired from the uniform rectilinear movement 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.610
 Some bandits stormed a store and fled in a car at the moment they are going to 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.140
 all speed on a straight and flat road a police car is in pursuit 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.329
 of the robbers the speed of the car of the bandits is 120 kilometers per hour while 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:35.180
 that the speed of the police is 160 kilometers per hour the bandits' car 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.280
 just passed by the 90 km of the road after six minutes bone of a tenth 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.370
 of time the police car goes through this same point, now we need to know 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.590
 at what moment of time and in what position measured in kilometers the bandits will be 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.350
 reached by the police to solve this problem we need to use the equation 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.640
 of the uniform rectilinear movement (MRU) for the car of the thieves and the one of the policemen. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.430
 according to the described the time equation that describes the car of the bandits is 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.400
 x sub be equals 90 kilometers + 120 kilometers per hour t, as the police car is 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.460
 It took a tenth of an hour for the 90th kilometer to calculate the distance 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.380
 which were the policemen of the thieves for it we will apply the formula 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.909
 of the distance that is equal to the speed by time which means that when 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.870
 the thieves passed by the ninety kilometer the police were within 16 kilometers 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.240
 behind the car of the bandits bone that the car of the policemen was in 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.890
 kilometer 74. Therefore its time function will be x sub 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.549
 be equals 74 kilometers plus 160 kilometers per hour t, 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.119
 when plotting the two time functions in the same X graph according to what we have 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.240
 a privileged view of the situation the red line describes the movement of the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.989
 car of the bandits and the blue line the one of the policemen with this graph we can obtain 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.689
 3 important data. The first is that in an instant you like 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:21.849
 at zero minutes the red line crosses the x-axis at the 90-kilometer coordinate and the 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.730
 blue line in the coordinate 74 kilometers. The second is the inclination of the line 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.349
 of the graphics that correspond to the speed of the cars we see that the blue line is 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.779
 more inclined than the red line because it represents the speed of the fastest car that is 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.279
 the one of the police the most inclined line corresponds to the car that has greater speed. 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:48.439
 The third important information corresponds to the crossing of the two lines, which is when 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:54.689
 the police reach the bandits to issue the exact value of the position and time 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.849
 that the police reach the bandits it is necessary to perform a small calculation as 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.049
 at that moment the positions of the cars are equal bone x equis sub pe equals 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:15.319
 x sub be we must match the time functions to calculate t therefore we have more 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:28.809
 120 km / h equals 74 km + 160km / h you bone 40km / h equals 16km so you 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:37.620
 is equal to 0.4 hours or 24 minutes, we should note that as the meeting of the two cars 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.949
 occurs at the same instant in the same position by substituting the value equal to 0.4, in any 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:52.150
 of the two time functions that should result in the same value for the position, 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.889
 which is where the police reach the bandits bony equis sub be equal to 90 kilometers 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:07.499
 + 120 kilometers per hour for 0.4 hours equal to 138 kilometers, or X equals sub equal to 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:17.319
 74 kilometers + 160 kilometers per hour for 0.4 hours, which is equal to 138 kilometers 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:26.009
 so the bandits were caught at kilometer 128, 24 minutes of chase 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.569
 I hope that now it will be much easier to solve rectilinear movement problems 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.270
 uniform (MRU) remember to answer the questionnaire we'll see 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.860
 soon
