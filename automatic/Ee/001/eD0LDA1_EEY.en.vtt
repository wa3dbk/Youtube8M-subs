00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.809
 Hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.250
 Another gate I want you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.080
 Introduce today as you do with one 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.180
 tensioner a very effective roadway 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.820
 Can these colors work both 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.140
 with skeletons as well as with zombies me 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.859
 introduce yourself through two variants of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.019
 this form 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.730
 the one semiautomatic he should 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.160
 for that the zombies and skeletons 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.420
 automatically respond and on two 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.610
 cats are housed 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.440
 That would kill the two themselves 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.899
 but comes both the items and the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.300
 Experience points is the second variant 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.309
 The skeletons become completely automatic 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.780
 and zombies automatic respond and 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.190
 also killed automatically but you 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.000
 only gets the items and not the ones 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.309
 experience then we'll have a look 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.930
 take on build once needed 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.850
 you for these colors 1 front 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.190
 You can do this sport for example in 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.680
 find dungeons if you found it 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.500
 you have to be with him as the center 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.949
 a 9 x 9 x 5 blog big room 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:14.130
 seven means four blocks in the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:17.570
 direction 2344 in this 1 2342 upwards 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.570
 down 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.750
 make sure that you at the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.729
 work an entire workspace 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.900
 Illuminates it can happen otherwise 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.900
 we are suddenly surprised 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.430
 when you have finished excavating this room 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.560
 have you for a page 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.369
 Decide where you have a mob lift and 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.200
 simplicity rebuilds 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.369
 I am now for this page 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.869
 decided therefore I do now 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.580
 just in two blocks 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.890
 Rosberg now you have to smart following 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.080
 to this wall turns at 30 on the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.940
 spot looks and then they go 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.000
 both corners and sets each one 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.280
 water bucket thereby arises here 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.780
 triangle is not water 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.200
 Covered is your impression deep 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.200
 appearance 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.060
 Now you have to move on a block 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.500
 appearance 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.830
 that is, the one of the der wehr 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.690
 and the block must go now you can 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.970
 already more like what we do with this building 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.220
 want to effect the bonner here are in 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.290
 the position that when the center point 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.420
 are in a radius of nine times nine 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.880
 be stretched five blocks monster 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.799
 that exactly this room here 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.540
 if you have any word then 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.510
 For example, the skeleton falls 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.430
 automatically into the water and you see 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.200
 Already all these waters lead the way 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.400
 exactly to a point and that is this 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.739
 here 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.319
 At this point you are now exactly 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.510
 Three works up and do it here 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.290
 again to three blocks high and three 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.620
 blocks deep into the wall now not 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.480
 Illuminate very important if he has it 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.950
 is real is here exactly a blog 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.780
 is covered on the water not 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.900
 Now their next set makes here 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.030
 in a sign there must not inferior 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.269
 is just here and here above purely 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.549
 now put a water source over it 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.980
 again a step over it again 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:27.049
 a water source over it again 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.609
 Shield a water source and so on 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.389
 for the sake of clarity, it will be time 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.090
 the whole time now from the 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:36.930
 side view of her friends he is thrice 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.349
 three area here because we are yours 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.760
 signs and here it is also about 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.409
 these orange bowl blocks here have one 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.480
 length of 23 bridges 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.599
 that's a pretty good indicator 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.379
 for how long it will take 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.379
 So here you see it again 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.830
 that's exactly how it must be the orange bowl 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.520
 is exactly 23 lucky 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.290
 if you are at the last 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.180
 Water source arrived , it means 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.270
 if the orange roll is just as high 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.300
 is again put shield over now 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.800
 this sign still a source of water 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:19.590
 Now, the establishment of a truck is building exactly four 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.030
 blocks deep nobody 1 2 blog around 8 and 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.300
 now you are here at the last 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.250
 position a shield you became you 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:36.000
 then a total of 21 blocks deep down 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:39.170
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.310
 17 18 19 20 21 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.740
 the red they want that again 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.120
 pretty much the red wanted it exactly 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:52.730
 21 bÃ¶ckeler that's from up here 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.760
 it right down here right here 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:59.970
 below now under it sat still 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.880
 a box we are behind with shift 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.100
 right a funnel if I now 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.180
 The above items are thrown in the land 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.800
 directly in this list 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.270
 Now you make up all the gaps here 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.870
 one that we still hit here 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.550
 could 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.590
 you should pretty much measure it 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.820
 pay attention to the skeletons or zombies 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.970
 he get wrong advents hereunder 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.880
 fall when you drop her 21 lay low 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.400
 that's what causes you the maximum damage 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.200
 you could usually use 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.570
 then have between half and two 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.740
 heart 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.260
 Unfortunately, it is not universally valid 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.490
 that means that everything is learned 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
 half a year time they 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.540
 just boxing away by hand 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.310
 that would be about 23 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.780
 you can also do it the problem is 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.370
 only that at this height 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.990
 some skeletons do not jump this 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.670
 but others suddenly survive 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.780
 to have half a year other 2 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.420
 there may be some fluctuations 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.090
 so I will give you now 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.590
 recommend it so that the 21 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.820
 fallen and down here in the 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.540
 for example, a stone smiths and 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.530
 stabbed her 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.180
 if he has her here and with one 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.410
 rock fall then they are still 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.820
 when did that mean it does not matter 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.380
 big difference stone cities should 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.760
 you actually have the whole thing now 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.210
 the semi-automatic version of this 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.830
 shape 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:17.610
 that means if I am here now all 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:17.610
 take away torches then that becomes active 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.360
 and if you own see first 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.090
 Skeletal skeletons will automatically open 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.020
 worn this one blog up here 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.020
 and earning pulled 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.150
 Incidentally, they can not drown because 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:46.639
 he always has an air pressure 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:48.560
 in between is when the skeletons are whole 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.910
 they are going through the top 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.509
 this water jet over here 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.539
 carried 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:55.759
 here they fall underneath and then land 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:07:00.550
 down here with minimal health here 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:03.830
 below you can just turn it red-red 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.419
 Below, customers can look at all the tips 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.039
 he wants to see this shape automatically 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.199
 then it just makes it so beat 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:15.979
 both really gone and or the whole 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:19.580
 here are some blocks deeper each 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:24.860
 funnel you have to do it all again 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:26.720
 close and you already see this 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:31.009
 Direct and the items become critical 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.639
 the same in the country was already alive 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:33.380
 two bones 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.639
 the problem with this variant is here 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.199
 that you do not get the experience 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.610
 therefore I would give you the other variant 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.810
 recommend more but that was it 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.729
 again with this tutorial 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.289
 I hope you like it I would 

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:44.120
 I am very positive about a rating 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:46.930
 happy and sand still stuck to say 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.930
 skin pure and
