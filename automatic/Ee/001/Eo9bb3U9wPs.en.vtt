00:00:10.658 --> 00:00:13.400
 now now, 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.560
 400 million miles into space, 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.498
 There is a spacecraft orbiting a comet 

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:22.068
 Looking for a place to land it 

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:26.101
 This is what is happening right now, and in a short time, 

00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.820
 We will have an opportunity for the first time in history 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.306
 To be slandered on a comet. 

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:33.976
 It's amazing. So it turns to my father. 

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:37.759
 I say "we" loosely because I am not a scientist, 

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.819
 I am not an engineer, I am an artist. 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:42.056
 But these comet fishermen came to me and asked me 

00:00:42.056 --> 00:00:45.362
 If I can help them explain comets to people. 

00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:46.954
 I said yes! 

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:50.278
 The problem was that I did not know anything about comets. 

00:00:50.278 --> 00:00:52.460
 But I wanted to learn. 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.531
 I had a wonderful opportunity to go and meet 

00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:59.711
 Some of the world's most famous rocket scientists. 

00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:02.639
 My job was to stimulate their minds 

00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:05.853
 I try to understand everything I can learn about comets. 

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.678
 It turns out that comets are incredibly interesting. 

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:12.977
 The first thing I learned was 

00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:17.417
 Comets look like giant mountains of ice 

00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:20.427
 When approaching the sun, 

00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:24.327
 heat up, 

00:01:24.327 --> 00:01:26.690
 These jets are made up of water vapor 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.070
 Which are formed around the culprit and end up extended 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.947
 In the form of a beautiful and luxurious tail running through the sky. 

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:40.156
 I have discovered that comets are old, very old. 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.099
 Comets may have originated very early in the beginning of our solar system. 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.669
 In fact, if you can get a piece of a comet 

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:49.779
 Look at them and study them, 

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:54.001
 As if you literally look through time, for 4.6 billion years ago, 

00:01:55.068 --> 00:01:57.020
 To the beginning of our solar system, 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.260
 When it was all around us, we were just a cloud of smoky dust. 

00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:04.615
 I also knew that comets may have been a source 

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:07.925
 For some or even all the water on the planet 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.530
 I mean, think about it, it's crazy. 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.508
 Every time you drink a glass of water, 

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.918
 You may drink guilty water. 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:22.136
 Partly, our bodies are made up of water, right? 

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:23.659
 There is a lot of water in our bodies 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.669
 So maybe our bodies are made up of comets. 

00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:29.739
 Thus, you can imagine, at the end of that day, 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.579
 My mind was completely rotating. 

00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:36.075
 But I had one interview left to do, 

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:38.464
 I was very enthusiastic about it 

00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:42.974
 Perhaps it was with one of the greatest comets scientists in the world. 

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.664
 He entered, then sat down, 

00:02:48.294 --> 00:02:50.114
 Then he looked at me, 

00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:54.683
 Even before I could ask any question, let me say: 

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:58.443
 "David, what would you say 

00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:01.170
 To get people interested in comets? " 

00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:04.987
 I thought then that this was my chance. I'll tell them everything you've learned. 

00:03:04.987 --> 00:03:08.927
 So I thought, Maybe I'll talk about the machines on board the spacecraft 

00:03:08.927 --> 00:03:13.267
 Or about the diameter of the comet, its surface, and what we know about it. 

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:14.765
 Then he said, "No, David, 

00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:17.835
 People do not care about these things. 

00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:20.195
 People care about emotional things. 

00:03:21.575 --> 00:03:24.206
 Do you realize we are about to 

00:03:24.206 --> 00:03:27.546
 Shall we descend upon a comet and float on its board around the sun? " 

00:03:28.463 --> 00:03:30.173
 I said, "Oh, hell! 

00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:33.721
 Among all the things you learned about science and technology 

00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:37.001
 And my attempts to nourish my mind to understand all that, 

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:41.353
 I came to that perception of a cowardly coward 

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:44.615
 He travels guilty across the solar system and circulates around the sun. 

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:49.355
 I could not believe it, he even reminded me of something very important to me, 

00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:55.539
 Sometimes we need to focus on something a bit different 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.425
 For the facts to be effective. 

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:04.345
 It changed my thoughts from logical questions to amazing questions. 

00:04:05.043 --> 00:04:08.193
 It is amazing, this is surprising. 

00:04:08.193 --> 00:04:10.306
 My questions became: 

00:04:10.306 --> 00:04:14.395
 "What would it look like if you could walk inside the tail of a comet, 

00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:17.729
 Do you feel the dust of the comet beating your face? " 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.939
 "How will it be when you are inside that tail and can not touch it?" 

00:04:24.387 --> 00:04:27.777
 Well, we've had the opportunity to do something about it. 

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:32.367
 This is a picture of something I made with my colleagues 

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:34.807
 To celebrate comets, 

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:37.130
 With the transformation you are going through 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.750
 From an ice rock to these beautiful and beautiful things. 

00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:45.185
 We wanted to give people the opportunity 

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:48.256
 In order to experience such astonishment but with miniature measurements. 

00:04:50.237 --> 00:04:55.827
 So, when I think of surprise, I think of it .. it's great. 

00:04:55.827 --> 00:04:59.930
 Surprise begins in our hearts and ascends to our minds. 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.850
 Surprise is the mother of curiosity. 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.449
 Is the driving force 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.780
 Which gives us the desire to learn and understand. 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.132
 Where science is born. 

00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:15.992
 When art and science meet together to be surprising, 

00:05:17.454 --> 00:05:21.854
 We come to the root of the reason that drives us to explore and research, 

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:25.454
 And the purpose for which we have been chasing this comet for ten years, 

00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:27.194
 Trying to land on it. 

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:29.398
 Did not we? Why? 

00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:31.649
 That's because we need to know. 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.819
 I think we are living in an era of renaissance 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.609
 Where art and science serve each other to elevate each other. 

00:05:41.295 --> 00:05:45.565
 If we want to raise the value of science in our culture 

00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:47.725
 We need art more than anything 

00:05:48.743 --> 00:05:51.232
 It's beautiful, I mean, nature has its beauty 

00:05:51.232 --> 00:05:54.342
 Which deserves the attention of mind and heart. 

00:05:54.342 --> 00:05:57.504
 I think the role of art 

00:05:57.504 --> 00:06:00.664
 Not informing people 

00:06:00.664 --> 00:06:04.898
 It is to attract them to experience something 

00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:06.768
 With a heart full of passion 

00:06:07.653 --> 00:06:10.593
 So they can ask questions. 

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:13.059
 We want to plant the seeds of curiosity 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:15.419
 So they can go ahead and do it themselves, 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.179
 They can discover themselves, by their own curiosity. 

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:23.010
 When you see pictures like this, 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.582
 Sometimes we think it's amazing for children, is not it? 

00:06:26.582 --> 00:06:29.508
 But no, it's all of us. 

00:06:30.193 --> 00:06:33.313
 It is really a passion that defines our humanity. 

00:06:33.313 --> 00:06:36.323
 It is one of the greatest gifts we have. 

00:06:36.323 --> 00:06:39.649
 So, I ask you, when the feeling overwhelms you next time, 

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.286
 Let him dig you up. 

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:44.037
 Let him shake that spark 

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:46.876
 Which ascends from the heart to the mind, 

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:50.741
 Because it can evolve into passion. 

00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:55.060
 And then the passion will take you to places 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.330
 We can only dream of it now. 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.453
 Thanks. 

00:06:58.453 --> 00:07:00.193
 (clap)
