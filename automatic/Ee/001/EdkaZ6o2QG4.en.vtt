00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hello to everyone with you makarych and in this 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.690
 video i would like to tell everything 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.660
 available ways how to get top with 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 into games and I think everyone came across 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 So the problem and strength you have is the decline of fps 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.289
 ki and favorite game began to lag Oleg 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.330
 unpleasant and especially i will tell you about 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.130
 minecraft rajah tell me about that 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 write something and so on like 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.780
 pretty much and let's move on 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.590
 the first way to market is change 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.649
 classic 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.600
 that is, here is such to all of them and us 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.030
 beloved 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.850
 windows 7 or you have there minus 80 years well 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.320
 shorter than pleasant 2 pictures on unpleasant 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.300
 that is, go personalization and 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.410
 We are changing such a pretty topic on 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.440
 micro sim card with classic theme and 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.230
 this can add 3 or even 4 fps 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.859
 and I personally added it only 2 bp 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.860
 s.a. 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.670
 but it also helped me a lot 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.119
 working capacity increases 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.360
 computer speed there i'm not exactly 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.299
 don't know here you we choose them easier on 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.549
 there classical themes and so on we go 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.200
 to the second item 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:26.240
 go to start the computer choose the right 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.240
 click properties 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.149
 additional system parameters 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:36.149
 parameters and here we tick the 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.130
 provide the best performance and then 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:43.100
 there is any animation removed 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.649
 sockets and so on so we go on 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.990
 if you have one video now i'm on to you 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.729

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:58.880
 maximum to pull out from the help sq menu 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:01.200
 so that is, we go here such a book 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.409
 adjusting image settings with 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.450
 browsing go this item here 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.310
 set user settings with 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.190
 focusing on performance and set 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.190
 maximum performance then we go 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.480
 control options 3d 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:22.260
 vertical sync pulses are disabled and 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:26.370
 triple buffering enable this to everyone and 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:31.050
 We take business and move on as well. 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.530
 turning on minecraft I turn on the controller 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.440

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.000
 go to process and change priority 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.300
 that is, we are you changing the archers middle 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.660
 priority high set high 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.890
 change its priority we are there before 103 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.630
 but even 5 fps and this is a go ahead 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.080
 as far as I know in java or java 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.380
 associated with minecraft so change 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:17.850
 we go to java i have it 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.230
 programs here so we go in our 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.960
 java 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.380
 so no that I do not run that so here in 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.680
 in the window that appears, select the java tab 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.350
 vm 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.230
 and here we click twice on the free 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.170
 field and here we enter here the following 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.890
 This I of course a reference they threw 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.700
 strongwoman movie is here now it's under 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.270
 video you enter then press ok 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.360
 apple 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.709
 ok so also we go in and still one 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.230
 way to go to start 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:59.890
 computer properties additional 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.510
 system parameters parameters and 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.970
 additionally go in and then push 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.380
 change and 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.320
 in here we indicate the initial size 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.300
 megabytes 3070 specify the maximum 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.230
 size you can put there six but I 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:22.470
 put 4070 can put there 5 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.380
 part is not important of course so 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.990
 also you can boost fps in 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.000
 minecraft there reduce range so 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.820
 same most raise there dad of the most 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.920
 minecraft settings 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.260
 install install there that there opte 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.150
 an optifine which I must with 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.120
 install optifine which 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.430
 adds exactly ps there and configured 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.670
 graphics settings though you can too 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.370
 can help them I don't know you clean there 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:54.090
 it will be straight on to increase fps there on 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.220
 20 apps can boost you with optifine 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:01.620
 and you can go there on different sites 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:06.570
 they are worse and I think it's all thanks to all 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:09.530
