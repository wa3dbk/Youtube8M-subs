00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.120
 hello dear friends how are you 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.280
 remember i recently got the fittings 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.260
 Sina from Panda Hall and today I 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.720
 I suggest you make one so cute 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.200
 bracelet but which you have in common 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.840
 difficulty probably 10 minutes to start 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.270
 I need to take a piece of this 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.820
 rezinochki I measure on my wrist and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.460
 plus two more tails so that was 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.360
 convenient to hold this gum in your hands and 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.390
 work with her further on one end 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.760
 gum I tie something important 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.250
 to this something slowed beads 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.370
 which will go so far on 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.290
 one knot just and put it all on 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:04.150
 table 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:07.659
 I put on two beads dropping so 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.950
 neatly and now I can say 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.710
 already starting to do 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.740
 the middle part or the main part of the bracelet 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.250
 because the back of the wrist will 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.380
 just beads and therefore it does not matter to me 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.520
 the amount that I can now dial 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.020
 dial 2 3 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.390
 I wish to take one , then I take the hat 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.400
 dressing her like a face on 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.310
 gum further one bead and hat 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.440
 the downside so that they like 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.580
 would be from two sides 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.580
 hugged this bead now take 2 more 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.860
 wear these beads to the gum very 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.930
 easy because they have a large diameter 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.740
 rezinochka thinner and does not provide 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:04.770
 no difficulty this process further i 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.770
 I take the hat again I repeat the same 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.190
 now i take one bead with pendant 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.470
 I like this bear again now 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.470
 hat bead hat 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:41.700
 two beads cap again 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.700
 bead and hat 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.370
 now i put so many beads on 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:02.700
 how much gum I miss up to 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:08.180
 full wrist grip now i'm 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.180
 I will try on if this length is not enough 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:19.910
 enough even to be 3 beads are now 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.910
 I measure again tighten the rezinochki and 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.230
 I look so that the bracelet strongly pressed 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.260
 but also not too free 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.120
 number of beads fits further i 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:40.260
 tying these two tails and tying 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.320
 they are also not too weak so that they all 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.790
 beads attracted each other but not 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.560
 much too tight not too tight to 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.490
 could then stretch it when 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.490
 we will dress 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:14.610
 I tied 6 knots later and pulled out 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:19.799
 two tails and cut rubber on 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:22.560
 about 45 millimeters long then I 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.900
 I hide all these tails in one of the beads 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.590
 just dragging them down so they donâ€™t 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.380
 you can see well and tried of course how 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.950
 it all looks to make it so 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:41.370
 bracelet I took one bead 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:50.090
 suspension this with a teddy bear then 8 caps and 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:53.790
 and 18 large beads if desired, you can 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.430
 do not just one row of beads yet 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.850
 several let's say one row just from 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.490
 beads another row just without suspension but 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.310
 many of these beads here with us 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.350
 caps in my next video I 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.520
 I will show you how to make earrings with 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.260
 such beads 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.260
 see you soon bye
