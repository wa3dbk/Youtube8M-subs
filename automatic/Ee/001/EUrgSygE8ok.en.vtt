00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.129
 and I want to name as they are welcome 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.170
 a new video people and good people this 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.330
 video is the first chapter people from 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.740
 good this series that I already have like here 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.469
 they established to the channel of which places 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.599
 to survive in robberies and good in 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.369
 this case mouse bidet no and good mind 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.899
 welcome to the first chapter and the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.390
 first chapter is going to be here in the 

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:25.790
 coffee shop people this place where all the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.009
 world is its rentrée to survive 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.390
 rounds reach high rounds because it is 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.040
 the easiest that between measure and has 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.570
 many ways to make the withdrawal 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.890
 you can do it in the cells you can 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.809
 be in the infantry you can do 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.539
 while I'll tease you where the 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.269
 click dick but the way in which 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.769
 do many is here normal and it 's like 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.989
 it takes a little bit but it's good 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.760
 then it's very easy to do it good 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.249
 people we will say as I do and 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.690
 as he prompted the good hand to start 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.510
 the people round when the 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.809
 The first ones are my always try to get you 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.219
 seem on the one hand exactly let's say 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.140
 I'm in the next cell I'm going to 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.149
 appear where the zombie is right now 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.550
 you walk north I'm going to notice this to the 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.170
 left and on top of 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.119
 where are the cells 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.470
 good this place is indispensable there 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.270
 two places where you can do the challenge 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.590
 initial active inside the cafeteria and or 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.090
 I recommend quite inside the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.130
 cafeteria because I think a bit bastard 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.530
 because the slow zombies feel 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.360
 and it works for you without you like that 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.710
 they cover the road and you have to kill them 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.780
 with the oratory spoon remember 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.130
 that from route 33 you can no longer 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.840
 kill with the dora kutxa then 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.880
 you need to sign up is inside the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.979
 coffee shop so we can take care of your ass 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.479
 another thing that now once you already 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.070
 let's get ours in people who 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.930
 in 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.399
 I'm showing you how exactly what 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.890
 to do is to retain that within the first 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.780
 unofficial challenge or be the first you see 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.009
 who are actively arriving to begin the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.810
 join them for this the contribution of the 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.600
 infantry arrived with once you see 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.250
 that are already a little bit since you leave 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 running to the road and if not 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.580
 I get people the strategy is 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.649
 very easy if you mind going around 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.119
 all the map vueltitas for all good not 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.429
 all over the map, but not all 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.979
 ie this area is like what circle 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.450
 because the place is wide and the zombies 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.890
 they are not going to put you in simply 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.360
 cover yourself the güeyes that come to you from 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.400
 opposite and try to arrive by 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.590
 behind 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.690
 they also start thinking about the ass because 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.040
 if they are not going to be a problem apart from 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.930
 Try to be a bit slow 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.010
 because if you start running fast 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.630
 the zombies like that are going to be divided 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.370
 because there are two like two roads 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.050
 they will divide and they will reach you by the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.630
 sides and they go down a point four bastards 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.770
 Now people in Persia know they are 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.060
 more as you want but I 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.650
 I would recommend a lot that you have 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.280
 electricity here because with the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.650
 victory 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.510
 smart is simply beautiful and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.300
 weapons already know that the stained glass whiting 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.820
 as mentions an mp5 like that but as 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.980
 put a round 50 and if you want to stop 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.620
 about 30 20 uses a rooting not us the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.720
 arms that time I do not know that that's 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.190
 optional by me and necessary things people 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.100
 that I really recommend you have 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.450
 is the shield of Tomáš not blue and 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.830
 spoon each thing that will be in 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.000
 the description in front of same I'm going to 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.200
 leave all things in the description 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.050
 that I think are necessary as well as 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.590
 good things from the map of the area map 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.970
 and bad things not all good people with 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.770
 this time that I have left, I am going to tell you 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.090
 a few things because I think that 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.099
 I'm going to do them for 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.900
 this map because this map people to 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.180
 despite having few places where 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.970
 retro is a place where good 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.340
 you practically have enough form of 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.720
 do it in the place where it is good what 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.310
 that I believe that before for the 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.629
 next chapter is going to be again the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.970
 cafeteria but with a different shape 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.819
 of the challenge as a poker link or as those of 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.160
 zeus canon or as another wiki saw the 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.140
 very tall not all personally I think 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.910
 that's been all the video you know 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.489
 If any doubt or comment they have 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.019
 leave here below if you have to leave a 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.209
 like why they like the video leave it 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.730
 and closes not because you do not subscribe to that 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.290
 use of zombies and more in video mode as well 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.630
 that we see ourselves in pieces are washed 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.630
 take care of yourself a lot is not close to diosito
