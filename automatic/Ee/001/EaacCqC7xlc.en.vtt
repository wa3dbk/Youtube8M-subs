great food I love food I eat it myself
but<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.350> key<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:51.210> body<00:01:51.390> is

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
but the key is that your body is

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.300 
but the key is that your body is
controlled<00:01:52.110> by<00:01:52.170> Sacchetti<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> rhythms

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
controlled by Sacchetti and rhythms

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.109 
controlled by Sacchetti and rhythms
which<00:01:54.030> controls<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:56.030> your<00:01:57.590> metabolism<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
which controls you your metabolism and

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.300 
which controls you your metabolism and
how<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:00.570> actually<00:02:01.200> how<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.619> really<00:02:01.799> works<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
how what actually how it really works is

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.010 
how what actually how it really works is
the<00:02:02.430> optic<00:02:02.820> nerve<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.210> your<00:02:03.240> eyes<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the optic nerve in your eyes like the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.350 
the optic nerve in your eyes like the
lens<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.469> camera<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:05.310> sends<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.700> message<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
lens of a camera it sends a message to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.020 
lens of a camera it sends a message to
will<00:02:07.200> say<00:02:07.439> your<00:02:07.860> brain<00:02:08.099> but<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.729> not<00:02:08.879> that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
will say your brain but it's not that

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.529 
will say your brain but it's not that

can have undigested material you're

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.780 
can have undigested material you're
going<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.320> be<00:02:32.410> fermenting<00:02:33.070> you<00:02:33.550> can<00:02:33.670> be

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
going to be fermenting you can be

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.580 
going to be fermenting you can be
creating<00:02:34.300> all<00:02:34.420> kinds<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.810> gases<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.380> one<00:02:35.530> of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
creating all kinds of gases and one of

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.800 
creating all kinds of gases and one of
them<00:02:35.740> is<00:02:35.800> methane<00:02:36.220> which<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:36.550> just<00:02:37.300> circulate

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
them is methane which is just circulate

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.930 
them is methane which is just circulate
through<00:02:38.020> your<00:02:38.200> system

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
through your system

through your system
you<00:02:39.940> know<00:02:40.060> which<00:02:40.330> is<00:02:40.480> definitely<00:02:41.110> not<00:02:41.320> good<00:02:42.090> so

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
you know which is definitely not good so

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.810
