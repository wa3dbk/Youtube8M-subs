00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello everyone, so I decided to take it off 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:13.920
 the second part of his horse of which corner so 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.940
 as promised now I will do it here 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.609
 i have such a set from rhyolis and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.220
 this pad is called 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.310
 moorish rug when i saw in 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.119
 directory I really liked it so 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.390
 I wanted to embroider threads there 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.890
 wool and of course I could not immediately 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.280
 resist when I bought it I have it 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.320
 scribbled strings rewound and folded 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.120
 Here in such an organizer which 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.760
 bought in a hardware store with 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:54.829
 discounted and so here I rewound them 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:00.870
 such are juicy beautiful bright strings 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:04.290
 Well, of course it takes time again 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.960
 to sit down and embroider with me now 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.080
 two projects but I really want to embroider 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.500
 here is this pad from rhyolis and that's it 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:21.740
 these woolen threads scheme 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.740
 here is beautiful here so colorful 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:36.470
 Here such a schema is clear, I think 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.470
 it will not be difficult to embroider 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:45.780
 There are also instructions in Russian 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.009
 in english and in spanish on 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.110
 Italian shorter all our 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:58.159
 naborchiki is in demand understand 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.840
 here and the outline is so round 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.490
 It will be good to embroider and here such 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.560
 still 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:12.000
 magic love poppies be it the same 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:15.810
 I bought I do not know when I will embroider 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.959
 very much wants k-56 other strings again 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:25.739
 and I rewound the shooting as well 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:32.810
 color is very clear, I now want to embroider 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.810
 these brands are just dreaming here and 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.600
 of course I could nâ€™t buy one 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.750
 set I just fell in love with him when 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.320
 girls all embroidered in the project of course 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.420
 also caught fire and here I was presented 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.959
 but its necessarily the future because 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.010
 I really like very well, like everyone 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:00.690
 he is somehow very festive 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.630
 mood raises very so lower 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.440
 the girl is so pretty come out 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.000
 necessarily 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.060
 and here are two more of my set of this 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.920
 beaded icons never thought that 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.950
 I want to embroider beads 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.959
 but when I looked at how girls are embroidered 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.260
 and here there are absolutely small girls 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.739
 we have on the forum the same embroidered icons 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.260
 such beauty turns out that's all 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.150
 they said it was so easy to embroider because I 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.850
 I tried to embroider nothing 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.090
 turned out so upset thought that 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.129
 Well, I'm some kind of stupid 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.849
 and yet and then decided to go to 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:49.640
 the store bought a small set 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:49.640
 such a bead is such a fish and 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.890
 when they explained to me I started myself and 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.379
 embroider and not all became clear at once and 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.900
 I got such a fish but 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.269
 can somewhere a little bit and wrong 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.940
 first embroidered but then nothing seems so 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:09.060
 it turned out of course now quite 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.190
 another thing I understand how to knock out and me 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.890
 so liked beads made with understand 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.849

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.870

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.200
