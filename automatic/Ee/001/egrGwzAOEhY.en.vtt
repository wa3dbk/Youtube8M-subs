00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.990
 / founded caps 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.550
 this is now May 30th informational cap 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.049
 as I explain I'm still the same 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.030
 wanted to say in this video I noticed 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.720
 such a pattern on my channel 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.990
 you look mostly just sony vegas 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.710
 i.e. sony vegas tutorials 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.720
 and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.840
 and all in general, if you compare any 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.750
 explanation and installations are valid or else 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.450
 something we feel a big difference 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.320
 although these videos are in fact 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:49.340
 are interesting 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:49.340
 night watching him on concepts just to 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.550
 calmly so here is sony vegas at the very 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.980
 the deed has already exhausted its next video 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.239
 of course there will be a new explanation 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:08.490
 1 effects but then I would like to 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.100
 finish with this somebody didn't just 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.950
 I I saw no just do not make excuses 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.159
 Here I do not condone these say wait a 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.159
 you 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.649
 but 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.310
 I don't need it now okay okay 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.310
 shaking so here but that doesn't mean with 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.940
 tony vegas i will tie up completely since 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.729
 in general, that was originally my channel and 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.470
 based on the BBC mill so he 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.460
 will definitely be on the channel if I find 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.330
 some effect 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.009
 then of course I will make a new explanation 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.070
 understandable and taken away immense why I lead 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.220
 I would like you to be under any 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.500
 general video under this under the oldest 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.600
 under the newest completely unrelated 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.630
 with you vegas wrote your problem 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.100

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.649
 for example how to speed up the video like there 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.600
 bring something else I will definitely 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.430
 separate edition exclusively 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.100
 exclusively for you I will do shorter to 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:24.350
 video explaining your problem here 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.720
 I noticed even know this is all 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.720
 bloggers for example so much too 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.450
 always in the comments they write for example 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.000
 They are 301 and more views that is 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.769
 youtube can not resume viewing 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.870
 but not yet have time to renew and they 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.019
 a lot of likes and they always write 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.720
 comments fuck Screw huskies 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.810
 rooster but unlike them since 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.360
 me views sometimes ok here 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:59.360
 really normal and like ten pieces 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:04.690

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.690
 views so here and put likes 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.320
 here I brought my thought to you and if 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.720
 yet something is not clear then write everything in 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.440
 I don't have too many comments 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.990
 subscribers to 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.250
 I was so busy and could not answer 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:29.520
 therefore, write everything as explained in general 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.810
 in any video in everything where you want to write 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.540
