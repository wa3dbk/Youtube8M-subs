00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.620
 Jalisco is full of beautiful places 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.670
 and surprising as surprising as 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.660
 their people 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.730
 in cihuatlán we discovered leo bananas a 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.180
 small banana manufacturer 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.939
 fried all their production is handmade and 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.460
 distribute almost 3000 pieces a week 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.320
 in strategic stores in colima and 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.470
 jalisco 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.450
 It is a completely natural product 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.180
 can say that the banana is processed 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.280
 the same day it is cut it does not have 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.890
 conservatives nor add anything else 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.500
 that a little salt 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.500
 at first we thought it was just 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.470
 of a simple snack after we gave ourselves 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.390
 account of everything behind it what 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.770
 that we produce is banana 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.019
 banana male in concrete and we wanted 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.420
 give an added value to this product 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.550
 and it's how we started our business of 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.550
 the banana fry 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.220
 we have already 13 years of that 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.920
 we started to elaborate this product and not 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.390
 in these dimensions right now but 13 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.880
 years that we started doing our 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.940
 product marketing it here in the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.120
 region here in the region and right now 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.370
 we already have other markets that are the 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.140
 main part of the region 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.850
 where we work where we are 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.520

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.450
 we work everything that is here the coast 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.010
 cheerful potential strategic stores 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.040
 it is the initial market 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.540
 we look like this 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.650
 market it elsewhere 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.940

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.640

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.850
 and the machinery we receive support for 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.290
 part of the sagarpa 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.240

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.360

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.400
 also the sagarpa supported us but not 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.130

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.360
 support 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.330

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.940

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.550
