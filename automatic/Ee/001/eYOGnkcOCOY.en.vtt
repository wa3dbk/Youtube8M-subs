he<00:01:05.790> took<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.180> Jules<00:01:06.420> two<00:01:06.720> justices<00:01:07.260> one<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
he took to Jules two justices one I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100 
he took to Jules two justices one I
began<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.790> realize<00:01:09.119> those<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.420> sniper<00:01:09.720> against

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
began to realize those I sniper against

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.160 
began to realize those I sniper against
justices<00:01:10.680> deck<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.869> really<00:01:12.869> didn't<00:01:13.140> think

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
justices deck that I really didn't think

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.630 
justices deck that I really didn't think
he<00:01:13.409> could<00:01:13.560> beat<00:01:13.680> me<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> second<00:01:14.220> third<00:01:14.400> game

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
he could beat me the second third game

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.249 
he could beat me the second third game
because<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.299> essentially<00:01:15.780> near<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> key<00:01:16.140> blow

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
because I essentially near the key blow

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.530 
because I essentially near the key blow
strategy<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.490> could<00:01:17.670> easily<00:01:17.759> align<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
strategy and I could easily align it and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.789 
strategy and I could easily align it and
so<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> felt<00:01:19.310> we<00:01:20.659> are<00:01:21.659> Lin<00:01:21.930> vac<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.350> matched<00:01:22.590> up

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
so I felt we are Lin vac was matched up

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.249 
so I felt we are Lin vac was matched up
against<00:01:23.130> George<00:01:23.460> Baxter<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.299> another<00:01:24.840> upset

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
against George Baxter and another upset

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
of the day Lin Bach defeated Baxter in

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.390 
of the day Lin Bach defeated Baxter in
two<00:01:27.270> straight<00:01:27.570> games

two straight games

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.469 
two straight games

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
probably the most heated match of the

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.080 
probably the most heated match of the
semi-finals<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.770> straight<00:01:33.190> took<00:01:33.430> on<00:01:33.610> Regnier
