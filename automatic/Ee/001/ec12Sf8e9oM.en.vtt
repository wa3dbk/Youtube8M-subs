00:00:02.722 --> 00:00:07.192
 The staff at the dry season park is busier. 

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:12.252
 Because poachers will be popular 

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:14.702
 Poachers follow the migration of antelopes 

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:17.712
 Poaching antelopes and beasts of hunting antelopes 

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:23.672
 The park uses a variety of methods to investigate poaching 

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:27.932
 Arrange the plane to hover over the sky to find poachers 

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.062
 Then contact the headquarters 

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:42.522
 Headquarters will send professional staff 

00:00:48.132 --> 00:00:51.062
 These workers must be fully armed 

00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:53.732
 Because poachers generally hold weapons 

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:56.052
 It is very dangerous to deal with them. 

00:00:59.352 --> 00:01:02.282
 Eliminating poachers is no different from combat 

00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:05.582
 The means of poaching have become increasingly complicated in recent years. 

00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:07.472
 Itâ€™s not easy to take them 

00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:10.422
 Boss found the trap 

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:27.962
 It is made up of poachers and made of wire and bark. 

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:31.772
 Mainly for catching herbivores 

00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:39.272
 Finally found a poacher gang 

00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:41.712
 In the Serengeti Park 

00:01:41.712 --> 00:01:45.352
 Conflict between staff and poachers is common 

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:02.562
 Poachers total 3 people 

00:02:02.562 --> 00:02:05.052
 Are residents nearby 

00:02:08.042 --> 00:02:11.972
 Poachers generally live in the grasslands for some time. 

00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:15.822
 And peel off the skin of the animal and dry it. 

00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:18.792
 They chose poaching to get rid of poverty. 

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:25.032
 Team leader of the Sai Lungeti poaching supervision team 

00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:34.622
 They are very poor, they chose to poach in order to buy food. 

00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:41.892
 The confiscated animal skin was destroyed on the spot. 

00:02:41.892 --> 00:02:44.862
 This is to prevent the formation of any black market 

00:02:44.862 --> 00:02:47.162
 Despite the great efforts of the park 

00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:49.822
 Poaching is difficult to eradicate 

00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:52.982
 For those who can't eat, 

00:02:52.982 --> 00:02:56.292
 Their own survival takes precedence over the survival of animals
