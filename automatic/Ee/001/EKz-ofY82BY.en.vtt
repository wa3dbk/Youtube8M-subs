00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 good afternoon dear friends today i am 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.109
 I open my culinary school in youtube 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.389
 schools it is more likely for me than for 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.799
 others because i'm learning to shoot food 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.900
 I try to make it more optimal 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.600
 more convenient because I'm alone I cook 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.359
 and so I take pictures of schools for me 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.430
 School can be for those who are trying 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.769
 learn the basics of cooking and today we 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.810
 the most and easiest trevi they are very in 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.760
 In general, they say despite this delicious 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.920
 salad salad with crab sticks 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 first hall he was in Beijing too 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.270
 cabbage now with crab sticks 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.399
 and cucumber 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.160
 So here we have already cut 250 grams 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.200
 crab sticks 2 3 2 3 with green 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.629
 onions do not need in principle green onions 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.370
 There are a lot of such salads tops very 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.120
 not much here she should just 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.739
 lightly shade crab sticks and so 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.140
 250 grams of chop sticks 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:08.479
 some green onions some dill 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:08.479
 Next 3 eggs we need mayonnaise 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.580
 corn 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:21.360
 Well, salt and pepper will not show so 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.549
 we take eggs and i advise 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.330
 take advantage of the usual standard here 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.680
 I am already so very old 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.159
 its cutting device and egg cutter 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.570
 and cut the eggs right here like this 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:41.460
 the way it is egg cutters 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:45.030
 then put again and cut like this 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.420
 way by skipping the egg and so three eggs 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.729
 eggs can use 3 4 because 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.979
 if the eggs are small then they need to take 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:59.869
 more if the eggs are large then three 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.920
 eggs use like this 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.180
 all eggs are such a complicated product 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.989
 cooking because here i am for example 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.860
 always a moment missed digest eggs 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.750
 when not to get 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.530
 this moment and I have them often 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.300
 such are blue well, I unfortunately do not 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.030
 love to bother on some 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.470
 fine points 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.380
 to figure out how long it takes to 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:33.010
 what is that boil egg shady it is more than 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.370
 it's not my path so here we are 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.900
 laid eggs 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.180
 it seems to me enough onions although you can and 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.730
 add a look later on and state 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.830
 Salad principle is such a thing and that she 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.209
 no matter how long the year may be 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.890
 ingredients of course vary by 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.459
 to one's discretion more of something 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.850
 put now we add corn 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.940
 corn important of course its taste before 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.940
 than putting a rose hand lettuce need 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.239
 try out the corn is not very 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.950
 sweet to be soft hard and so 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.260
 corn can just spoil the taste 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.280
 the salad is therefore better at all then its not 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.010
 to put 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:20.400
 what to put poor-quality crying corn 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:23.830
 the same and peas in the hangar 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.810
 hard old and its not needed then 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.130
 generally added on and last 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:35.970
 the ingredient is fresh cucumber cut 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:42.940
 him on such layers but somewhere around 05 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:48.850
 as far as possible there will be a curve 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:51.010
 Basically this is not scary how 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.519
 we will cut now we will now 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.519
 cubes 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.390
 small doses. 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.320
 actually i love big boards but me to 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:27.490
 Sorry big there varieties 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:29.260
 no owners and so this is a simple salad 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:35.710
 delicious it can be done in the winter and 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:39.730
 in the summer and anyone can himself without 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.640
 labor prepare and salad lie down 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.990
 living have cucumber cut 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.250
 Now you can look at this 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.140
 stage enough cucumber or add well 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.530
 possible in principle 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:58.600
 add another cucumber will not be worse off 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:02.440
 him so here we pay that is 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.450
 I repeat that it is convenient as if 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.980
 the number of ingredients in the salad that is 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:13.290
 Well, there is something you need more 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:17.230
 you can put less is not critical here 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:21.130
 more important of course the amount of ingredients 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:25.390
 baking proportions there is serious every 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:34.500
 gram can already affect 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:34.500
 and here it is not so scary and so is the salad 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:46.410
 and mix well 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:51.180
 Corn seems to me unnecessary before 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:55.100
 cucumber we have everything okay you can in 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.100
 principle add some green onions 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.290
 like this and the salad is left only 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.870
 fill it with mayonnaise 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.510
 I mean I want to say if we take 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.000
 preparing a salad well, for example, so as not to 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.760
 for guests and for yourself Well tomorrow 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.010
 got up and ate a lot of salad myself 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.840
 I put them to a plate and then for breakfast 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.000
 this salad does not need to be refilled 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.200
 put it down here is such a bowl or 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.400
 Cover the pot and store 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:31.470
 if we want to consume salad right away 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.950
 that is , we take some dose 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.950
 lettuce 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:45.480
 flour plate portion already in this plate 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.870
 mayonnaise dressed such a salad will 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.700
 stored longer he will not lose his 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.010
 properties at a not a lot of water 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:58.919
 tich you'll always eat ya delicious 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:07:01.380
 nice salad that will not be well 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.990
 sudden won't be raw from moksha we're all 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.680
