00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
to undo your belt and all that so it's a

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.550 
to undo your belt and all that so it's a
little<00:02:23.420> bit<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.630> convenience<00:02:24.140> but<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.440> not

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
little bit of a convenience but it's not

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.460 
little bit of a convenience but it's not
it's<00:02:25.459> not<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.640> huge<00:02:25.730> deal<00:02:26.090> for<00:02:26.120> me<00:02:26.470> just

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
it's not a huge deal for me just

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.380 
it's not a huge deal for me just
something<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.770> noticed<00:02:27.980> someone<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.550> mention

handle material and they're fixed blades
before<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.660> never<00:03:59.870> really<00:04:00.170> knew<00:04:00.410> what<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.590> was

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
before I never really knew what it was

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.800 
before I never really knew what it was

and<00:04:07.609> I<00:04:08.180> found<00:04:08.450> out<00:04:08.630> that<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:08.930> material<00:04:09.500> they

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
and I found out that this material they

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.879 
and I found out that this material they
use<00:04:09.829> for<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.069> handle<00:04:10.370> here<00:04:10.549> is<00:04:10.700> called

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
use for the handle here is called

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.539 
use for the handle here is called
phenolic<00:04:13.030> pH<00:04:14.030> en<00:04:14.600> l<00:04:15.139> I<00:04:15.170> see<00:04:15.680> I'm<00:04:16.220> not<00:04:16.310> sure<00:04:16.489> if

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
phenolic pH en l I see I'm not sure if

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.279 
phenolic pH en l I see I'm not sure if
I'm<00:04:16.669> pronouncing<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.419> correctly<00:04:17.479> but<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:17.989> say

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
I'm pronouncing that correctly but I say

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.699 
I'm pronouncing that correctly but I say
it's<00:04:18.650> phenolic<00:04:19.989> now<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.019> looked<00:04:21.289> it<00:04:21.410> up<00:04:21.440> and

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
it's phenolic now I looked it up and

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.089 
it's phenolic now I looked it up and
what<00:04:22.039> it<00:04:22.130> says<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:22.789> it<00:04:23.360> is<00:04:23.479> a<00:04:24.099> compound

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
what it says is that it is a compound

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.670 
what it says is that it is a compound
material<00:04:25.789> so<00:04:26.120> I'm<00:04:26.240> guessing<00:04:26.630> it's<00:04:26.750> just

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
material so I'm guessing it's just

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.780 
material so I'm guessing it's just
some<00:04:27.949> kind<00:04:28.190> of<00:04:28.340> epoxy<00:04:28.880> type<00:04:29.389> plastic<00:04:29.840> mix

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
some kind of epoxy type plastic mix

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.650 
some kind of epoxy type plastic mix
that's<00:04:31.790> impervious<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.330> heat<00:04:33.320> cold<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.919> shock

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
that's impervious to heat cold and shock

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.360 
that's impervious to heat cold and shock
basically<00:04:35.660> meaning<00:04:36.320> a<00:04:36.530> very<00:04:36.800> very<00:04:37.039> hard

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
basically meaning a very very hard

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.900 
basically meaning a very very hard
plastic<00:04:37.910> that<00:04:38.000> they<00:04:38.060> mold<00:04:38.449> in<00:04:38.690> shape<00:04:39.229> and<00:04:39.910> if

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
plastic that they mold in shape and if

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.090 
plastic that they mold in shape and if
it<00:04:41.060> gets<00:04:41.210> really<00:04:41.330> hot<00:04:41.660> or<00:04:41.900> really<00:04:41.960> cold<00:04:42.470> it's

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
it gets really hot or really cold it's

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.710 
it gets really hot or really cold it's
not<00:04:43.280> going<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.580> crack<00:04:43.789> on<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:44.030> it's<00:04:44.360> not<00:04:44.539> going

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
not going to crack on you it's not going

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.379 
not going to crack on you it's not going
to<00:04:44.780> flex<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.470> know<00:04:45.560> with<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.830> heat<00:04:46.039> and<00:04:47.000> it's

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
to flex you know with the heat and it's

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.150 
to flex you know with the heat and it's
impervious<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.870> shock<00:04:48.199> meaning<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:48.979> know<00:04:49.100> you

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
impervious to shock meaning you know you

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.430 
impervious to shock meaning you know you
can<00:04:49.340> bang<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.389> around<00:04:50.479> you<00:04:51.020> know<00:04:51.139> if<00:04:51.229> you're<00:04:51.350> in

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
can bang it around you know if you're in

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.050 
can bang it around you know if you're in
the<00:04:51.500> woods<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:51.860> drop<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.220> on<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.340> log<00:04:52.580> whatever

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
the woods you drop it on a log whatever

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.340 
the woods you drop it on a log whatever
you<00:04:53.690> could<00:04:53.810> probably<00:04:53.930> hit<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.199> with<00:04:54.320> your

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
you could probably hit it with your

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.740 
you could probably hit it with your
hammer<00:04:54.590> it<00:04:55.100> might<00:04:55.310> scuff<00:04:55.669> up<00:04:55.910> but<00:04:56.479> it's<00:04:56.630> not

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
hammer it might scuff up but it's not

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.129 
hammer it might scuff up but it's not
going<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.169> crack<00:04:57.500> or<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.400> know<00:04:58.520> break<00:04:58.820> easily

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
going to crack or you know break easily

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.930 
going to crack or you know break easily
so<00:05:00.139> they<00:05:00.500> say<00:05:00.740> it's<00:05:00.919> ideal<00:05:01.220> for<00:05:01.250> you<00:05:01.850> know

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
so they say it's ideal for you know

knives<00:06:49.900> or<00:06:50.230> get<00:06:50.410> rid<00:06:50.560> of<00:06:50.590> old<00:06:50.770> ones<00:06:50.950> not

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
knives or get rid of old ones not

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.200 
knives or get rid of old ones not

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
because I don't like them for the most

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.000 
because I don't like them for the most
part<00:06:52.480> but<00:06:52.690> I<00:06:52.900> just<00:06:53.500> want<00:06:53.620> to<00:06:53.680> try<00:06:53.770> something
