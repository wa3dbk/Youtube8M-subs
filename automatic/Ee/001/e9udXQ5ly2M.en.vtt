identity it's low field Oh percentages

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.330 
identity it's low field Oh percentages
but<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.600> walk<00:00:34.200> down<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.440> other<00:00:34.649> team<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.219> you

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
but you walk down the other team do you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.569 
but you walk down the other team do you
feel<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.790> there's<00:00:35.940> something<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.559> uh

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
feel like there's something to that uh

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.020 
feel like there's something to that uh
yeah<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:39.180> know<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.329> think<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.140> way<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.290> play

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
yeah you know I think the way we play

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.540 
yeah you know I think the way we play
defense<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:43.020> way<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.160> after<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
defense and the way we get after the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.360 
defense and the way we get after the
other<00:00:44.730> team<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.840> tends<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.770> but

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
other team it tends to be like that but

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.119 
other team it tends to be like that but
uh<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.820> mean<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.750> working<00:00:49.020> right<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.320> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
uh I mean it's working right now so you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
uh I mean it's working right now so you
can't<00:00:50.370> argue<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.000> yeah<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.719> think

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
can't argue with that but yeah I think

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.729 
can't argue with that but yeah I think
it<00:00:52.050> might<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.890> our<00:00:53.280> style<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> play<00:00:54.739> you

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it might be just our style of play you

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.770 
it might be just our style of play you
know<00:00:55.829> JD<00:00:56.399> these<00:00:56.610> guys<00:00:56.820> were<00:00:57.030> ranked<00:00:57.420> above<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
know JD these guys were ranked above you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.939 
know JD these guys were ranked above you
guys<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.199> start<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> season<00:00:58.770> out<00:01:00.829> what's<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
guys to start the season out what's the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.080 
guys to start the season out what's the
feeling<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.430> gotta<00:01:02.640> feel<00:01:03.530> um<00:01:04.820> we<00:01:05.820> don't<00:01:05.909> look

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
feeling I gotta feel um we don't look

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.789 
feeling I gotta feel um we don't look
too<00:01:06.240> much<00:01:06.360> into<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.780> preseason<00:01:07.110> rankings<00:01:07.619> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
too much into the preseason rankings I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
too much into the preseason rankings I
think<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.189> says<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> little<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.810> they

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
think it says a little more that they

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.050 
think it says a little more that they
just<00:01:10.229> beat<00:01:10.380> New<00:01:10.530> Mexico<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.850> just

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
just beat New Mexico and then we just

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
just beat New Mexico and then we just
one<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.600> i<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:12.960> that's<00:01:13.229> bigger<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.770> us<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
one so i think that's bigger for us is

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.590 
one so i think that's bigger for us is
that<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.549> got<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> big<00:01:14.970> win<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.509> were

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that they just got a big win and we were

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.480 
that they just got a big win and we were
able<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:17.270> withstand<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.689> momentum<00:01:19.110> they<00:01:19.229> had
