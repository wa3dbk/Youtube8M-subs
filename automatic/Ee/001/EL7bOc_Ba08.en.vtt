00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
fine cuz the first few minutes the game

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.610 
fine cuz the first few minutes the game
I<00:02:12.580> caught<00:02:12.760> out<00:02:12.910> anyway<00:02:13.209> no<00:02:13.570> not<00:02:13.959> because<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.350> was

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
I caught out anyway no not because I was

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.940 
I caught out anyway no not because I was
spawn<00:02:14.920> trapping<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:16.330> because<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.780> was

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
spawn trapping but because it was

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.229 
spawn trapping but because it was
incredibly<00:02:17.950> boring<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.670> couldn't<00:02:19.000> find

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
incredibly boring I couldn't find

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.380 
incredibly boring I couldn't find
anybody<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:20.700> then<00:02:21.700> about<00:02:21.850> halfway<00:02:22.030> through<00:02:22.360> I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
anybody and then about halfway through I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.120 
anybody and then about halfway through I
went<00:02:22.720> nuts<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.260> i<00:02:23.380> think<00:02:23.620> that's<00:02:23.769> about<00:02:23.860> when

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
went nuts and i think that's about when

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
went nuts and i think that's about when
he<00:02:24.280> got<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.610> here<00:02:24.820> now<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:26.670> couple<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.820> things<00:02:28.000> he

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
he got in here now a couple of things he

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.170 
he got in here now a couple of things he
said<00:02:28.390> he<00:02:29.019> said<00:02:29.230> he<00:02:29.290> called<00:02:29.650> activision<00:02:30.610> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
said he said he called activision the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.850 
said he said he called activision the
day<00:02:31.390> before<00:02:31.600> he<00:02:31.959> sent<00:02:32.170> me<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.290> message<00:02:32.470> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
I spawn trapping to me is is getting all

your<00:03:07.590> teammates<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.190> set<00:03:08.400> up<00:03:08.550> in<00:03:08.700> certain

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
your teammates to set up in certain

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.550 
your teammates to set up in certain
positions<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.630> there's<00:03:09.870> only<00:03:10.020> one<00:03:10.320> spot

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560

they could spawn spawn camping to me I

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.290 
they could spawn spawn camping to me I
guess<00:03:13.709> means<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.340> would<00:03:14.459> just<00:03:14.610> sit<00:03:14.850> outside

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
guess means you would just sit outside

guess means you would just sit outside
the<00:03:15.450> spawn<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.870> pick<00:03:15.990> him<00:03:16.110> up<00:03:16.200> until<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
spawns flipping I flipped the spawns

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.960 
spawns flipping I flipped the spawns
every<00:03:19.440> time<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.860> call<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.310> killstreak<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:20.910> I

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970
