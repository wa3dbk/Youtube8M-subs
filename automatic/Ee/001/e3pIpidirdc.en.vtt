so<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.390> think<00:02:27.599> it's<00:02:27.780> really<00:02:27.870> aimed<00:02:28.200> for<00:02:28.530> runners

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
so I think it's really aimed for runners

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.370 
so I think it's really aimed for runners
I<00:02:29.300> think<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.420> works<00:02:30.600> well<00:02:30.870> from<00:02:31.050> even

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
I think that works well from even

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.300 
I think that works well from even
