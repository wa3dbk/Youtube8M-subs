extra<00:01:31.970> resolution<00:01:32.180> but<00:01:32.689> what<00:01:32.900> people<00:01:33.080> are

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
extra resolution but what people are

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.440 
extra resolution but what people are
really<00:01:33.320> excited<00:01:33.470> about<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.369> as<00:01:34.700> up<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.060> 15

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
really excited about is as up to 15

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.480 
really excited about is as up to 15
stops<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.990> dynamic<00:01:36.439> range<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:36.920> every<00:01:37.220> stop<00:01:37.460> a

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
stops a dynamic range and every stop a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.249 
stops a dynamic range and every stop a
dynamic<00:01:38.000> range<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.360> twice<00:01:38.540> as<00:01:38.570> much<00:01:38.780> dynamic

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
dynamic range is twice as much dynamic

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.800 
dynamic range is twice as much dynamic
range<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:39.820> great<00:01:40.820> to<00:01:40.970> have<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.119> new<00:01:41.420> sensor

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
range so great to have that new sensor

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.030 
range so great to have that new sensor
on<00:01:41.960> there<00:01:42.200> it's<00:01:42.380> got<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.530> little<00:01:42.650> more<00:01:42.890> latitude

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
on there it's got a little more latitude

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.990 
on there it's got a little more latitude
as<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.549> native<00:01:43.790> a<00:01:44.030> sa<00:01:44.680> sensor<00:01:45.680> on<00:01:45.830> there<00:01:46.040> so<00:01:46.340> for

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
as a native a sa sensor on there so for

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.580 
as a native a sa sensor on there so for
independent<00:01:47.450> filmmakers<00:01:47.900> this<00:01:48.080> is<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.200> great

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
independent filmmakers this is a great

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.020 
independent filmmakers this is a great
camera<00:01:48.950> because<00:01:49.340> it's<00:01:49.490> got<00:01:49.610> all<00:01:49.820> that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
camera because it's got all that

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.789 
camera because it's got all that
capability<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.810> extra<00:01:51.080> resolution<00:01:51.200> that

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
capability that extra resolution that

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.469 
capability that extra resolution that
dynamic<00:01:52.280> range<00:01:52.549> something<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.390> an

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
dynamic range something that an

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.850 
dynamic range something that an
independent<00:01:53.720> operative<00:01:54.290> could<00:01:54.439> just<00:01:54.619> run

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
independent operative could just run

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.620

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
sensors two thousand dollars more so you

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.630 
sensors two thousand dollars more so you
are<00:02:16.080> paying<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.470> bit<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:17.070> get<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.340> extra

is going to be tremendous for
independent<00:02:27.150> filmmakers<00:02:27.570> it's<00:02:27.780> raw<00:02:27.960> footage

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
independent filmmakers it's raw footage

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.320 
independent filmmakers it's raw footage
correct<00:02:28.740> that's<00:02:29.160> right<00:02:29.280> little<00:02:29.430> court<00:02:29.760> raw<00:02:30.000> or

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
correct that's right little court raw or

our full-size earth so these new see
fast<00:02:34.410> cards<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.250> reason<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:35.640> need<00:02:35.790> that

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
fast cards and the reason we need that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.400 
fast cards and the reason we need that
is<00:02:36.120> for<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.360> frame<00:02:36.630> rates<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.080> we<00:02:37.140> want<00:02:37.320> to

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
is for the frame rates that we want to

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.500 
is for the frame rates that we want to
do<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:37.770> ultra<00:02:38.190> HD<00:02:38.520> now<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.180> camera<00:02:39.480> will

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
do with ultra HD now this camera will

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.830 
do with ultra HD now this camera will
record<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.590> do<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.830> 4.6<00:02:41.400> k<00:02:41.640> sensor<00:02:41.940> 4.6<00:02:42.630> k

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.410 
record in we do the 4.6 k sensor 4.6 k
for<00:02:43.380> k<00:02:43.590> or<00:02:43.830> HD<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.730> that's<00:02:45.060> gonna<00:02:45.209> also

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
for k or HD and that's gonna also

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.030 
for k or HD and that's gonna also
determine<00:02:45.930> what<00:02:46.080> frame<00:02:46.440> rate<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.860> have

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040
