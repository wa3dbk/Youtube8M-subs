00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.149
 hello friends the bright scam as they are 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.889
 here again the anti heroes but that 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.559
 I'm very good today with this new video 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.720
 with which I want to start with a phrase 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.760
 very important that one should remember 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.890
 you must teach your children to read but 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.960
 especially to question what they read and 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.330
 I mention it to all those who read 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.760
 the bible so many things that they tell us or 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.440
 we read and question however from 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.810
 childhood teach us not to question 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.400
 the a that is a divine word and that does not 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.230
 you have to question for those 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.760
 ready amateurs will realize that 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.980
 in history many have questioned 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.070
 what the Bible says is a matter of 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.840
 greens of Copernicus galileo discards and 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.210
 many others that really started to 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.489
 question the divine word and 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.559
 absolute gave many times I do not understand 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.570
 how people can read something and not 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.540
 question it when you read a thread like 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.670
 this one without a doubt you read it and you try 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.800
 get the best out of it however there are 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.660
 things that one should question and a 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.520
 very clear example is when you open it and 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.829
 you start reading about that story 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.049
 Jesus Christ of the first chapters and 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.530
 verses and you realize that god 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.430
 send an angel in sight 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.070
 give a woman 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.470
 of a certain age that of course had to 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.750
 be young and that she had to be a virgin to 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.290
 to be able to conceive it with his son then 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.300
 magically born Jesus Christ born of 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.979
 a virgin if you're the kind of person 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.600
 since the dogmatizar boy on 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.820
 then you will not question it and 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.970
 you 're really going to believe this you really go 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.920
 to believe that a virgin woman gave birth 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.750
 the son of god and you're not going to 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.030
 question why should any 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.040
 doubt since childhood surely they are going to 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.660
 repress and they're going to tell you not that you 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.880
 you will not understand that but when 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.070
 you are a teenager or adult, no doubt 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.440
 you can reflect and question this 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.530
 reading is very easy if we see that in the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.200
 historical context of that time the woman 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.630
 was treated as less than kaka because 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.360
 they really were less than kaka then 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.670
 a new reflection and there reflect and 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.310
 there to question and so it really was 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.440
 virgin or it really was something divine is 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.229
 well reading the history of mankind 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.539
 and the context that occurred in each era 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.230
 how the woman was treated as was the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.120
 political and religious situation of that 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.459
 to be able to come to questions 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.709
 basic so friends I'll leave you at 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.659
 this video so they can transmit it 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.700
 or move to any other person to 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.680
 really reflect what they read in 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.709
 the birth of Jesus by his 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.660
 virgin mother who is most likely one who 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.090
 all the natural order has been 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.030
 suspended or two that a Jewish woman 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.400
 have lied if you start thinking and 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.530
 to really question this verse 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.079
 or chapter will realize that in the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.209
 same bible there are laws where they kill a 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.760
 woman if she is not a virgin then that is 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.129
 more likely I want to be left here in 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.599
 the comments of the video for you 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.910
 which is most likely question number 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.470
 one the number two question and for all 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.569
 those who in the video really 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.549
 when they give something something like that 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.560
 that this is all friends and I hope to see you 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.900
 in the next video of lan earth and how 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.209
 I started the video teaching your children to 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.099
 read but above all to question what 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.799
 read so we'll see each other in the next 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.910
