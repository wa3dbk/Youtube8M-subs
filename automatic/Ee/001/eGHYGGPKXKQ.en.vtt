two<00:03:24.030> templates<00:03:24.450> or<00:03:24.920> where<00:03:25.920> each<00:03:26.879> of<00:03:27.060> the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
two templates or where each of the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.839 
two templates or where each of the
paddles<00:03:27.540> goes<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.829> i<00:03:28.859> don't<00:03:29.250> waste<00:03:29.640> any

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
paddles goes so that i don't waste any

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.240 
paddles goes so that i don't waste any
plywood<00:03:30.090> any<00:03:30.480> gaps<00:03:30.780> i<00:03:31.049> can<00:03:31.260> fill<00:03:31.500> up<00:03:31.680> with<00:03:31.920> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
plywood any gaps i can fill up with the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.780 
plywood any gaps i can fill up with the
easy<00:03:33.209> Phillip<00:03:33.689> when<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:33.930> do<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.829> fairing<00:03:35.640> and

easy Phillip when I do the fairing and
you're<00:03:36.060> filling<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.659> the<00:03:36.890> edges<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:39.739> will

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
you're filling in the edges so that will

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.849 
you're filling in the edges so that will
be<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:40.980> for<00:03:41.150> this<00:03:42.150> part<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.079> Interior<00:03:43.620> the

be it for this part of the Interior the
next<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.849> covering<00:03:45.480> panels<00:03:46.109> I<00:03:46.379> will<00:03:47.219> do

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
next is the covering panels I will do

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.670 
next is the covering panels I will do

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.110 
took some extra to a tues that I had and
then<00:04:20.329> rip<00:04:21.329> them<00:04:21.509> in<00:04:21.599> half<00:04:21.840> on<00:04:22.019> my<00:04:22.199> bandsaw

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
then rip them in half on my bandsaw

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.180 
then rip them in half on my bandsaw
tapered<00:04:24.120> an<00:04:24.300> end<00:04:24.690> into<00:04:24.990> them<00:04:25.289> enough<00:04:26.010> you'll

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
tapered an end into them enough you'll

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.450 
tapered an end into them enough you'll
see<00:04:26.400> down<00:04:26.610> here<00:04:27.680> here's<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.770> close-up<00:04:29.010> of<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
see down here here's a close-up of the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.980 
see down here here's a close-up of the
notch<00:04:29.699> that<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.060> was<00:04:30.180> talking<00:04:30.599> about<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.960> I

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
notch that I was talking about that I

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.060 
notch that I was talking about that I
cut<00:04:31.349> in<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:36.330> crusties<00:04:36.840> fits<00:04:37.139> in<00:04:37.349> like<00:04:37.560> that

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
cut in to the crusties fits in like that

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.610 
cut in to the crusties fits in like that
I<00:04:38.690> put<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.720> notch<00:04:40.050> into<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:41.130> two<00:04:41.310> by<00:04:41.490> four<00:04:42.620> so

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
I put a notch into the two by four so

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.800 
I put a notch into the two by four so
they<00:04:43.830> use<00:04:44.130> something<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.610> set<00:04:44.940> in<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.330> then

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
they use something to set in and then

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.230 
they use something to set in and then
being<00:04:46.020> notched<00:04:46.409> on<00:04:46.530> both<00:04:46.740> ends<00:04:47.039> it<00:04:47.789> will<00:04:47.940> kind

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
being notched on both ends it will kind

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.140 
being notched on both ends it will kind
of<00:04:48.330> wake<00:04:48.539> itself<00:04:48.960> in<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.880> plywood<00:04:50.880> that<00:04:50.909> I'll

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
of wake itself in the plywood that I'll

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.110 
of wake itself in the plywood that I'll
have<00:04:51.419> layer<00:04:51.690> on<00:04:52.020> either<00:04:52.229> side<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:52.680> these<00:04:53.120> will

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
have layer on either side of these will

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.469 
have layer on either side of these will
lean<00:04:54.330> into<00:04:54.750> it<00:04:54.780> give<00:04:55.349> us<00:04:55.470> some<00:04:55.650> strength

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
lean into it give us some strength

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.649 
lean into it give us some strength
vertically<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:57.770> also<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:59.159> top<00:04:59.430> will<00:05:00.090> span

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
vertically and also the top will span

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:04.370 
vertically and also the top will span
and<00:05:00.990> out<00:05:01.409> it<00:05:01.530> will<00:05:01.650> love<00:05:01.919> that<00:05:02.360> will<00:05:03.360> be<00:05:03.539> jel

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
and out it will love that will be jel

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.550 
and out it will love that will be jel
magic<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:05.039> the<00:05:05.220> two<00:05:05.370> by<00:05:05.520> twos<00:05:05.789> of<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:07.110> borders

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
magic to the two by twos of the borders

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.070 
magic to the two by twos of the borders
plywood<00:05:08.130> top<00:05:08.520> seed<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:09.570> then<00:05:09.870> these<00:05:10.020> will

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
plywood top seed and then these will

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.890 
plywood top seed and then these will
give<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:11.099> seat<00:05:11.340> some<00:05:11.580> extra<00:05:11.909> support<00:05:12.060> I've

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
give the seat some extra support I've

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.860 
give the seat some extra support I've
got<00:05:13.139> my<00:05:13.289> class<00:05:13.590> setup<00:05:14.659> for<00:05:15.659> the<00:05:15.720> right

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
got my class setup for the right

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.210 
got my class setup for the right
thickness<00:05:16.110> so<00:05:16.530> that<00:05:16.560> when<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:16.830> take<00:05:17.009> them<00:05:17.130> apart

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
thickness so that when I take them apart

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
thickness so that when I take them apart
put<00:05:17.729> the<00:05:17.849> gel<00:05:18.060> magic<00:05:18.449> in<00:05:18.630> then<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.199> will<00:05:19.349> take

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
put the gel magic in then I will take

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.600 
put the gel magic in then I will take
some<00:05:21.240> black<00:05:22.110> this<00:05:22.380> clean<00:05:22.620> plastic<00:05:22.919> and<00:05:23.370> wrap

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
some black this clean plastic and wrap

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.600 
some black this clean plastic and wrap
around

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
around

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.339 
around
and<00:05:24.759> then<00:05:24.939> select<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:27.419> lamps<00:05:28.419> back<00:05:28.659> on<00:05:28.990> and

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
and then select the lamps back on and

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.230 
and then select the lamps back on and
hold<00:05:29.860> them<00:05:30.099> in<00:05:30.219> place<00:05:30.250> so<00:05:30.729> I<00:05:30.819> know<00:05:30.939> they're

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
hold them in place so I know they're

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.490 
hold them in place so I know they're
there<00:05:31.419> 11-1<00:05:31.930> both<00:05:32.139> sides<00:05:33.479> will<00:05:34.479> do<00:05:34.659> that<00:05:34.870> next

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
there 11-1 both sides will do that next

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.950 
there 11-1 both sides will do that next
and<00:05:35.979> enough<00:05:36.400> this<00:05:36.939> should<00:05:37.210> bring<00:05:37.389> this<00:05:37.719> to<00:05:37.900> a

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
and enough this should bring this to a

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.510 
and enough this should bring this to a
close<00:05:38.020> next<00:05:38.620> thing<00:05:38.830> i<00:05:38.919> want<00:05:38.949> to<00:05:39.129> start<00:05:39.310> getting

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
close next thing i want to start getting

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.779 
close next thing i want to start getting
into<00:05:39.969> is<00:05:40.389> the<00:05:40.960> applied<00:05:41.740> with<00:05:42.069> sides<00:05:42.370> where<00:05:42.729> i
