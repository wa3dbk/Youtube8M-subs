we<00:01:27.360> mean<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.750> talk<00:01:27.780> about<00:01:27.959> light<00:01:28.590> quality

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
we mean when we talk about light quality

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.279 
we mean when we talk about light quality
like<00:01:29.580> quantity<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.209> the<00:01:30.450> other<00:01:30.569> hand<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.929> the

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
like quantity on the other hand is the

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.710 
like quantity on the other hand is the
total<00:01:31.679> duration<00:01:32.039> that<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.759> how<00:01:33.060> long<00:01:33.360> during

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
total duration that is how long during

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
total duration that is how long during
the<00:01:33.810> day<00:01:33.990> does<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.709> particular<00:01:35.220> plant<00:01:35.610> in

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the day does that particular plant in

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.540 
the day does that particular plant in
this<00:01:36.270> case<00:01:36.509> turf<00:01:36.810> actually<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.069> Sun<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
this case turf actually see the Sun and

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.120 
this case turf actually see the Sun and
so<00:01:39.179> when<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.450> combine<00:01:39.569> light<00:01:40.050> quality<00:01:40.560> with

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so when you combine light quality with

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.980 
so when you combine light quality with
light<00:01:41.340> quantity<00:01:41.910> you<00:01:42.209> can<00:01:42.240> determine<00:01:42.599> or<00:01:42.840> not

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
light quantity you can determine or not

and<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.470> greens<00:01:58.740> are<00:01:58.950> absorbed<00:01:59.399> and

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
and the greens are absorbed and

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.760 
and the greens are absorbed and
therefore<00:01:59.849> the<00:02:00.330> photosynthetic<00:02:01.140> spectrum<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
therefore the photosynthetic spectrum is

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.859 
therefore the photosynthetic spectrum is
disrupted<00:02:02.250> or<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.789> building<00:02:03.240> shade<00:02:03.539> on<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that case it's simply a reduction in

called the light Scout not only does it

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.509 
called the light Scout not only does it
do<00:02:33.629> a<00:02:33.659> snapshot<00:02:34.079> measurement<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.950> your<00:02:35.340> light

the right cultivar choice you've made

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.400 
the right cultivar choice you've made
the<00:03:30.510> right<00:03:30.660> species<00:03:30.900> choice<00:03:31.290> about

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
the right species choice about

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.900 
the right species choice about
management<00:03:31.860> there's<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.340> couple<00:03:32.520> of<00:03:32.700> key

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
management there's a couple of key

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.170 
management there's a couple of key
points<00:03:33.360> here<00:03:33.480> one<00:03:34.040> Mohar<00:03:35.040> in<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.490> shade<00:03:35.760> you

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
points here one Mohar in the shade you

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.310 
points here one Mohar in the shade you
want<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.390> get<00:03:36.480> as<00:03:36.570> much<00:03:36.750> photosynthetic

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
want to get as much photosynthetic

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.100 
want to get as much photosynthetic
capacity<00:03:37.560> out<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.670> leaf<00:03:38.880> as<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.300> can<00:03:39.540> to

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
capacity out of that leaf as you can to

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.280 
capacity out of that leaf as you can to
reduce<00:03:40.740> your<00:03:41.220> nitrogen<00:03:42.180> applications<00:03:42.990> turf

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
reduce your nitrogen applications turf

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.630 
reduce your nitrogen applications turf
in<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.500> shade<00:03:43.709> tends<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.040> be<00:03:44.130> very<00:03:44.340> succulent

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
in the shade tends to be very succulent

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.030 
in the shade tends to be very succulent
and<00:03:45.000> three<00:03:45.600> keep<00:03:45.990> an<00:03:46.110> eye<00:03:46.260> out<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:46.470> disease

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
and three keep an eye out for disease

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.620 
and three keep an eye out for disease
because<00:03:47.459> in<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.730> shade<00:03:47.970> diseases<00:03:48.480> like

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
because in the shade diseases like

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.740 
because in the shade diseases like
powdery<00:03:49.140> mildew<00:03:50.030> brown<00:03:51.030> patch<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.540> others

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
powdery mildew brown patch and others

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.770 
powdery mildew brown patch and others
all<00:03:52.020> tend<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:52.890> be<00:03:53.040> more<00:03:53.280> prevalent<00:03:54.030> in<00:03:54.480> the

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
all tend to be more prevalent in the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.900 
all tend to be more prevalent in the
shade<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:55.410> with<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.680> said<00:03:56.010> those<00:03:56.700> are<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
shade so with that said those are the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.580 
shade so with that said those are the
three<00:03:57.180> key<00:03:57.360> points<00:03:57.780> make<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.200> right<00:03:58.350> choice

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
three key points make the right choice

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.680 
three key points make the right choice
in<00:03:58.800> species<00:03:59.250> might<00:03:59.670> choice<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.090> cultivar<00:04:00.570> and

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
in species might choice in cultivar and

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.570 
in species might choice in cultivar and
then<00:04:01.050> manage<00:04:01.380> it<00:04:01.500> correctly<00:04:01.770> and<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.370> should

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
then manage it correctly and you should

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.250 
then manage it correctly and you should
have<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:02.850> made<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.270> shade<00:04:03.540> with<00:04:03.900> your<00:04:04.050> turf

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
have it made in the shade with your turf

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.070 
have it made in the shade with your turf
grass<00:04:04.470> selection
