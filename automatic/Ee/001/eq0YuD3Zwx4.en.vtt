high strung from gitanos and today I'm
going<00:00:06.510> to<00:00:06.569> be<00:00:06.630> demonstrating<00:00:06.779> my<00:00:07.380> sir<00:00:07.620> s<00:00:07.950> for

going to be demonstrating my sir s for

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.850 
going to be demonstrating my sir s for
using<00:00:09.210> overdrive<00:00:09.690> instead<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.139> clean<00:00:10.440> last

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
using overdrive instead of clean last

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.230 
using overdrive instead of clean last
time<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.190> was<00:00:11.280> clean<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:11.580> make<00:00:12.030> sure<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.209> check

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
time I was clean so make sure you check

time I was clean so make sure you check
that<00:00:12.419> one<00:00:12.719> out<00:00:12.919> this<00:00:13.919> time<00:00:14.129> I'm<00:00:14.190> using<00:00:14.309> my

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
that one out this time I'm using my

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.930 
that one out this time I'm using my
kinsman's<00:00:14.969> black<00:00:15.209> pearl<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:16.940> basically

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
kinsman's black pearl and to basically

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.070 
kinsman's black pearl and to basically
create<00:00:18.180> some<00:00:18.539> tube<00:00:18.960> overdrive<00:00:20.810> but<00:00:21.810> i'm<00:00:21.930> also

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
create some tube overdrive but i'm also

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.250 
create some tube overdrive but i'm also
using<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.680> circo<00:00:23.220> co<00:00:23.430> boost<00:00:23.960> which<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.080> this

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
using a circo co boost which is this

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.660 
using a circo co boost which is this
pedal<00:00:25.590> here<00:00:26.780> which<00:00:27.780> has<00:00:28.020> a<00:00:28.290> clean<00:00:29.130> boost<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
pedal here which has a clean boost and a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.730 
pedal here which has a clean boost and a
mid<00:00:29.820> boost<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.270> i'll<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.440> little<00:00:31.620> bit

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
mid boost and i'll do a little bit

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.080 
mid boost and i'll do a little bit
demonstration<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> difference<00:00:33.030> between

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
demonstration of the difference between

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.139 
demonstration of the difference between
the<00:00:33.329> two<00:00:33.559> but<00:00:34.559> i<00:00:34.829> also<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> more<00:00:35.730> in-depth

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the two but i also do a more in-depth

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
the two but i also do a more in-depth

humbucker<00:00:45.679> not<00:00:46.679> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:46.980> using<00:00:47.159> the

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
humbucker not going to be using the

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.939 
humbucker not going to be using the
cocoa<00:00:47.640> boost<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.409> but<00:00:49.409> I'll<00:00:49.530> switch<00:00:49.739> on

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
cocoa boost for this but I'll switch on

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:59.069 
cocoa boost for this but I'll switch on
the<00:00:49.980> second<00:00:50.429> to<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.699> difference

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.500 

and<00:00:59.739> ma

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
and ma

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.530 
and ma
and<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.920> i<00:01:02.949> have<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.250> clean<00:01:03.460> boost<00:01:03.670> with<00:01:04.119> boost

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
and now i have a clean boost with boost

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:16.370 
and now i have a clean boost with boost
at<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.750> halfway

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.789 

and<00:01:16.729> now<00:01:17.729> I'll<00:01:17.939> use<00:01:17.969> the<00:01:18.420> cocoa<00:01:18.750> boost<00:01:19.020> mid

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and now I'll use the cocoa boost mid

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:39.300 
and now I'll use the cocoa boost mid
boost<00:01:20.039> instead<00:01:20.960> again<00:01:21.960> set<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.380> halfway

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.510 

and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.180 

this<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.760> front<00:01:43.940> pick<00:01:44.210> up<00:01:44.500> using<00:01:45.500> the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
this is the front pick up using the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:02:07.020 
this is the front pick up using the
clean<00:01:46.850> boost<00:01:47.230> with<00:01:48.230> Vera

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:47.800 

is<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.209> second<00:02:08.509> position
