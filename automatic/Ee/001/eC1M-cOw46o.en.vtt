stuff<00:02:04.520> like<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:05.030> realized<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.570> hey

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
stuff like that and I realized that hey

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.109 
stuff like that and I realized that hey
I<00:02:06.619> actually<00:02:06.890> really<00:02:07.280> like<00:02:07.460> this<00:02:07.640> building

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
I actually really like this building

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.389 
I actually really like this building
stuff<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:08.869> what<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.110> like<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.679> do<00:02:09.830> how<00:02:10.100> can

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
stuff this is what I like to do how can

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.750 
stuff this is what I like to do how can
I<00:02:10.780> do<00:02:11.780> what<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:11.989> like<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.500> do<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.280> i<00:02:13.310> got<00:02:13.550> into
