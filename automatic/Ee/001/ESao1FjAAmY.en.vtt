00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
nine cell battery that's the huge thing

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.090 
nine cell battery that's the huge thing
on<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> back<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:43.049> kind<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.259> hard<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> open<00:01:43.979> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
on the back it's kind of hard to open it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.219 
on the back it's kind of hard to open it
as<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.180> our<00:01:45.299> fingernails<00:01:45.960> are

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
as you can see here our fingernails are

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.520 
as you can see here our fingernails are
or<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:47.040> fingernails<00:01:47.610> are

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.010 

and<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.680> pressure<00:01:52.040> right<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:52.720> but<00:01:53.720> there<00:01:53.930> is

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
and the pressure right now but there is

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.350 
and the pressure right now but there is
no<00:01:54.140> other<00:01:54.320> screw<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.920> just<00:01:55.130> have<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.460> pull

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
no other screw you just have to pull

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.380 
no other screw you just have to pull
really<00:01:56.810> really<00:01:57.080> hard<00:01:57.730> try<00:01:58.730> to<00:01:58.790> get<00:01:59.060> under<00:01:59.360> it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
really really hard try to get under it

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.580 
really really hard try to get under it
and<00:01:59.810> then<00:02:00.050> just<00:02:00.980> take<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.490> top<00:02:01.700> off<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.590> on

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
and then just take the top off and on

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.040 
and then just take the top off and on
the<00:02:03.710> side<00:02:03.920> we<00:02:04.100> have<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.340> plastic<00:02:04.910> really<00:02:05.780> big

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
the side we have the plastic really big

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.639 
the side we have the plastic really big
plastic<00:02:06.430> covers<00:02:07.430> here<00:02:07.760> so<00:02:08.380> that's<00:02:09.380> why<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.619> was

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
plastic covers here so that's why it was

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.350 
plastic covers here so that's why it was
kind<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:09.979> hard<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.160> remove<00:02:10.460> so<00:02:10.820> you<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:11.030> an<00:02:11.150> 8

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
kind of hard to remove so you have an 8

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.030 
kind of hard to remove so you have an 8
outta<00:02:11.800> one<00:02:12.800> gigabyte<00:02:13.340> RAM<00:02:13.760> stick<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.240> here

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
outta one gigabyte RAM stick in here

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.160 
outta one gigabyte RAM stick in here
it's<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.130> taiwanese<00:02:16.340> company<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:17.150> has<00:02:17.390> ddr2

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
it's a taiwanese company it has ddr2

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.530 
it's a taiwanese company it has ddr2
with<00:02:19.300> 666<00:02:20.350> megahertz<00:02:21.350> as<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:21.950> read<00:02:22.160> there

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
with 666 megahertz as you can read there

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.330 
with 666 megahertz as you can read there
so<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.990> have<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.170> take<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.620> out<00:02:24.710> by<00:02:24.980> just

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
so you have to take it out by just

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.370 
so you have to take it out by just
pulling<00:02:26.000> those<00:02:26.330> clips<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.960> right<00:02:27.170> and

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
pulling those clips on the right and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.449 
pulling those clips on the right and
left<00:02:27.590> side<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.130> side<00:02:30.310> usually<00:02:31.310> it's

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
left side to the side usually it's

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.890 
left side to the side usually it's
easier<00:02:31.550> if<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.820> do<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.030> with<00:02:32.180> two<00:02:32.360> hands<00:02:32.720> but

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
easier if you do it with two hands but

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.390 
easier if you do it with two hands but
with<00:02:33.200> one<00:02:33.350> eye<00:02:33.380> hand<00:02:33.800> I'm<00:02:33.950> holding<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.370> camera

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
with one eye hand I'm holding the camera

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.540 
with one eye hand I'm holding the camera
so<00:02:34.820> we<00:02:34.850> just<00:02:35.090> have<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.890> wait<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.950> little<00:02:37.160> bit<00:02:37.340> now

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
so we just have to wait a little bit now

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.810 
so we just have to wait a little bit now
and<00:02:37.910> when<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:39.620> do<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:40.010> right<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.459> should<00:02:40.490> pop

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
and when you do it right it should pop

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.650 
and when you do it right it should pop
up<00:02:40.880> like<00:02:41.180> that

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
up like that

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.140 
up like that
and<00:02:42.340> then<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.459> can<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:44.000> take<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.390> out<00:02:46.150> just

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
and then you can just take it out just

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.530 
and then you can just take it out just
yeah<00:02:47.450> with<00:02:47.750> one<00:02:47.930> hand<00:02:48.290> it's<00:02:48.440> not<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.709> easy

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
yeah with one hand it's not that easy

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.840 
yeah with one hand it's not that easy
take<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.660> out<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.050> then<00:02:51.350> put<00:02:53.080> two<00:02:54.080> gig<00:02:54.850> RAM

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
take it out and then put two gig RAM

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.390 
take it out and then put two gig RAM
stick<00:02:56.390> instead<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:57.050> this<00:02:57.350> one<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:58.070> there

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
stick instead of this one in there

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.530 
stick instead of this one in there
remember<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.480> has<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.720> be<00:02:59.840> ddr2<00:03:01.239> when<00:03:02.239> you<00:03:02.330> put

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
remember it has to be ddr2 when you put

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.540 
remember it has to be ddr2 when you put
it<00:03:02.630> back<00:03:02.810> it's<00:03:03.080> important<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.950> put<00:03:04.430> it

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
it back it's important that you put it

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.910 
it back it's important that you put it
back<00:03:04.790> in<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> right<00:03:05.330> way<00:03:05.750> as<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.470> saw<00:03:06.739> on<00:03:06.769> the

back in the right way as you saw on the
left<00:03:07.190> side<00:03:07.459> it's<00:03:08.420> shorter<00:03:09.910> shorter<00:03:11.200> so<00:03:12.200> if<00:03:12.470> you

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
left side it's shorter shorter so if you

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.140 
left side it's shorter shorter so if you
have<00:03:12.800> it<00:03:12.920> in<00:03:13.670> there<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.209> have<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:16.150> push
