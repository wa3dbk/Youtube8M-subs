00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.840 

okay<00:00:59.050> so<00:00:59.110> we<00:00:59.410> are<00:00:59.440> flying<00:00:59.740> down<00:01:00.040> on<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.430> heading

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
okay so we are flying down on a heading

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:09.459 
okay so we are flying down on a heading
of<00:01:00.940> 165<00:01:01.630> to<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:02.020> seal<00:01:02.230> Beach<00:01:02.410> vor

we're going to look at the triangle the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.940 
we're going to look at the triangle the
triangle<00:01:11.299> just<00:01:11.659> flipped<00:01:11.930> needle<00:01:12.380> Center<00:01:12.680> so

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
triangle just flipped needle Center so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.230 
triangle just flipped needle Center so
we're<00:01:13.070> going<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.219> immediately<00:01:13.490> turn<00:01:13.969> to<00:01:14.000> the

as we're turning on our vor one heading
bug<00:01:25.090> I'm<00:01:25.360> going<00:01:25.509> to<00:01:25.570> put<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.750> heading<00:01:26.140> with<00:01:26.500> 0<00:01:26.770> 6

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.850 

as<00:01:49.700> we<00:01:50.390> turn<00:01:50.600> past<00:01:50.900> setting<00:01:51.260> of<00:01:51.350> zero<00:01:51.590> six

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860

eight to the heading of zero three five
we<00:01:54.230> can<00:01:54.410> see<00:01:54.620> that<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.890> vor<00:01:55.160> needle<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:55.880> all

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
we can see that the vor needle is all

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.000 
we can see that the vor needle is all
the<00:01:56.240> way<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.660> left<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.500> we're<00:01:57.680> just<00:01:57.710> going

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
the way to the left so we're just going

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.340 
the way to the left so we're just going
back<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.640> intercept<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.180> radial<00:01:59.540> of<00:01:59.780> zero<00:02:00.110> six

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
because we are so close to the vor the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.510 
because we are so close to the vor the
needle<00:02:18.020> will<00:02:18.200> move<00:02:18.380> fast<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:18.950> we<00:02:19.190> have<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.430> be

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
needle will move fast so we have to be

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.610 
needle will move fast so we have to be

there's<00:03:04.799> no<00:03:05.040> way<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.280> us<00:03:05.609> to<00:03:05.819> tell<00:03:06.030> when<00:03:06.239> we

there's no way for us to tell when we

there's no way for us to tell when we

are exactly over the vor

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.190 
are exactly over the vor
until<00:03:08.519> we<00:03:08.670> actually<00:03:08.849> over<00:03:09.329> fly<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.629> and<00:03:09.900> the

now<00:03:12.780> there<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.109> a<00:03:13.140> way<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.739> tell<00:03:14.010> where<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.519> are

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
now there is a way to tell where you are

now there is a way to tell where you are

triangulation<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:19.319> is<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> best<00:03:19.859> part<00:03:20.159> it's

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519
