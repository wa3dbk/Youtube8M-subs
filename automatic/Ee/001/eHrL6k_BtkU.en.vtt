recommends this be immersed in water or
in<00:01:46.670> wet<00:01:47.270> dirt<00:01:47.539> like<00:01:47.750> an<00:01:47.899> earth<00:01:47.990> battery<00:01:48.700> so

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
in wet dirt like an earth battery so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.760 
in wet dirt like an earth battery so
here<00:01:49.880> we<00:01:50.000> are<00:01:50.119> immersing<00:01:50.720> in<00:01:50.929> water<00:01:51.530> and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
here we are immersing in water and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.040 
here we are immersing in water and
you'll<00:01:52.610> notice<00:01:52.819> oh<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:53.330> attached<00:01:53.899> a

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
you'll notice oh and I attached a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.650 
you'll notice oh and I attached a
capacitor<00:01:54.590> here<00:01:54.770> really<00:01:55.280> big<00:01:55.489> capacitor<00:01:56.090> just

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
capacitor here really big capacitor just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.100 
capacitor here really big capacitor just
so<00:01:56.780> we<00:01:57.229> could<00:01:57.349> observe<00:01:57.500> them<00:02:01.569> this<00:02:02.569> is<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.959> I'm

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
so we could observe them this is a I'm

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.330 
so we could observe them this is a I'm
sorry<00:02:03.379> I'm<00:02:03.530> trying<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.800> rotate<00:02:03.950> this<00:02:04.220> around

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
sorry I'm trying to rotate this around

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.130 
sorry I'm trying to rotate this around
here<00:02:04.700> this<00:02:05.269> is<00:02:05.539> a<00:02:07.000> 16<00:02:08.000> volt<00:02:10.750> three<00:02:11.750> thousand

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
here this is a 16 volt three thousand

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.680 
here this is a 16 volt three thousand
three<00:02:12.290> hundred<00:02:12.319> microfarads

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.390 

connect<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.840> up<00:02:18.990> again

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.839 

okay<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.459> there's<00:02:28.220> not<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> lot<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.489> potential

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
okay so there's not a lot of potential

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.319 
okay so there's not a lot of potential
difference<00:02:30.269> here<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.799> think<00:02:32.610> one<00:02:33.120> thing<00:02:33.150> that

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
difference here I think one thing that

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.210 
difference here I think one thing that
stubble<00:02:33.870> fields<00:02:34.200> patent<00:02:34.530> doesn't<00:02:34.799> mention<00:02:34.920> is

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
stubble fields patent doesn't mention is

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.350 
stubble fields patent doesn't mention is

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the copper the copper wire needs to make

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.660 
the copper the copper wire needs to make
a<00:02:39.390> connection<00:02:39.840> down<00:02:40.290> into<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.680> water<00:02:40.829> or<00:02:41.220> into

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
a connection down into the water or into

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.380 
a connection down into the water or into
the<00:02:42.200> electrolyte<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.879> have<00:02:45.060> both

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
the electrolyte so that you have both

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.920 
the electrolyte so that you have both
the<00:02:45.599> copper<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.230> steel<00:02:47.329> touching<00:02:48.329> so<00:02:48.810> I'm

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
the copper and the steel touching so I'm

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.390 
the copper and the steel touching so I'm
bending<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.379> down<00:02:49.560> now<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.220> touches

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
bending this down now so that it touches

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.949 
bending this down now so that it touches
the<00:02:50.640> wire<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.450> water<00:02:51.689> and<00:02:52.579> look<00:02:53.579> at<00:02:53.700> this

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
the wire of the water and look at this

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:04.879 
the wire of the water and look at this
we<00:02:54.959> have<00:02:55.200> charging<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:01.170> as<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.379> just<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
we have charging so as so this is just a

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.740 
we have charging so as so this is just a

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
in an electrolyte it's a lot of produce

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.619 
in an electrolyte it's a lot of produce
electricity<00:03:19.500> but<00:03:20.400> what<00:03:20.549> Stubblefield<00:03:21.150> has

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
electricity but what Stubblefield has

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.589 
electricity but what Stubblefield has
going<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.349> here<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.739> coil<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:24.030> as<00:03:24.299> it

first to demonstrate wireless broadcast
a<00:03:51.209> voice<00:03:51.389> through<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.260> earth<00:03:52.409> using<00:03:53.220> his

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
a voice through the earth using his

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:00.450 
a voice through the earth using his
technology<00:03:57.379> so<00:03:58.379> I<00:03:58.409> don't<00:03:58.590> know<00:03:58.650> how

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
technology so I don't know how

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.150 
technology so I don't know how
farthest<00:04:01.420> will<00:04:01.540> charge<00:04:01.780> up<00:04:02.050> I'm<00:04:02.320> guessing<00:04:03.040> it

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
farthest will charge up I'm guessing it

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.640 
farthest will charge up I'm guessing it
will<00:04:03.280> go<00:04:03.460> up<00:04:03.490> to<00:04:03.730> about<00:04:04.260> no<00:04:05.260> more<00:04:05.410> than<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.620> half

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
will go up to about no more than a half

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.810 
will go up to about no more than a half
fault<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:07.260> then<00:04:08.260> kind<00:04:08.500> of<00:04:08.560> stabilize<00:04:09.040> there

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.190 

now<00:04:12.820> because<00:04:12.940> this<00:04:13.240> is<00:04:13.300> kind<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.720> big<00:04:13.930> cap

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
now because this is kind of a big cap

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.670 
now because this is kind of a big cap
it'll<00:04:15.840> take<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.870> little<00:04:17.050> while<00:04:17.140> to<00:04:17.350> charge<00:04:17.500> it

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
it'll take a little while to charge it

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:26.360 
it'll take a little while to charge it
up

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.250 

well<00:04:27.370> what<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.730> heck<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:27.970> try<00:04:28.510> is<00:04:28.570> them<00:04:28.870> if<00:04:29.110> I

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
well what the heck to try is them if I

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.700 
well what the heck to try is them if I
remove<00:04:29.470> this<00:04:29.680> from<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.010> water<00:04:31.500> since<00:04:32.500> there's

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
remove this from the water since there's

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.750 
remove this from the water since there's
no<00:04:33.040> longer<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.430> connection<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.090> electrolyte

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
no longer a connection to electrolyte

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.130 
no longer a connection to electrolyte
charging<00:04:36.760> stops<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:38.110> makes<00:04:38.290> sense<00:04:40.020> put<00:04:41.020> this

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
charging stops that makes sense put this

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.080 
charging stops that makes sense put this
back<00:04:41.350> in<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.740> water<00:04:42.040> now<00:04:42.820> we<00:04:42.880> have<00:04:43.000> an

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
back in the water now we have an

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.530 
back in the water now we have an
electrolyte<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:45.580> charging<00:04:45.970> resumes<00:04:48.540> now

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
electrolyte and the charging resumes now

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.000 
electrolyte and the charging resumes now
I<00:04:49.600> notice<00:04:49.780> that<00:04:50.050> some<00:04:50.230> people<00:04:50.500> are<00:04:50.590> taking

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
I notice that some people are taking

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.690 
I notice that some people are taking
earth<00:04:51.280> batteries<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:52.860> connecting<00:04:53.860> them<00:04:54.280> to

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
earth batteries and connecting them to

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.390 
earth batteries and connecting them to
the<00:04:55.740> jewel<00:04:56.740> thief<00:04:56.980> circuit<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:58.150> run<00:04:58.360> LEDs<00:04:59.400> I

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
the jewel thief circuit to run LEDs I

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.740 
the jewel thief circuit to run LEDs I
think<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.480> might<00:05:02.260> try<00:05:02.410> that<00:05:02.500> if<00:05:03.100> I<00:05:03.190> get<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.430> chance

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
think I might try that if I get a chance

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.890 
think I might try that if I get a chance
this<00:05:04.750> double<00:05:05.020> field<00:05:05.200> battery<00:05:06.360> is<00:05:07.360> probably<00:05:07.780> a

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
this double field battery is probably a

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.290 
this double field battery is probably a
little<00:05:08.140> bit<00:05:08.320> more<00:05:08.500> elegant<00:05:08.770> earth<00:05:09.700> battery

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.190 

probably<00:05:16.300> need<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:16.600> construct<00:05:16.930> something

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
probably need to construct something

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.320 
probably need to construct something
bigger<00:05:17.530> than<00:05:17.620> this<00:05:17.919> and<00:05:18.220> or<00:05:18.640> maybe<00:05:18.880> many<00:05:19.210> of

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
bigger than this and or maybe many of

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:27.440 
bigger than this and or maybe many of
them<00:05:19.600> to<00:05:20.140> create<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.800> slightly<00:05:21.490> larger<00:05:21.730> current

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.260 

okay<00:05:28.450> I<00:05:28.480> got<00:05:28.840> another<00:05:29.050> idea<00:05:29.140> here<00:05:29.500> so<00:05:29.740> um

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
okay I got another idea here so um

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.580 
okay I got another idea here so um
imagine<00:05:31.270> that<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.480> planet<00:05:31.870> is<00:05:32.040> surrounded<00:05:33.040> by

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
imagine that the planet is surrounded by

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.930 
imagine that the planet is surrounded by
weather<00:05:35.590> systems<00:05:36.010> that<00:05:36.160> are<00:05:36.280> producing

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
weather systems that are producing

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.760 
weather systems that are producing
lightning<00:05:37.390> bolts<00:05:37.660> striking<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.470> earth<00:05:38.560> all

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
lightning bolts striking the earth all

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.890 
lightning bolts striking the earth all
over<00:05:38.950> the<00:05:39.040> place<00:05:39.220> and<00:05:39.490> there's<00:05:39.640> sort<00:05:40.030> of<00:05:40.150> these

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
over the place and there's sort of these

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.909 
over the place and there's sort of these
spikes<00:05:41.410> and<00:05:42.000> magnetic<00:05:43.000> field<00:05:43.919> fluctuations

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
spikes and magnetic field fluctuations

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.930 
spikes and magnetic field fluctuations
so<00:05:45.850> the<00:05:45.970> question<00:05:46.060> is<00:05:47.820> with<00:05:48.820> this

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
so the question is with this

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.440 
so the question is with this
Stubblefield<00:05:49.479> earth<00:05:50.080> battery<00:05:50.820> if<00:05:51.820> I<00:05:52.090> were<00:05:52.330> to

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
Stubblefield earth battery if I were to

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.330 
Stubblefield earth battery if I were to
take<00:05:52.600> this<00:05:52.780> magnet<00:05:53.290> and<00:05:53.410> sort<00:05:53.650> of<00:05:53.710> move<00:05:54.220> it

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
take this magnet and sort of move it

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.690 
take this magnet and sort of move it
around<00:05:54.400> near<00:05:55.000> this<00:05:55.150> bolt<00:05:56.130> would<00:05:57.130> it<00:05:57.160> make

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
around near this bolt would it make

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.800 
around near this bolt would it make
things<00:05:57.760> go<00:05:58.150> faster

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.779 

turns<00:06:03.810> charging<00:06:04.319> I'm<00:06:04.740> not<00:06:04.949> observing

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
turns charging I'm not observing

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:17.210 
turns charging I'm not observing
anything<00:06:06.120> but<00:06:13.009> certainly<00:06:14.009> there's<00:06:16.220> certainly

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
anything but certainly there's certainly

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.140 
anything but certainly there's certainly
the<00:06:17.370> coral<00:06:17.759> would<00:06:17.970> have<00:06:19.789> some<00:06:20.789> induced

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
the coral would have some induced

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:32.519 
the coral would have some induced
current

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:32.529 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:35.029 

and<00:06:32.649> that<00:06:33.339> would<00:06:33.489> be<00:06:33.519> in<00:06:33.699> the<00:06:34.119> form<00:06:34.389> of

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
and that would be in the form of

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:41.489 
and that would be in the form of
alternating<00:06:36.039> current<00:06:38.459> it<00:06:39.459> is<00:06:39.669> a<00:06:40.199> 336<00:06:41.199> p.m.

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:41.499 
alternating current it is a 336 p.m.

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:45.329 
alternating current it is a 336 p.m.
perhaps<00:06:42.009> I'll<00:06:42.189> come<00:06:42.369> back<00:06:42.519> in<00:06:42.789> a<00:06:43.089> bit
