bit one thing you get rid of it in like

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.710 
bit one thing you get rid of it in like
five<00:04:16.989> days<00:04:17.020> Kyodai<00:04:17.860> all<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.520> waters<00:04:18.880> out<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.690> I

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
five days Kyodai all the waters out so I

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.570 
five days Kyodai all the waters out so I
don't<00:04:19.930> even<00:04:20.200> worry<00:04:20.500> about<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.770> don't<00:04:21.400> the

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
don't even worry about that don't the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.090 
don't even worry about that don't the
fat<00:04:22.620> then<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.650> put<00:04:24.010> on<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.480> not<00:04:25.480> that<00:04:25.630> much<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:26.770> I

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
fat then I put on is not that much so I

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.090 
fat then I put on is not that much so I
think<00:04:27.400> it's<00:04:27.580> mostly<00:04:27.940> being<00:04:28.410> through<00:04:29.410> its<00:04:29.680> from

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
think it's mostly being through its from

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.510 
think it's mostly being through its from
the<00:04:30.250> carbohydrates<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.360> creatine<00:04:31.750> but

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
the carbohydrates and the creatine but

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.890 
the carbohydrates and the creatine but
the<00:04:33.520> strength<00:04:33.910> is<00:04:34.150> totally<00:04:34.960> up<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.900> the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
the strength is totally up and the

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.470 
the strength is totally up and the
motivation<00:04:38.290> is<00:04:38.530> there<00:04:38.860> just<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:40.060> just<00:04:40.210> feels

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
motivation is there just it just feels
