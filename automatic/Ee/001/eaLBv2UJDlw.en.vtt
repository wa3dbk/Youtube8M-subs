00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.149

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.860

 single impulse defect 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.880
 I do not know why since a little 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.860
 I have the feeling that it's the plan 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.540
 loose finally if I think it's 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.830

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.390

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.930
 rhythm in the skin the renois not but 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.000

 blind that would give swag charms years to 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.720
 the pure state the guy has a son who is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.150

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.690

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.489
 proof that there is still a problem 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.390
 when you see that I'm proud to be 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:47.290

 good I can understand at the same time 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.230
 almost every time a people has 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.850
 been oppressed there were whites in the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.590
 delirium it is normal that we will play it 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.900

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.010
 discrimination and dude I mean y'a 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.780
