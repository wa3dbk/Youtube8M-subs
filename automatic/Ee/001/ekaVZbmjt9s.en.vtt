00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
I mean it works but I don't know I just

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.179 
I mean it works but I don't know I just
like<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> little<00:02:02.189> better<00:02:03.409> um<00:02:04.409> what<00:02:05.100> you

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
