update you're not still building it and
it's<00:00:19.419> not<00:00:19.599> finished<00:00:19.840> now<00:00:20.560> I<00:00:20.860> want<00:00:21.099> to<00:00:21.189> say

it's not finished now I want to say

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.850 
it's not finished now I want to say
although<00:00:22.210> it<00:00:22.270> took<00:00:22.480> over<00:00:22.750> 2<00:00:23.230> months<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:23.710> it's

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
although it took over 2 months and it's

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.650 
although it took over 2 months and it's
probably<00:00:24.009> my<00:00:24.189> biggest<00:00:24.369> project<00:00:25.000> yet<00:00:25.060> it<00:00:25.539> was

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
probably my biggest project yet it was

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.630 
probably my biggest project yet it was
actually<00:00:26.020> very<00:00:26.050> very<00:00:26.470> simple<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.040> I'm<00:00:27.520> gonna

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
actually very very simple and I'm gonna

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.889 
actually very very simple and I'm gonna
talk<00:00:27.790> to<00:00:27.880> you<00:00:27.970> about<00:00:28.029> some<00:00:28.419> of<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.570> paths<00:00:28.779> that

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:28.899 
talk to you about some of the paths that

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.659 
talk to you about some of the paths that
I<00:00:28.989> used<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:29.470> why<00:00:29.680> I<00:00:29.710> specifically<00:00:30.250> chose<00:00:30.340> this

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
I used and why I specifically chose this

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.249 
I used and why I specifically chose this
design<00:00:30.969> if<00:00:31.540> you<00:00:31.599> didn't<00:00:31.869> see<00:00:31.930> my<00:00:32.050> previous

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
design if you didn't see my previous

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.380 
design if you didn't see my previous
video<00:00:32.559> the<00:00:32.890> reason<00:00:33.160> why<00:00:33.340> I<00:00:33.370> had<00:00:33.640> to<00:00:33.670> update<00:00:34.149> my

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
video the reason why I had to update my

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.510 
video the reason why I had to update my
dollie<00:00:34.630> is<00:00:35.140> that<00:00:35.350> my<00:00:35.500> first<00:00:35.890> one<00:00:36.070> that<00:00:36.160> I<00:00:36.250> built

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
dollie is that my first one that I built

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.150 
dollie is that my first one that I built
wasn't<00:00:37.000> as<00:00:37.210> stable<00:00:37.660> as<00:00:38.079> I<00:00:38.410> wanted<00:00:38.800> it<00:00:38.890> to<00:00:38.950> be

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
wasn't as stable as I wanted it to be

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.709 
wasn't as stable as I wanted it to be
and<00:00:39.370> so<00:00:39.760> I<00:00:39.820> needed<00:00:40.000> something<00:00:40.450> that<00:00:40.480> I<00:00:40.629> could

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
and so I needed something that I could

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.989 
and so I needed something that I could
stand<00:00:41.140> on<00:00:41.350> or<00:00:41.590> sit<00:00:41.860> on<00:00:41.890> while<00:00:42.250> I'm<00:00:42.430> filming<00:00:42.670> and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999 
stand on or sit on while I'm filming and

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.810 
stand on or sit on while I'm filming and
I<00:00:43.749> went<00:00:44.079> for<00:00:44.260> this<00:00:44.379> specific<00:00:44.859> design<00:00:44.980> because

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
I went for this specific design because

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.970 
I went for this specific design because
I<00:00:45.850> wanted<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.570> Tauri<00:00:46.809> to<00:00:47.019> be<00:00:47.109> able<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.410> turn<00:00:47.739> my

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
I wanted the Tauri to be able to turn my

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.639 
I wanted the Tauri to be able to turn my
previous<00:00:48.429> dolly<00:00:48.640> could<00:00:48.850> only<00:00:49.120> film<00:00:49.839> from<00:00:50.320> in

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
previous dolly could only film from in

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.649 
previous dolly could only film from in
one<00:00:51.159> direction<00:00:51.339> in<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.789> straight<00:00:52.059> line<00:00:52.089> so<00:00:52.510> this

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
one direction in a straight line so this

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.389 
one direction in a straight line so this
one<00:00:52.809> here<00:00:52.989> can<00:00:53.559> actually<00:00:53.859> turn<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.249> that's

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
one here can actually turn and that's

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.489 
one here can actually turn and that's
why<00:00:54.579> I<00:00:54.609> went<00:00:54.999> for<00:00:55.089> this<00:00:55.329> design<00:00:55.749> here<00:00:55.960> so<00:00:56.199> all

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
why I went for this design here so all

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:59.790 
why I went for this design here so all
four<00:00:57.280> wheels<00:00:57.609> or<00:00:58.030> all<00:00:58.359> four<00:00:59.140> sets<00:00:59.440> of<00:00:59.589> wheels

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
four wheels or all four sets of wheels

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.099 
four wheels or all four sets of wheels
can<00:01:00.249> actually<00:01:00.609> rotate<00:01:00.969> it<00:01:01.149> like<00:01:01.239> this<00:01:01.480> which

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
can actually rotate it like this which

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.079 
can actually rotate it like this which
means<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.499> can<00:01:02.649> put<00:01:02.859> it<00:01:02.949> on<00:01:03.039> a<00:01:03.069> curved<00:01:03.399> track<00:01:03.789> and

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
means I can put it on a curved track and

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.399 
means I can put it on a curved track and
the<00:01:04.269> dolly<00:01:04.600> will<00:01:04.780> just<00:01:04.960> turn<00:01:05.080> while<00:01:05.320> I'm

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
the dolly will just turn while I'm

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.190 
the dolly will just turn while I'm
filming<00:01:05.770> in<00:01:06.159> terms<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.210> parts<00:01:07.479> I've<00:01:07.600> got<00:01:07.810> four

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
filming in terms of parts I've got four

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.870 
filming in terms of parts I've got four
wheels<00:01:08.380> on<00:01:08.890> each<00:01:09.040> corner<00:01:09.280> of<00:01:09.370> the<00:01:09.460> dolly<00:01:09.640> and

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
wheels on each corner of the dolly and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.120 
wheels on each corner of the dolly and
I've<00:01:10.330> got<00:01:10.450> four<00:01:10.750> just<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.229> make<00:01:11.770> sure<00:01:11.800> that<00:01:12.070> I

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
I've got four just to make sure that I

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.040 
I've got four just to make sure that I
can<00:01:12.280> carry<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.729> weight<00:01:12.909> of<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.270> camera

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
can carry the weight of the camera

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.440 
can carry the weight of the camera
cameraman<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:14.950> maybe<00:01:15.549> that<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:16.030> focus

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
cameraman and maybe that the focus

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.880 
cameraman and maybe that the focus
puller<00:01:16.600> but<00:01:16.840> I'm<00:01:16.930> not<00:01:17.049> gonna<00:01:17.229> go<00:01:17.350> for<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.649> until

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
puller but I'm not gonna go for it until

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.910 
puller but I'm not gonna go for it until
I've<00:01:18.399> tested<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:18.759> and<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.630> can<00:01:19.810> see<00:01:19.990> here<00:01:20.320> that

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
I've tested it and you can see here that

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.700 
I've tested it and you can see here that
this<00:01:21.310> l-shaped<00:01:21.689> ion<00:01:22.689> was<00:01:22.899> very<00:01:23.200> crucial<00:01:23.439> and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
this l-shaped ion was very crucial and

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.050 
this l-shaped ion was very crucial and
fortunately<00:01:24.159> for<00:01:24.250> me<00:01:24.399> I<00:01:24.490> had<00:01:24.700> lying<00:01:24.939> around

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
the balconies I know it way came from so

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.520 
the balconies I know it way came from so
that's<00:01:27.909> what<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.090> use<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:28.539> it's<00:01:28.689> quite<00:01:29.079> quite

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530

sturdy how men is to get my wheels to

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.380 
sturdy how men is to get my wheels to
pivot<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.680> as<00:01:33.039> you<00:01:33.130> can<00:01:33.189> see<00:01:33.340> here<00:01:33.820> I've<00:01:34.119> got

pivot is as you can see here I've got

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.330 
pivot is as you can see here I've got
this<00:01:34.689> one<00:01:34.960> long<00:01:35.289> 10<00:01:35.619> millimeter<00:01:36.009> screw

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
this one long 10 millimeter screw

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.060 
this one long 10 millimeter screw
running<00:01:37.180> from<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.600> base<00:01:37.840> from<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.289> top<00:01:38.829> of

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
running from the base from the top of

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.639 
running from the base from the top of
the<00:01:39.670> dolly<00:01:39.850> right<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.750> bottom<00:01:40.899> and<00:01:41.380> I'm

the dolly right to the bottom and I'm
using<00:01:41.890> four<00:01:42.520> screws<00:01:42.939> to<00:01:43.299> create<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.719> gap<00:01:43.960> so

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
using four screws to create that gap so

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.959 
using four screws to create that gap so
that<00:01:44.380> my<00:01:44.530> wheels<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:44.979> turn<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.460> not<00:01:45.670> touch

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
that my wheels can turn and not touch

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.480 
that my wheels can turn and not touch
the<00:01:46.210> base<00:01:46.359> and<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.950> at<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.159> bottom<00:01:48.460> there

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
the base and right at the bottom there

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.459 
the base and right at the bottom there
after<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.000> lock<00:01:49.240> nut<00:01:49.539> that<00:01:49.780> obviously<00:01:50.259> just

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
after the lock nut that obviously just

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.050 
after the lock nut that obviously just
keeps<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:51.039> thing<00:01:51.250> from<00:01:51.399> rolling<00:01:51.729> out<00:01:51.850> as

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
keeps this thing from rolling out as

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.429 
keeps this thing from rolling out as
it's<00:01:52.270> spinning<00:01:52.600> because<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:52.899> could<00:01:53.079> spin<00:01:53.350> out

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
it's spinning because it could spin out

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.950 
it's spinning because it could spin out
and<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:53.859> could<00:01:54.039> be<00:01:54.219> like<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:55.450> is<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.570> start<00:01:55.929> to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
and that could be like it is a start to

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.899 
and that could be like it is a start to
say<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.200> least<00:01:56.380> for<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:57.340> base<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.700> dolly

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
say the least for the base of the dolly

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.190 
say the least for the base of the dolly
I've<00:01:58.119> got<00:01:58.299> just<00:01:58.450> simple<00:01:58.810> wood<00:01:58.960> that<00:01:59.109> I've

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
I've got just simple wood that I've

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.050 
I've got just simple wood that I've
bought<00:01:59.350> at<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.530> hard<00:01:59.799> way<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.729> just<00:02:00.909> had<00:02:01.030> to

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
bought at the hard way and I just had to

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.370 
bought at the hard way and I just had to
make<00:02:01.240> sure<00:02:01.299> that<00:02:01.509> it's<00:02:01.659> picking<00:02:01.899> up<00:02:02.109> and<00:02:02.320> so

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
make sure that it's picking up and so

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.020 
make sure that it's picking up and so
you<00:02:02.439> can<00:02:02.590> see<00:02:02.799> I've<00:02:02.979> got<00:02:03.159> two<00:02:03.369> pieces<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.729> wood

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
you can see I've got two pieces of wood

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.580 
you can see I've got two pieces of wood
that<00:02:04.270> I've<00:02:04.719> joined<00:02:04.960> together<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.500> I've

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
that I've joined together that I've

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.739 
that I've joined together that I've
screwed<00:02:05.740> in<00:02:06.250> just<00:02:06.789> a<00:02:06.850> couple<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.179> screws<00:02:07.450> to

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
screwed in just a couple of screws to

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:09.540 
screwed in just a couple of screws to
keep<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:08.080> together<00:02:08.259> in<00:02:08.830> terms<00:02:09.039> of<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.190> width<00:02:09.369> I

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
keep it together in terms of the width I

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.889 
keep it together in terms of the width I
just<00:02:09.789> made<00:02:09.910> sure<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.210> it<00:02:10.330> can<00:02:10.450> fit<00:02:10.690> through<00:02:10.869> a

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
just made sure that it can fit through a

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.960 
just made sure that it can fit through a
door<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.380> it's<00:02:11.530> about<00:02:11.680> 70<00:02:12.190> centimetres<00:02:12.760> and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
the length length wives about a meter

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.040 
the length length wives about a meter
meter<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.610> 10<00:02:15.760> centimeters<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.600> that's<00:02:16.870> just

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
meter and 10 centimeters and that's just

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.899 
meter and 10 centimeters and that's just
to<00:02:17.170> allow<00:02:17.380> for<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.710> cameraman<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.370> tripod

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
to allow for the cameraman the tripod

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.940 
to allow for the cameraman the tripod
and<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> focus<00:02:20.019> puller<00:02:20.200> when<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.530> get<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.830> that

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
and the focus puller when I get to that

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:38.339 
and the focus puller when I get to that
stage

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.589 

the<00:02:38.920> last<00:02:39.099> mechanism<00:02:39.520> that<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.670> built<00:02:39.910> was<00:02:40.240> this

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
the last mechanism that I built was this

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.170 
the last mechanism that I built was this
little<00:02:41.110> tea<00:02:41.920> joint<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.370> use<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.030> is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
little tea joint that I use and this is

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.420 
little tea joint that I use and this is
where<00:02:43.390> they<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:44.110> rod<00:02:44.349> comes<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.830> here<00:02:45.160> that

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
where they the rod comes in here that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.670 
where they the rod comes in here that
the<00:02:45.760> dolly<00:02:46.090> could<00:02:46.270> actually<00:02:46.599> uses<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.440> push

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
the dolly could actually uses to push

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.710 
the dolly could actually uses to push
and<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:47.980> pull<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> dolly<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.880> was<00:02:49.390> worried<00:02:49.690> that

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
and to pull the dolly I was worried that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.900 
and to pull the dolly I was worried that
the<00:02:49.900> PVC<00:02:50.319> might<00:02:50.620> not<00:02:50.860> be<00:02:51.040> as<00:02:51.190> strong<00:02:51.730> and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
the PVC might not be as strong and

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.280 
the PVC might not be as strong and
material<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.390> use<00:02:52.569> but<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.840> actually<00:02:52.989> found

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
material to use but I actually found

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.390 
material to use but I actually found
that<00:02:53.410> actually<00:02:53.800> just<00:02:53.980> works<00:02:54.130> pretty<00:02:54.280> well

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
that actually just works pretty well

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.220 
that actually just works pretty well
this<00:02:54.700> allows<00:02:55.030> for<00:02:55.270> this<00:02:55.390> movement<00:02:55.690> here<00:02:56.020> which

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
this allows for this movement here which

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.050 
this allows for this movement here which
means<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.739> dolly<00:02:57.069> grip<00:02:57.250> can<00:02:57.550> have<00:02:57.760> at

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
means the dolly grip can have at

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.850 
means the dolly grip can have at
whatever<00:02:58.390> end<00:02:58.750> all<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.050> suits<00:02:59.290> investor

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
whatever end all that suits investor

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.130 
whatever end all that suits investor
based<00:03:00.250> on<00:03:00.400> his<00:03:00.580> height<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.000> stuff<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.989> rest

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
based on his height and stuff the rest

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.840 
based on his height and stuff the rest
that's<00:03:02.590> left<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:02.950> do<00:03:03.100> now<00:03:03.130> such<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.459> painted

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
that's left to do now such a painted

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.100 
that's left to do now such a painted
black<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.090> then<00:03:04.360> I'm<00:03:04.450> gonna<00:03:04.569> have<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.750> piece<00:03:04.959> of
