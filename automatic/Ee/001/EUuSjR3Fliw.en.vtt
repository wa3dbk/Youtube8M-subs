00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.730
 let's analyze the negotiation techniques 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.760
 pressure that you can use 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.170
 in order to emotionally loosen 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.439
 opponent and so he stopped 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.330
 feel the ground under your feet 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:29.480
 first bargaining pressure 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.480
 called depreciation depreciation 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.970
 any argument or competitive 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:42.780
 the advantage that your opponent says 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:49.530
 say so at all 1 option 2 option 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:52.070
 there is a better and the third option is ladies 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.070
 Problems 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.469
 given this problem that is it is not 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:05.399
 advantage of the problem suppose 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.649
 customer manager tells you we are in the market 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.110
 we have a lot of experience for 10 years 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:14.130
 it gives you the opportunity ta ta ta ta ta 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.369
 ta and you answer at the cottage there are companies 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.709

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.810

 Please do not need to consider something 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.590
 so everyone has it better if we 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.119
 say so please everyone 10 years on 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.009
 the market 10 years says the manager 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.340
 so we have a lot of experience you burn in 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.840
 all great experience in our business without 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 experience doesn't survive at all 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.700
 so young at all big 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.390
 everyoneâ€™s decent experience this month 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.720
 of suppliers 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.080
 somehow from which we choose he 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.509
 for example says we have a respite you 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.700
 say everyone has a respite we at all 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.360
 we do not consider all without delay 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.489
 offers 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.220
 they are all in the bin if u have 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:08.720
 better you have a little line we have 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.890
 sentence with line more 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.530
 now let's break this one 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.480
 problem we are 10 years on the market with us 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.310
 serious shoes home fishing rods but this 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.379
 problem when the company acts on 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.480
 it means she has a big market 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.519
 amount of overhead she 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.829
 bureaucrats zero wanna and we have to 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.799
 overpay for it we are not ready 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.349
 overpay for it we have big 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.769
 the company itself will also have to overpay 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.920
 for bloated bloated frames for overhead 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.459
 our expenses are professional 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.590
 management 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.810
 And now I understand why you have such 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.379
 big goals when professional 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.790
 management 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.890
 who professionally takes big 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.969
 salary it all affects 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.939
 cost of goods 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:54.409
 why we will pay for it 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:58.670
 give us a good technique or service 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.560
 for example these as yes but it is a problem 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.180
 we have a great experience 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.609
 long ago this problem you have for raspberries 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.730
 look you have no serious experience you have 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.359
 zazylyam look at things and we need 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.890
 provider 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:15.840
 with not a zoomed look for example we 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.700
 young ambitious company looking for such 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.290
 same supplier 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.010
 they are an old supplier who have long been on 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.829
 the market is down and there has long been no 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.719
 his ambitions of excitement in his gaze is not that 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:32.700
 we need a supplier just as ambitious 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:38.150
 how does he ethic this tactic is insulting it 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:41.700
 admission depreciation must write down 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.379
 with example phrases as you can 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.859
 depreciate 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:49.889
 customer second competitive advantage 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:53.120
 the tool that we go through is 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.120
 time limit 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.189
 constantly rush your opponent say that 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:14.840
 he has little time left 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:17.980
 you rush the other person tell me what 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.980
 time is short 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.890
 constantly rush if about the beginning 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.520
 conversation will ask how much we have 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.260
 of time 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.170
 say he has five minutes 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:40.010
 because you have been assigned the following 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.530
 meeting with another supplier 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.170
 he has only 5 minutes he will 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.390
 chattering mistaken trying to hurry and 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:51.500
 at the end when you see enough 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.200
 heat up the situation can be further 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.360
 still devalue so everyone has better yes 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.810
 well, this is a problem 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:03.040
 heat up the pads too 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.630
 ok so young man i understood 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.390
 from what you said don't forget he 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.760
 loosen it feels the ground under your feet 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.560
 I understood everything and then for example goes 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.220
 tactic inflated strap 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.810
 but we are ready to take you on and 640 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.070
 delaying 30 days he thought somehow 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.410
 went to this price with a maximum discount 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.980
 so on at this moment if he 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.410
 I thought it was clear that there is much to give 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.110
 he will voice his sentence but she will 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.150
 already far below the previous near how 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.270
 maximum discounts which could give 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.550
 because you emotionally shaken him 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:46.780
 and he already thinks about it as if in general 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:50.470
 make a deal next tactic 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.470
 creating pressure
