00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
mathcad with Pro II through utilizing

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.210 
mathcad with Pro II through utilizing
parameters<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.759> relationships<00:00:15.980> we'll<00:00:16.980> start

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
parameters and relationships we'll start

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.450 
parameters and relationships we'll start
out<00:00:17.340> by<00:00:17.520> creating<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> rectangular<00:00:18.510> prism<00:00:19.460> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
out by creating a rectangular prism and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.130 
out by creating a rectangular prism and
then<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> next<00:00:20.910> step<00:00:21.060> would<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.480> create<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
then the next step would be to create a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.279 
then the next step would be to create a
parameter<00:00:23.039> will<00:00:23.730> create<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> parameter<00:00:24.960> for

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
parameter will create a parameter for

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.130 
parameter will create a parameter for
height<00:00:25.820> then<00:00:26.820> we'll<00:00:27.060> need<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.420> create<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.900> math

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
height then we'll need to create a math

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.859 
height then we'll need to create a math
CAD<00:00:28.380> document<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.789> will<00:00:30.090> take<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.750> this

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
CAD document that will take in this

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.069 
CAD document that will take in this
parameter<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.489> output<00:00:32.489> again<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> same<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
parameter and output again the same the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.979 
parameter and output again the same the
same<00:00:34.110> value<00:00:34.790> will<00:00:35.790> use<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.300> relations<00:00:36.750> within

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
same value will use the relations within

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.720 
same value will use the relations within
pro<00:00:37.290> e<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:38.250> grab<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:40.340> value<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.579> an

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
pro e to grab that value out of an

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.369 
pro e to grab that value out of an
analysis<00:00:42.210> feature<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.660> then<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.140> will

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
analysis feature and then that will

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.310 
analysis feature and then that will
complete<00:00:43.860> our<00:00:43.890> integration<00:00:45.170> here<00:00:46.170> we'll

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
complete our integration here we'll

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.889 
complete our integration here we'll
begin<00:00:46.590> by<00:00:46.649> creating<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.610> rectangle<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.480> our<00:00:48.660> top

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
begin by creating a rectangle on our top

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.229 
begin by creating a rectangle on our top
datum<00:00:49.410> plane<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.800> then<00:00:50.250> will<00:00:50.460> extrude<00:00:51.030> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
datum plane and then will extrude that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.990 
datum plane and then will extrude that
an<00:00:51.449> arbitrary<00:00:51.960> amount<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:53.070> point<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
an arbitrary amount at this point the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.610 
an arbitrary amount at this point the
values<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.989> dimensions<00:00:55.410> don't

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
values and the dimensions don't

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
values and the dimensions don't
necessarily<00:00:56.039> matter<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:57.329> will<00:00:57.480> be

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
necessarily matter as we will be

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.970 
necessarily matter as we will be
changing<00:00:57.930> them<00:00:58.050> later<00:00:58.289> through<00:00:58.949> our

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
changing them later through our

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.350 
changing them later through our
integration

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.299 

the<00:01:02.960> first<00:01:03.170> thing<00:01:03.320> we'll<00:01:03.440> need<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.650> do<00:01:03.800> is<00:01:04.010> is

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
the first thing we'll need to do is is

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.760 
the first thing we'll need to do is is
create<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:04.820> parameter<00:01:05.540> for<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.440> high

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
create a parameter for the high

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.080 
create a parameter for the high
dimension<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:08.000> we'll<00:01:08.120> go<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.270> tools

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
dimension so we'll go to tools

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.149 
dimension so we'll go to tools
parameters

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.550 

and<00:01:13.249> then<00:01:13.820> we'll<00:01:13.999> add<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.450> parameter<00:01:14.689> will<00:01:15.380> name

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
and then we'll add a parameter will name

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.090 
and then we'll add a parameter will name
it<00:01:15.590> height<00:01:15.969> will<00:01:16.969> give<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.509> value<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.679> 10<00:01:18.920> and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
it height will give it a value of 10 and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.530 
it height will give it a value of 10 and
then<00:01:20.030> we'll<00:01:20.270> add<00:01:20.569> an<00:01:21.319> inch<00:01:21.560> unit

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.960 

the<00:01:26.110> next<00:01:26.350> step<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:26.680> we'll<00:01:27.190> need<00:01:27.400> to<00:01:27.610> go<00:01:27.940> ahead

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
the next step is we'll need to go ahead

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.820 
the next step is we'll need to go ahead
and<00:01:28.210> create<00:01:28.420> an<00:01:28.720> analysis<00:01:29.170> feature<00:01:29.350> so<00:01:29.710> we'll

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
and create an analysis feature so we'll

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.610 
and create an analysis feature so we'll
go<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:29.980> analysis<00:01:30.580> external<00:01:31.300> analysis<00:01:31.750> mathcad

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
go to analysis external analysis mathcad

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.860 
go to analysis external analysis mathcad
analysis<00:01:33.160> which<00:01:34.000> will<00:01:34.150> open<00:01:34.270> up<00:01:34.420> in<00:01:34.570> our<00:01:34.690> top

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
analysis which will open up in our top

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.800 
analysis which will open up in our top
right<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.350> our<00:01:36.040> screen<00:01:36.520> we<00:01:37.510> have<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.720> option

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
right of our screen we have the option

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.450 
right of our screen we have the option
to<00:01:38.020> either<00:01:38.230> load<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.590> file<00:01:38.860> or<00:01:39.100> create<00:01:39.370> a<00:01:39.400> new

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
to either load a file or create a new

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.280 
to either load a file or create a new
file<00:01:39.820> we'll<00:01:40.510> go<00:01:40.660> ahead<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:40.840> choose<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.170> create

a<00:01:41.440> new<00:01:41.620> file<00:01:41.830> at<00:01:41.980> this<00:01:42.160> point<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.990> we<00:01:44.110> have

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
a new file at this point here we have

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.500 
a new file at this point here we have
just<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.530> blank<00:01:44.740> mathcad<00:01:45.190> document<00:01:45.670> we're

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
just a blank mathcad document we're

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.080 
just a blank mathcad document we're
going<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.660> start<00:01:46.720> out<00:01:46.930> by<00:01:47.110> creating<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:48.090> height

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
going to start out by creating a height

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.250 
going to start out by creating a height
sub<00:01:49.570> pro<00:01:50.250> variable<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.540> i<00:01:52.540> will<00:01:52.870> just<00:01:53.020> give<00:01:53.140> it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
sub pro variable and i will just give it

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.780 
sub pro variable and i will just give it
again<00:01:53.500> an<00:01:53.620> arbitrary<00:01:54.010> value<00:01:54.340> at<00:01:54.430> this<00:01:54.520> point

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
again an arbitrary value at this point

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.400 
again an arbitrary value at this point
then<00:01:55.600> we're<00:01:55.720> going<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.900> go<00:01:55.990> ahead<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.229> link

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
then we're going to go ahead and link

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.060 
then we're going to go ahead and link
that<00:01:56.680> height<00:01:57.280> sub<00:01:58.090> pro<00:01:58.360> value<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:59.530> another

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
that height sub pro value to another

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.200 
that height sub pro value to another
variable<00:02:00.520> called<00:02:01.210> height<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:04.060> to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
variable called height and then just to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.940 
variable called height and then just to
double<00:02:04.450> check<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.780> that<00:02:04.960> variable<00:02:05.530> will

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
double check to that variable will

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.590 
double check to that variable will
actually<00:02:06.310> be<00:02:06.400> updated<00:02:06.850> with<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.150> appropriate

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
actually be updated with the appropriate

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.530 
actually be updated with the appropriate
terms<00:02:08.500> will<00:02:08.920> type<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.250> in<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.399> hit<00:02:09.610> equals<00:02:09.729> as

will need to connect this analysis with
a<00:03:01.830> parameter<00:03:02.460> so<00:03:02.850> we'll<00:03:02.970> hit<00:03:03.090> add<00:03:03.270> parameter

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
a parameter so we'll hit add parameter

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.450 
a parameter so we'll hit add parameter
will<00:03:04.440> choose<00:03:04.680> height<00:03:04.920> which<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
parameter that we've put into pro ii and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.950 
parameter that we've put into pro ii and
we'll<00:03:07.740> connect<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.430> hide<00:03:08.910> sub<00:03:09.180> pro<00:03:09.420> which

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
we'll connect that to hide sub pro which

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.720 
we'll connect that to hide sub pro which
is<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.230> value<00:03:10.530> variable<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.070> was<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.310> math<00:03:11.490> cat

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
is the value variable it was in math cat

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.360 
is the value variable it was in math cat
also<00:03:12.660> need<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.930> choose<00:03:13.140> our<00:03:13.320> outputs<00:03:13.740> so<00:03:14.250> we'll

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
also need to choose our outputs so we'll

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.940 
also need to choose our outputs so we'll
choose<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.820> height<00:03:15.000> output<00:03:15.420> again<00:03:16.380> from<00:03:16.740> math

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
choose the height output again from math

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.770 
choose the height output again from math
cat<00:03:17.190> which<00:03:17.610> will<00:03:17.760> as<00:03:17.910> you'll<00:03:18.060> see<00:03:18.210> is<00:03:18.360> one<00:03:18.570> inch

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
cat which will as you'll see is one inch

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.410 
cat which will as you'll see is one inch
here<00:03:19.050> we'll<00:03:19.680> hit<00:03:19.830> okay<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.820> next<00:03:21.030> step<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.390> to

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
here we'll hit okay the next step is to

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.610 
here we'll hit okay the next step is to
compute<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:23.570> as<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.720> can<00:03:24.870> see<00:03:24.900> we<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.590> a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
compute and as you can see we have a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.460 
compute and as you can see we have a
value<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.100> 10<00:03:26.310> inches<00:03:26.580> which<00:03:27.090> shows<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.470> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
value of 10 inches which shows that the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.350 
value of 10 inches which shows that the
parameter<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.400> actually<00:03:29.670> gone<00:03:29.820> through<00:03:29.850> pro<00:03:30.330> e

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360

it MC 1 as you can see here is showing

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.190 
it MC 1 as you can see here is showing
up<00:03:40.620> in<00:03:40.710> our<00:03:40.800> model<00:03:41.010> tree<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:42.050> then<00:03:43.050> we'll

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
up in our model tree and then we'll

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.300 
up in our model tree and then we'll
close<00:03:43.320> that<00:03:43.650> analysis<00:03:44.270> dialog<00:03:45.270> box<00:03:46.310> finally

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
close that analysis dialog box finally

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.600 
close that analysis dialog box finally
we<00:03:47.430> will<00:03:47.730> need<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:47.970> add<00:03:48.540> relation

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.460 

so<00:03:52.270> first<00:03:52.480> what<00:03:52.600> we<00:03:52.720> need<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.900> do<00:03:53.020> is<00:03:53.200> we<00:03:53.380> need

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
so first what we need to do is we need

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.390 
so first what we need to do is we need
to<00:03:53.590> find<00:03:53.830> which<00:03:54.460> dimension<00:03:55.360> we<00:03:55.810> want<00:03:56.050> to<00:03:56.400> run

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
to find which dimension we want to run

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.300 
to find which dimension we want to run
through<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:58.380> as<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.560> can<00:03:59.680> see<00:03:59.710> here<00:04:00.100> or

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
through and as you can see here or

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.560 
through and as you can see here or
looking<00:04:00.580> for<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.790> height<00:04:00.940> dimension<00:04:01.390> so

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
looking for the height dimension so

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.120 
looking for the height dimension so
we'll<00:04:01.690> choose<00:04:01.900> d0<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:04.000> we'll<00:04:04.180> type<00:04:04.330> ND<00:04:04.750> 0

in<00:04:45.460> fact<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.760> has<00:04:45.910> changed<00:04:46.360> now<00:04:47.020> just<00:04:47.260> a<00:04:47.350> double

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
in fact it has changed now just a double

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.080 
in fact it has changed now just a double
check<00:04:47.830> that<00:04:48.010> our<00:04:48.160> integration<00:04:48.700> is<00:04:48.790> working

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
check that our integration is working

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.580 
check that our integration is working
appropriately<00:04:49.270> we'll<00:04:49.930> go<00:04:50.020> back<00:04:50.200> into<00:04:50.410> our

appropriately we'll go back into our
parameters<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.360> we'll<00:04:52.360> change<00:04:52.660> that

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
parameters and we'll change that

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.460 
parameters and we'll change that
parameter<00:04:53.140> to<00:04:53.710> another<00:04:54.660> value<00:04:55.660> let's<00:04:55.960> say<00:04:56.020> 20

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470

inches<00:04:56.950> we'll<00:04:57.880> hit<00:04:57.940> OK<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.300> exit<00:04:58.479> our<00:04:58.780> dialog

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
inches we'll hit OK to exit our dialog

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.159 
inches we'll hit OK to exit our dialog
box<00:04:59.490> then<00:05:00.490> we'll<00:05:00.640> need<00:05:00.790> to<00:05:01.000> regenerate<00:05:01.479> now

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
box then we'll need to regenerate now

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.390 
box then we'll need to regenerate now
here<00:05:02.380> we'll<00:05:02.500> need<00:05:02.620> to<00:05:02.710> regenerate<00:05:02.979> twice

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
here we'll need to regenerate twice

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.110 
here we'll need to regenerate twice
because<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:05.440> first<00:05:05.650> regenerate<00:05:06.190> actually

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
because the first regenerate actually

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.390 
because the first regenerate actually
does<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.510> math<00:05:07.690> for<00:05:07.990> pro<00:05:08.140> ii<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.470> then<00:05:09.040> the

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
does the math for pro ii and then the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.330 
does the math for pro ii and then the
second<00:05:09.729> regeneration<00:05:10.919> actually<00:05:11.919> makes<00:05:12.250> the

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
second regeneration actually makes the

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.219 
second regeneration actually makes the
physical<00:05:12.700> changes<00:05:13.000> within<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.750> graphical

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
physical changes within the graphical

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.219 
physical changes within the graphical
window<00:05:14.530> as<00:05:14.740> you<00:05:15.580> can<00:05:15.669> see<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.270> cube<00:05:17.169> is

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
window as you can see the cube is

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.620 
window as you can see the cube is
changed<00:05:17.650> and<00:05:17.740> it<00:05:17.860> is<00:05:18.040> in<00:05:18.250> fact<00:05:18.450> 20<00:05:19.450> inches

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.170 

well<00:05:23.230> that's<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:23.560> for<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.010> pro<00:05:24.670> e<00:05:24.700> mathcad

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
well that's it for the pro e mathcad

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.290 
well that's it for the pro e mathcad
integration<00:05:25.780> and<00:05:26.850> again<00:05:27.850> just<00:05:27.970> a<00:05:28.090> very<00:05:28.240> quick

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300
