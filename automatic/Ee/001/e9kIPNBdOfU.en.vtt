00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
costume as you see he's I don't know in

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.830 
costume as you see he's I don't know in
my<00:04:17.930> opinion<00:04:18.140> its<00:04:18.650> wings<00:04:18.950> better<00:04:19.280> but<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.480> I

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
my opinion its wings better but it I

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.690 
my opinion its wings better but it I
don't<00:04:20.959> think<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.500> would<00:04:21.650> probably<00:04:21.680> do<00:04:22.280> much<00:04:22.520> of

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
don't think it would probably do much of

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.310 
don't think it would probably do much of
a<00:04:22.790> difference<00:04:23.180> it's<00:04:23.390> just<00:04:23.660> for<00:04:23.870> visual

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
a difference it's just for visual

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.020 
a difference it's just for visual
effects<00:04:24.650> but<00:04:26.440> as<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.710> can<00:04:27.860> see<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.340> don't<00:04:28.910> know

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
effects but as you can see I don't know

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.900 
effects but as you can see I don't know
I<00:04:29.060> just<00:04:29.240> really<00:04:30.020> liked<00:04:30.500> this<00:04:30.680> suit<00:04:31.010> it's<00:04:31.550> just
