directly<00:04:38.639> back<00:04:38.820> into<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.300> drive<00:04:39.539> and<00:04:39.840> that

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
directly back into the drive and that

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.310 
directly back into the drive and that
will<00:04:40.620> boot<00:04:40.830> up<00:04:41.009> and<00:04:41.340> we're<00:04:42.030> going<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.240> see<00:04:42.509> what

so yeah I mean I think you can probably
tell<00:04:48.750> by<00:04:48.810> now

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199

that this does in fact fix my Nets type
issues<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:55.199> finally<00:04:55.729> black<00:04:56.729> ops<00:04:56.970> now<00:04:57.330> agrees

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870

problems that I've had and it's not at

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.180 
problems that I've had and it's not at
all<00:05:17.820> my<00:05:18.060> own<00:05:18.240> idea<00:05:18.690> I<00:05:18.750> just<00:05:18.919> stumbled<00:05:19.919> across

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
all my own idea I just stumbled across

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.089 
all my own idea I just stumbled across
this<00:05:20.580> on<00:05:20.789> a<00:05:20.820> forum<00:05:21.449> as<00:05:21.570> a<00:05:21.599> fix<00:05:21.930> for<00:05:22.620> how<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.800> do

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
this on a forum as a fix for how to do

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.400 
this on a forum as a fix for how to do
it<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.970> thought<00:05:24.479> I'd<00:05:24.660> make<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:24.840> sort<00:05:25.320> of

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
it and I thought I'd make a sort of

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.370 
it and I thought I'd make a sort of
real-time<00:05:25.770> video<00:05:26.370> of<00:05:26.910> me<00:05:27.570> attempting<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.199> was

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
real-time video of me attempting it was

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.980 
real-time video of me attempting it was
the<00:05:28.500> first<00:05:28.740> time<00:05:29.070> that<00:05:29.099> and<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:30.120> tried<00:05:30.479> this<00:05:30.690> fix

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
the first time that and I tried this fix

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.620 
the first time that and I tried this fix
and<00:05:31.289> so<00:05:31.650> I<00:05:31.680> thought<00:05:31.889> I'll<00:05:32.820> record<00:05:33.120> it<00:05:33.300> I'll<00:05:33.449> see

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
and so I thought I'll record it I'll see

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.150 
and so I thought I'll record it I'll see
what<00:05:33.780> happens<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.410> so<00:05:34.889> we're<00:05:35.039> at<00:05:35.099> the

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
what happens and so we're at the

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.330 
what happens and so we're at the
multiplayer<00:05:35.580> menu<00:05:36.530> reading<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.830> hard<00:05:38.010> disk

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
multiplayer menu reading the hard disk

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.960 
multiplayer menu reading the hard disk
and<00:05:39.139> we're<00:05:40.139> going<00:05:40.289> to<00:05:40.349> go<00:05:41.099> to<00:05:41.159> the<00:05:41.370> PlayStation

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
and we're going to go to the PlayStation

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.939 
and we're going to go to the PlayStation
Network<00:05:44.030> eventually<00:05:45.030> and<00:05:45.810> they<00:05:46.229> see<00:05:46.289> in<00:05:46.770> the

you got any other questions for me

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.560 
you got any other questions for me
give<00:06:04.770> me<00:06:04.830> a<00:06:04.889> shout<00:06:05.099> believe<00:06:05.849> this<00:06:06.090> works<00:06:06.360> with

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
give me a shout believe this works with

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.990 
give me a shout believe this works with
other<00:06:06.720> games<00:06:07.020> that<00:06:07.349> aren't<00:06:08.099> modern<00:06:08.610> warfare<00:06:08.760> 2

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
other games that aren't modern warfare 2

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.570 
other games that aren't modern warfare 2
but<00:06:09.479> that<00:06:09.990> was<00:06:10.169> the<00:06:10.380> solution<00:06:11.099> that<00:06:11.250> I<00:06:11.310> saw

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
but that was the solution that I saw

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.120 
but that was the solution that I saw
suggested<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.389> I<00:06:12.870> had<00:06:12.990> a<00:06:13.020> copy<00:06:13.289> of<00:06:13.470> it<00:06:13.590> so<00:06:13.860> I

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
suggested and I had a copy of it so I

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.180 
suggested and I had a copy of it so I
gave<00:06:14.970> it<00:06:15.120> a<00:06:15.180> go<00:06:15.360> and<00:06:15.599> pretty<00:06:16.590> annoying<00:06:16.949> that

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
gave it a go and pretty annoying that

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.379 
gave it a go and pretty annoying that
you're<00:06:17.340> probably<00:06:17.550> going<00:06:17.789> to<00:06:17.849> have<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:18.000> do<00:06:18.240> this

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
you're probably going to have to do this

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.110 
you're probably going to have to do this
every<00:06:18.750> time<00:06:18.780> you<00:06:19.460> want<00:06:20.460> to<00:06:20.520> play<00:06:20.699> black<00:06:20.970> ops

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
every time you want to play black ops

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.719 
every time you want to play black ops
but<00:06:21.539> it's<00:06:22.199> better<00:06:22.500> than<00:06:22.830> never<00:06:23.220> getting<00:06:23.610> into

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
but it's better than never getting into

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.270 
but it's better than never getting into
any<00:06:24.060> parties<00:06:24.539> at<00:06:24.690> all<00:06:24.840> I've<00:06:25.740> been<00:06:25.800> mr.<00:06:26.070> van

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
any parties at all I've been mr. van

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.539 
any parties at all I've been mr. van
leader<00:06:26.490> have<00:06:27.180> a<00:06:27.210> good<00:06:27.389> day
