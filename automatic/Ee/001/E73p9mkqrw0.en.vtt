and<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.910> can<00:02:25.030> put<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.540> freezer<00:02:30.570> now

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
and you can put it in the freezer now

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.370 
and you can put it in the freezer now
you<00:02:32.590> have<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.980> slam<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.730> really<00:02:34.330> hard<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:35.320> is

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
you have to slam it really hard this is

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.890 
you have to slam it really hard this is
the<00:02:35.530> kind<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.160> an<00:02:36.310> anger<00:02:36.640> management

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the kind of like an anger management

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.810 
the kind of like an anger management
therapy<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.740> once<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.040> get<00:02:39.190> all<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.550> scouts

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
therapy so once you get all the scouts

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.820 
therapy so once you get all the scouts
out<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.480> can<00:02:40.660> transfer<00:02:41.110> them<00:02:41.260> onto<00:02:41.650> the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
out you can transfer them onto the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.520 
out you can transfer them onto the
baking<00:02:41.980> sheet<00:02:42.460> and<00:02:42.670> then<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.570> have<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.810> repeat

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
baking sheet and then you have to repeat

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.500 
baking sheet and then you have to repeat
the<00:02:44.710> process<00:02:44.890> again<00:02:45.460> if<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.880> had<00:02:46.090> several<00:02:46.390> of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the process again if you had several of

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.230 
the process again if you had several of
these<00:02:46.720> molds<00:02:47.140> originally<00:02:48.040> they<00:02:48.220> are<00:02:48.400> for<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
these molds originally they are for the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.300 
these molds originally they are for the
ice<00:02:49.450> cubes<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.140> then<00:02:50.470> they<00:02:50.709> work<00:02:50.860> really<00:02:51.190> well

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
ice cubes but then they work really well

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.699 
ice cubes but then they work really well
for<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.850> too<00:02:52.120> if<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.840> have<00:02:53.020> some<00:02:53.230> residual

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
for this too if you have some residual

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.160 
for this too if you have some residual
dough<00:02:54.640> there<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.150> may<00:02:55.270> want<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.540> wipe<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.930> off

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
dough there you may want to wipe it off

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.290 
dough there you may want to wipe it off
so<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.470> don't<00:02:56.560> transfer<00:02:57.220> different<00:02:57.940> colors

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
so you don't transfer different colors

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.040 
so you don't transfer different colors
onto<00:02:58.709> your<00:02:59.709> other<00:03:00.070> dough<00:03:00.370> again<00:03:01.360> sprayed<00:03:01.900> with

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
onto your other dough again sprayed with

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.540 
onto your other dough again sprayed with
the<00:03:02.170> spray<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.470> here<00:03:02.800> is<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.040> blue<00:03:03.280> though

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
the spray and here is the blue though

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.199 
the spray and here is the blue though
that<00:03:03.820> I'm<00:03:03.940> using<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:06.190> can<00:03:06.340> roll<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.790> nicely

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
that I'm using you can roll it nicely

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.540 
that I'm using you can roll it nicely
into<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.450> ball<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.989> then<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:09.010> can<00:03:09.190> fill<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.520> the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
into a ball and then you can fill in the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.890 
into a ball and then you can fill in the
cavity<00:03:11.310> I'm<00:03:12.310> using<00:03:12.580> gloves<00:03:12.910> for<00:03:13.300> this<00:03:13.480> as<00:03:13.660> well

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
cavity I'm using gloves for this as well

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.550 
cavity I'm using gloves for this as well
it<00:03:14.440> seems<00:03:14.739> like<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:15.190> works<00:03:15.430> really<00:03:15.700> well<00:03:15.820> with

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
it seems like it works really well with

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.560 
it seems like it works really well with
colored<00:03:17.560> dough<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.190> don't<00:03:18.430> transfer<00:03:19.420> the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
colored dough so you don't transfer the

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.860 
colored dough so you don't transfer the
food<00:03:19.959> coloring<00:03:20.380> onto<00:03:20.709> your<00:03:20.830> hands<00:03:21.870> again

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
food coloring onto your hands again

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.120 
food coloring onto your hands again
slimy<00:03:23.260> hard<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.780> get<00:03:26.019> first<00:03:26.320> cow<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:26.950> then

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
slimy hard so you get first cow and then

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.979 
slimy hard so you get first cow and then
I<00:03:27.400> mean<00:03:27.550> they<00:03:27.730> will<00:03:27.940> eventually<00:03:28.180> pop<00:03:28.630> out<00:03:28.810> you

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
I mean they will eventually pop out you

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.030 
I mean they will eventually pop out you
just<00:03:29.080> have<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.440> be<00:03:29.560> patient<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:31.920> think<00:03:32.920> it's

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
just have to be patient I think it's

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.800 
just have to be patient I think it's
totally<00:03:33.190> worth<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.000> result<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.600> really

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
totally worth it the result is really

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.229 
totally worth it the result is really
fun<00:03:35.170> once<00:03:35.800> you<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.160> them<00:03:36.310> all<00:03:36.430> done<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:37.030> can

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
fun once you have them all done you can

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.229 
fun once you have them all done you can
chill<00:03:37.480> them<00:03:37.750> in<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.050> fridge<00:03:38.350> for<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:39.239> couple

chill them in the fridge for a couple
minutes<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.630> then<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:41.019> can<00:03:41.260> bake<00:03:41.830> them<00:03:42.840> at

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840
