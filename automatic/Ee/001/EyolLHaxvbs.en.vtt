example you can get character cards on

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 
example you can get character cards on
this<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.220> bronze<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.090> don't<00:01:15.270> got<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.750> silver<00:01:16.110> or

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
this a bronze I don't got a silver or

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.350 
this a bronze I don't got a silver or
gold<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:16.560> first<00:01:17.490> bronze<00:01:17.700> cloud<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> think<00:01:18.240> I've

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
gold but first bronze cloud I think I've

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.929 
gold but first bronze cloud I think I've
got<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.720> let's<00:01:18.750> fuse<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.409> guy<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.790> them

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
got so let's fuse that guy and get them

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.670 
got so let's fuse that guy and get them
a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.509> bit<00:01:21.689> stronger<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.320> bit<00:01:22.530> more

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
a little bit stronger I get bit more

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.200 
a little bit stronger I get bit more
health<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.040> well<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.490> brings<00:01:23.820> them<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
health as well so that brings them to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
health as well so that brings them to
elite<00:01:24.689> two<00:01:25.080> or<00:01:25.350> fuse<00:01:25.950> number<00:01:26.159> two<00:01:26.310> or<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
elite two or fuse number two or if you

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.420 
elite two or fuse number two or if you
want<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.939> call<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.810> that's<00:01:27.960> cool<00:01:28.430> number

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
want to call it so that's cool number

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760 
want to call it so that's cool number
two<00:01:29.640> let's<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:30.900> again

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
give me a special to attack so this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.670 
give me a special to attack so this
gives<00:01:41.369> me<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> level<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.540> gold<00:01:43.140> character

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680

on<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.009> second<00:01:44.520> move<00:01:44.850> which<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.390> good

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
on this second move which is really good

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.719 
on this second move which is really good
because<00:01:46.020> off<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> water<00:01:46.710> get<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> bit<00:01:47.130> pricey

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
because off the water get a bit pricey

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.850 
because off the water get a bit pricey
so<00:01:48.240> instead<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.509> using<00:01:48.689> your<00:01:48.810> coins<00:01:49.229> which<00:01:49.530> can

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
so instead of using your coins which can

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.670 
so instead of using your coins which can
be<00:01:49.979> quite<00:01:50.220> rare<00:01:50.960> especially<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.439> they<00:01:52.560> don't

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
be quite rare especially when they don't

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.609 
be quite rare especially when they don't
do<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> daily<00:01:53.610> booster<00:01:54.240> coin<00:01:55.170> challenge

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
do the daily booster coin challenge

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.130 
do the daily booster coin challenge
thing<00:01:55.829> they<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.060> quite<00:01:57.270> hard<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.780> so

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
thing they can be quite hard to get so

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.959 
thing they can be quite hard to get so
by<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.799> means<00:01:58.829> I'll<00:01:59.219> save<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> lot<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> these

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
by all means I'll save a lot of these

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.130 
by all means I'll save a lot of these
things<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.360> those<00:02:00.479> rainy<00:02:00.719> days

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
things for those rainy days

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.850 
things for those rainy days
I'm<00:02:01.829> afraid<00:02:02.159> let's<00:02:02.850> say<00:02:02.969> we<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.329> time

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.620 

it's<00:02:06.860> funny<00:02:07.159> seeing<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.579> that<00:02:07.939> those<00:02:08.239> coins

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
it's funny seeing that that those coins

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.440 
it's funny seeing that that those coins
go<00:02:08.750> down<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.259> quickly<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.950> get<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.670> level<00:02:11.120> up<00:02:11.209> on<00:02:11.420> a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
go down so quickly I get a level up on a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.620 
go down so quickly I get a level up on a
special<00:02:12.380> one<00:02:12.709> silver<00:02:13.280> characters<00:02:14.090> move<00:02:14.300> so

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
special one silver characters move so

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.059 
special one silver characters move so
that's<00:02:14.780> cool<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:17.030> before<00:02:17.860> let's<00:02:18.860> say<00:02:18.920> we

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
that's cool and and before let's say we

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.740 
that's cool and and before let's say we
get<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:19.310> time<00:02:19.580> oh<00:02:25.510> nice

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
get this time oh nice

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.610 
get this time oh nice
gotcha<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.500> got<00:02:28.069> Jax<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.930> tack<00:02:29.930> card

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
gotcha I got Jax is a tack card

gotcha I got Jax is a tack card
character<00:02:31.010> card<00:02:31.340> so<00:02:31.849> this<00:02:31.940> gives<00:02:32.180> him<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.540> more

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
character card so this gives him a more

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
with a 3% bonus attack on all Jax

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.020 
with a 3% bonus attack on all Jax
