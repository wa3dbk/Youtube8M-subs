 how to convert an external hard drive from 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.740
 the laptop 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.710
 on an external hard drive for this not 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.520
 be spending a lot of money just 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.860
 having the hard drive already have a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.170
 damaged notebook or something just does not 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.660
 having to buy an external box is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.660
 this one and it's usb let's give it to him 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.440
 it's like how to convert a disk 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:39.460
 hard let's see how good 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.460
 from the external side 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.590
 that can be removed yes 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.670
 we see this later we see this 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.329
 let's see what else is the box 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.340
 screw to secure 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.090
 we go with the screws 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.480
 and which usb there is that is a 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.480
 sheath 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.369
 to bring the ball very useful 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.400
 and the only thing that is going to be is simply 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.300
 put it together 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.300
 I remove the lid 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.760
 and we are the screws 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.620
 you can already after looking at 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.420
 instructions 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.740
 I could already find where the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.240
 large screws and where the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.860
 small screws the big ones are for 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.280
 secure it 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.119
 to secure it to the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.119
 to the box 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.110
 and finally 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.110
 was our external hard drive 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.330
 acceptable usb connects 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.580
 It has a led indicator light 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.570
 and a case so that we do not get hurt if 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.570
