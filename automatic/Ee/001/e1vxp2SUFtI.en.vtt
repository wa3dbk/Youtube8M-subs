it's a badass coming out it'll be chubby
or<00:01:39.329> tubby<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:43.610> yeah<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.869> work

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
or tubby and yeah so they work

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.469 
or tubby and yeah so they work
differently<00:01:46.979> than<00:01:47.700> these<00:01:48.180> ones<00:01:49.520> now<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
differently than these ones now like I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.010 
differently than these ones now like I
said<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:52.409> now<00:01:52.470> anywhere<00:01:53.130> badass<00:01:53.700> will<00:01:54.600> spawn

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
said just now anywhere badass will spawn

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.090 
said just now anywhere badass will spawn
that's<00:01:55.710> where<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.130> spawn<00:01:56.719> so<00:01:57.719> we're<00:01:58.649> Pomona

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that's where they spawn so we're Pomona

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.350 
that's where they spawn so we're Pomona
and<00:01:59.219> tumba<00:01:59.640> spawn<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> while<00:02:00.240> life

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and tumba spawn in a while life

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.690 
and tumba spawn in a while life
exploitation<00:02:00.960> that's<00:02:01.170> where<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.860> chubby<00:02:02.280> or

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
exploitation that's where the chubby or

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
exploitation that's where the chubby or
tubby<00:02:03.030> use<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:03.659> spawn<00:02:04.969> here<00:02:06.320> just<00:02:07.320> tubbies

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
tubby use will spawn here just tubbies

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.480 
tubby use will spawn here just tubbies
will<00:02:08.069> spawn<00:02:09.950> there<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.160> badass<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.300> I

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
will spawn there is badass so I

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.610 
will spawn there is badass so I
as<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.730> think<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> spawn<00:02:13.300> here<00:02:13.660> or<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.560> don't

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
as I think the spawn here or I don't

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.170 
as I think the spawn here or I don't
think<00:02:14.830> they're<00:02:14.920> called<00:02:15.040> bad<00:02:15.280> ass<00:02:15.460> spider<00:02:15.760> ants

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
think they're called bad ass spider ants

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.640 
think they're called bad ass spider ants
I<00:02:16.270> think<00:02:16.300> they're<00:02:16.600> just<00:02:16.630> like<00:02:16.960> spider<00:02:17.380> and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
I think they're just like spider and

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.110 
I think they're just like spider and
monarchs<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.250> things<00:02:18.400> like<00:02:18.520> that<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.000> they

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
monarchs and things like that so they
