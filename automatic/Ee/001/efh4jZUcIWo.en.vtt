00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.690
 welcome to the third part of the piano tutorial 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.670
 In this video we will put into practice everything we have seen in the 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.499
 previous tutorials 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.219
 In our first tutorial we learned how to locate the central 2 and the notes of the 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:12.989
 piano 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:16.769
 then we learned how to build the scale of domaio reforms descending trend 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.890
 and finally we saw the scale of the largest for the left hand 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.210
 in our second tutorial we learned the chords of two 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.199
 and major sun with its corresponding arpeggios 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.070
 now in this third tutorials I will show how to put into practice 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.710
 each of the techniques that we have seen 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.450
 consists umento and a notebook are taking notes of what I will go 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.440
 saying 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.730
 begin by explaining the use of the annotated piano 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.890
 remember that in the first point we already gave the location of the central 2 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.470
 but now I want to show you a very simple exercise 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.420
 the noticed 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690
 is found in all octaves of the piano 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.090
 but what makes the difference is that every note that does not sound different 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.230
 frequency 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 that is to say 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.760
 it could sound serious 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.080
 media and treble 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.080
 as I will show you next 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.890
 we just heard all two 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.680
 found on the piano 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.680
 from the most serious to the most acute of the instrument 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.960
 the same is for the other piano notes 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.670
 remember that the annotated 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.040
 is just before the two black keys 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.910
 a piano usually has seven octaves 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.320
 the octaves are the group of eight defeats in a row 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.020
 and like the notes do not 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.110
 that we just heard are in different frequencies 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.369
 in conclusion if you learn only one octave of the piano 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.890
 you will have all the other notes of the instrument 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.600
 that's because the octaves are repeating 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.800
 but at different frequencies 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.260
 now we will do a simple exercise with the notes we have seen so far 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.280
 with the right hand we are going to play a little melody and then the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.670
 we will transport one octave higher 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.700
 first I'm going to show you the melody and then we'll analyze it 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.530
 by 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.199
 how will they have noticed 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.199
 this melody began with the noted piano central 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.210
 Now I'm going to show you the same melody 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.210
 with the same notes but one octave higher 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:36.889
 the melody is the same 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.079
 but on a sharper frequency 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.099
 and we could also play this same melody anywhere on the piano 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.879
 I hope you have made this first part of this tutorial clear 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.290
 now I want to explain something very simple but at the same time very important 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.829
 in the previous tutorial we saw how to form a major chord and how to play it in 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.419
 its three states 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.189
 Now I want to explain how to apply them and how to play the chords with 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.619
 both hands 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.769
 first we will work with the major finger chord 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.079
 How will I show you next 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.079
 a court also takes care to accompany a melody 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.779
 first we will see the melody without any accompaniment of the chords 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:31.609
 now we will hear the same melody but with accompaniment of the chords 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:32.359
 dice 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.359
 and sun greater 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.829
 I want to teach you how to play this melody so that you practice it with the 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.119
 accompaniment of the chords 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.729
 the correct draw to play the melody 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.389
 They are the following 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.389
 finger 1 go the note my 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.539
 then finger 3 go the sun note 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.599
 finger 4 in the note the 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.229
 the 2 5 on the note 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:20.060
 the one of co2 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.060
 on the note sun 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:25.850
 the 0 4 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.850
 in the note itself 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.280
 and finally the one of 2 5 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.550
 in note 2 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.870
 we will see the melody for the last time 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.259
 and you place the gage that I just showed you 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.360
 It is imperative that I never played in a melody with just one finger 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.479
 they always have to look for the most comfortable break so they can touch it 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.080
 more easily 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.080
 Let's listen to the melody one more time 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.990
 now that they have the wear for the melody 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.439
 the second step is to play it with the three corresponding chords 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:12.469
 remember that the chords were 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:13.889
 and sun greater 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.889
 listen to the same melody but together with the chords 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.989
 remember also that these three chords are played with the left hand 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.710
 and finally I remind you that in this case the chords for the left hand 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.710
 they touch with those of 2 5 3 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.750
 now the next step is to play the melody along with the chords 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.020
 I recommend that you practice it very slowly and with separate hands 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.569
 I hope this third tutorial where we put into practice and summarize great 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.589
 part of the two previous videos have helped 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.709
 remember that this is just the beginning of this long road of music in the 

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:03.729
 next tutorial we will continue advancing with new technical concepts and new 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.779
 formulas to achieve a good piano interpretation 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.900
 greets you from the commune of the cross fifth region chile
