00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.819 
like that a lot and then when you bite
the<00:01:49.240> cone<00:01:49.479> you've<00:01:49.749> got<00:01:49.929> fun<00:01:50.170> little<00:01:50.350> M&amp;Ms

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.709 
the cone you've got fun little M&amp;Ms
inside<00:01:51.279> how<00:01:51.729> awesome<00:01:52.329> is<00:01:52.479> that

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
inside how awesome is that

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.370 
inside how awesome is that
I<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.939> recommend<00:01:55.329> putting<00:01:55.749> something<00:01:55.929> inside

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
I do recommend putting something inside

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.289 
I do recommend putting something inside
because<00:01:56.709> these<00:01:57.310> are<00:01:57.459> pretty<00:01:57.609> top-heavy<00:01:58.029> with

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
because these are pretty top-heavy with

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.839 
because these are pretty top-heavy with
a<00:01:58.359> little<00:01:58.600> cake<00:01:58.719> ball<00:01:58.929> on<00:01:59.079> top<00:01:59.289> so<00:01:59.829> the<00:02:00.429> candies

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:00.849 
a little cake ball on top so the candies

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:02.039 
a little cake ball on top so the candies
inside<00:02:01.029> will<00:02:01.329> act<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.599> little<00:02:01.810> bit<00:02:01.899> like<00:02:02.020> a

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
inside will act a little bit like a

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.809 
inside will act a little bit like a
counterweight<00:02:02.439> if<00:02:03.099> you<00:02:03.369> want<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.609> make<00:02:03.700> this

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
counterweight if you want to make this

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.239 
counterweight if you want to make this
even<00:02:04.179> simpler<00:02:04.749> and<00:02:04.990> skip<00:02:05.439> making<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.069> whole

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
even simpler and skip making the whole

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.309 
even simpler and skip making the whole
cake<00:02:06.819> ball<00:02:07.060> part<00:02:07.359> if<00:02:07.599> you<00:02:07.719> don't<00:02:07.869> have<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.050> cake

pop maker or whatever

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.970 
pop maker or whatever
try<00:02:10.330> using<00:02:10.539> donut<00:02:10.990> holes<00:02:11.200> those<00:02:11.620> would<00:02:11.830> work

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
try using donut holes those would work

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.740 
try using donut holes those would work
