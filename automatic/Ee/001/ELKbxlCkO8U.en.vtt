00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
did complete a challenge chug and that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.590 
did complete a challenge chug and that
was<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> swarm<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> dsr-50<00:00:45.059> and

was get a swarm of the dsr-50 and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.139 
was get a swarm of the dsr-50 and
considering<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.739> TDM<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.520> find<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
considering this is TDM I find it

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
considering this is TDM I find it
extremely<00:00:48.239> impressive<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
extremely impressive just because you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.799 
extremely impressive just because you
know<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.940> lot<00:00:51.120> harder<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.510> get<00:00:51.629> your

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
know it's a lot harder to get your

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.209 
know it's a lot harder to get your
streaks<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.289> TDM<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.100> no

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
streaks in TDM because there's no

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.709 
streaks in TDM because there's no
objectives<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.910> help<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.420> score

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
objectives to help you get your score

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
objectives to help you get your score
streaks<00:00:55.020> faster<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.640> your

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
streaks faster it's just you and your

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.939 
streaks faster it's just you and your
kills<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.350> considering<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.530> didn't<00:00:58.710> pick<00:00:58.829> up

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
kills and considering I didn't pick up

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.340 
kills and considering I didn't pick up
any<00:00:59.190> other<00:00:59.370> guns<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.300> had<00:01:00.480> no<00:01:00.629> secondary<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
any other guns and I had no secondary it

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
any other guns and I had no secondary it
was<00:01:01.469> nothing<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> dsr-50<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.940> think<00:01:03.239> this

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
was nothing but the dsr-50 I think this

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.359 
was nothing but the dsr-50 I think this
is<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.539> really<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:03.930> good<00:01:04.290> gameplay<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369

our place because i only have i have to
ram<00:01:45.270> slots<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:45.990> computer<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.250> gig<00:01:47.490> of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
ram slots in my computer with one gig of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.190 
ram slots in my computer with one gig of
ram<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.970> each<00:01:48.149> slot<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.750> i'm<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> take

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
ram in each slot so i'm going to take

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.010 
ram in each slot so i'm going to take
those<00:01:49.380> out<00:01:49.560> by<00:01:50.000> get<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.329> four<00:01:51.600> gigs<00:01:51.840> of
