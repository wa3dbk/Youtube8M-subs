00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.680
 Hello, everyone, good evening 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.700
 This time, the watch of 100 grade Daiso 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.880
 I would like to introduce you 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.959
 I think there are a lot of people here 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.280
 There are many other colors 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.400
 I have this white and black this time 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.266
 I bought it 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.849
 When I look at the package 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.729
 It is written as Digital Watch Blue Planet 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.759
 This is 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.120
 Not waterproof, but not waterproof 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.670
 Though only this is a little disappointing 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.390
 Well, I think that I can use it on a daily basis 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.910
 Part number to say that watch, digital 21 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.670
 When I turn the back, it is the usage 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.140
 How to set the watch 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.500
 It is written how to replace the battery 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.140
 Well, I would like to open it 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.560
 When opened, this simple design 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.960
 I have a watch coming out 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.060
 Look at this design 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.470
 Mature and elderly people, those who are nostalgic 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.893
 Aren't you coming? 

00:01:06.893 --> 00:01:09.853
 Mr. Casio, watch 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.820
 Long time ago, this type of watch is quite 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.480
 Because it was sold 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.920
 When you try it actually, it looks like this 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.100
 After all men 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.540
 I told you that it is a size for women 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.560
 Replace battery in package 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.660
 Although it was written in the wind that I can do it 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.880
 Well, I need a precision driver 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.527
 And for those who are dexterous. 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.190
 When replacing the battery 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.470
 I'm not saying that one LR41 is used 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.330
 Because it is a common thing 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.040
 I think that you can buy it at various places 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.750
 Naturally I think I could buy even 100 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.770
 It is such a feeling when it is up 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.860
 The black type looks like this 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.640
 I think that both are simple and good 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.440
 I want to use this summer, though 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.920
 Here 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.860
 Blue Planet, under the influence of the third generation 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.889
 Though type of light blue sells explosively 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.017
 Still 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:14.679
 But well 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.999
 This white and black. It is recommended
