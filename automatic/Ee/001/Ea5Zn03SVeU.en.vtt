00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
to shoot some portraits so we've chosen

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.369 
to shoot some portraits so we've chosen
to<00:00:33.219> position<00:00:33.610> our<00:00:33.760> subject<00:00:34.239> out<00:00:34.420> in<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:34.989> open

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
to position our subject out in the open

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.470 
to position our subject out in the open
we've<00:00:36.340> got<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.489> nice<00:00:36.730> tree<00:00:37.059> in<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.270> background

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
but straight away we confront a quite

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.470 
but straight away we confront a quite
obvious<00:00:41.170> problem<00:00:41.620> it's<00:00:41.980> too<00:00:42.309> sunny<00:00:42.610> a<00:00:42.879> subject

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
is squinting at the camera and even if

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.130 
is squinting at the camera and even if
she<00:00:45.760> can<00:00:46.030> manage<00:00:46.329> to<00:00:46.360> keep<00:00:46.480> her<00:00:46.750> eyes<00:00:46.930> open

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
she can manage to keep her eyes open

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.049 
she can manage to keep her eyes open
we're<00:00:47.770> going<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:47.949> get<00:00:48.039> some<00:00:48.250> nasty<00:00:48.730> dark

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
work so instead we're going to head into

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.930 
work so instead we're going to head into
some<00:00:58.989> shade<00:00:59.350> now<00:00:59.980> here<00:01:00.280> we're<00:01:00.430> heading<00:01:00.730> into

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
some shade now here we're heading into

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.849 
some shade now here we're heading into
the<00:01:01.149> really<00:01:01.420> deep<00:01:01.690> shade<00:01:02.109> and<00:01:02.469> in<00:01:02.829> this

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
the really deep shade and in this

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.460 
the really deep shade and in this
instance<00:01:03.219> our<00:01:03.730> subject<00:01:04.450> has<00:01:04.840> no<00:01:05.050> problem

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
instance our subject has no problem

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.230 
instance our subject has no problem
keeping<00:01:05.740> her<00:01:05.860> eyes<00:01:06.010> open<00:01:06.400> but<00:01:06.760> it's<00:01:06.910> really<00:01:07.150> a

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
keeping her eyes open but it's really a

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.480 
keeping her eyes open but it's really a
bit<00:01:07.480> too<00:01:07.810> dark<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.620> we've<00:01:08.800> had<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.070> raise<00:01:09.310> the

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
bit too dark and we've had to raise the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.650 
bit too dark and we've had to raise the
ISO<00:01:09.700> from<00:01:10.420> 100<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.290> 400<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:13.060> isn't<00:01:13.600> a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
ISO from 100 to 400 this isn't a

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.990 
ISO from 100 to 400 this isn't a
disaster<00:01:14.290> but<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.860> does<00:01:15.070> mean<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.340> bit<00:01:15.730> more

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
disaster but it does mean a bit more

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.510 
disaster but it does mean a bit more
noise<00:01:16.270> in<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:17.110> image<00:01:17.410> now<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.070> pictures

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
noise in the image now the pictures

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.000 
noise in the image now the pictures
aren't<00:01:19.150> too<00:01:19.270> bad<00:01:19.450> but<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.870> light<00:01:20.200> is<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:20.530> little

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
aren't too bad but the light is a little

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.160 
aren't too bad but the light is a little
bit<00:01:21.160> flat<00:01:21.370> and<00:01:21.730> on<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.030> bright<00:01:22.390> sunny<00:01:22.690> day<00:01:22.840> like

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
bit flat and on a bright sunny day like

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.140 
bit flat and on a bright sunny day like
today<00:01:23.320> surely<00:01:24.070> we<00:01:24.280> can<00:01:24.400> find<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.700> spot<00:01:24.850> where

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
today surely we can find a spot where

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.110 
today surely we can find a spot where
the<00:01:25.270> light<00:01:25.480> is<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.690> bit<00:01:26.050> more<00:01:26.230> dynamic<00:01:27.120> now

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
the light is a bit more dynamic now

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.820 
the light is a bit more dynamic now
we're<00:01:28.330> still<00:01:28.510> in<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.780> shade<00:01:29.020> but<00:01:29.530> we're<00:01:29.680> on

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
we're still in the shade but we're on

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.470 
we're still in the shade but we're on
the<00:01:29.980> edge<00:01:30.130> of<00:01:30.370> the<00:01:30.460> shade<00:01:30.730> which<00:01:31.090> means<00:01:31.330> we

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
the edge of the shade which means we

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.570 
the edge of the shade which means we
still<00:01:31.510> have<00:01:31.720> lots<00:01:32.110> of<00:01:32.230> light<00:01:32.470> here<00:01:33.250> we<00:01:33.370> face<00:01:33.550> a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
still have lots of light here we face a

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.850 
still have lots of light here we face a
different<00:01:33.880> issue<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.720> background<00:01:35.290> is<00:01:35.500> much

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
different issue the background is much

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.160 
different issue the background is much
brighter<00:01:36.220> than<00:01:36.640> our<00:01:37.030> subject<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.930> means

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
brighter than our subject that means

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.960 
brighter than our subject that means
while<00:01:38.380> she<00:01:38.590> looks<00:01:38.770> great<00:01:38.980> the<00:01:39.400> background<00:01:39.850> is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
while she looks great the background is

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.010 
while she looks great the background is
really<00:01:40.000> burnt<00:01:40.570> out<00:01:41.970> ok<00:01:42.970> so<00:01:43.030> again<00:01:43.270> we're

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
really burnt out ok so again we're

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.230 
really burnt out ok so again we're
looking<00:01:44.050> for<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.530> spot<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.160> shade<00:01:45.370> but<00:01:46.090> on

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
looking for a spot in the shade but on

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.240 
looking for a spot in the shade but on
the<00:01:46.420> edge<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.960> shade<00:01:47.230> so<00:01:47.650> there's<00:01:47.890> lots<00:01:48.100> of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
the edge of the shade so there's lots of

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.030 
the edge of the shade so there's lots of
bright<00:01:48.750> indirect<00:01:49.750> natural<00:01:50.290> light<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.830> here

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
bright indirect natural light and here

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.800 
bright indirect natural light and here
we've<00:01:51.160> got<00:01:51.280> some<00:01:51.460> shady<00:01:51.790> trees<00:01:52.210> which<00:01:52.540> make<00:01:52.780> a

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
we've got some shady trees which make a
