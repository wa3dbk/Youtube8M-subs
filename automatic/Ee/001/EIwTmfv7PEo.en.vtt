blocks<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.729> decoration<00:01:06.740> redstone<00:01:07.740> materials

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
blocks and decoration redstone materials

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.770 
blocks and decoration redstone materials
that<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.010> write<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.549> redstone<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.330> from

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that you can write use redstone on from

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.719 
that you can write use redstone on from
good<00:01:13.020> things<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.159> rails<00:01:17.430> so

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
good things so this is all the rails so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
thought there are only rails were gonna

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.260 
thought there are only rails were gonna

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
nation but just two of them actually

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.930 
nation but just two of them actually
and<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.679> is<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.830> first<00:02:10.039> one<00:02:10.190> which<00:02:10.520> are<00:02:10.759> new

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
and this is the first one which are new

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.059 
and this is the first one which are new
buildings<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:11.480> Minecraft<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.110> there<00:02:12.800> should

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
buildings in Minecraft and there should

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.840 
buildings in Minecraft and there should
be<00:02:13.100> an<00:02:13.490> entrance<00:02:13.819> but<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:15.740> sand<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.340> blocking

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
be an entrance but the sand is blocking

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.590 
be an entrance but the sand is blocking
it<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.319> when<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.440> find<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.830> structure<00:02:19.600> there

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
it so when you find this structure there

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.960 
it so when you find this structure there
is<00:02:20.720> pretty<00:02:20.900> much<00:02:20.990> nothing<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.650> there<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:22.280> when

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
is pretty much nothing in there but when

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.490 
is pretty much nothing in there but when
you<00:02:23.030> go<00:02:23.180> down<00:02:23.800> let<00:02:24.800> me<00:02:24.860> destroy<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:26.500> you
