00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
think we're going to flare to the right

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.899 
think we're going to flare to the right
just<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.619> avoid<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:35.430> he's<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
just to avoid because he's got that

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.060 
just to avoid because he's got that
cannon<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> sniper<00:01:37.229> tower<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.860> far

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
cannon in the sniper tower and the far

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.030 
cannon in the sniper tower and the far
left<00:01:38.570> it's<00:01:39.570> kind<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> useless<00:01:40.380> spot<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.920> I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
left it's kind of in a useless spot if I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.690 
left it's kind of in a useless spot if I
go<00:01:41.189> flare<00:01:41.460> over<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:44.340> had<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> drop<00:01:44.640> a

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
what I'm working towards right now so

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.770 
what I'm working towards right now so
that<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:25.260> get<00:04:25.590> my<00:04:25.680> radar<00:04:26.010> up<00:04:26.190> because

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
that I get my radar up because

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.570 
that I get my radar up because
Ben<00:04:27.020> big<00:04:27.260> have<00:04:27.770> been<00:04:27.860> able<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.070> push<00:04:28.250> metals

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
Ben big have been able to push metals

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.230 
Ben big have been able to push metals
quite<00:04:28.820> as<00:04:28.940> much<00:04:29.840> as<00:04:30.050> I<00:04:30.170> was<00:04:30.320> before<00:04:31.090> all<00:04:32.090> right

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
quite as much as I was before all right

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.050 
quite as much as I was before all right
so<00:04:32.420> brush<00:04:32.889> drop<00:04:33.889> our<00:04:34.070> troops<00:04:34.310> we<00:04:34.639> can<00:04:34.790> cover<00:04:34.940> a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
so brush drop our troops we can cover a

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.850 
so brush drop our troops we can cover a
big<00:04:35.419> ground<00:04:35.750> with<00:04:36.080> their<00:04:36.200> shock<00:04:36.440> bombs<00:04:36.650> here

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
big ground with their shock bombs here

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.100 
big ground with their shock bombs here
plus<00:04:37.100> we've<00:04:37.250> got<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.370> lot<00:04:37.580> of<00:04:37.610> energy<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.840> we're

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
plus we've got a lot of energy so we're

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.200 
plus we've got a lot of energy so we're
just<00:04:39.139> going<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.440> shock<00:04:39.710> bomb<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.850> out<00:04:41.090> of

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
just going to shock bomb the out of

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.790 
just going to shock bomb the out of
the<00:04:41.330> space<00:04:41.570> basically<00:04:42.700> drop<00:04:43.700> another<00:04:43.970> one

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
the space basically drop another one

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.890 
the space basically drop another one
probably<00:04:45.800> drop<00:04:46.010> one<00:04:46.220> on<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.700> HQ<00:04:47.240> after<00:04:47.780> this

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
probably drop one on the HQ after this

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.260 
probably drop one on the HQ after this
and<00:04:48.230> get<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.650> sniper<00:04:49.010> towers<00:04:49.310> in<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.430> back

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.970 

burning<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.419> we<00:04:54.050> can<00:04:54.230> drop<00:04:54.380> another<00:04:54.710> shock

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
burning it we can drop another shock

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.940 
burning it we can drop another shock
bottom<00:04:55.220> see<00:04:55.340> we<00:04:55.430> didn't<00:04:55.610> waste<00:04:55.730> that<00:04:55.880> much<00:04:56.090> on

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
bottom see we didn't waste that much on

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.290 
bottom see we didn't waste that much on
missiles<00:04:57.950> or<00:04:58.100> broj<00:04:58.430> is<00:04:58.639> there<00:04:58.760> anything<00:04:58.910> so

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
missiles or broj is there anything so

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.180 
missiles or broj is there anything so
we'll<00:04:59.600> probably<00:04:59.840> be<00:05:00.050> able<00:05:00.140> to<00:05:00.290> shock<00:05:00.890> bottom

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
we'll probably be able to shock bottom

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.340 
we'll probably be able to shock bottom
like<00:05:01.340> four<00:05:01.730> or<00:05:01.910> five<00:05:01.970> times<00:05:02.450> in<00:05:02.810> this<00:05:02.930> one<00:05:03.140> so

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
like four or five times in this one so

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.620 
like four or five times in this one so
they<00:05:03.470> won't<00:05:03.620> even<00:05:03.710> be<00:05:03.860> able<00:05:03.919> to<00:05:04.010> touch<00:05:04.220> us<00:05:04.250> now

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:16.380 

perfect<00:05:08.630> or<00:05:08.900> eight<00:05:09.160> see<00:05:10.160> what<00:05:10.310> gets<00:05:10.490> upgraded

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390
