00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.090
 this distance 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.800
 this 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.710
 this 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.680
 to be our necklace we are going to 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.220
 need a bit of youtube too 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.320
 lace pearl crystals or whatever 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.510
 who want to use to decorate the necklace 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.820
 we are also going to use a button or some 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.269
 something they have to close it 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.400
 thread needle and also some scissors that 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:54.770
 it's not written out there but if we're going to 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:56.670
 use a start piece like 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.680
 generally the cloth houses the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.329
 chiquititos remains that they 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.250
 he is alone in riding quite cheap 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.110
 so find out and take advantage of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.090
 find in any offer or other option 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.710
 if they do not have any delicious recipes 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.530
 There are already many places where they sell 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.289
 with small sprigs of liquid that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.289
 Use to decorate necklines to undertake 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.580
 another option is this system never rang 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.040
 in a first that you have controlled with 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.510
 memory we like very much after 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.330
 escocer and used for this necklace or is 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.250
 make no fuss look to see what can 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.990
 be good in my case I had this 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.570
 hippie piece what I did was 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.500
 cut out a shape that has more or less 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.500
 necklace shape 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.640
 well now the decorating part comes 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.440
 Our is necklace with crystals first 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.180
 I'm just going to support you as 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.540
 see what design I like the most before 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.780
 sew here be creative try 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.440
 quite young it is not necessary that they leave 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.119
 to the letter the drawing of the ball 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.820
 with giving him some creativity and 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.560
 imagination that there is no problem 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.320
 Encourage yourself to put enough crystals 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.240
 Collars are used a lot as well as 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.300
 big and full of things so 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.520
 put everything good is the only 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.350
 caution that they have to have is nothing 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.100
 do not put crystallites floating on me 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.050
 air 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.840
 notice that all the little fishes that 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.209
 put can be known in the place in 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.400
 where they are putting it like this is the only 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.910
 caution I think about creating and 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.380
 try it once they come up with a design 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.690
 that more or less they like and they 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.080
 convince him take a little picture and we started 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.080
 to sew 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.330
 in addition to cost the truth 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.280
 difficult is not the only thing that requires a 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.290
 little bit of patience if it's going to take them 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.530
 a little bit of time to finish things 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.870
 absolutely all the crystals because 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.540
 choose to cost and not for example to paste that 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.150
 It would be faster because women 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.880
 we have a tendency to get bored 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.520
 the accessories pretty fast 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.590
 so good when you get bored 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.780
 of the necklace if the crystallites 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.090
 I consider all they have to do 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.010
 is to listen to them if it is very easy and the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.590
 crystallites will be in tact if 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.390
 ready to use them for something else and 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.150
 this way they are going to save a lot of money 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.550
 so good put on things that the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.550
 long really worth it 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.239
 to finish grab these two bits 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.269
 in lace that was quite thick and 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.730
 firm and it will serve me to harass the 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.340
 cut two pieces of the desired length 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.180
 and I knew each one of the extremes 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.180
 of the sack 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.390
 to finish with an oil button in 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.700
 one end and I made a small pull on the 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.220
 another extreme and in this way we are left 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.220
 the stroller closed and finished 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.620
 yes 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.759
 true 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.610
 all right 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.870
 do not 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.870
 nothing 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.270
 i
