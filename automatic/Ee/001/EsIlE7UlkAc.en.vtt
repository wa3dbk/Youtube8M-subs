00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.619
 the little mermaid was a bought story and 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:22.220
 edited by disney where life counts 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.640
 of a young mermaid which was 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.189
 in love with a young prince the truth 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.310
 is that this story even if fiction 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.129
 and have marked childhood many people 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.699
 in the original story written by hand 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:40.960
 it's not with the simple end of lived 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.930
 happy forever 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.540
 it turns out that it's based on innocence in 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.989
 blind love in the desire of a love 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.370
 that would result for this situation 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.160
 impossible 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.840
 the true story talks about a 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.500
 young mermaid in love and wonder 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.400
 I was in love with a prince change 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.290
 her beautiful voice for a pair of legs 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.409
 had as a greater desire to go abroad 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.009
 to fall in love with a prince 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.670
 the answer is yes for everything but not with 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.680
 the same purpose that we all know 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.439
 the original story was written by 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.799
 hans christian andersen which in its 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.259
 story tells the cruelty and the 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.659
 brutality to which the teenager 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.049
 marine had to face 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.120
 the real story then begins 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.530
 A) Yes 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.060
 a mermaid turned 15 years old and then she 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.939
 it was allowed to go abroad 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.000
 until then as happened with the rest 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.740
 of his sisters the young sirens do not 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.200
 they could go to the dangers of the world 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.409
 land would be exposed to 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.990
 way of lives that they did not imagine the 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.780
 classic tale is a sea of cruelty and 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.679
 The little mermaid was the youngest 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.989
 all these sisters a curious girl 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.630
 pale and beautiful I felt a deep 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:16.730
 attraction for what was new and 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.680
 strange or is a curious young woman like that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.799
 once had permission to visit the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.769
 surface left his home and took out the 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.170
 head of the water for the first time that 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.230
 that control made her very nervous and the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.799
 mine moro inevitably between strong 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.349
 and fireworks beautiful embargo it 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.540
 I balanced between chants and laughter 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.180
 inside him a lot of sailors 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.230
 they celebrated the birthday of a very young 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.739
 beautiful 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.230
 the prince was 16 years old and that 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.920
 it was his big party 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.120
 amused the little mermaid looked at her admired 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.680
 Prince until a terrible storm 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.409
 caused a fracture she swam up 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.420
 save him and took him to the shore where the 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.940
 wake up he was also taken with 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.519
 the enormous beauty and beautiful voice of 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.500
 that strange girl the mermaid went back to 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.000
 sea and both she and the young prince 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.160
 they were obsessed with each other 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.550
 how to tempt luck to follow the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.400
 heart how to achieve a dream 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.560
 almost impossible for what it's worth living 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.510
 under the sea if the only beats of love 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.659
 the causes a human 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.480
 the little mermaid chose to visit a witch 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:35.380
 who promised to have some legs 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.770
 precious in exchange for his voice 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.320
 Witch cut tongue wildly 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.390
 the young woman after warning them several 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.690
 times that in that process there was no 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.780
 turn back and if you do not get 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:54.280
 love a human yes that would stay 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.970
 silent and alone for all eternity as 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.030
 they saw it was not magic or sorcery 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.940
 Witch cut his tongue young 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.660
 being left painless and there 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.420
 bleeding 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.220
 and how they saw the witch was not her sister 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.090
 as in the Disney tale it was a 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.730
 witch peasant or whatever you want to call 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.560
 who lived in the sea 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.460
 although we do not know if it was really a 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.480
 point or a squid woman we only know 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.480
 be a sea ​​witch 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.850
 as we sealed it fell in a tremendous 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.270
 depression was mute she felt sore and 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.170
 was alone innocence is a poison and 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.750
 love kills for that the young mermaid does not 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.780
 he cared what the witch said and 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.900
 she was soon turned into a girl 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.320
 really with his trembling legs 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.720
 Unable to walk, nobody had 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.320
 said that on the road it was easy and the 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.530
 little mermaid now shaped like a girl 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.300
 literally speechless and bloodied 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.300
 I would walk for the first time feeling like 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.289
 his own weight made him rent to the 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.139
 world 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:12.559
 with intense pain in their new and 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:15.559
 bloody feet to see her appear on 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:18.229
 young prince could not help falling in love 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:20.089
 it but not enough to 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.659
 that the spell was broken and the 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:26.389
 teenager could have an eternal soul 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:29.689
 like that of humans although that 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.719
 young mute reminded him of the pretty woman 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:37.309
 who days ago saved him he knew it was not 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:39.470
 she was missing something was her beautiful and her 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:42.440
 perfect voice 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.820
 the witch stayed with her voice and cut 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.620
 wildly tongue to the young mermaid 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.620
 one day a woman appeared in the palace 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.690
 with the lovely voice similar to that of the 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.360
 mermaid and then the prince decided 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.000
 that his search was over and that he 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.250
 marry her 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.850
 the little mermaid then fell into a 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:07.420
 tremendous depression was dumb he felt 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.880
 sore and was alone the predictions 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.610
 of the witch had been true and his 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.340
 heart would explode into a thousand pieces and not 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.860
 I found comfort was then when 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.010
 a voice appeared to him and told him 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.110
 kill the prince one of the two had 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.800
 that leave the world so that the 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.690
 Little Mermaid's heart would not rot 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.740
 but he preferred to let him live with his 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:38.190
 girlfriend she falter and has in that sea 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.190
 that had always been his mouth 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.590
 innocence is a poison love kills and 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.920
 although the little mermaid did not die if she was 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.890
 condemned to an eternity of remembrance and 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.500
 suffering when trying to commit suicide in 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:57.100
 the sea finally the young girl rose by 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:00.780
 the doomed heaven is fixed from the air as 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:05.420

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:27.389
 this is not considered a crepe and pasta 

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:31.019
 or something similar but obviously it's not 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:33.529
 a true story is a story is a 

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:36.959
