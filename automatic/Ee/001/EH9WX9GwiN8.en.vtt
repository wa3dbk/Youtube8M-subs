00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
triangle or Y you'll just keep bouncing

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.539 
triangle or Y you'll just keep bouncing
off<00:01:21.060> him<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.830> can't<00:01:23.100> really

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549

off him like this and you can't really
be<00:01:23.850> hurt<00:01:24.150> there's<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> couple<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.140> attacks<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
be hurt there's a couple of attacks that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.140 
be hurt there's a couple of attacks that
might<00:01:25.830> catch<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.430> you're<00:01:26.580> unlucky<00:01:26.880> with

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
might catch you if you're unlucky with

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.940 
might catch you if you're unlucky with
the<00:01:27.270> timing<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> most<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.920> should

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the timing but for the most you should

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.039 
the timing but for the most you should
be<00:01:29.280> able<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> stay<00:01:29.820> safe<00:01:30.119> doing<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.659> until

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
be able to stay safe doing this until

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.109 
be able to stay safe doing this until
the<00:01:31.170> King<00:01:31.350> wakes<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.880> need<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the King wakes up and then you need to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.560 
the King wakes up and then you need to
do<00:01:33.329> everything<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.590> kill<00:01:35.070> him

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
do everything you can to kill him

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.149 
do everything you can to kill him
because<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.780> kill<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> King<00:01:37.380> every<00:01:38.070> other

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
because if you kill the King every other

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.840 
because if you kill the King every other
piece<00:01:38.430> dies<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.720> simple<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.850> can

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
piece dies it's that simple you can

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
piece dies it's that simple you can
focus<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> other<00:01:42.689> pieces<00:01:42.899> first<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
focus on the other pieces first but the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.020 
focus on the other pieces first but the
reason<00:01:43.979> why<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.340> tell<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.909> do

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
reason why I would tell you not to do

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.289 
reason why I would tell you not to do
this<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.750> if<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.350> kill<00:01:46.590> three<00:01:46.890> pieces

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
this is because if you kill three pieces

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.609 
this is because if you kill three pieces
everything<00:01:48.299> will<00:01:48.420> devil<00:01:48.689> trigger<00:01:48.869> including

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
everything will devil trigger including

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
everything will devil trigger including
the<00:01:49.740> King<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.119> want

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the King and that is not what you want

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.359 
the King and that is not what you want
you<00:01:52.110> want<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> kill<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> King<00:01:52.920> before<00:01:53.250> he

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you want to kill the King before he

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.740 
you want to kill the King before he
devil<00:01:53.640> triggers<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.030> his<00:01:54.210> life<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.450> at

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
devil triggers because his life is at

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.139 
devil triggers because his life is at
its<00:01:54.869> lowest<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:56.130> I'm<00:01:56.280> doing<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:56.939> that

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
its lowest and what I'm doing to do that

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.389 
its lowest and what I'm doing to do that
is<00:01:57.360> I'm<00:01:58.110> using<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.649> time<00:01:58.860> freeze<00:01:59.159> and

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
is I'm using the time freeze and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.980 
is I'm using the time freeze and
Quicksilver<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.090> beat<00:02:00.240> him<00:02:00.450> off<00:02:00.600> watch<00:02:00.780> out

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
Quicksilver to beat him off watch out

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.539 
Quicksilver to beat him off watch out

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
for the Queen she's easily the most

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.399 
for the Queen she's easily the most

irritating and damaging piece on the
board<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.570> you'll<00:02:06.570> notice<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.290> King

do some stupid damage and all I'm doing

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.309 
do some stupid damage and all I'm doing
is<00:02:28.220> I'm<00:02:28.819> watching<00:02:29.060> where<00:02:29.480> he<00:02:29.629> teleports<00:02:30.230> to

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
is I'm watching where he teleports to

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.420 
is I'm watching where he teleports to
because<00:02:30.470> every<00:02:30.650> time<00:02:30.799> you<00:02:30.920> attack<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.280> King

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
because every time you attack the King

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.339 
because every time you attack the King
too<00:02:31.610> much<00:02:31.849> he<00:02:32.090> will<00:02:32.239> replace<00:02:32.629> his<00:02:32.900> position

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
too much he will replace his position

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.470 
too much he will replace his position
with<00:02:33.500> another<00:02:33.530> piece<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.549> board<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.090> he

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
with another piece on the board and he

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.850 
with another piece on the board and he
needs<00:02:35.599> to<00:02:35.629> pay<00:02:35.720> attention<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.470> don't<00:02:36.709> get

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
needs to pay attention so you don't get

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.009 
needs to pay attention so you don't get
sloppy<00:02:37.129> but<00:02:37.430> there<00:02:37.579> you<00:02:37.700> go<00:02:37.849> folks<00:02:38.120> that's<00:02:38.780> how

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
sloppy but there you go folks that's how

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.390 
sloppy but there you go folks that's how
much<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.319> takes<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.650> kill<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.010> king

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
much it takes to kill the king

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.100 
much it takes to kill the king
everything<00:02:41.000> else<00:02:41.180> dies<00:02:41.500> flawless<00:02:42.500> chessboard

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
everything else dies flawless chessboard

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.569 
everything else dies flawless chessboard
so<00:02:45.110> we're<00:02:45.620> gonna<00:02:45.709> be<00:02:45.890> teleporting<00:02:46.430> through

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
so we're gonna be teleporting through

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.400 
so we're gonna be teleporting through
mirrors<00:02:46.849> pretty<00:02:47.569> much<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.870> rest<00:02:48.079> of<00:02:48.319> this

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
mirrors pretty much the rest of this

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.289 
mirrors pretty much the rest of this
area<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.129> this<00:02:49.489> room<00:02:49.790> here<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.150> can

completely skip the fallens and that's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.589 
completely skip the fallens and that's
exactly<00:02:52.370> what<00:02:52.519> I'm<00:02:52.609> gonna<00:02:52.790> do<00:02:53.030> because<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.329> hate

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
exactly what I'm gonna do because I hate

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
path to get to the end the quickest is

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.140 
path to get to the end the quickest is
Cerberus<00:03:08.660> Agni<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.319> Rudra<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:09.849> Beowulf<00:03:10.849> if

Cerberus Agni and Rudra and Beowulf if

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.729 
Cerberus Agni and Rudra and Beowulf if
you<00:03:11.269> can<00:03:11.480> kill<00:03:11.660> those<00:03:11.840> three<00:03:12.079> bosses<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.590> can

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
you can kill those three bosses you can

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.940 
you can kill those three bosses you can
get<00:03:12.859> through<00:03:13.040> this<00:03:13.129> level<00:03:13.340> very<00:03:13.640> quickly<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:15.620> I

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
get through this level very quickly so I

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.490 
get through this level very quickly so I
changed<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.819> sword<00:03:17.120> master<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.720> change<00:03:18.290> to

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.500 
changed the sword master I change to
Cerberus<00:03:19.040> because<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.519> need<00:03:19.819> to<00:03:19.849> use<00:03:20.269> the

on the Xbox I think it'll be much better
because<00:04:18.579> there's<00:04:19.579> just<00:04:19.789> something<00:04:20.120> about<00:04:20.419> you

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
difficult one thanks to this strategy

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.379 
difficult one thanks to this strategy
you<00:06:05.759> could<00:06:05.939> just<00:06:06.089> choose<00:06:06.419> his<00:06:06.629> face<00:06:06.839> off

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
you could just choose his face off

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.089 
you could just choose his face off
because<00:06:09.389> it<00:06:09.569> works<00:06:09.779> and<00:06:10.439> if<00:06:10.500> it's<00:06:10.649> a<00:06:10.740> working

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
because it works and if it's a working

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:12.709 
because it works and if it's a working
strategy<00:06:11.580> it's<00:06:11.729> a<00:06:11.759> winning<00:06:12.029> strategy<00:06:12.210> in<00:06:12.569> my

strategy it's a winning strategy in my
eyes<00:06:13.909> and<00:06:14.909> it's<00:06:15.389> just<00:06:15.419> so<00:06:15.659> ironic<00:06:15.810> that<00:06:16.199> I<00:06:16.259> lose

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:16.439 
eyes and it's just so ironic that I lose

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:18.950 
eyes and it's just so ironic that I lose
my<00:06:16.649> console<00:06:17.069> when<00:06:17.219> I<00:06:17.250> get<00:06:17.460> my<00:06:17.610> mic<00:06:17.819> so<00:06:18.509> all<00:06:18.779> the

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
now and it's really tragic because I

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.649 
now and it's really tragic because I
only<00:06:28.349> have<00:06:28.560> two<00:06:28.830> deadlines<00:06:29.550> left<00:06:29.849> for<00:06:30.300> uni

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159

the<00:07:33.460> godhand<00:07:33.849> game<00:07:34.210> that<00:07:34.389> I've<00:07:34.479> mentioned<00:07:34.960> the

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:35.889 
the godhand game that I've mentioned the

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:38.309 
the godhand game that I've mentioned the
bosses<00:07:36.339> have<00:07:36.610> got<00:07:36.759> so<00:07:37.059> much<00:07:37.210> life<00:07:37.509> even<00:07:38.139> on

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 
bosses have got so much life even on

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:40.649 
bosses have got so much life even on
normal<00:07:38.830> and<00:07:39.039> the<00:07:39.729> game<00:07:39.909> has<00:07:40.120> an<00:07:40.240> adjustable

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.659 
normal and the game has an adjustable

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:42.510 
normal and the game has an adjustable
difficulty<00:07:41.319> where<00:07:41.469> the<00:07:41.649> better<00:07:41.800> you<00:07:42.069> play<00:07:42.279> the

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 
difficulty where the better you play the

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.439 
difficulty where the better you play the
harder<00:07:42.849> it<00:07:42.999> gets

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:43.449 
harder it gets

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:45.749 
harder it gets
so<00:07:43.949> regardless<00:07:44.949> of<00:07:45.129> difficulty<00:07:45.580> they'll

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 
so regardless of difficulty they'll

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:47.699 
so regardless of difficulty they'll
always<00:07:45.969> have<00:07:46.180> the<00:07:46.360> same<00:07:46.569> life<00:07:46.810> which<00:07:47.139> is<00:07:47.289> far

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:51.149 
always have the same life which is far
too<00:07:47.949> much<00:07:48.189> if<00:07:48.430> you<00:07:48.550> ask<00:07:48.580> me<00:07:49.800> but<00:07:50.800> there<00:07:51.009> is

too much if you ask me but there is

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:53.489 
too much if you ask me but there is
Cerberus<00:07:51.639> this<00:07:52.300> should<00:07:52.539> be<00:07:52.659> the<00:07:52.839> end<00:07:53.020> of<00:07:53.349> the
