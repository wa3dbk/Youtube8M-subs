00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.590
 In this training unit we deal 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.130
 us with the battery multi saw pst 10.8 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.349
 'glee' from bosch the multi saw pst 10.8 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.579
 l is characterized by its compact and 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.579
 slim design 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:16.199
 the intelligent control electronics fit 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.539
 the energy provided 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.759
 individually to the respective application 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.880
 as needed by more or less 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.189
 power in connection with the 1.5 hours 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.490
 Battery will have a maximum battery life 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.470
 The versatility is achieved by 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.840
 the use of normal made jigsaw 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.180
 leaves can be reached with alcohol 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.230
 the saw almost all materials 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.230
 are processed 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.760
 The saw blade recording allows a 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.100
 easy and fast change of 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.730
 Saw blades used on both sides 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.730
 can be 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.660
 through the ejection mechanism, the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.570
 saw blades fast and safe 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.160
 ejected 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.140
 with the help of speed regulation can 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.589
 one the high speed individually 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.440
 to adapt to the material thanks to the 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.450
 special design, the psd can be 10.8 eli 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.740
 both as a classic jigsaw for 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.740
 Precise sawing work 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.330
 as well as a multi saw for example for 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.409
 Relief work in the garden or for 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.710
 cut- outs in plate material 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.990
 be used 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.450
 even large cut to strengthen 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.960
 Example in wood up to 30 mm are lightweight 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.960
 to manage something 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.540
 the power light ensures precise 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.400
 work also in dark places 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.780
 the battery status indicator indicates 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.200
 timely notice when the battery 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.760
 should be loaded again the 10.8 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.430
 Volt battery fits in all others 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.920
 Devices of the 10.80 how to ion battery 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.750
 system 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.540
 of course also owns the new battery 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.180
 Multi saw the proven etc system that 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.979
 the battery from overheating overheating 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.680
 deep discharge protects and thereby one 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.690
 ensures a long service life 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.270
 and now have fun with the battery multi 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.270
