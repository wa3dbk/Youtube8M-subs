00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
really counting the zombie maps because

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.840 
really counting the zombie maps because
it's<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.359> really<00:00:31.199> horror

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
it's not really horror

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.240 
it's not really horror
let's<00:00:32.850> look<00:00:33.540> today<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.290> some<00:00:34.320> examples<00:00:35.190> of

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
let's look today at some examples of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.799 
let's look today at some examples of
horror<00:00:35.489> maps<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.820> they<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:35.969> well<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.719> what

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
horror maps what they do well and what

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.200 
horror maps what they do well and what
they<00:00:36.960> don't<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.680> well<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.129> let's<00:00:38.879> look<00:00:39.090> at

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
they don't do so well and let's look at

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.209 
they don't do so well and let's look at
how<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.660> make<00:00:39.840> your<00:00:40.050> own<00:00:40.260> brilliant

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
how you can make your own brilliant

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.940 
how you can make your own brilliant
horror<00:00:41.430> apps<00:00:41.840> welcome<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> web<00:00:43.050> crafts<00:00:43.379> let's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
horror apps welcome to web crafts let's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.490 
horror apps welcome to web crafts let's
get<00:00:44.160> started

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
get started

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.920 
get started
so<00:00:46.500> why<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.129> lack<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.789> horror<00:00:48.030> maps<00:00:48.300> will

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
so why the lack of horror maps will

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.990 
so why the lack of horror maps will
simply<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:49.590> because<00:00:49.829> minecraft<00:00:50.129> isn't<00:00:50.640> that

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
simply it's because minecraft isn't that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.970 
simply it's because minecraft isn't that
scary<00:00:51.300> when<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> scariest<00:00:52.590> thing<00:00:52.710> you've<00:00:52.829> got

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
scary when the scariest thing you've got

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
scary when the scariest thing you've got
in<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.160> game<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:54.000> not<00:00:54.420> enough<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
in your game is this it's not enough to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.410 
in your game is this it's not enough to
terrify<00:00:55.020> players<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:56.550> problem<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
terrify players the problem is that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.229 
terrify players the problem is that
minecraft<00:00:58.050> doesn't<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:59.160> detail<00:00:59.820> very<00:01:00.059> well

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
minecraft doesn't do detail very well

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
minecraft doesn't do detail very well
and<00:01:00.449> horror<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.079> kind<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.430> detail

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and horror is kind of all about detail

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.980 
and horror is kind of all about detail
you<00:01:03.149> need<00:01:03.480> high<00:01:04.409> resolution<00:01:05.129> textures<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
you need high resolution textures and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.649 
you need high resolution textures and
scary<00:01:06.990> models<00:01:07.500> most<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> time<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
scary models most of the time and

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.090 
scary models most of the time and
normally<00:01:09.659> minecraft<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.770> good<00:01:10.950> at

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
normally minecraft is not that good at

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.539 
normally minecraft is not that good at
base<00:01:11.299> this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.479> why<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.740> absolutely<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
base this is why you absolutely have to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.130 
base this is why you absolutely have to
have<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> resource<00:01:15.180> pack<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
have a resource pack if you don't have a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.260 
have a resource pack if you don't have a
resource<00:01:16.560> pack<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.250> are<00:01:17.280> probably<00:01:17.820> making<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
resource pack you are probably making a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.140 
resource pack you are probably making a
massive<00:01:18.659> mistake<00:01:19.100> all<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> maps<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.880> played

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
massive mistake all of the maps I played

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060 
massive mistake all of the maps I played
when<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.020> looking<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> horror<00:01:22.830> maps

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
when I was looking at the horror maps

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.399 
when I was looking at the horror maps
they're<00:01:23.939> already<00:01:24.330> existing<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.110> them<00:01:25.259> had

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
they're already existing all of them had

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.649 
they're already existing all of them had
a<00:01:25.439> resource<00:01:25.830> pack<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.970> map<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> probably

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
a resource pack and your map is probably

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.539 
a resource pack and your map is probably
not<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.619> scary<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.070> don't<00:01:29.369> have

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
not going to be scary if you don't have

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.020 
not going to be scary if you don't have
one<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.869> tip<00:01:31.079> number<00:01:31.110> one<00:01:32.030> most

I<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:41.369> walking<00:01:41.700> around<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:42.299> map<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.689> 10

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
I was walking around in one map for 10

I was walking around in one map for 10
minutes<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.409> sure<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> was<00:01:43.950> doing<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.640> was

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
minutes not sure I was doing it was

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.160 
minutes not sure I was doing it was
getting<00:01:45.060> boring<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.780> wasn't<00:01:46.049> being
