beyblade<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.240> way<00:01:21.509> heavier<00:01:21.990> than<00:01:22.020> Andrews

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
beyblade is way heavier than Andrews

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.770 
beyblade is way heavier than Andrews
blade<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.369> that's<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.150> reason<00:01:24.180> he's<00:01:24.390> able<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
blade so that's the reason he's able to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.320 
blade so that's the reason he's able to
beat<00:01:24.990> everyone<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.740> challenges<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:27.030> about

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
beat everyone the challenges think about

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330 
beat everyone the challenges think about
it<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.600> heavier<00:01:28.080> blade<00:01:28.350> makes<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:29.009> stable

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it a heavier blade makes it more stable

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
it a heavier blade makes it more stable
and<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.000> makes<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> last<00:01:30.540> 10<00:01:30.810> times<00:01:31.020> longer

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and that makes it last 10 times longer

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.039 
and that makes it last 10 times longer
in<00:01:31.560> battle<00:01:31.920> bingo<00:01:32.790> give<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> boy<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> metal

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
using a heavier metal alloy the extra

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.230 
using a heavier metal alloy the extra
weight<00:01:42.299> gives<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.020> more<00:01:43.200> stability<00:01:43.470> oh<00:01:44.240> yeah

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
weight gives it more stability oh yeah

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.480 
weight gives it more stability oh yeah
which<00:01:45.720> means<00:01:45.960> any<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.229> our<00:01:46.530> ordinary<00:01:47.100> blades
