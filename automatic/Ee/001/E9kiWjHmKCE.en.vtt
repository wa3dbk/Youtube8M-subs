another new feature of mango

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.819 
another new feature of mango
applications<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:36.000> pin<00:01:36.710> tiles<00:01:37.710> that

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
applications can actually pin tiles that

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.039 
applications can actually pin tiles that
go<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:38.790> specific<00:01:39.030> features<00:01:39.659> within<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
go to very specific features within the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.330 
go to very specific features within the
application<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.860> I've<00:01:40.920> done<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.130> I've

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
application so what I've done is I've

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
application so what I've done is I've
picked<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.700> recipe<00:01:42.119> big<00:01:42.360> smoky<00:01:42.780> burgers<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
pinned it to the home screen so both

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.800 
pinned it to the home screen so both
this<00:01:47.250> tile<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.970> tile<00:01:48.180> both<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> all

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
this tile and this tile both go to all

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.030 
this tile and this tile both go to all
recipes<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.799> along<00:01:50.009> the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.210 

and<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:04.880> if<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.030> tap<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.360> hold<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:05.600> one<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.869> these

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
and so if I tap and hold on one of these

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.260 
and so if I tap and hold on one of these
one<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.369> options<00:02:07.520> here<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:07.939> pin<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.209> start

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
one of the options here is pin to start

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.940 
one of the options here is pin to start
which<00:02:08.929> is<00:02:09.050> seen<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.229> lot<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.410> places<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.890> the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
which is seen a lot of places in the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.979 
which is seen a lot of places in the
operating<00:02:10.280> system<00:02:10.640> we're<00:02:11.270> going<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.480> hit<00:02:11.780> that

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
operating system we're going to hit that

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.750 
operating system we're going to hit that
and<00:02:14.319> boom<00:02:15.319> it<00:02:15.560> adds<00:02:15.709> another<00:02:16.010> recipe<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.670> the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
and boom it adds another recipe to the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.610 
and boom it adds another recipe to the
home<00:02:16.849> screen<00:02:16.880> if<00:02:17.239> i<00:02:17.330> tap<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.569> it's<00:02:18.440> going<00:02:18.590> to

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
home screen if i tap that it's going to

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.190 
home screen if i tap that it's going to
take<00:02:18.680> me<00:02:18.890> straight<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.370> recipe<00:02:20.200> it's

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
take me straight to that recipe it's

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.280 
take me straight to that recipe it's
obviously<00:02:21.560> different<00:02:21.800> different<00:02:23.290> developers

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
obviously different different developers

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.000 
obviously different different developers
are<00:02:24.380> going<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.590> implement<00:02:24.680> that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
are going to implement that

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.470 
are going to implement that
functionality<00:02:25.459> differently<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.209> do<00:02:26.270> think

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
functionality differently but I do think

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.790 
functionality differently but I do think
that's<00:02:26.630> pretty<00:02:26.900> exciting<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.440> lot<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.620> people

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
that's pretty exciting a lot of people

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.600 
that's pretty exciting a lot of people
are<00:02:27.860> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.040> be<00:02:28.160> able<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.400> take<00:02:28.580> advantage

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
are going to be able to take advantage

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.690 
are going to be able to take advantage
of<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.360> some<00:02:29.540> interesting<00:02:29.660> ways<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:31.519> this

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
of that in some interesting ways so this

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.009 
of that in some interesting ways so this
is<00:02:31.819> actually<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:32.120> good<00:02:32.209> opportunity<00:02:32.510> for<00:02:32.780> me<00:02:32.930> to

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
is actually a good opportunity for me to

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.350 
is actually a good opportunity for me to
show<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.410> multitasking<00:02:34.069> capability<00:02:34.760> by

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
show you the multitasking capability by

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.280 
show you the multitasking capability by
tap<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.840> hold<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.410> back<00:02:37.220> button<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.780> see<00:02:38.780> this
