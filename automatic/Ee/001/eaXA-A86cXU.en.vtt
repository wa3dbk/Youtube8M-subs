00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello to all of you delighted to find for this year a new 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.529
 tasting and safety of Sinai 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.619
 you will have seen it from the famous bottle cabinets and easily 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.460
 recognizable yes we are at Châteauneuf du Pape in the south of the 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.269
 Rhone valley in the heart of this 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.969
 famous and historic appellation with the domain of old 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:25.310
 telegraph on the 2008 vintage that we 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.300
 let's take a small step forward 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.700
 practically% to introduce you to its aging potential we have 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.520
 actually advise a tasting from 2010 and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.810
 until 2020 and I see a little bit beyond because the field of bio 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.800
 telegraph and par excellence 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.830
 a wine guard because of its location the geographical location of 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.610
 his vines which is located on the plateau of the crau so at a club percent at 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.450
 south-east of the appellation which precisely the very typical terroir is doubtful and 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.800
 and stony in europe robin lehner a frame is a minerality that that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.450
 we appreciate that it is so thin the offer field of the old telegraph 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.610
 since it is a pledge of actually balancing conservation any case 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.990
 in the 20% m 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.170
 at this time when global warming is affecting the southern regions 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.810
 the notion of terroir and more and more important so 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.780
 those domain belongs the burnished family is a field with character 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.979
 family even flags of the appellation châteauneuf-du-pape 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.010
 is this 2008 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.990
 it is not tasted very well we appreciate it 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.610
 the brightness the misfortune 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.159
 the shimmering colors of her satiny dress 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.479
 characteristic that we come to mingle notes of fresh black fruits well 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.930
 ripe sweet spicy brought by in these pages mans by the region 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.060
 also already this frame a little fierce of slightly mineral so 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 a duo of terroir delay of the crau 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.310
 and we find all in the mouth of course through this texture 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.120
 tannins this silky tannin that we have a good on the first sensation and where 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.860
 quickly have the minerality comes settle to bring balance 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.670
 righteousness or twenty-one 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.560
 we actually let ourselves think that this jerk 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.900
 which has a high potential of guarding so an important notion for us 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.349
 at qualys simard 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.799
 then for the amateurs of 20 young people since some take pleasure in 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.540
 see them a little earlier, we're not going to blame them 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.980
 recommend red meats with% and play on the textures of the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.159
 seals said then for example an hour a bull gardiane 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.269
 languedoc and not very very far it is a regional specialty 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.780
 a slightly spicy beef stew could quite suit and then 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.440
 if you have the patience to wait a few years than the evolution of a 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.409
 installed maintenance and that the 20110 little bit and well it's the moment 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.769
 actually to enjoy the oar of the finesse of feathered game like 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.999
 nine a partridge cooked in a casserole with a tent and mushroom or to 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.799
 autumn for example besides a thrush a mallard 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:53.759
