00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.610
 good afternoon evening morning night dear 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.570
 friends today with you will be botwiny and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.369
 This is my review on ds ps3 back in 2008 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.259
 year under the auspices of electronics 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.080
 ArtS released the first part of this trilogy 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.750
 giving us an incredible pleasure from 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.170
 his passing ded space was scary 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.650
 play 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 atmosphere complexity plot and its presentation 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.730
 All this formed a line shot 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.230
 games as people who know well in fear 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.480
 after a long engine improvement 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.309
 stretching for two years they let out 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.610
 next part of the series where isaac clarke 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.860
 learned to speak a variety of costumes 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.129
 replenished and the plot became more of us 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.079
 confuse and atmosphere and fear also 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.989
 stayed especially when isaac 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.660
 returns to ishimura and now we finally 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.090
 then we match the nail of our program 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.339
 before you say something I remind you about 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.450
 other failed protracted projects 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.310
 under electronics art 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.810
 mostly incorporating themselves 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.060
 fakes beat off in 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.970
 it's dragon age and in mass effect 3 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.400
 of course in my mind 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.369
 plot dullness and increased emphasis on 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.920
 action dictates electronic arts because 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.390
 a bungle of Syria, I have never seen but 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.700
 I will prove it to you later 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.659
 and let's go back to the dice ps3 game 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.479
 waited 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.220
 de spoilers I can not do but even 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.930
 if you haven't played dead space 3 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.780
 but want to play then do not be scared 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.240
 because the plot space 3 is full of slag 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.790
 the beginning of the game we see Isaac Clarke 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.549
 suspended from his life he retired with 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.950
 his new girlfriend at the station titan 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.270
 communal from the future and see the obelisk 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.630
 first question arisen in my head 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.790
 why the hell was everyone perfectly aware 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.070
 what happened to ishimura and what happened on 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.259
 metropolis station behind right after 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.259
 explanations that obelisks are mined 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.390
 energy I closed my eyes to this and then a 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.960
 language force forced to agree to 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.980
 the salvation of mankind but emotions 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.680
 the former about consent are shown somehow dimly 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.840
 sort of because of his new girlfriend but then 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.520
 there is a main villain who looks like 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.670
 on the villain from the movie skyfall 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.130
 lucy burrow and here it bang and blows up 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.900
 monolith and explosion monolith provoke 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.120
 turning people into a micro brand 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.220
 the question is when why the explosion stand monolith 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.470
 changes people gradually not immediately 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.790
 what happened to the body that made 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.100
 Necromorph people 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.320
 why ammo now fits all 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.570
 types of weapons why because of the apartments 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.320
 shoots people and a shocked because 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.870
 The thing about the game has always been that the language is 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.000
 11 bite with a bunch of monsters and this 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.990
 stirred the imagination wanted the main thing 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.160
 empathize hero but no we need action 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.680
 rolls and shelters 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.080
 it is good that even the first-aid kits left that 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.270
 were generated by the angle that's all 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.820
 questions that arose to me after 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.370
 passing the first chapter of the game further 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.710
 innovations in the gameplay of weapons 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.250
 the number of slots for guns limited 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.410
 two well, now supposedly you can do 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.330
 double gun 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.040
 accordingly the question is the weapon of the tongue 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.760
 there was always an alternate fire 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.040
 but we were told no and I understand why 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.780
 weapons can make such a game 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.800
 you can go even at the highest 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.870
 difficulty level on 1 and 2 only increasing 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.960
 damage and putting a couple of gadgets 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.510
 the form of stasis cartridges assembly 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.470
 absolutely everything from weapons to first aid kits 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.540
 can make 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.250
 from the collected resources because I will not soon 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.620
 discovered that the saves were gone 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.530
 the entire save system was successful 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.030
 replaced by autosave every new 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.770
 the discovery was complete for me 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.560
 disappointing especially trying 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.120
 explain what is uncle gameplay 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.340
 in some parts of the game quite 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.250
 good in the middle of where we fly in 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.620
 open space and in the final part but 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.700
 huge gaps he bore and 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.640
 quickly bored 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.520
 scare us not even trying for the whole beat I 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.230
 scared only once where in the store 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.230
 sweets worth advertising year 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.460
 about ending there will not even speak 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.310
 it's cretinism in the last stage 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.780
 drying of the brain well, in general, four 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.730
 half of even limbs 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.420
 kramorov from 10 for addition will come down 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.130
 subscribe put likes
