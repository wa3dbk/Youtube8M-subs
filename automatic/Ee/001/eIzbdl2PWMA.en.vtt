musically<00:01:57.660> now<00:01:58.660> I<00:01:58.690> get<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.229> great<00:01:59.500> feel<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.340> a

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
musically now I get a great feel and a

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.249 
musically now I get a great feel and a
great<00:02:00.910> touch<00:02:01.119> is<00:02:01.330> being<00:02:01.509> achieved<00:02:01.630> by<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.020> lot

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
great touch is being achieved by a lot

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.710 
great touch is being achieved by a lot
of<00:02:02.380> things<00:02:02.679> if<00:02:03.250> you<00:02:03.369> break<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.759> down<00:02:03.940> analyze

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
of things if you break it down analyze

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.840 
of things if you break it down analyze
it<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.289> think<00:02:06.190> it's<00:02:06.369> mainly<00:02:07.830> by<00:02:08.830> bends<00:02:09.550> and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
it I think it's mainly by bends and

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.330 
it I think it's mainly by bends and
vibrato<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.660> course<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.440> know<00:02:11.560> vibrato<00:02:11.920> being

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
vibrato of course you know vibrato being

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.330 
vibrato of course you know vibrato being
you<00:02:13.000> know

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.869 

in<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.489> bigger<00:02:16.030> impact<00:02:16.920> even<00:02:17.920> if<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.310> if<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:18.670> go

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
in a bigger impact even if you if you go

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.960 
in a bigger impact even if you if you go
to<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.390> spookiest<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.410> hostile<00:02:21.400> place<00:02:21.700> in

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
to the spookiest and hostile place in

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.390 
to the spookiest and hostile place in
the<00:02:22.209> world<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.870> play<00:02:23.590> guitar<00:02:23.769> which<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.370> course

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
the world to play guitar which of course

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.990 
the world to play guitar which of course
is<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.090> guitar<00:02:25.569> shop<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.260> music<00:02:26.709> shop<00:02:27.000> you

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
is a guitar shop and a music shop you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.050 
is a guitar shop and a music shop you
can<00:02:28.180> play<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.690> simplest<00:02:29.650> licks<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.459> slowest

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
can play the simplest licks the slowest

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.720 
can play the simplest licks the slowest
licks<00:02:31.330> if<00:02:31.599> you<00:02:31.780> have<00:02:31.989> good<00:02:32.530> vibrato<00:02:33.190> people

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
licks if you have good vibrato people

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.180 
licks if you have good vibrato people
who<00:02:33.849> stop<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.209> say<00:02:34.650> well<00:02:35.650> he<00:02:35.830> knows<00:02:36.010> how<00:02:36.160> to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
who stop and say well he knows how to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.509 
who stop and say well he knows how to
play<00:02:36.459> ok<00:02:37.450> also<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:38.019> think<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:39.069> having<00:02:39.310> an

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
play ok also I think that having an

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.449 
play ok also I think that having an
excellent<00:02:39.940> vibrato<00:02:40.629> is<00:02:41.080> one<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.129> skills

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
excellent vibrato is one of the skills

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.600 
excellent vibrato is one of the skills

that<00:03:39.819> I

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
that I

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.010 
that I
you<00:03:41.239> can<00:03:41.500> guess<00:03:42.500> by<00:03:42.650> yourself<00:03:44.830> anyway<00:03:45.830> anyway

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
you can guess by yourself anyway anyway

I<00:03:48.020> think<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.830> first<00:03:49.040> thing<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:50.120> do<00:03:50.300> is<00:03:50.540> just

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
I think the first thing to do is just

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.010 
I think the first thing to do is just
you<00:03:51.349> know<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.640> listen<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.819> it<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.569> give<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.750> some

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
you know to listen to it to give it some

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.160 
you know to listen to it to give it some
attention<00:03:54.650> what<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.430> used<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.880> do<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.569> slow

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
attention what I used to do and I slow

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.589 
attention what I used to do and I slow
down<00:03:57.200> with<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.190> software<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:59.060> things<00:03:59.300> that<00:03:59.510> I

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
down with the software the things that I

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.540 
down with the software the things that I
wanted<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.019> learn<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.440> listen<00:04:01.010> very<00:04:01.430> very

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550

going to give a lot of attention to the

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.659 
going to give a lot of attention to the
vibrato<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:16.520> then<00:05:17.330> we'll<00:05:17.539> see<00:05:17.690> how<00:05:17.750> it<00:05:17.810> goes

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
vibrato and then we'll see how it goes

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
don't want the end result to be kind of

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.850 
don't want the end result to be kind of
close<00:06:14.590> or<00:06:15.010> sort<00:06:15.940> of<00:06:16.150> almost<00:06:16.590> because<00:06:17.590> in<00:06:17.710> the
