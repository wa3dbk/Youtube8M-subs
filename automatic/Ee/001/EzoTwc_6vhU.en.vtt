00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.210
 it's time to heading myself another 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.859
 portion of zozh from the most sports 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.030
 Christina correspondents 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.030
 carp look 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.240
 There is an opinion that the use of 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.039
 protein is harmful to health and leads to 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.939
 different consequences if you forget something and 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.099
 remind about three 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.259
 This biological supplements to not least 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.849
 so say about the manufacturers who 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.189
 Consume athletes would not only 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:37.960
 can we talk about myths here today 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:39.789
 we will try to figure it out Ivan 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.289
 Engaged in two years and most recently 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:47.739
 began to take protein supplements 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:50.920
 by the way they are different are soy 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.350
 egg whey protein I accept 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.399
 whey protein immediately after 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.720
 workout and an hour before bed 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.120
 the pilot cannot be harmful man by 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.410
 whether the definition also considers ordinary 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.410
 pedestrians on the street 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.310
 health i don't shoot i think i don't 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.640
 climb as it's pure protein 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.800
 which is specifically going respect 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.300
 negative because it can cause 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.430
 addictive is best used 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.400
 natural dopov natural nutrition 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.470
 have time in the body but it is harmful for 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.470
 organism in the first place well and stupidly 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.190
 the goal given means completely different ilya 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.980
 involved in sports and never tried 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.620
 protein and is in good shape but I 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:04.150
 I do not try cool because I think 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.060
 you can pump up the whole body without 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.620
 supplements for sports nutrition naturally 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.960
 some way while consuming 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.100
 ok homemade food i think that everything 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.490
 must be natural 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.600
 land that I ask you in such a reason 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.450
 show clearly our viewers 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.590
 miracle achieved in three years without consumed 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.590
 protein good 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.920
 dry 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.400
 but met with several famous 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.170
 athletes and asked their opinions sell 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.489
 I treat us as positively as 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.260
 to all food and in general in our time is very 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.760
 often hear a question 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.950
 Is protein harmful to these people into space ? 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.220
 fly schoolchildren running around with iPhones have 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.220
 some people in the heads of such a maraga 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.940
 Middle Age and you know what 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.730
 there is not enough protein for everyone 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.489
 polls with proper use 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.030
 products in particular sports nutrition 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:30.530
 in particular protein, I'm sure that 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.660
 it will add to health and improve 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.440
 appearance is the main thing all this competently 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.440
 use 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:47.190
 really cool i treat myself so 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.760
 here's a big much nicer i'm 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.760
 I love him very much 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.250
 protein is that food that is not 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.090
 slag the body it is enough 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.930
 well digested and does not leave 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.940
 some slag say so other 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.800
 you name the words that there is one thing 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.130
 you ate 20 kilos of meat there 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.800
 a business 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.270
 10 kilograms of protein that is what what 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.330
 more harmful that is this big big 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.209
 question I think that even this is not a question we 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.480
 and so everyone understands that 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.250
 recycle all 20 kilos of meat i 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.440
 heard a lot of different opinions we still 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.450
 it remains for me to question whether 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.950
 health protein supplement and therefore 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.950
 we go to a specialist 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.690
 this is it like regular proteins that is like 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.940
 protein meat in principle only this other 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.659
 squirrels eating meat protein there 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.210
 spend much more time than 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.460
 these proteins these proteins are made for 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.979
 so that they digest quickly and easily then 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.590
 there is so that but the forces of the body 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.169
 spent less so that less worked 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.169
 liver less worked pancreas 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.169
 gland 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:09.089
 how hard the mouse is probably useful 

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:11.189
 if you do this daily because 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.860
 this seriously kristina karpova alexey
