00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.379
 but it's music 6 will be the first time 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.160
 that we will change to make a rhythm 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:16.439
 broke 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:20.820
 This team is there, what's there, what are you going to do? 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.539
 a means but an example of the third shaft 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.850
 time 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.359
 I would not normally stay at this hotel 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.099
 You'll hear two beats the day there was 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.040
 two hits but two are popular 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.479
 whole that is not two times is in 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.479
 early pace that's here 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.850
 the goal 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.670
 O 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.000
 i 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.540
 O 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.370
 the goal 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.909
 O 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.130
 i beauty that had on top of it 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.130
 first step is in the same time 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.970
 u1 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.439
 even with 10 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.400
 now let's do the third with step 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.010
 line is still not working. 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:32.750
 it is because this type of rhythm also picks up 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:35.650
 the real will need until it reaches the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.650
 speed and beauty
