look is towards the middle of the face
and<00:01:36.720> actually<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.229> bit<00:01:37.350> down<00:01:37.500> below<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and actually a little bit down below the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 
and actually a little bit down below the
eyes<00:01:38.070> about<00:01:38.520> halfway<00:01:38.759> between<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.509> eyes<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
eyes about halfway between the eyes and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.600 
eyes about halfway between the eyes and
the<00:01:39.900> nose<00:01:40.020> tip<00:01:40.350> seems<00:01:40.979> kind<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.220> weird<00:01:41.400> place

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the nose tip seems kind of a weird place

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.920 
the nose tip seems kind of a weird place
because<00:01:41.820> there's<00:01:41.939> nothing<00:01:42.090> really<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
because there's nothing really there I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
because there's nothing really there I
mean<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.259> me<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.590> course<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> computer

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
mean on me of course I have a computer

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
mean on me of course I have a computer
right<00:01:44.520> there<00:01:44.850> right<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.930> know<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
don't have there I know why because

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
don't have there I know why because
people<00:01:48.659> hate<00:01:48.780> making<00:01:48.990> eye<00:01:49.200> contact

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
people hate making eye contact

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
people hate making eye contact
that's<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.549> hypothesis<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.570> my<00:01:51.720> issue

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that's one hypothesis I think my issue

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.870 
that's one hypothesis I think my issue
with<00:01:52.170> eye<00:01:52.380> contact<00:01:52.619> sometimes<00:01:53.340> was<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> was

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
with eye contact sometimes was I was

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.940 
with eye contact sometimes was I was
like<00:01:54.030> make<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> good<00:01:54.659> eye<00:01:54.689> contact<00:01:55.049> use<00:01:55.710> both

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
like make a good eye contact use both

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.380 
like make a good eye contact use both
your<00:01:56.130> eyes<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.520> look<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.759> both<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:56.969> their<00:01:57.210> eyes

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
your eyes to look at both of their eyes

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
your eyes to look at both of their eyes
and<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.170> feeling<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.439> oh<00:01:58.649> my

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and I would have that feeling like oh my

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.469 
and I would have that feeling like oh my
god<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.430> falling<00:01:59.729> into<00:01:59.939> his<00:02:00.030> dreamy<00:02:00.360> blue

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
god I'm falling into his dreamy blue

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.760 
god I'm falling into his dreamy blue
eyes<00:02:00.950> why<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:03.060> freaked<00:02:03.570> out<00:02:03.810> when<00:02:04.170> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
eyes why do I get freaked out when I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.319 
eyes why do I get freaked out when I
look<00:02:05.070> into<00:02:05.310> somebody's<00:02:05.520> eyes<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> feel

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
look into somebody's eyes and I feel

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.690 
look into somebody's eyes and I feel
like<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.570> can't<00:02:06.780> break<00:02:06.930> away<00:02:07.129> for<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> mean

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
like I can't break away for that I mean

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.600 
like I can't break away for that I mean
I<00:02:08.910> would<00:02:09.869> basically<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.590> into

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
I would basically have to go into

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.920 
I would basically have to go into
collisions<00:02:12.060> right<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> safe<00:02:12.720> space

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
collisions right this is a safe space

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.100 
collisions right this is a safe space
for<00:02:13.610> speculation<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:15.000> might<00:02:15.270> be<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.720> for

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
for speculation it might be that for

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.260 
for speculation it might be that for
instance<00:02:16.440> your<00:02:16.980> amygdala<00:02:17.640> might<00:02:17.880> be<00:02:18.000> slightly

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
instance your amygdala might be slightly

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.720 
instance your amygdala might be slightly
overactive<00:02:18.990> amygdala<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.950> small<00:02:20.340> cluster

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
overactive amygdala is a small cluster

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.370 
overactive amygdala is a small cluster
of<00:02:20.760> neurons<00:02:21.210> deep<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.690> your<00:02:21.810> brain<00:02:22.050> that's

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
of neurons deep in your brain that's

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.560 
of neurons deep in your brain that's
basically<00:02:22.830> like<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.340> emotional<00:02:24.030> center<00:02:24.540> of

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
basically like the emotional center of

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.750 
basically like the emotional center of
your<00:02:24.990> brain<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.590> here's<00:02:25.920> what's<00:02:26.130> interesting

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
your brain and here's what's interesting

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.090 
your brain and here's what's interesting
direct<00:02:27.300> eye<00:02:27.480> contact<00:02:27.890> stimulates<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
direct eye contact stimulates the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.070 
direct eye contact stimulates the
amygdala<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.300> one<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.600> reasons<00:02:30.930> why

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
amygdala this is one of the reasons why

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.320 
amygdala this is one of the reasons why
I<00:02:31.110> contact<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:32.040> be<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.400> emotionally<00:02:33.090> heavy

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
I contact can be so emotionally heavy

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.150 
I contact can be so emotionally heavy
whether<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:33.930> feelings<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.350> intimacy<00:02:34.800> or

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
whether it's feelings of intimacy or

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.740 
whether it's feelings of intimacy or
feelings<00:02:35.820> of<00:02:35.940> like<00:02:36.090> threat

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
feelings of like threat

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.080 
feelings of like threat
I<00:02:36.780> find<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> act<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.740> meeting<00:02:38.100> someone<00:02:38.370> itself

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
I find the act of meeting someone itself

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.260 
I find the act of meeting someone itself
kind<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.770> over<00:02:40.770> stimulating<00:02:41.400> essentially<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
kind of over stimulating essentially the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.250 
kind of over stimulating essentially the
brain<00:02:42.420> structures<00:02:42.780> which<00:02:42.930> are<00:02:43.050> usually

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
brain structures which are usually

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.449 
brain structures which are usually
responsible<00:02:43.800> for<00:02:44.040> drawing<00:02:44.130> people's

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
responsible for drawing people's

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.880 
responsible for drawing people's
attention<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.940> eyes<00:02:45.180> are<00:02:45.570> now<00:02:46.230> causing

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
attention to the eyes are now causing

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.390 
attention to the eyes are now causing
some<00:02:47.459> form<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.820> anxiety<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.840> yeah<00:02:49.110> yeah<00:02:49.530> which

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
some form of anxiety and yeah yeah which

some form of anxiety and yeah yeah which
are<00:02:50.520> now<00:02:50.610> driving<00:02:50.940> your<00:02:51.150> eye<00:02:51.180> moments

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570
