00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.330
 And you, we are the son of you. 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.869
 for all Brazil and do not even want to leave 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.670
 and with me is vital to ensure 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.260
 to think that it is for the first time in the 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.680
 Brazilian television 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:32.290
 I'm going to get a better shoe, right? 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:42.940

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.820

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:50.120

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.370
 little the middle way that the boy is is 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.399

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:10.190
 the quick sucker hit he passed 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.960
 fast but the movement is more difficult 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.709
 to leave a little after you get the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.770
 that clicks in the last fight and 

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:23.660
 managed to run and was on top 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.459
 and he turned from spin to here the spin he did 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.679
 but then all jobs are catching 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:29.539
 here is my hip with the years of 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.750

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.990
 this country for that very reason so if you 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.090

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:56.599

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.610

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:04.250

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.040
