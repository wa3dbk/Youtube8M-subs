 "Without him, a game would give the lead 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:14.429
 massive problems with his eyes light 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.529
 he had difficulty seeing the last of the press 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.669

 Of course, you can get it through either with a virus or through 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.859
 cold 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.850

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.320
 Eyes because I know what you're talking about -5 sorrow 7 5 diopter that is if Ole 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.140
 and looks I can see it always wears centered at the time 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.260
 Training a headband so the sweat no longer in his eyes 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.780
 this means 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.440
 Now this original 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.440
 Oliver Kahn of Rhythm and his opposite to buy this 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.110
 this Olliver Kahn 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.330
 that is unfortunately now I usually have their clique hundreds of thousands of gloves 5 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.440
 percent 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.440

 Brown feel you boar Erhard Kommunale still 1 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.090
 the party congress will be 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.090
 and now I will take off my glasses 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.490
 and now honestly say you would bet on me 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.490
 no major concerns 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.840
 dpa ARD celebrated so were not only the water way yes that's exactly what you want it 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.410

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.250
 Meadow as the Commission hermits protect it too 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.250
 and he is still shown exactly 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.940
 new that goes 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:09.929
 passed the election 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.929
 We may therefore continue to be open as before 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:17.299
 For that we want to win when we are needed 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.679
 only prevent fins 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.149
 he should be with a right 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.149
 IAA were still a freshman Nico by the bill 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.769
 okay acts with real yes well that does not have to be here but the course of the World Cup 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.769
 applies the APA 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.450
 now it is really good but now the pants were undressed yesterday 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:53.349
 that is now what is that soon a picture the topic choice how should 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.479
 that 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.479
 okay yes because that is so long that would be 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:14.449

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.399
 very quickly but also when cooking now so what should that mean then 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.749
 quickly done away from the beginning, there are probably objects ships 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:23.749
 the organ 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.929

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.089
 not where is the player 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.240
 so far investors have been and will be there 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.240
 who at the end or wants to see yes around 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:23.919
 the STS 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.289
 Vettel sat down again has to see everywhere is rolling so Hellstern 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.849

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.819
 the capital 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.490
 Of course I had to do that, I did not want pirate points 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.050
 but more reasons yes 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.440

 the culprits fled 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.759
