green out in your driving range or a

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.520 
green out in your driving range or a
large<00:00:34.030> bunker<00:00:34.570> it's<00:00:35.050> going<00:00:35.199> to<00:00:35.260> make<00:00:35.350> this<00:00:35.469> a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
large bunker it's going to make this a

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.800 
large bunker it's going to make this a
lot<00:00:35.739> easier<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.940> we're<00:00:37.090> going<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:37.480> count<00:00:37.630> the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
lot easier so we're going to count the

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.510 
lot easier so we're going to count the
shots<00:00:38.050> that<00:00:38.140> land<00:00:38.440> on<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.680> green<00:00:38.920> or<00:00:39.190> in<00:00:39.430> the

shots that land on the green or in the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.670 
shots that land on the green or in the
bunker<00:00:39.880> or<00:00:40.000> whatever<00:00:40.300> you're<00:00:40.480> aiming<00:00:40.810> for<00:00:40.840> now

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
bunker or whatever you're aiming for now

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.810 
bunker or whatever you're aiming for now
if<00:00:41.739> you<00:00:41.829> don't<00:00:42.010> have<00:00:42.160> that<00:00:42.340> you're<00:00:42.579> gonna<00:00:42.670> have

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
if you don't have that you're gonna have

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.760 
if you don't have that you're gonna have
to<00:00:42.910> pick<00:00:43.120> out<00:00:43.270> something<00:00:43.540> like<00:00:43.899> some<00:00:44.110> flags<00:00:44.440> or

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
to pick out something like some flags or

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.260 
to pick out something like some flags or
some<00:00:44.950> trees<00:00:45.220> in<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.460> distance<00:00:45.610> and<00:00:46.060> try<00:00:46.210> to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
some trees in the distance and try to

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.000 
some trees in the distance and try to
make<00:00:46.480> sure<00:00:46.660> that<00:00:47.230> they<00:00:47.380> land<00:00:47.620> within<00:00:47.890> a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
make sure that they land within a

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.549 
make sure that they land within a
specified<00:00:48.610> target<00:00:49.239> area<00:00:49.510> now<00:00:50.230> I<00:00:50.260> recommend

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
specified target area now I recommend

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.040 
specified target area now I recommend
you<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:50.920> keep<00:00:51.100> keep<00:00:51.520> the<00:00:51.670> same<00:00:51.880> target<00:00:52.390> over<00:00:53.020> a

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
you to keep keep the same target over a

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.479 
you to keep keep the same target over a
period<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.470> time<00:00:53.649> so<00:00:53.920> that<00:00:54.040> you<00:00:54.130> can<00:00:54.280> track

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
period of time so that you can track

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.400 
period of time so that you can track
your<00:00:54.550> improvement<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.390> see<00:00:55.960> how<00:00:56.079> your<00:00:56.230> ball

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
your improvement and see how your ball

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.250 
your improvement and see how your ball
striking<00:00:56.770> is<00:00:57.040> getting<00:00:57.460> better<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:57.820> better<00:00:58.260> so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
striking is getting better and better so

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.299 
striking is getting better and better so
what<00:00:59.350> we're<00:00:59.469> going<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.620> do<00:00:59.739> after<00:00:59.890> we<00:01:00.010> pick<00:01:00.190> out

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
what we're going to do after we pick out

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.010 
what we're going to do after we pick out
our<00:01:00.399> target<00:01:00.760> we're<00:01:01.329> going<00:01:01.450> to<00:01:01.510> start<00:01:01.840> out

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
our target we're going to start out

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.259 
our target we're going to start out
working<00:01:02.920> through<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:03.550> nine<00:01:03.730> different<00:01:04.119> ball

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
working through the nine different ball

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.109 
working through the nine different ball
flights<00:01:04.570> so<00:01:05.079> if<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.229> can<00:01:05.350> imagine<00:01:05.590> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
flights so if you can imagine a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.429 
flights so if you can imagine a
tic-tac-toe<00:01:07.119> board<00:01:07.329> two<00:01:07.899> lines<00:01:08.139> going

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
tic-tac-toe board two lines going

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.399 
tic-tac-toe board two lines going
vertical<00:01:09.189> two<00:01:09.700> lines<00:01:09.909> going<00:01:10.149> horizontal<00:01:10.959> that

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
vertical two lines going horizontal that

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.919 
vertical two lines going horizontal that
would<00:01:11.560> make<00:01:11.740> nine<00:01:12.100> squares<00:01:12.609> now<00:01:13.450> your<00:01:13.600> bottom

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
would make nine squares now your bottom

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:16.020 
would make nine squares now your bottom
right<00:01:14.139> Square<00:01:14.590> you<00:01:15.100> can<00:01:15.130> imagine<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:15.729> as<00:01:15.999> a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
right Square you can imagine that as a

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.480 
right Square you can imagine that as a
low<00:01:16.450> draw<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:17.469> I'm<00:01:17.530> hitting<00:01:17.619> a<00:01:17.799> low<00:01:17.920> draw<00:01:18.189> as

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
low draw so I'm hitting a low draw as

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.940 
low draw so I'm hitting a low draw as
soon<00:01:18.729> as<00:01:18.880> I<00:01:18.969> hit<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.149> low<00:01:19.299> draw<00:01:19.600> that<00:01:20.380> lands<00:01:20.740> in

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
soon as I hit a low draw that lands in

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.219 
soon as I hit a low draw that lands in
my<00:01:21.100> target<00:01:21.340> area<00:01:21.639> I'm<00:01:22.479> going<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.689> go<00:01:22.779> ahead<00:01:22.840> and

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
my target area I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.410 
my target area I'm going to go ahead and
work<00:01:23.649> into<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.009> medium<00:01:24.399> draw<00:01:24.639> now<00:01:25.090> after<00:01:25.329> I<00:01:25.359> do

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
work into a medium draw now after I do

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.580 
work into a medium draw now after I do
the<00:01:25.600> medium<00:01:25.719> draw<00:01:26.049> I'm<00:01:26.170> going<00:01:26.289> to<00:01:26.350> go<00:01:26.439> high

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
the medium draw I'm going to go high

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.699 
the medium draw I'm going to go high

now with each square I'm gonna mark down

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.160 
now with each square I'm gonna mark down
keep<00:01:36.520> like<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.700> scorecard<00:01:37.299> on<00:01:37.840> how<00:01:38.109> many

and that's on that scorecard that's
gonna<00:01:49.869> allow<00:01:50.169> me<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.409> analyze<00:01:50.999> my<00:01:51.999> ball

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
gonna allow me to analyze my ball

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.419 
gonna allow me to analyze my ball
striking<00:01:52.779> and<00:01:52.929> see<00:01:53.169> which<00:01:53.439> pieces<00:01:54.189> that<00:01:54.340> I'm

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.879 
striking and see which pieces that I'm
struggling<00:01:54.729> with<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.119> most<00:01:55.289> so<00:01:56.289> for<00:01:56.499> me<00:01:56.619> I

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
struggling with the most so for me I

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.099 
struggling with the most so for me I
always<00:01:57.219> played<00:01:57.639> a<00:01:57.669> draw<00:01:58.179> play<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.719> draw<00:01:58.929> ever

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
always played a draw play to draw ever

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.870 
always played a draw play to draw ever
since<00:01:59.349> I<00:01:59.469> was<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.709> high<00:01:59.739> school<00:02:00.159> through

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
since I was in high school through

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.300 
since I was in high school through
college<00:02:00.969> after<00:02:01.810> college<00:02:02.200> playing<00:02:03.009> some<00:02:03.279> of

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
college after college playing some of

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.330 
college after college playing some of
the<00:02:03.429> mini<00:02:03.609> tours<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.649> just<00:02:05.979> assumed<00:02:06.310> that

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
the mini tours and I just assumed that

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.649 
the mini tours and I just assumed that
that<00:02:06.489> was<00:02:06.639> the<00:02:06.789> shot<00:02:06.999> that<00:02:07.149> I<00:02:07.209> hit<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.419> best

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
that was the shot that I hit the best

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.660 
that was the shot that I hit the best
now<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:08.590> started<00:02:08.950> working<00:02:09.160> through<00:02:09.520> this

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
now as I started working through this

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.300 
now as I started working through this
drill<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.360> couple<00:02:11.020> years<00:02:11.200> ago<00:02:11.380> when<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.250> first

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
drill a couple years ago when I first

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.040 
drill a couple years ago when I first
really<00:02:12.790> started<00:02:12.880> practicing<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.540> way<00:02:13.810> I

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
really started practicing this way I

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.260 
really started practicing this way I
noticed<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.920> my<00:02:15.070> fade<00:02:15.430> was<00:02:15.820> much<00:02:16.060> more

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
noticed that my fade was much more

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.910 
noticed that my fade was much more
consist

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
consist

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.440 
consist
so<00:02:17.280> when<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.460> looked<00:02:17.640> at<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.819> boxes<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
so when I looked at the boxes on the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.960 
so when I looked at the boxes on the
right<00:02:18.660> my<00:02:18.930> draw<00:02:19.200> boxes<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.460> compared<00:02:20.850> them

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
right my draw boxes and I compared them

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.670 
right my draw boxes and I compared them
to<00:02:21.030> my<00:02:21.240> three<00:02:21.630> boxes<00:02:21.959> on<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.200> left<00:02:22.440> which<00:02:22.590> are

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
to my three boxes on the left which are

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.730 
to my three boxes on the left which are
my<00:02:22.830> fade<00:02:23.040> boxes<00:02:23.780> my<00:02:24.780> left<00:02:25.140> numbers<00:02:25.530> were

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
my fade boxes my left numbers were

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.100 
my fade boxes my left numbers were
always<00:02:26.250> lower<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.000> any<00:02:27.150> time<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.360> tried<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.870> fade

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
always lower so any time I tried to fade

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.390 
always lower so any time I tried to fade
the<00:02:28.200> ball<00:02:28.230> into<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> target<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.130> was<00:02:29.220> always

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
the ball into the target it was always

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.030 
the ball into the target it was always
lower<00:02:29.730> now<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.480> didn't<00:02:30.840> look<00:02:31.020> as<00:02:31.200> cool<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.650> me<00:02:31.800> it

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
lower now I didn't look as cool to me it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.770 
lower now I didn't look as cool to me it
probably<00:02:32.310> went<00:02:32.580> about<00:02:32.790> ten<00:02:33.030> yards<00:02:33.240> shorter

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
probably went about ten yards shorter

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.110 
probably went about ten yards shorter
when<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:33.959> had<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> fade<00:02:34.440> but<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.700> was<00:02:35.850> more

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
when I had a fade but it was more

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.449 
when I had a fade but it was more
effective<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.780> more<00:02:37.200> consistent<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.430> I

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
effective and more consistent so I

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.490 
effective and more consistent so I
started<00:02:38.910> playing<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.450> fade<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.290> started

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
started playing a fade and I started

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.830 
started playing a fade and I started
hitting<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.709> lot<00:02:40.860> more<00:02:41.040> greens<00:02:41.340> by<00:02:41.550> doing<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.090> so

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
hitting a lot more greens by doing so so

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.780 
hitting a lot more greens by doing so so
work<00:02:43.110> through<00:02:43.380> all<00:02:43.560> nine<00:02:43.800> drills<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.670> I'm

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
hitting a straight shot let me go ahead

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
hitting a straight shot let me go ahead
and<00:05:05.920> try<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.070> hit<00:05:06.190> a<00:05:06.250> normal<00:05:06.670> trajectory

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
and try to hit a normal trajectory

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:16.940 
and try to hit a normal trajectory
straight<00:05:07.420> shot<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.320> let's<00:05:08.620> see<00:05:08.800> what<00:05:08.920> happens

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.680 

okay<00:05:17.850> so<00:05:17.910> that<00:05:18.090> one<00:05:18.180> went<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.360> little<00:05:18.600> bit

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
okay so that one went a little bit

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.640 
okay so that one went a little bit
straight<00:05:19.430> maybe<00:05:20.430> a<00:05:20.940> hair<00:05:21.480> lower<00:05:21.870> than<00:05:22.350> normal

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
straight maybe a hair lower than normal

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.490 
straight maybe a hair lower than normal
trajectory<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:24.360> little<00:05:24.720> tiny<00:05:24.990> bit<00:05:25.290> of<00:05:25.320> a

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
trajectory and a little tiny bit of a

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.930 
trajectory and a little tiny bit of a
draw<00:05:25.740> I<00:05:26.010> probably<00:05:26.250> would<00:05:26.430> have<00:05:26.460> counted<00:05:26.640> that

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
draw I probably would have counted that

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.010 
draw I probably would have counted that
because<00:05:27.210> it<00:05:27.300> was<00:05:27.420> pretty<00:05:27.660> straight<00:05:27.990> and

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
because it was pretty straight and

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.140 
because it was pretty straight and
pretty<00:05:28.500> close<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.830> normal<00:05:29.010> trajectory<00:05:29.250> but

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
pretty close to normal trajectory but

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.640 
pretty close to normal trajectory but
let's<00:05:30.330> pretend<00:05:30.690> that<00:05:30.780> I<00:05:30.900> had<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.170> fine-tune

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
let's pretend that I had to fine-tune

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.580 
let's pretend that I had to fine-tune
that<00:05:31.860> I<00:05:32.100> got<00:05:32.760> a<00:05:32.790> little<00:05:33.060> bit<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.360> draw<00:05:33.630> so<00:05:34.500> if

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
that I got a little bit of a draw so if

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.920 
that I got a little bit of a draw so if
I<00:05:34.680> wanted<00:05:34.950> to<00:05:35.040> straighten<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.580> out<00:05:35.930> instead

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
I wanted to straighten that out instead

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.140 
I wanted to straighten that out instead
of<00:05:37.020> letting<00:05:37.200> these<00:05:37.350> hands<00:05:37.620> roll<00:05:37.950> on<00:05:38.160> over<00:05:38.580> I'm

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
of letting these hands roll on over I'm

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.640 
of letting these hands roll on over I'm
gonna<00:05:39.300> keep<00:05:39.510> that<00:05:39.570> face<00:05:39.900> a<00:05:39.930> little<00:05:40.230> bit<00:05:40.350> more

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
gonna keep that face a little bit more

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.830 
gonna keep that face a little bit more
open<00:05:41.010> and<00:05:41.250> basically<00:05:41.850> keep<00:05:42.060> this<00:05:42.270> left<00:05:42.540> wrist

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
open and basically keep this left wrist

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.300 
open and basically keep this left wrist
instead<00:05:43.320> of<00:05:43.410> rolling<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:43.770> over<00:05:43.890> I'm<00:05:44.130> going<00:05:44.250> to

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
instead of rolling it over I'm going to

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.190 
instead of rolling it over I'm going to
straighten<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.730> out<00:05:44.820> a<00:05:44.880> little<00:05:45.090> bit<00:05:45.360> keep<00:05:46.020> that

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
straighten it out a little bit keep that

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.710 
straighten it out a little bit keep that
face<00:05:46.350> more<00:05:46.740> vertical<00:05:47.280> instead<00:05:47.580> of<00:05:47.760> turning<00:05:48.510> to

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
face more vertical instead of turning to

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.280 
face more vertical instead of turning to
the<00:05:48.810> left

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
the left

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.510 
the left
that's<00:05:49.680> going<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:49.890> help<00:05:49.980> to<00:05:50.070> straighten<00:05:50.340> out

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
that's going to help to straighten out

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.950 
that's going to help to straighten out
my<00:05:50.550> ball<00:05:50.820> flight<00:05:51.060> instead<00:05:51.300> of<00:05:51.390> having<00:05:51.540> a<00:05:51.690> draw

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
my ball flight instead of having a draw

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.200 
my ball flight instead of having a draw
and<00:05:52.230> if<00:05:52.770> it<00:05:52.890> had<00:05:53.010> gone<00:05:53.100> a<00:05:53.160> little<00:05:53.460> bit<00:05:53.580> lower<00:05:53.880> I

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
and if it had gone a little bit lower I

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.090 
and if it had gone a little bit lower I
may<00:05:54.510> not<00:05:54.630> have<00:05:54.750> counted<00:05:55.110> it<00:05:55.230> and<00:05:55.440> I<00:05:55.890> need<00:05:56.070> a

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
may not have counted it and I need a

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.010 
may not have counted it and I need a
little<00:05:56.250> bit<00:05:56.430> higher<00:05:56.610> trajectory<00:05:56.870> so<00:05:57.870> if<00:05:57.930> I

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
little bit higher trajectory so if I

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.280 
little bit higher trajectory so if I
needed<00:05:58.200> some<00:05:58.410> higher<00:05:58.590> trajectory<00:05:59.160> I<00:05:59.370> would

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
needed some higher trajectory I would

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.620 
needed some higher trajectory I would
basically<00:06:01.290> take<00:06:01.860> my<00:06:02.070> left<00:06:02.640> wrist<00:06:02.850> and<00:06:03.150> make<00:06:03.480> it

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
basically take my left wrist and make it

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.880 
basically take my left wrist and make it
a<00:06:03.690> little<00:06:03.750> bit<00:06:03.930> flatter<00:06:04.200> feel<00:06:04.620> like<00:06:04.710> it's<00:06:04.860> a

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
a little bit flatter feel like it's a

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.590 
a little bit flatter feel like it's a
little<00:06:05.010> bit<00:06:05.100> more<00:06:05.280> cupped<00:06:05.610> instead<00:06:06.330> of<00:06:06.420> bowed

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
little bit more cupped instead of bowed

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.720 
little bit more cupped instead of bowed
so<00:06:07.440> what<00:06:07.620> I'm<00:06:07.770> doing<00:06:08.070> is<00:06:08.190> I'm<00:06:08.310> working<00:06:08.490> through

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
so what I'm doing is I'm working through

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.670 
so what I'm doing is I'm working through
all<00:06:08.850> these<00:06:08.970> drills<00:06:09.330> is<00:06:09.990> I'm<00:06:10.200> looking<00:06:10.470> at<00:06:10.590> the

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
all these drills is I'm looking at the

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.400 
all these drills is I'm looking at the
ball<00:06:10.890> for<00:06:11.580> feedback<00:06:11.900> so<00:06:12.900> I'm<00:06:12.960> looking<00:06:13.260> at<00:06:13.320> the

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
ball for feedback so I'm looking at the

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.870 
ball for feedback so I'm looking at the
ball<00:06:13.560> do<00:06:13.740> I<00:06:13.770> want<00:06:13.980> it<00:06:14.070> to<00:06:14.130> go<00:06:14.220> higher<00:06:14.400> lower

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
ball do I want it to go higher lower

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.640 
ball do I want it to go higher lower
more<00:06:15.510> to<00:06:15.600> the<00:06:15.690> left<00:06:15.870> more<00:06:16.050> to<00:06:16.140> the<00:06:16.230> right<00:06:16.410> and

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
more to the left more to the right and

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.250 
more to the left more to the right and
then<00:06:17.130> I'm<00:06:17.250> controlling<00:06:17.700> this<00:06:18.060> with<00:06:18.510> now<00:06:19.050> it's

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
then I'm controlling this with now it's

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.290 
then I'm controlling this with now it's
time<00:06:19.530> to<00:06:19.560> take<00:06:19.920> action<00:06:20.130> don't<00:06:20.940> let<00:06:21.180> another

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
time to take action don't let another

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.450 
time to take action don't let another
year<00:06:21.540> pass<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:22.290> still<00:06:22.590> be<00:06:22.770> frustrated<00:06:23.430> with

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
year pass and still be frustrated with
