white<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.720> see<00:03:09.019> how<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.290> whitening

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
white you can see how the whitening

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.530 
white you can see how the whitening
agent<00:03:10.130> actually<00:03:10.340> gets<00:03:10.850> into<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.180> smallest

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
agent actually gets into the smallest

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.479 
agent actually gets into the smallest
surfaces<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.319> your<00:03:12.350> teeth<00:03:12.680> where<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.220> stains

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
surfaces of your teeth where the stains

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.099 
surfaces of your teeth where the stains
hide<00:03:13.790> making<00:03:14.420> them<00:03:14.540> whiter<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.049> brighter

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
hide making them whiter and brighter

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.050 
hide making them whiter and brighter
than<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.590> ever<00:03:15.799> imagined<00:03:16.430> possible

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
than you ever imagined possible

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.569 
than you ever imagined possible
and<00:03:17.299> this<00:03:17.900> doesn't<00:03:18.230> take<00:03:18.560> two<00:03:18.799> hours<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.430> it

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
and this doesn't take two hours and it

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.190 
and this doesn't take two hours and it
sure<00:03:19.790> doesn't<00:03:20.000> cost<00:03:20.359> hundreds<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:20.959> hundreds

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
sure doesn't cost hundreds and hundreds

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.440 
sure doesn't cost hundreds and hundreds
of<00:03:21.230> dollars<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.829> for<00:03:22.370> me<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.819> best<00:03:23.030> part<00:03:23.299> is

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
of dollars and for me the best part is

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.210 
of dollars and for me the best part is
it<00:03:23.660> doesn't<00:03:24.200> hurt<00:03:24.350> my<00:03:24.530> sensitive<00:03:24.980> teeth

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
it doesn't hurt my sensitive teeth

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.099 
it doesn't hurt my sensitive teeth
Debbie<00:03:25.700> those<00:03:26.150> days<00:03:26.450> are<00:03:26.720> over

Debbie those days are over
yeah<00:03:27.440> those<00:03:28.100> are<00:03:28.280> really<00:03:28.430> my<00:03:28.639> pictures

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
yeah those are really my pictures

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.250 
yeah those are really my pictures
that's<00:03:31.960> incredible<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:33.130> had<00:03:34.120> no<00:03:34.450> idea<00:03:34.810> that

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
that's incredible I had no idea that

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.530 
that's incredible I had no idea that
they<00:03:35.410> were<00:03:35.500> really<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.370> is<00:03:36.610> HUGE<00:03:36.970> oh

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
they were really that that is HUGE oh

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.900 
they were really that that is HUGE oh
wow<00:03:38.230> yeah<00:03:38.770> it<00:03:39.040> looks<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.310> much<00:03:39.430> brighter

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
wow yeah it looks so much brighter

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.420 
wow yeah it looks so much brighter
I<00:03:40.120> mean<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:40.510> changes<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.170> whole<00:03:41.200> chemistry<00:03:42.160> of

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
I mean it changes the whole chemistry of

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.640 
I mean it changes the whole chemistry of
your<00:03:42.550> smile<00:03:42.910> that's<00:03:43.480> pretty<00:03:43.870> impressive<00:03:44.260> I

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
your smile that's pretty impressive I

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.300 
your smile that's pretty impressive I
like<00:03:44.830> that

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
like that

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.970 
like that
