first<00:00:04.420> of<00:00:04.660> all<00:00:04.750> I<00:00:04.990> wrote<00:00:05.529> the<00:00:06.009> program<00:00:06.189> on<00:00:08.160> this

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
first of all I wrote the program on this

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.909 
first of all I wrote the program on this
program<00:00:09.639> called<00:00:09.849> mplab<00:00:10.480> I<00:00:10.919> then<00:00:12.959> converted<00:00:13.959> my

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:14.919 
program called mplab I then converted my

programmers<00:00:15.519> wrote<00:00:15.789> two<00:00:16.209> hats<00:00:16.950> using<00:00:17.950> picture

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
programmers wrote two hats using picture

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.220 
programmers wrote two hats using picture
which<00:00:19.720> also<00:00:20.520> transferred<00:00:21.520> the<00:00:22.510> program<00:00:22.990> to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
which also transferred the program to

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.520 
which also transferred the program to

possible outputs free times and then

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.069 
possible outputs free times and then
pause<00:00:53.230> for<00:00:53.590> a<00:00:53.620> delay<00:00:53.980> to<00:00:54.040> build<00:00:54.430> tension<00:00:55.079> then

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
pause for a delay to build tension then

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.420 
pause for a delay to build tension then
it<00:00:56.530> will<00:00:57.600> display<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:59.050> output<00:00:59.079> it<00:00:59.829> was<00:01:00.040> on<00:01:00.220> at

it will display the output it was on at

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:08.100 
it will display the output it was on at
that<00:01:00.579> time

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.200 

here<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.890> an<00:01:09.010> example<00:01:09.100> of<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.790> program

here is an example of the program

here is an example of the program
running<00:01:10.630> through<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.290> sequence

here<00:01:17.120> it<00:01:17.450> has<00:01:17.630> displayed<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.380> number<00:01:18.650> five

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
system was first be reset after the

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.050 
system was first be reset after the
output<00:01:30.170> has<00:01:30.320> been<00:01:30.380> displayed<00:01:31.040> in<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:31.850> case

output has been displayed in this case

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.490 
output has been displayed in this case
five<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.759> program<00:01:35.450> will<00:01:35.720> then<00:01:35.960> be<00:01:36.320> in<00:01:36.409> a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
five the program will then be in a

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.980 
five the program will then be in a
dormant<00:01:36.920> state<00:01:36.950> continually<00:01:37.850> checking<00:01:38.330> if

the reset button is pressed once the

reset button is pressed the outputs are

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.279 
reset button is pressed the outputs are
cleared<00:01:46.720> over<00:01:47.720> there<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:49.690> is<00:01:50.690> ready<00:01:50.929> for

cleared over there and it is ready for

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:58.240 
cleared over there and it is ready for
you<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.470> roll<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.770> die<00:01:51.890> again

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
when the program is going through the

when the program is going through the
sixth<00:02:00.770> stage<00:02:00.980> loop<00:02:01.660> it<00:02:02.660> goes<00:02:03.260> through<00:02:03.530> each<00:02:03.800> of

sixth stage loop it goes through each of

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.230 
sixth stage loop it goes through each of
the<00:02:04.280> six<00:02:04.790> possible<00:02:05.300> outcomes<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:06.290> fast<00:02:06.620> that

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the six possible outcomes so fast that

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.230 
the six possible outcomes so fast that
it<00:02:08.240> makes<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.979> impossible<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.310> cheat<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.880> also

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
it makes it impossible to cheat and also

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.710 
it makes it impossible to cheat and also
makes<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.570> Apple<00:02:11.960> see<00:02:12.170> running<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:14.240> show<00:02:14.510> this

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
makes the Apple see running to show this

makes the Apple see running to show this
I'm<00:02:14.959> now<00:02:15.230> going<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.470> press<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.860> button<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.190> few

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
I'm now going to press the button a few

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:45.350 
I'm now going to press the button a few
times<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:17.630> see<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.830> different<00:02:19.190> outputs

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.750 

okay<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:46.770> are<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:47.720> 103<00:02:48.720> 243<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:50.160> six<00:02:50.520> and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
okay so that we are a 103 243 a six and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.470 
okay so that we are a 103 243 a six and
A<00:02:50.910> five<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.430> six<00:02:53.430> rolls<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:54.060> only<00:02:54.240> actually

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
A five so in six rolls we only actually

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.170 
A five so in six rolls we only actually
had<00:02:54.840> one<00:02:54.870> repeat<00:02:55.500> which<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.640> perfectly

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
had one repeat which is perfectly

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.610 
had one repeat which is perfectly
possible<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.870> normal<00:02:58.140> die<00:02:58.470> and<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
possible in a normal die and so the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.420 
possible in a normal die and so the
system<00:03:02.010> works<00:03:02.930> if<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.230> were<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.590> actually<00:03:05.010> build

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
system works if I were to actually build

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.750 
system works if I were to actually build
the<00:03:05.700> circuit<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:07.370> outputs<00:03:08.370> would<00:03:08.580> be

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the circuit the outputs would be

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.180 
the circuit the outputs would be
arranged<00:03:09.270> in<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.930> way<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:10.860> they<00:03:11.040> look

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
arranged in the way so that they look

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:20.250 
arranged in the way so that they look
like<00:03:11.400> real<00:03:11.730> done
