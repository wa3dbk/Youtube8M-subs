00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.860 
couple hours on the 90 degrees sunny had
no<00:05:12.039> problems<00:05:12.520> but<00:05:13.060> as<00:05:13.210> opposed<00:05:13.510> to<00:05:13.630> some<00:05:13.840> other

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
no problems but as opposed to some other

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.300 
no problems but as opposed to some other
people<00:05:14.169> just<00:05:14.349> saying<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.830> happens<00:05:15.130> regardless

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
people just saying it happens regardless

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.240 
people just saying it happens regardless
even<00:05:15.729> under<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.090> lamps<00:05:17.099> that's<00:05:18.099> BS<00:05:20.250> only

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
even under the lamps that's BS only

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.740 
even under the lamps that's BS only
reason<00:05:21.490> they<00:05:21.580> can<00:05:21.699> separate<00:05:22.210> is<00:05:22.360> like<00:05:22.510> I<00:05:22.599> said

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
reason they can separate is like I said

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.900 
reason they can separate is like I said
you<00:05:22.870> have<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.080> just<00:05:23.260> be<00:05:23.560> not<00:05:24.490> paying<00:05:24.789> attention

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
you have to just be not paying attention

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.000 
you have to just be not paying attention
so<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:25.840> can<00:05:26.080> leave<00:05:26.199> my<00:05:26.349> hand<00:05:26.560> under<00:05:26.770> here<00:05:26.889> the

so I can leave my hand under here the

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.830 
so I can leave my hand under here the
