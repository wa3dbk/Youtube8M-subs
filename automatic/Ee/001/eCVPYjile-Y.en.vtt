nose of what happened in South Africa so

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.120 
nose of what happened in South Africa so
we<00:02:24.940> have<00:02:25.209> been<00:02:25.480> talking<00:02:25.780> about<00:02:26.260> doing<00:02:26.860> another

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
we have been talking about doing another

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.120 
we have been talking about doing another
suite<00:02:27.790> in<00:02:27.940> short<00:02:28.240> for<00:02:28.540> years<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.770> think<00:02:29.860> if

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
suite in short for years so I think if

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.949 
suite in short for years so I think if
there's<00:02:30.340> something<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.090> pipeline<00:02:31.300> it

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
there's something in the pipeline it

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.960 
there's something in the pipeline it
would<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.650> because<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.490> name<00:02:33.700> is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
would be that because the name is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.820 
would be that because the name is
established

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
established

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.590 
established
sweetheart<00:02:35.830> lights<00:02:36.070> we<00:02:36.310> could<00:02:36.610> see<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> bit

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
sweetheart lights we could see a bit

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.470 
sweetheart lights we could see a bit
like<00:02:37.900> shorty<00:02:38.440> ever<00:02:38.770> showed<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.310> mean<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:40.030> Louise

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
like shorty ever showed I mean is Louise

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.020 
like shorty ever showed I mean is Louise
so<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.170> think<00:02:41.410> that'll<00:02:41.920> be<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.190> next<00:02:42.340> might<00:02:42.850> be

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
so I think that'll be the next might be

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.570 
so I think that'll be the next might be
that<00:02:43.330> will<00:02:43.540> be<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.840> next<00:02:43.989> movie<00:02:44.920> which<00:02:45.070> is<00:02:45.220> not

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
that will be the next movie which is not

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.850 
that will be the next movie which is not
candid<00:02:46.060> camera<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.230> will<00:02:47.380> be<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> lack<00:02:47.830> of

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
candid camera but it will be a lack of

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.880 
candid camera but it will be a lack of
story<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.580> sure
