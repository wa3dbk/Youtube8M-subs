00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.929 
Marvel Universe toy line I just think
it's<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.460> fantastic<00:01:41.460> accurate

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it's a a fantastic accurate

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.969 
it's a a fantastic accurate
representation<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.350> character<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.860> I'm

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
representation of the character and I'm

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.700 
representation of the character and I'm
really<00:01:44.189> glad<00:01:44.340> they<00:01:44.700> were<00:01:44.759> able<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.240> reuse<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
really glad they were able to reuse it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.480 
really glad they were able to reuse it
typically<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> little

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
typically I would be a little

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.399 
typically I would be a little
disappointed<00:01:48.000> they<00:01:48.149> reused<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> sculpt<00:01:49.020> but

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
they reuse it so first of all let's just

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.469 
they reuse it so first of all let's just
go<00:01:53.280> over<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> face<00:01:53.670> sculpt<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.060> course<00:01:54.329> this

completely<00:03:20.760> new<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.330> figure<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:22.080> I

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
completely new to this figure and I

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.720 
completely new to this figure and I
think<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.410> looks<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:22.739> nice<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.489> paint

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
think it looks really nice the paint

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.780 
think it looks really nice the paint
jobs<00:03:23.970> pretty<00:03:24.180> okay<00:03:24.570> um<00:03:24.989> it's<00:03:25.980> not<00:03:26.220> as<00:03:26.430> detailed

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
jobs pretty okay um it's not as detailed

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.150 
jobs pretty okay um it's not as detailed
as<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.239> would<00:03:27.390> liked<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.840> I'd<00:03:28.410> say<00:03:28.769> it's<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.950> very

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
as I would liked it I'd say it's a very

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.650 
as I would liked it I'd say it's a very
dark<00:03:29.340> blue<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.910> then<00:03:30.269> they<00:03:30.360> kind<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.600> like

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
dark blue and then they kind of like

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.259 
dark blue and then they kind of like
spray-painted<00:03:31.530> some<00:03:31.739> light<00:03:31.980> blue<00:03:32.700> on<00:03:33.000> some

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
spray-painted some light blue on some

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.060 
spray-painted some light blue on some
parts<00:03:33.570> which<00:03:34.049> i<00:03:34.170> think<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.500> kind<00:03:34.799> of<00:03:34.890> nice<00:03:35.040> you

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
parts which i think is kind of nice you

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.500 
parts which i think is kind of nice you
know<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.489> definitely<00:03:35.580> does<00:03:35.910> look<00:03:36.120> good<00:03:36.269> I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
know it definitely does look good I

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.479 
know it definitely does look good I
think<00:03:36.840> it's<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.140> little<00:03:37.260> lacking<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:38.250> just

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
think it's a little lacking it's just

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.070 
think it's a little lacking it's just
kind<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.730> too<00:03:38.970> bright<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.570> would<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:39.810> liked

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
kind of too bright I would have liked

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.840 
kind of too bright I would have liked
them<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.440> kind<00:03:40.769> of<00:03:40.830> wash<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.250> some<00:03:41.430> black<00:03:41.640> in

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
them to kind of wash in some black in

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.550 
them to kind of wash in some black in
some<00:03:42.030> places<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:43.079> would<00:03:43.200> have<00:03:43.290> been<00:03:43.380> nice

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
some places that would have been nice

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.530 
some places that would have been nice
but<00:03:43.920> uh<00:03:43.980> but<00:03:44.549> overall<00:03:44.610> that's<00:03:44.970> fine

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
but uh but overall that's fine

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.140 
but uh but overall that's fine
he's<00:03:45.780> back<00:03:46.079> this<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.590> very<00:03:46.860> rhino<00:03:47.250> back<00:03:47.730> for<00:03:48.030> me

he's back this is very rhino back for me

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
he's back this is very rhino back for me
I<00:03:48.180> mean<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.540> just<00:03:48.690> kind<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.870> looks<00:03:49.019> like<00:03:49.079> that

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
I mean it just kind of looks like that

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.920 
I mean it just kind of looks like that
and<00:03:49.739> also<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.459> different<00:03:50.820> blue<00:03:51.120> okay<00:03:51.690> it

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
and also the the different blue okay it

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.840 
and also the the different blue okay it
just<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.320> doesn't<00:03:52.500> feel<00:03:53.070> like<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.400> fits<00:03:53.670> in

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850

just it doesn't feel like it fits in
some<00:03:54.060> places<00:03:54.329> but<00:03:54.750> overall<00:03:55.110> I<00:03:55.200> think<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.530> does

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
a trick to help him look up is just to

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.120 
a trick to help him look up is just to
pop<00:04:15.360> off<00:04:15.540> his<00:04:15.690> head<00:04:15.900> it's<00:04:16.410> just<00:04:16.680> not<00:04:16.829> a<00:04:16.859> little

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
pop off his head it's just not a little

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.890 
pop off his head it's just not a little
kind<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.370> like<00:04:17.519> rubber<00:04:17.790> joint<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.720> just

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
kind of like rubber joint so you just

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.390 
kind of like rubber joint so you just
pop<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.109> off<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.590> it's<00:04:19.680> just<00:04:19.739> on<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:19.979> ball<00:04:20.160> joint

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
pop it off and it's just on a ball joint

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.920 
pop it off and it's just on a ball joint
and<00:04:20.489> then<00:04:20.910> you<00:04:21.030> kind<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.329> just<00:04:21.479> put<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.750> down

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
and then you kind of just put it down

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.990 
and then you kind of just put it down
and<00:04:22.200> then<00:04:22.349> just<00:04:22.410> slightly<00:04:23.099> put<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.520> push<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:23.789> on

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
and then just slightly put it push it on

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000 
and then just slightly put it push it on
there<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:24.750> then<00:04:24.900> he<00:04:25.110> looks<00:04:25.349> up<00:04:25.530> really<00:04:25.919> far<00:04:26.190> and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
there so then he looks up really far and

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.440 
there so then he looks up really far and
of<00:04:27.220> course<00:04:27.430> his<00:04:27.550> head's<00:04:27.730> not<00:04:27.880> gonna<00:04:28.000> fall<00:04:28.270> off

like the Hulk sculpt and this is this is
an<00:05:43.930> even<00:05:44.140> better<00:05:44.320> skull<00:05:44.620> but<00:05:44.710> I<00:05:44.800> think<00:05:44.980> that

this<00:05:55.810> wave<00:05:57.300> there<00:05:58.300> we<00:05:58.420> go<00:05:58.570> as<00:05:59.350> you<00:05:59.410> can<00:05:59.680> see

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
this wave there we go as you can see

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.350 
this wave there we go as you can see
they<00:05:59.920> kinda<00:06:00.190> look<00:06:00.280> nice<00:06:00.460> I<00:06:00.700> just<00:06:01.150> kind<00:06:01.330> of

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
they kinda look nice I just kind of

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.580 
they kinda look nice I just kind of
wanted<00:06:01.600> to<00:06:01.690> compare<00:06:01.960> them<00:06:02.110> with<00:06:02.230> a<00:06:02.260> figure

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
wanted to compare them with a figure

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.650 
wanted to compare them with a figure
from<00:06:02.710> the<00:06:02.890> wave<00:06:03.040> and<00:06:03.400> then<00:06:03.790> from<00:06:04.030> the<00:06:04.150> original

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
from the wave and then from the original

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.320 
from the wave and then from the original
body<00:06:04.930> sculpt<00:06:05.380> use<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:06.100> Rhino<00:06:06.310> I<00:06:06.730> think<00:06:07.210> that

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
body sculpt use the Rhino I think that

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.240 
body sculpt use the Rhino I think that
the<00:06:07.450> Rhino<00:06:07.690> is<00:06:08.050> a<00:06:08.080> better<00:06:08.350> figure<00:06:08.590> overall

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
the Rhino is a better figure overall

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.770 
the Rhino is a better figure overall
just<00:06:09.940> based<00:06:10.240> on<00:06:10.650> just<00:06:11.650> based<00:06:11.860> on<00:06:12.040> the<00:06:12.220> actual

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
just based on just based on the actual

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.510 
just based on just based on the actual
the<00:06:13.780> way<00:06:13.930> they<00:06:14.140> use<00:06:14.350> the<00:06:14.530> sculpt<00:06:14.890> I<00:06:15.070> think<00:06:15.430> it

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
the way they use the sculpt I think it

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.860 
the way they use the sculpt I think it
just<00:06:15.700> works<00:06:15.970> a<00:06:16.090> little<00:06:16.150> better<00:06:16.330> for<00:06:16.600> Rhino<00:06:16.780> I

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
just works a little better for Rhino I

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.480 
just works a little better for Rhino I
think<00:06:17.230> Reynolds<00:06:17.620> a<00:06:17.650> little<00:06:17.830> better<00:06:18.010> painted

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
think Reynolds a little better painted

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.900 
think Reynolds a little better painted
as<00:06:18.670> well<00:06:18.930> so<00:06:19.930> I<00:06:20.290> definitely<00:06:21.130> definitely<00:06:21.580> loved

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
as well so I definitely definitely loved

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.370 
as well so I definitely definitely loved
a<00:06:22.090> bomb<00:06:22.330> though<00:06:22.570> I<00:06:22.600> think<00:06:22.750> that<00:06:22.930> this<00:06:23.140> works

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
a bomb though I think that this works

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.470 
a bomb though I think that this works
really<00:06:23.560> nicely<00:06:23.830> and<00:06:24.430> I<00:06:24.520> think<00:06:24.730> abomination<00:06:25.360> is
