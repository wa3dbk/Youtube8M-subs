00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 damian decoration of them then puts 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.299
 to make decorations that can be done at the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.429
 elegant simple house marzipan 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.559
 white chocolate a nice way to do 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.150
 very simple we will make a foliage 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.170
 going to make a rose and we're going to make it go 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.670
 do a little bit of work to the body is 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.440
 very simple you have ideas for 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.609
 to do pretty with each other but we 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.710
 does not act of the show 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.150
 colored then we take dye and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.920
 Almond paste is kneaded with the Koran 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.910
 I will be having a uniform color or 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.949
 marbled it's up to you 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.609
 instead of putting flour we put 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.170
 icing sugar and we will lower it then 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.690
 rolling pin and in the sugar 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.160
 ice the drop that is given to him and 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.120
 the thickness you want to do the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.110
 leaves to play the little game 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.010
 it's really what his choice from 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:47.010
 from there we will detail the shape of a 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.600
 leaves a sharp knife one cuts out and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:57.020
 from there with the back the back of the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.020
 knife goes here marked 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.890
 once upon a time, it's easy to do 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.150
 more or less hungry that's how we do 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.170
 foliage is from there 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.910
 can do all the shapes we want 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.460
 for a sheet of or cut into 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.930
 slices and that's really all 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.729
 other songs possible so we did 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.280
 the foliage now to a beautiful 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.410
 road so we take a bag a little bit 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.700
 thick his plastic freezing a little 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.710
 thick it's important we'll use it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.010
 we will make snow clear 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 marzipan pasta and almond paste 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.640
 do them then we cut sections 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.570
 just like the little ones 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.570
 cut half a centimeter 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.090
 you can arrange it on the bag is 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.670
 regularly like that on a half of 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.300
 sarc important we have them on the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.580
 half of the bag from there we will folded 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.550
 the bag with the palm of the hand 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.800
 we weld we close we make sure that 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.860
 the bag adheres below and above 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.200
 almond paste 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.490
 we use the round shape of the back of the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.420
 spoon to precisely refine his 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.110
 petals the stalls and gently we go 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.110
 refine 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.840
 that's it for the form 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.340
 the top of the petal and the bottom to give 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.980
 a very slender shape to the rose found at 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:18.709
 locate perfect 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.120
 first thing to do we will attack 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.170
 by the chorus of the damian rose leclere 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.590
 it has to be firm and it's 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.060
 important 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.290
 it's a rosebud it's something 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.209
 close thing well who will stay 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.440
 perfectly closed by precisely this is 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.159
 too much that will flourish around the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.060
 heart we will take a first petal on 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:37.450
 go here shut it up we learn it on 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.450
 second beta 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.450
 so we go up the petals to parent 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.010
 it's important it will allow us 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.420
 precisely from well the frames and well 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.159
 position them and do something 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.569
 something that will open gently around 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.860
 from the heart we used the plastic film 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.090
 here because precisely it does not stick 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.829
 so by putting the almond paste on 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.790
 could have put beyond the icing sugar 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.709
 to lower it but it will make it 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.790
 cassandre that will make it harder in 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.959
 being in a plastic film and in 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.280
 lowering it with baking it on the safe 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.989
 the moisture that's in my marzipan 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.250
 and it'll make it more sticky we're going 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.690
 to have the petals sticking 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.640
 other wages very easy when 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.989
 damien do it you petals it remains 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.160
 well adherents it is the fact to have 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.609
 worked in the plastic film he goes 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.720
 allow us that damien the heart eight 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.950
 petals you'll put the ninth and 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.720
 last petals to have a rose that 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.269
 will really be fulfilled and ended 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.169
 after it is allowed to dry the rose a few 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.090
 moments before putting it on 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:25.760
 the interview here we finish last rose 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.250
 So I cut the base a little bit 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.250
 bias for claro be beautifully arranged 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.930
 to see well impose here nicely 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.590
 his watch but then there Damien who has 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.000
 chose a rose 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.310
 we can make the flowers we want 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.900
 can crush the spoon very finely 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.970
 as you showed us to make 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.569
 small shoes one can make towards 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.040
 daisies 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.840
 we can also with the same technique 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.549
 refined very very finely a paste 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.079
 of green almond to make the stems of 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.730
 our flowers the almond paste is a 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.829
 very flexible and malleable material 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.840
 which allows you to make beautiful scenery 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.980
 it's really left running our 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.980
 imagination everything is possible
