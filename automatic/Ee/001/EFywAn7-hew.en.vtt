00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.539
 hello to all of you guys and find yourself today 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.999
 we find with another unboxing phone 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.449
 that it was possible to find it thanks 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:26.029
 to the friends of 39 precisely the link it 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.669
 you will find in phone description that yes 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.390
 it is htc desire precisely 116 therefore 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.149
 it makes htc black that still difficult 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.250
 find in italy but on the internet 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.989
 however, the European markets in particular 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.719
 on belen or via punto it is already possible 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.719
 buy soul see what it is 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.370
 I tell you I have already dropped by 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.920
 pour this here to put one 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.929
 back film because he told me 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.609
 which really lines up very easily 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.129
 this smartphone so I recommend you 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.230
 cover it as soon as you can with a film 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.809
 I cut a film in some 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.739
 way pending its film made 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.289
 on purpose 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.850
 so for now we will do so 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:09.890
 then oh well you see there is his usual 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.870
 plastichina as for also htc juan n 8 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.580
 we are going to open box very similar to 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.290
 but what cinema a bit longer though 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.730
 not richer with a more square but more 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.040
 Rectangular oh well we find the IMEI of the 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.140
 cin instructions 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.910
 there is no comb comb because then there is 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.980
 I'll show created there is a trolley here 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.900
 we have headphones that are not in 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:35.630
 here like those at atcm excellent they are 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.610
 so we have invoice headphones so 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.230
 try another term because 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 we also had white and not there 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.450
 they made you crazy 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.509
 then we have the usual htc chargers which 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.210
 I'm not opening because I have one 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.950
 of that of htc vane m8 already open and lo 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.829
 same from an amp 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.060
 and then we have the usual htc said 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.159
 so I don't even know how to open it here 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.799
 because I already have the htc one m8 cable 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.869
 open so this is the box 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.899
 here we find our terminal is a 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.830
 fabless from a 5.5 inch display 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.940
 hand held pretty well I must say 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.379
 really very much blue coloring 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.349
 nice we also had the coloring 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:19.400
 white is a bit beautiful it is 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:23.000
 same but it turns out we say it has more 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.299
 personality this htc desire blue e 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.250
 816 cameras of which we will then go to 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.989
 talk to compare with that of hm 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.590
 octa see a little what changes between the two 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.790
 cameras 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.630
 here we have the door that there 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.310
 lets you insert sim I think here 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.019
 open it guys don't have nails myself 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.660
 here we are 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:49.700
 see the trolley we open and find 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.850
 to micro sd up to 128gb and nano yes but 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.460
 both of which fit together 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:01.150
 with slipping inside 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.740
 and quite comfortable maybe it's better than 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.610
 usually the usual trolley for which 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.670
 you need to use the plug for 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.260
 open the trolley from the side 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.380
 left uncomfortable in my opinion 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.210
 we find the power button and volume rocker 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.280
 uncomfortable because being a telephone 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.230
 big go like a hand to press 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.250
 these buttons is practically 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.320
 impossible 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.870
 I think we find the usual cases 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.430
 stereo that htc now puts on almost 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.240
 all its camera terminals 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.010
 front and this beautiful screen from 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.470
 5.5 inches 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.240
 unfortunately not not so gesture 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.530
 we wo n't be able to go and unlock it with one 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.990
 below we find the micro usb for the 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.840
 recharge above we find the jack of the 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.770
 headphones and a microphone and on the side 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.130
 right just let's just do the 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:57.040
 trolley to insert micro 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.250
 sd and nano yes I remember nano sim htc 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.100
 now adopted the nano yes but he too 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.390
 5.5 inch hd screen not full hd but 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.140
 of which we will discuss later better 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.950
 full review without the same 6.0 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.320
 of htc one m8 phone really a lot 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.850
 aesthetically a little bulky 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.370
 because in any case it is a file from 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.960
 5.5 inches 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.350
 from my point of view first impact me 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.770
 looks like a nib too wide to have 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.440
 a good truth handle for a 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.030
 family for example can find 7 was a 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.860
 in a bit tighter in my opinion and was a 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.360
 Pelino more portable however, these are the 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.370
 let's talk better in a more review 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.430
 thorough and complete well guys 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.910
 hello to everyone from daniele for space to 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.910
 times
