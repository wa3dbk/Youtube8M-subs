00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.000
 goalless draw in the new joseph 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.190
 Zorrilla between Valladolid and 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.200
 valencia very important party for 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.360
 the painting pucelano in its fight for 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.830
 avoid the descent a match in which 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.540
 there were many occasions but none of 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.779
 the two finally had the ability 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.300
 to score the goal that would have given them 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.779
 the victory of valència very far away from 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.240
 his European goal got a draw 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.580
 which logically serves him very little 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.710
 although he had more occasions the box of 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.410
 pichichi that the combined that the 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.570
 set of jim this is the first of 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.260
 reach at the start of the match 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.690
 done in the 8th minute the replica puts it 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.079
 the valladolid with this ball in the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.410
 interior of the area that ends up finishing 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.600
 larsson 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.570
 the 11 of Valladolid would end 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.200
 marching injured would enter for 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.600
 replace jeffrén minutes after the 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.140
 former player of malmoe as we see 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.880
 replaced the Swedish by jeffrén that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.260
 I would have some opportunity in the second 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.260
 period of the former FC Barcelona player 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.100
 would select in fact in this pitch 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.670
 in the head 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.730
 the Swedish first half as we said 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.170
 also competed the second with more 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.900
 options maybe goal in the first 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.780
 period as for example is very clear 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.250
 the action of the Chilean vargas that 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.590
 find a ball inside the area 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.990
 that does not just control nor so 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.170
 even to finish well in the end finished 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.920
 catching the goalkeeper 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.570
 James 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.540
 more attempts for the pucelanos the ball 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.280
 of oscar that try to surprise from 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.420
 the front with this hanging ball that 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.670
 finishes blocking well the guaita goalkeeper 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.310
 occasions for the two teams already in the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.270
 second period the script was kept 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.619
 practically of the alternative encounter 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.320
 arrivals of the two although as we said 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.930
 more shots 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.850
 between the three clubs and also away from 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.890
 the clubs by the pit box and 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.720
 as for example in this action in the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.650
 that cancer is about to mark 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.030
 new 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.180
 he meets the goalkeeper again 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.690
 Jaime Jimenez good performance of the former 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.720
 goalie 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.060
 from the elche 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.670
 I tried to squeeze the valence had 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.160
 some minutes of siege the che picture 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.530
 and see this shot that goes to the 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.110
 right of Pablo Piatti who had 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.330
 entered the second time the former 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.130
 almería player good choice although 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.970
 the ball goes to the right of the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.070
 jaime's goal 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.690
 Any detail could have 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.600
 unbalanced the party sideways 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.160
 or towards the other here who tries it 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.380
 this one of cartabia the ball in the frontal 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.130
 of the area and see how it has to block 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.040
 again and catch after jaime jiménez 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.220
 to avoid the goal of the cheers lamented 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.920
 the valencià the many opportunities that 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.140
 Valladolid did not have many but the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.050
 final distribution of points without goals in 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.370
 this day 32 in zorrilla valladolid 0 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.370
 Valencia 0
