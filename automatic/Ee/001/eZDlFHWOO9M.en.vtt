definitely helped the MOBA genre explode
and<00:06:11.650> reach<00:06:11.890> a<00:06:12.040> worldwide<00:06:12.430> audience<00:06:12.730> but<00:06:13.630> I

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
and reach a worldwide audience but I

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.090 
and reach a worldwide audience but I
don't<00:06:13.930> think<00:06:14.140> it's<00:06:14.260> the<00:06:14.380> only<00:06:14.410> contributing

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
don't think it's the only contributing

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.410 
don't think it's the only contributing
factor<00:06:16.380> so<00:06:17.380> why<00:06:17.950> are<00:06:18.280> MOBAs<00:06:18.670> so<00:06:18.910> popular

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
factor so why are MOBAs so popular

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.930 
factor so why are MOBAs so popular
because<00:06:20.170> they're<00:06:20.560> free<00:06:20.860> to<00:06:20.980> play<00:06:21.130> and<00:06:21.490> fun<00:06:21.760> to

because they're free to play and fun to

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.150 
because they're free to play and fun to

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
play because they are dedicated to their

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.220 
play because they are dedicated to their

maybe<00:06:29.230> it's<00:06:29.380> because<00:06:29.530> they<00:06:29.860> offer<00:06:30.040> a<00:06:30.190> huge

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520
