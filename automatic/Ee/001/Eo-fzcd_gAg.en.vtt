00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.380
 hello friends my name is gennady 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.950
 Razin and today I will show you how to measure 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 sugar edge in the blood with one touch glucometer 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:31.460
 select and so before proceeding to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.219
 blood sugar measurement is necessary 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.800
 prepare pen for piercing 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.910
 for this , 10 lancets are included 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.910
 this is a piercing needle 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:54.050
 we remove the pen head insert 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:04.710
 lancet and shoot this one 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.970
 safety head machine all 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.040
 now put the pen head in place and 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.750
 set by turning the head number 4 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:23.509
 it means finger piercing depth 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.509
 and so the pen piercing is ready 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:36.539
 take 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:41.070
 sand blood glucose meter and take a sterile test 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:44.450
 strip set comes 10 but I already 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.369
 spent and therefore bought 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:56.149
 For this model, an additional 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:58.840
 test strips as the test is inserted 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.909
 strip here she has such stripes and 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.399
 here these stripes it is inserted 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.470
 over here 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.110
 but Iâ€™m not going to paste in yet because 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.080
 if I leave the device immediately turn on 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.180
 but I have not yet prepared a finger 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.209
 there is need to prepare your fingers that was 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:26.049
 a drop of blood for this we take a pen for 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.049
 piercing with this lever we start and 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:38.950
 substitute the head of the piercing pen 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.950
 finger here is a button we press it 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.519
 Here I did not work for some reason 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.870
 to pierce 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:52.780
 let's try again like this 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.590
 now punctured 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:02.950
 keep in mind that hiding need to pierce 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.950
 wash your finger washed away 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.270
 you see the piercing depth 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.250
 not enough 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:21.490
 little droplet I'm not enough for the test 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:28.710
 so we put on figure 5 we cock and another 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:31.480
 you pierce your finger 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.750
 droplet more transported quite 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:40.500
 enough to make a test 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:43.840
 So we insert a test strip device 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.180
 Now the numbers that you on display from 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.960
 so far from the previous replacement now 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.170
 a droplet appeared on the screen and here we are 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.410
 this test strip 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:00.400
 Substitute the device all the device began 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:04.800
 measurement is literally 5 seconds 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.840
 the result is ready here is the result 5 8 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:15.510
 millimoles per liter blood sugar 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:22.450
 and then something stopped I made an empty stomach 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:26.020
 literally passed about 11 hours in the evening 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.180
 I have eaten and in the morning I now directly produce 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.670
 froze 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.880
 that is, it is quite normal sugar level 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.800
 in blood 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.630
 because now the device has already turned off 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.480
 self literally in 2 seconds 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.760
 after measuring the device automatically 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.610
 turned off 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.450
 that's all nothing complicated so friends 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.500
 use if you have such a device 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.410
 if not, purchase 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.900
 All you good luck and health all 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.830
 and all the best with you was gennady 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.830
