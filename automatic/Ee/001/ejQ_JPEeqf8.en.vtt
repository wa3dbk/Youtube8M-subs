00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.810
 Super good thing played with many 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.789
 missions of many things is really just 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.039
 a little part that I recorded there 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.380
 You are what I want to say. 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.140
 Good people first, I want to say 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.219
 is thinking about buying fulfillment because 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.079
 it's worth it and another thing that I wanted 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.719
 Tell you guys, actually. 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.520

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.440
 console video in case I 'm playing the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.480
 gta 5 on playstation 3 which is the only 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.329
 console that I actually have and face 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.250
 I think it's very cool tunes to bring 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.020

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.080

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.990
 People, I do not know if I'm going to start a 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.229
 series of gta5 here in the channel or if I go 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.729
 bring some videos let's say so 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.490
 sporadic such as this for example 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.259
 some simple things are 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.780
 videos showing you some of the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.030
 game I do not know, I can make a video 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.799
 for example playing tennis because it is 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.229
 ear is more or less playing tennis or 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.930
 I can take a video and do not know 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.729
 look for a car too fuck a ferrari 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.159
 or I do not know if I'll fuck but get a car 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.270
 pretty fuck and make the car or I can 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.340
 make a video will be 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.350
 catching a lot of cop trying 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.130
 catch five stars and then tried 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.479
 to run away 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.450
 I want to do some things well. 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.729
 different as well and as you do not have the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.439
 gta online I did not want to bring videos 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.340
 with friends and tals but not yet 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.320
 available 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.880
 when online gta available i 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.040
 Can I bring you some videos too? 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.689
 playing with friends and such and such smas 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.790
 Who do I want to say here? 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.950
 About the game I'm really enjoying it 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.979
 Actually, I just started playing 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.319
 and I was going to buy the physical version of the game 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.390
 read and have waited until today to buy 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.740
 the physical version box pretty much everything 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.110
 It turns out I just got caught. 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.660
 the digital version that you download 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.970
 on psn for those who have the psd know more or 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.490
 less how it works I thought until 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.160
 it was worth it because it is much cheaper 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.080
 and you have to download 18 gb 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.600
 which may be influence of the internet was 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.240
 a bit slow but I let it down 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.640
 at dawn from yesterday to today and now 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.840
 I already have the game and it works normal 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.880
 Yes, it works very well. 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.530
 If you want to catch the game, I'll leave one. 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.090
 link in the description of where you can 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.250
 buy at psn 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.680
 I really liked it because I was going to pay 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.660
 two hundred reais in the physical media I found 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.240
 it was very expensive indeed I 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.980
 I want to buy a special edition 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.960
 special edition only here in brazil is 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.580
 very complicated to achieve is very 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.370
 Too expensive, maybe I should buy one. 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.920
 order and if one day arrived business 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.630
 here for me maybe I do a boxing to 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.520
 But you were not what I mean. 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.170
 I do not want to do a lot of 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.420
 anticipate of gta 5 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.610
 even if you want because I already know 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.100
 What a lot of people are doing. 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.690
 people posting gta5 videos on youtube 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.700
 I just wanted to bring this right here to 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.170
 not be left out because I really 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.000
 I really like gta 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.980
 I know I'm a little new, I have 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.690
 only 15 years but I want to remember having 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.580
 played several gt with my friends and 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.500
 maybe I'm not mistaken started the play 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.150
 one I think was not a good game and gta 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.370
 Towers do not know but I remember that I 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.010
 I played here gta you had the vision 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.440
 of top type you would pick up and saw the guy 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.510
 so over the top it was very crazy old 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.520
 at that time we had a lot of fun 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.130
 then we jumped into the gt as a 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.250
 little more advanced than that already had 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.480
 vision as it is today 3d vision gta game more 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.210
 city ​​and andré deficits we played until 4 samp 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.790
 you fell 5 played a lot and now I am 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.220
 very happy that gave gta5 and something else 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.590
 that I know I always realized 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.470
 I just remembered I have never played for 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.450
 to do mission is true i played alone 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.850
 to pick up things user will be 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.400
 wanted bitch will look for something 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.709
 do knock out police play 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.810
 doorman that's what I did I played 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.910
 that not even a madman used China too 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.940
 to get a plane to fly out 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.890
 I remember a very crazy jet and who 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.020
 did the missions were my friends them 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.200
 They liked to do a mission more than I did. 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.330
 I think they like it more 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.130
 I remember but they do some lessons I 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.600
 almost do not do mission so I 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.640
 I do not think it's worth bringing 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.530
 you here a series doing mission and 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.570
 maybe even because I do not know that much 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.910
 of history for never fearing gt 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.500
 I do not think I'll ever be the only one 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.990
 People must have already had some pee 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.780
 but I'll never be one without any code 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.790
 Such ze until the end tranquility is 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.580
 I never played it, it would never be silly. 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.990
 always to screw up and it's that kind of 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.010
 videos I want to bring to you 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.930
