00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
them to the viral flash game site so the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.490 
them to the viral flash game site so the
first<00:01:42.540> thing<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.869> want<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.290> is

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
first thing that we want to do is

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800 
first thing that we want to do is
rebrand<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.220> game<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.939> logo<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
rebrand this game with your logo and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.780 
rebrand this game with your logo and
your<00:01:46.290> link<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> player<00:01:47.759> is

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
your link so that when the player is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.940 
your link so that when the player is
playing<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> game<00:01:48.479> they<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.380> logo<00:01:49.560> here

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
playing the game they see your logo here

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.289 
playing the game they see your logo here

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and when they click their it takes them

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.990 
and when they click their it takes them
to<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.630> website<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:53.850> really

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
to your website now this really really

to your website now this really really
is<00:01:54.180> very<00:01:54.420> simple<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.560> race<00:01:55.770> small

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
is very simple it's just one race small

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.499 
is very simple it's just one race small
piece<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> code<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.460> change<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.390> we'll

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
piece of code to change and then we'll

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.060 
piece of code to change and then we'll
change<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> graphic<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> logo<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.920> let's

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
change the graphic of the logo so let's

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.819 
change the graphic of the logo so let's
deal<00:01:59.250> with<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.460> code<00:01:59.700> first<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.180> all<00:02:00.329> just

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
deal with the code first of all just

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.630 
deal with the code first of all just
because<00:02:01.829> some<00:02:01.979> people<00:02:02.189> are<00:02:02.219> scared<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
because some people are scared of the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.980 
because some people are scared of the
code<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.119> really<00:02:03.329> isn't<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.689> difficult

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
code and it really isn't that difficult

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.200 
code and it really isn't that difficult
I'm<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.130> open<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.460> actions<00:02:05.909> tab

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
on the first frame actually let me close

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.109 
on the first frame actually let me close
that<00:02:08.190> down<00:02:08.429> again<00:02:08.700> show

need to change from now so let's close

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.690 
need to change from now so let's close
that<00:02:45.239> back<00:02:45.599> down<00:02:45.780> again<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:47.160> next<00:02:47.400> thing<00:02:47.519> we

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
that back down again the next thing we

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.119 
that back down again the next thing we
need<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.849> do<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.299> change<00:02:48.329> this<00:02:48.900> actual<00:02:49.349> logo

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
that the graphic itself so we're gonna

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.660 
that the graphic itself so we're gonna
look<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.769> library<00:02:53.160> panel<00:02:53.340> on<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.579> right

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
look in the library panel on the right

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.640 
look in the library panel on the right
hand<00:02:53.849> side<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.329> this<00:02:54.480> one<00:02:54.629> here<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.379> open

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
hand side is this one here if I open

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.289 
hand side is this one here if I open
that<00:02:55.680> up<00:02:55.890> you'll<00:02:56.640> see<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:56.879> there's<00:02:57.090> two

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
that up you'll see that there's two

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.390 
that up you'll see that there's two
folders<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.409> folders<00:02:58.709> have<00:02:58.799> got<00:02:58.950> quite<00:02:59.159> a<00:02:59.190> lot

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
folders the folders have got quite a lot

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.680 
folders the folders have got quite a lot
in<00:02:59.430> them<00:02:59.730> but<00:02:59.849> we<00:02:59.970> don't<00:03:00.150> were<00:03:00.329> not<00:03:00.359> bothered

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
in them but we don't were not bothered

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.319 
in them but we don't were not bothered
about<00:03:00.750> any<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.170> there's<00:03:01.590> one<00:03:01.920> file<00:03:02.340> one

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
about any of that there's one file one

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.089
