should matter yeah okay took the card in
us<00:01:48.270> ok<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.250> code<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.970> um<00:01:51.470> well

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
us ok so with this code it's um well

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.910 
us ok so with this code it's um well
where<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:52.920> got<00:01:53.040> right<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:54.110> means<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.320> side<00:01:55.530> at

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
where we got right it means the side at

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.280 
where we got right it means the side at
which<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.340> monitors<00:01:56.820> touching<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> was

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
which the monitors touching so if it was

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.319 
which the monitors touching so if it was
on<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> back<00:01:58.530> you'd<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.520> back<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
on the back you'd do back if it's on the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.789 
on the back you'd do back if it's on the
left<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.780> left<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.290> was<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> top<00:02:01.740> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
left to do left it was on the top you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.399 
left to do left it was on the top you
tube<00:02:01.950> top<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.780> bottom<00:02:04.170> you

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
tube top and if it's on the bottom you

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.679 
tube top and if it's on the bottom you
do<00:02:04.590> bottom<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.130> think<00:02:05.490> let's<00:02:05.939> say<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> long<00:02:06.450> time
