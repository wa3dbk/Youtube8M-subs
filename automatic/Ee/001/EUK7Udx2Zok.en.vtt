00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the power steering pump okay so I say

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.590 
the power steering pump okay so I say
siphoned<00:01:43.710> off<00:01:43.799> as<00:01:43.950> much<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.340> could<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.820> know

going<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.619> pump<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:07.979> fluid<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.729> I'm<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:09.899> to

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
going to pump out fluid and I'm going to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.990 
going to pump out fluid and I'm going to
make<00:02:10.380> sure<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> keep<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.160> topped<00:02:11.400> off

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
make sure I keep it topped off

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.540 
make sure I keep it topped off
I<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.989> bottles<00:02:13.380> here<00:02:13.530> at<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.739> ready<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.310> pump

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
I have bottles here at the ready to pump

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.610 
I have bottles here at the ready to pump
it<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:15.030> mean<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.569> pour<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.020> as<00:02:16.200> fast<00:02:16.380> as

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
it in I mean to pour it in as fast as

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
it in I mean to pour it in as fast as
it's<00:02:16.770> taking<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.819> do<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> flush<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:19.170> way

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
it's taking it to do a flush that way

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.009 
it's taking it to do a flush that way
we'll<00:02:20.640> hopefully<00:02:20.760> flush<00:02:21.180> out<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.630> old<00:02:21.930> stuff

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
we'll hopefully flush out the old stuff

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.080 
we'll hopefully flush out the old stuff
as<00:02:22.319> soon<00:02:22.350> as<00:02:22.560> possible<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.190> mean<00:02:23.700> as<00:02:23.819> quick<00:02:24.000> as

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
as soon as possible I mean as quick as

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.970 
as soon as possible I mean as quick as
possible<00:02:24.150> why<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:24.959> helper<00:02:25.260> starts<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.800> car

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
possible why my helper starts the car

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.680 
possible why my helper starts the car
and<00:02:26.250> turns<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.060> steering<00:02:27.330> wheel<00:02:27.420> back<00:02:27.660> and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
and turns the steering wheel back and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.570 
and turns the steering wheel back and

forth being really gentle at the stops

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.640 
forth being really gentle at the stops
and<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.660> should<00:02:30.870> be<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:30.989> good<00:02:31.170> flush<00:02:31.440> right

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and that should be a good flush right

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.930 
and that should be a good flush right
