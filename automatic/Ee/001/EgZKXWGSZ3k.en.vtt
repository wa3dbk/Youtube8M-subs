00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hello, I'm welcome, especially since day 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.200
 Today it will be really colorful again 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.000
 we make a rainbow page but that 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.759
 special about this rainbow cache is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 we do it in a bagger that is 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.390
 it's not that complicated as we are 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.650
 take our big bowl and there 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.420
 first do the butter beat 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.470
 They look at me and then we give 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.470
 Slowly add the sugar 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.520
 important in this recipe too 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.940
 Again the all room temperature 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.220
 to have 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:49.820
 Now I take that my will extract 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:52.510
 and do that and a pinch of salt and 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.510
 the protein 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.860
 and then the three eggs 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:18.320
 so now we take this giant were 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:21.610
 mail do the baking powder on it and 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.870
 mix this in an extra bowl 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.540
 mix it thoroughly and then 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.780
 we always give something by turns 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.640
 the mixture to it and a small one 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.620
 sip milk and milk again 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.160
 me and I or myself until everything 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.160
 is used up 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.450
 the dough is ready and now we go 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.300
 to split and of course to dye 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.520
 I have bowl here now 123456 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.190
 because I use six colors and mine 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.220
 colors take on strung red yellow 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.080
 orange green blue and songs and so on 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.430
 now everything is evenly distributed 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.619
 I have a big spoon here and 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.890
 always go around and give each school 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.390
 spoon up the dough everything the bigger the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.390
 spoon the faster it goes of course 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.730
 I'm done with the splitting now 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.650
 now we start to dye 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.510
 if you wonder what colors you are 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.400
 For that we can have a list 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.070
 on our website compiled with 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.270
 different colors types and the link 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.190
 is down in the infobox 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.709
 As far as the colors are concerned, this is yours 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.720
 Creativity set free so you 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.310
 you can make very strong colors you 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.160
 can make the technique on colors 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.380
 you can mix with each other 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.770
 yes, if you are the same now 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.770
 set 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.680
 The red is still a bit for me now 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.190
 super mature that I do now 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.300
 a bit stronger equally important 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.010
 Of course, that's for every one of you 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.380
 dish used its own spoon 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.080
 otherwise you have a huge one right away 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.310
 brown mush heap and then has 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.210
 nothing to do with what we do 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.210
 actually want 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.989
 the colors are finished and now that's it 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.580
 one after the other, always driving and doing 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.200
 a big blob in the middle 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.200
 that's how they look like 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:17.330
 The whole thing looks like this and then 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.400
 now comes in at 180 degrees for 30 minutes in 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.230
 the stove simply gave with the 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.180
 chopsticks may make it to 40 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.460
 minutes you have to watch people at the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.810
 wooden sticks still dough sticks to it 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.930
 just a little longer in it 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.760
 if you prefer rainbow cupcakes 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.140
 Want to do it in a car? 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.150
 namely, I have one in between 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.720
 recipe made even with rainbow 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.230
 frosting the rainbow cache is ready 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.920
 and he does not look gorgeous now 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.560
 go for a walk and there you can 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.330
 really do what you want you can do 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.190
 take buttercream and then from there 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.110
 you can think of it from there 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.000
 use different colors and with it 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.010
 make pattern or you can just only 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.170
 take buttercream you can get flowers 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.580
 you can do everything you want I will 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.890
 now just a vanilla buttercream 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:10.240
 I think that fits very well 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:10.240
