hi and welcome to another five minute

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:06.679 
hi and welcome to another five minute
tip<00:00:03.659> in<00:00:04.470> this<00:00:05.009> tip<00:00:05.069> I'd<00:00:05.459> love<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.850> show<00:00:06.120> sort<00:00:06.629> of

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:06.689 
tip in this tip I'd love to show sort of

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.400 
tip in this tip I'd love to show sort of
a<00:00:06.779> hidden<00:00:07.049> feature<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.979> knife<00:00:08.250> tool<00:00:09.410> it

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
a hidden feature of the knife tool it

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.039 
a hidden feature of the knife tool it
works<00:00:10.679> best<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.400> certain<00:00:11.910> modes<00:00:12.179> like<00:00:12.719> loop

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
works best in certain modes like loop

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.560 
works best in certain modes like loop
mode<00:00:13.349> that's<00:00:13.620> where<00:00:13.799> I'm<00:00:13.889> going<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.099> show<00:00:14.309> it

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
mode that's where I'm going to show it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.540 
mode that's where I'm going to show it
but<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.629> found<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.230> really<00:00:16.530> useful<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:17.400> my

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
but I found it really useful in my

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.660 
but I found it really useful in my
modeling<00:00:18.120> and<00:00:18.830> I'd<00:00:19.830> love<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.190> share<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.460> with

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
modeling and I'd love to share it with

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.040 
modeling and I'd love to share it with
you<00:00:20.820> guys<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.870> right<00:00:22.140> here<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.770> a<00:00:22.980> cylinder

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
you guys so right here I have a cylinder

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.260 
you guys so right here I have a cylinder
kind<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.200> cylinder<00:00:25.620> object<00:00:26.190> I<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.940> tried<00:00:27.240> to

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
kind of cylinder object I just tried to

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.320 
kind of cylinder object I just tried to
make<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.690> as<00:00:27.810> weird<00:00:28.080> as<00:00:28.260> possible<00:00:28.770> and<00:00:29.330> as

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
make it as weird as possible and as

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.930 
make it as weird as possible and as
irregular<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.290> should<00:00:31.620> say<00:00:31.860> and<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> way<00:00:32.789> it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
irregular I should say and the way it

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.689 
irregular I should say and the way it
works<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.629> let's<00:00:33.960> say<00:00:34.350> you'd<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.679> to<00:00:35.129> make<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
works is let's say you'd like to make a

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.329 
works is let's say you'd like to make a
knife<00:00:36.059> cut<00:00:36.539> at<00:00:37.379> two<00:00:38.039> places<00:00:38.539> along<00:00:39.539> this<00:00:40.339> loop

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
knife cut at two places along this loop

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.569 
knife cut at two places along this loop
of<00:00:41.519> polygons<00:00:42.210> right<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.949> so<00:00:43.949> you<00:00:44.010> might<00:00:44.339> use

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
of polygons right here so you might use

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.349 
of polygons right here so you might use
the<00:00:44.760> knife<00:00:44.969> tool<00:00:45.269> in<00:00:45.539> loop<00:00:46.320> mode<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.829> this

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
the knife tool in loop mode like this

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.549 
the knife tool in loop mode like this
but<00:00:48.359> what<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.659> wanted<00:00:48.839> to<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.109> sure<00:00:49.140> that

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
but what if you wanted to be sure that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.919 
but what if you wanted to be sure that
they<00:00:50.070> were<00:00:50.129> evenly<00:00:50.640> spaced<00:00:51.149> from<00:00:51.569> the<00:00:51.719> two

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
they were evenly spaced from the two

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.919 
they were evenly spaced from the two
edges<00:00:52.409> well<00:00:53.280> there's<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.600> really

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
edges well there's actually a really

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.319 
edges well there's actually a really
cool<00:00:55.170> way<00:00:55.409> to<00:00:55.440> look<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.219> offset<00:00:57.089> value

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
cool way to look at the offset value

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.229 
cool way to look at the offset value
right<00:00:57.929> here<00:00:58.319> and<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.069> it<00:00:59.190> says<00:00:59.429> but

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
right here and see what it says but

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
right here and see what it says but
you'll<00:01:00.390> notice<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.199> kind<00:01:01.499> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
you'll notice that it's kind of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.670 
you'll notice that it's kind of
difficult<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.239> hover<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.380> and<00:01:04.500> see

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
difficult to you know hover over and see

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.110 
difficult to you know hover over and see
your<00:01:04.800> offset<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.489> go<00:01:05.670> over<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:05.910> and

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
your offset and then go over here and

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.760 
your offset and then go over here and
type<00:01:06.270> something<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.870> so<00:01:07.440> what<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> can

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
type something in so what you can

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.280 
type something in so what you can
actually<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.150> hover<00:01:09.450> over<00:01:09.600> then

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
actually do is you can hover over then

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.130 
actually do is you can hover over then
you<00:01:10.410> can<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.740> tap<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.490> shift<00:01:11.820> key<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.420> just

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
you can just tap the shift key you just

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.770 
you can just tap the shift key you just
press<00:01:13.410> and<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.800> shift<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:14.550> you<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.330> stays

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
press and really shift and you it stays

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
press and really shift and you it stays
locked<00:01:16.190> then<00:01:17.190> you<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.580> come<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
locked then you can come in here and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.920 
locked then you can come in here and
interactively<00:01:19.110> adjust<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.330> or<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
interactively adjust it or in this

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.750 
interactively adjust it or in this
example<00:01:22.460> enter<00:01:23.600> 504<00:01:24.600> 50<00:01:25.220> press<00:01:26.220> ENTER<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
example enter 504 50 press ENTER and

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.430 
example enter 504 50 press ENTER and
then<00:01:26.910> come<00:01:27.120> back<00:01:27.300> into<00:01:27.480> the<00:01:27.660> viewport<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.260> do

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
then come back into the viewport and do

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.100 
then come back into the viewport and do
a<00:01:28.470> single<00:01:28.950> click<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.540> you<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:30.690> your<00:01:30.870> cut

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
a single click and you get your cut

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.130 
a single click and you get your cut
right<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.820> let's<00:01:32.820> say<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.060> wanted<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.630> cut<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
right there let's say I wanted a cut the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
right there let's say I wanted a cut the
same<00:01:34.410> distance<00:01:34.830> away<00:01:35.070> from<00:01:35.220> these<00:01:35.700> two<00:01:35.910> points

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
same distance away from these two points

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.180 
same distance away from these two points
we'll<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.690> just<00:01:36.870> split<00:01:37.080> this<00:01:37.350> 50<00:01:37.740> down<00:01:38.010> the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
we'll have just split this 50 down the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.460 
we'll have just split this 50 down the
middle<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.690> do<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.170> say

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
middle so now what I can do is I can say

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.240 
middle so now what I can do is I can say
okay<00:01:40.770> let's<00:01:41.730> say<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> wanted<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:43.200> first<00:01:43.710> cut

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
okay let's say I wanted the first cut

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.500 
okay let's say I wanted the first cut
over<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.790> at<00:01:44.970> 25%<00:01:45.510> I<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.350> tap<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.950> shift<00:01:47.190> key

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
over here at 25% I can tap the shift key

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.010 
over here at 25% I can tap the shift key
enter<00:01:48.510> to<00:01:48.930> 5<00:01:49.230> enter<00:01:49.890> click<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.660> can<00:01:51.690> come

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
enter to 5 enter click and I can come

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.020 
enter to 5 enter click and I can come
over<00:01:52.140> here<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:54.020> tap<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> shift<00:01:55.470> key<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:56.030> say

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
over here and tap the shift key and say

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.550 
over here and tap the shift key and say
to<00:01:57.630> 5<00:01:57.960> enter<00:01:59.090> click<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.690> then<00:02:01.050> I<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to 5 enter click and then I know that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.170 
to 5 enter click and then I know that
these<00:02:01.800> two<00:02:03.020> sort<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.140> cuts<00:02:04.590> are

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
these two sort of cuts are

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.550 
these two sort of cuts are
proportionally<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.540> same<00:02:06.870> distance<00:02:07.320> away

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
proportionally the same distance away

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.470 
proportionally the same distance away
from<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:09.140> they<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.530> me<00:02:11.280> highlight<00:02:11.609> things

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
from this they are me highlight things

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.220 
from this they are me highlight things
this<00:02:13.480> cut<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.290> cut<00:02:14.620> are<00:02:14.830> each<00:02:15.840> 25%<00:02:16.840> away

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
this cut and this cut are each 25% away

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.530 
this cut and this cut are each 25% away
from<00:02:17.740> their<00:02:17.890> respective<00:02:18.250> places<00:02:19.090> where<00:02:19.510> I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
from their respective places where I

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.810 
from their respective places where I
made<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.960> cuts<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:21.220> that's<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.520> nice<00:02:21.640> little

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
made the cuts so that's a nice little

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.970 
made the cuts so that's a nice little
hidden<00:02:22.060> feature<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.750> knife<00:02:22.930> tool<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.740> can

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
hidden feature of the knife tool you can

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.480 
hidden feature of the knife tool you can
go<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.760> loop<00:02:25.000> mode<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.800> works<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.370> other

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
go to loop mode and it works in other

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.330 
go to loop mode and it works in other
modes<00:02:27.730> too<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.090> think<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:29.260> could<00:02:29.740> think<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.130> works

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
modes too I think I could think it works

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.040 
modes too I think I could think it works
in<00:02:30.550> plane<00:02:30.880> mode<00:02:31.180> where<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.570> just<00:02:31.840> tap

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
in plane mode where you can just tap

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.310 
in plane mode where you can just tap
shift<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.710> locks<00:02:32.950> there<00:02:33.960> but<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.170> don't

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
shift and it locks there but I don't

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.830 
shift and it locks there but I don't
think<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.770> can<00:02:35.950> actually<00:02:36.840> interactively

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
think you can actually interactively

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.740 
think you can actually interactively
adjust<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.470> same<00:02:38.680> way<00:02:39.330> maybe<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.510> can

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
adjust it the same way maybe you can

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.230 
adjust it the same way maybe you can
yeah<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.550> offset<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.060> not

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
yeah you can but the offset is not

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.840 
yeah you can but the offset is not
expressed<00:02:43.690> as<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.900> percentage<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:45.040> seems<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.760> be

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
expressed as a percentage it seems to be

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.440 
expressed as a percentage it seems to be
expressed<00:02:46.270> as<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.480> relative<00:02:47.580> unit<00:02:48.580> from<00:02:49.240> where

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
expressed as a relative unit from where

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.410 
expressed as a relative unit from where
you<00:02:49.830> started<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.980> but<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.820> pretty<00:02:52.210> cool

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
you started it but this is a pretty cool

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.240 
you started it but this is a pretty cool
feature<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.960> you<00:02:53.050> just<00:02:53.230> tap<00:02:53.410> shift<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:53.890> unlock

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
feature and you just tap shift to unlock

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.350 
feature and you just tap shift to unlock
it<00:02:54.460> you<00:02:54.640> can<00:02:55.630> tap<00:02:56.020> shift<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.710> locks<00:02:56.920> again

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
it you can tap shift and it locks again

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.420 
it you can tap shift and it locks again
so<00:02:58.360> let<00:02:58.840> me<00:02:58.930> know<00:02:59.050> if<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.290> like<00:02:59.560> this<00:02:59.830> tip<00:03:00.190> and
