now<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.679> car<00:00:13.920> manufacturing<00:00:14.150> if<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.269> ask<00:00:15.420> me

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
now in car manufacturing if you ask me

now in car manufacturing if you ask me
it<00:00:15.839> looks<00:00:16.049> like<00:00:16.139> ordinary<00:00:16.619> plastic<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.760> what's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
it looks like ordinary plastic so what's

the<00:00:18.180> big<00:00:18.300> deal<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:20.100> big<00:00:20.279> deal<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:21.119> very

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
the big deal the big deal is it's very
