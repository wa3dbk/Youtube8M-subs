hey guys welcome back to take in and

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.640 
hey guys welcome back to take in and
another<00:00:02.760> box<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.389> gaming<00:00:03.659> tutorials<00:00:03.810> so<00:00:04.529> this

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
another box of gaming tutorials so this

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.289 
another box of gaming tutorials so this
time<00:00:04.830> we're<00:00:04.980> gonna<00:00:05.040> have<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.310> very<00:00:05.790> quick<00:00:06.120> look

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
time we're gonna have a very quick look

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.259 
time we're gonna have a very quick look
at<00:00:06.480> teleporters<00:00:07.309> they're<00:00:08.309> very<00:00:08.460> easy<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:09.120> make

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
at teleporters they're very easy to make

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.940 
at teleporters they're very easy to make
so<00:00:09.599> we're<00:00:09.780> gonna<00:00:09.870> keep<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.230> tutorial<00:00:10.650> short

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
so we're gonna keep this tutorial short

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.850 
so we're gonna keep this tutorial short
you<00:00:11.370> know<00:00:11.519> it's<00:00:11.969> probably<00:00:12.269> better<00:00:12.650> so<00:00:13.650> first

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
you know it's probably better so first

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.709 
you know it's probably better so first
of<00:00:13.950> all<00:00:14.070> I'm<00:00:14.670> not<00:00:14.880> gonna<00:00:15.030> explain<00:00:15.269> what<00:00:15.480> copper

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
of all I'm not gonna explain what copper

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.910 
of all I'm not gonna explain what copper
cables<00:00:16.049> are<00:00:16.170> I'm<00:00:16.260> not<00:00:16.410> gonna<00:00:16.500> explain<00:00:16.800> what

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
cables are I'm not gonna explain what

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.170 
cables are I'm not gonna explain what
electronic<00:00:17.250> circuits<00:00:17.699> are<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:18.000> you're<00:00:18.150> not

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
electronic circuits are if you're not

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.960 
electronic circuits are if you're not
versed<00:00:18.720> into<00:00:19.170> industry<00:00:19.770> craft<00:00:20.039> even<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
versed into industry craft even the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.420 
versed into industry craft even the
basics<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> look<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.680> getting<00:00:23.010> started

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
basics have a look at my getting started

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.340 
basics have a look at my getting started
with<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> duster<00:00:24.000> craft<00:00:24.269> just<00:00:24.510> searching

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
with the duster craft just searching

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.900 
with the duster craft just searching
YouTube<00:00:25.590> or<00:00:25.920> probably<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> first<00:00:26.609> result

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
YouTube or probably be the first result

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.749 
YouTube or probably be the first result
and<00:00:27.199> that<00:00:28.199> should<00:00:28.410> get<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.039> started<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:31.759> let

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and that should get you started so let

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.030 
and that should get you started so let
us<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:33.090> started<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.570> well<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.410> copper<00:00:34.710> cable

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
us get started as well so copper cable

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830 
us get started as well so copper cable
electronic<00:00:35.579> circuit<00:00:35.910> makes<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.270> frequency

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
electronic circuit makes a frequency

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
electronic circuit makes a frequency
transmitter<00:00:37.380> yeah<00:00:37.559> now<00:00:37.770> you'll<00:00:37.980> need<00:00:38.219> these

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
transmitter yeah now you'll need these

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540 
transmitter yeah now you'll need these
one<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.420> each<00:00:39.510> teleporter<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.309> as

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
one for each teleporter and then one as

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.100 
one for each teleporter and then one as
well<00:00:41.879> apart<00:00:42.270> from<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.719> link<00:00:42.930> them

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
well apart from that to link them

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.740 
well apart from that to link them
together<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> want<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> make<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.030> two

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
together so if you want to make just two

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.279 
together so if you want to make just two
teleporter<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.770> two-way<00:00:47.370> ring<00:00:48.020> make<00:00:49.020> three

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
teleporter so a two-way ring make three

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.369 
teleporter so a two-way ring make three
of<00:00:49.320> them<00:00:49.850> cool<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> actual<00:00:51.780> teleporter

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
of them cool then the actual teleporter

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.470 
of them cool then the actual teleporter
so<00:00:52.500> teleporter<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.610> advanced<00:00:53.969> circuits

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
so teleporter is for advanced circuits

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.189 
so teleporter is for advanced circuits
at<00:00:55.260> Diamond<00:00:56.180> advanced<00:00:57.180> machine<00:00:57.510> block<00:00:57.719> two

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
at Diamond advanced machine block two

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.410 
at Diamond advanced machine block two
glass<00:00:58.469> fiber<00:00:58.739> cables<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.910> frequency

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
glass fiber cables and a frequency

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.619 
glass fiber cables and a frequency
transmitter<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:02.329> then<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
transmitter and then you get a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.500 
transmitter and then you get a
teleporter<00:01:04.430> now<00:01:05.430> once<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> teleporter

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
teleporter now once you get a teleporter

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.190 
teleporter now once you get a teleporter
you<00:01:06.750> break<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:08.640> needs<00:01:08.820> power<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.689> needs<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you break this it needs power it needs a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.600 
you break this it needs power it needs a
lot<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.799> power<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.150> boatload<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.140> power<00:01:14.930> so

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
lot of power like a boatload of power so

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.469 
lot of power like a boatload of power so
what<00:01:17.610> we're<00:01:17.790> gonna<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:19.790> cut<00:01:20.790> link<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.299> so

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
what we're gonna do cut link it to it so

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.560 
what we're gonna do cut link it to it so
okay<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:22.590> fine<00:01:23.869> what<00:01:24.869> we're<00:01:24.990> gonna<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.610> is

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.340 

have<00:01:30.570> an<00:01:30.720> mfsu

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
have an mfsu

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.609 
have an mfsu
it<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.790> an<00:01:32.909> MFE<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.200> like

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
it can do an MFE but not really like

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.010 
it can do an MFE but not really like
just<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.549> having<00:01:35.759> first<00:01:35.909> fuse<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.780> amount

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
just go for having first fuse the amount

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.620 
just go for having first fuse the amount
of<00:01:37.079> power<00:01:37.320> you'll<00:01:37.530> need<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.070> incredible<00:01:38.700> if

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
of power you'll need is is incredible if

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.700 
of power you'll need is is incredible if
you<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.930> want<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> teleport<00:01:40.350> short

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
you just want to teleport short

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
you just want to teleport short
distances<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> there<00:01:42.270> that's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
distances like from here to there that's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.840 
distances like from here to there that's
fine<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.560> use<00:01:43.770> em<00:01:43.950> Fe<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.579> otherwise

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
fine you can use em Fe but otherwise

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.380 
fine you can use em Fe but otherwise
using<00:01:45.299> them<00:01:45.450> officially<00:01:45.810> please<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.149> I've<00:01:48.240> got

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
using them officially please so I've got

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
using them officially please so I've got
the<00:01:48.479> mfsu<00:01:48.810> hooked<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.799> some<00:01:50.040> Highfill<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the mfsu hooked up to some Highfill the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.999 
the mfsu hooked up to some Highfill the
solar<00:01:50.939> arrays<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:52.350> know<00:01:52.470> how<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.860> this

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
solar arrays now you know how to do this

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.560 
solar arrays now you know how to do this
I'm<00:01:53.220> gonna<00:01:53.369> explain<00:01:53.729> again<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:56.360> once<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.450> do

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
I'm gonna explain again so once you do

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.690 
I'm gonna explain again so once you do
that<00:01:57.750> make<00:01:57.990> sure<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.259> output<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.710> facing<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that make sure the output is facing the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.520 
that make sure the output is facing the
teleporter<00:02:00.180> block<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.350> you'll<00:02:01.500> just

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
teleporter block and then you'll just

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.399 
teleporter block and then you'll just
connect<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.210> button<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.630> Tora<00:02:06.229> we<00:02:07.229> can

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
connect a button to it and Tora we can

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.279 
connect a button to it and Tora we can
now<00:02:07.560> freely<00:02:08.099> teleport<00:02:08.789> between<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.149> two

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
now freely teleport between the two

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.860 
now freely teleport between the two
and<00:02:10.830> if<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.039> hold<00:02:11.189> the<00:02:11.310> right<00:02:11.489> button<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.689> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
and if I hold the right button in the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.149 
and if I hold the right button in the
button<00:02:13.200> there<00:02:13.730> it'll<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:14.909> that<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.590> lag<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.860> lot

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
button there it'll do that and lag a lot

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.600 
button there it'll do that and lag a lot
anyways<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:18.810> drains<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.079> lot<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.230> powder<00:02:19.610> but

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
anyways it drains a lot of powder but

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.039 
anyways it drains a lot of powder but
this<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.909> very<00:02:21.030> short<00:02:21.299> distance<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.930> it's

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
this is a very short distance so it's

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.500 
this is a very short distance so it's
not<00:02:22.140> too<00:02:22.349> bad

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
not too bad

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.860 
not too bad
okay<00:02:24.950> I'll<00:02:25.950> show<00:02:26.189> you<00:02:26.250> how<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.459> works<00:02:26.810> now<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
okay I'll show you how it works now the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.500 
okay I'll show you how it works now the
first<00:02:28.170> thing<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.379> do<00:02:28.440> want<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.709> show<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:32.510> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
first thing I do want to show you is the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.270 
first thing I do want to show you is the
teleporter<00:02:34.640> terror<00:02:35.640> now<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.390> thing<00:02:36.599> here

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
teleporter terror now this thing here

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.030 
teleporter terror now this thing here
this<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.459> not<00:02:42.049> for<00:02:43.049> teleport<00:02:43.590> sorry<00:02:43.799> because

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
this is not for teleport sorry because

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.229 
this is not for teleport sorry because
it's<00:02:44.220> right<00:02:44.370> next<00:02:44.609> to<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.790> might<00:02:44.970> think

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
it's right next to it you might think

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.789 
it's right next to it you might think
it's<00:02:45.450> sort<00:02:45.629> of<00:02:45.750> part<00:02:45.989> of<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.530> looks<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
it's sort of part of it and it looks the

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.460 
it's sort of part of it and it looks the
same<00:02:46.980> as<00:02:47.190> well<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.849> it's<00:02:48.000> actually<00:02:48.299> it's<00:02:49.170> used

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
same as well but it's actually it's used

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.440 
same as well but it's actually it's used
for<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.829> pipes<00:02:50.129> so<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.730> teleport<00:02:51.180> pipes

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
for the pipes so the teleport pipes

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.420 
for the pipes so the teleport pipes
which<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.810> will<00:02:51.989> do<00:02:52.139> a<00:02:52.409> tutorial<00:02:52.650> about<00:02:53.040> as<00:02:53.250> well

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
which I will do a tutorial about as well

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.539 
which I will do a tutorial about as well
sometimes<00:02:54.409> you<00:02:55.409> do<00:02:55.680> not<00:02:55.920> need<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:56.489> the

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
sometimes you do not need to have the

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.520 
sometimes you do not need to have the
chunk<00:02:56.909> loaded<00:02:57.269> in<00:02:57.420> order<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.780> teleport<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.319> it

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
chunk loaded in order to teleport to it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.129 
chunk loaded in order to teleport to it
so<00:02:59.220> if<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.489> was<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> million<00:03:00.239> miles<00:03:00.480> away

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
so if I was a million miles away

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.080 
so if I was a million miles away
I<00:03:01.170> could<00:03:01.620> still<00:03:01.950> teleport<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.639> that<00:03:02.670> thing

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
I could still teleport to that thing

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.330 
I could still teleport to that thing
even<00:03:03.299> if<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.569> was<00:03:03.720> not<00:03:03.900> loaded<00:03:04.079> so<00:03:04.889> that's<00:03:05.220> just

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
even if it was not loaded so that's just

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.960 
even if it was not loaded so that's just
something<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.670> keep<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:06.150> mind<00:03:07.760> having<00:03:08.760> said

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
something to keep in mind having said

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.789 
something to keep in mind having said
that<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.569> telepods<00:03:10.079> feeders<00:03:10.379> are<00:03:10.530> still

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
that the telepods feeders are still

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.379 
that the telepods feeders are still
handy<00:03:11.220> that's<00:03:11.579> why<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.760> had<00:03:12.000> one<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.269> for

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
handy that's why I had one here for

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.479 
handy that's why I had one here for
example<00:03:12.450> because<00:03:12.930> when<00:03:13.079> you're<00:03:13.200> far<00:03:13.470> away<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
example because when you're far away the

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.539 
example because when you're far away the
solar<00:03:14.879> panels<00:03:15.209> won't<00:03:15.419> charge<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.959> mfsu<00:03:16.549> so

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
solar panels won't charge the mfsu so

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.680 
solar panels won't charge the mfsu so
that's<00:03:17.699> why<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:17.940> handy<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.209> have<00:03:18.359> one<00:03:18.540> next

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
that's why it's handy to have one next

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.360 
that's why it's handy to have one next
to<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.870> anyways<00:03:19.199> and<00:03:19.859> if<00:03:19.949> you<00:03:20.040> don't<00:03:20.190> know<00:03:20.250> what

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
to it anyways and if you don't know what

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.159 
to it anyways and if you don't know what
these<00:03:20.459> doodies<00:03:21.000> keep<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.389> chunk<00:03:21.660> load<00:03:21.840> it's<00:03:22.019> the

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
these doodies keep a chunk load it's the

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.979 
these doodies keep a chunk load it's the
same<00:03:22.500> as<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:23.160> boat<00:03:23.430> anchor<00:03:23.669> just<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.510> smaller

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
same as a boat anchor just a smaller

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.920 
same as a boat anchor just a smaller
ratio<00:03:25.349> a<00:03:26.750> smaller<00:03:27.750> area<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.650> effect<00:03:29.419> yeah<00:03:30.419> so

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
ratio a smaller area of effect yeah so

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.309 
ratio a smaller area of effect yeah so
you<00:03:30.989> make<00:03:31.199> these<00:03:31.410> using<00:03:32.329> iron<00:03:33.329> ingots<00:03:33.720> and

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
you make these using iron ingots and

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.330 
you make these using iron ingots and
they'll<00:03:35.310> up<00:03:35.549> it's<00:03:35.760> cool<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.980> now<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.129> we<00:03:38.310> got

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
they'll up it's cool so now that we got

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.129 
they'll up it's cool so now that we got
our<00:03:38.519> teleport<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.329> we<00:03:39.389> got<00:03:39.540> our<00:03:39.629> frequency

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
our teleport and we got our frequency

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.750 
our teleport and we got our frequency
transmitter<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.919> actually<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.280> should<00:03:41.310> chuck

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
transmitter and actually I should chuck

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.839 
transmitter and actually I should chuck
this<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.239> I'll<00:03:42.690> tell<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:42.989> why<00:03:43.169> later<00:03:43.849> we'll

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
this and I'll tell you why later we'll

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.990 
this and I'll tell you why later we'll
get<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.000> frequency<00:03:45.480> transmitter<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.959> new<00:03:46.139> one<00:03:47.000> so

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
get a frequency transmitter a new one so

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.490 
get a frequency transmitter a new one so
what<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.180> want<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.389> do<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.720> make<00:03:49.169> sure<00:03:49.199> the

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
what you want to do is make sure the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.610 
what you want to do is make sure the
mfsu<00:03:49.889> which<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:50.579> one<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:52.109> output<00:03:52.319> is

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
mfsu which is this one is the output is

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.619 
mfsu which is this one is the output is
connected<00:03:52.859> to<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.760> teleporter<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.419> just

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
connected to the teleporter so I just

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.449 
connected to the teleporter so I just
put<00:03:54.930> down<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:55.079> teleporter<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:55.799> top<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.250> here

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
put down a teleporter on top of it here

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.170 
put down a teleporter on top of it here
there<00:03:57.419> we<00:03:57.480> go<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:58.489> that's<00:03:59.489> basically<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.150> you

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
there we go and that's basically it you

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.210 
there we go and that's basically it you
know<00:04:00.389> it's<00:04:00.540> very<00:04:00.720> easy<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.349> you<00:04:01.680> put<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> button

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
know it's very easy so you put a button

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.970 
know it's very easy so you put a button
next<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.639> which<00:04:02.849> I<00:04:03.000> want<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.739> then<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:04.829> get

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
next to it which I want to then you get

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.439 
next to it which I want to then you get
you<00:04:05.069> free<00:04:05.250> frequency<00:04:05.790> transmitter<00:04:06.239> you

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
you free frequency transmitter you

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.229 
you free frequency transmitter you
right-click<00:04:06.989> for<00:04:07.199> the<00:04:07.229> first<00:04:07.530> one<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.239> it'll

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
right-click for the first one and it'll

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.699 
right-click for the first one and it'll
say<00:04:09.419> frequency<00:04:09.930> transmitter<00:04:10.349> linked<00:04:10.590> to

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
say frequency transmitter linked to

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.250 
say frequency transmitter linked to
teleporter<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.629> right-click<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.139> other

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
teleporter and I right-click the other

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.539 
teleporter and I right-click the other
one<00:04:13.379> you<00:04:13.500> know<00:04:13.530> say<00:04:13.739> teleportation<00:04:14.400> link

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
one you know say teleportation link

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.319 
one you know say teleportation link
established

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
established

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.479 
established
that's<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:16.019> that's<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.919> like<00:04:17.220> thank<00:04:17.430> you

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
that's it that's it like thank you

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.920 
that's it that's it like thank you
that's<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.760> put<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.060> button<00:04:18.239> on<00:04:18.389> you<00:04:18.690> can

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
that's it put a button on you can

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.729 
that's it put a button on you can
teleport

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.740 

now<00:04:22.100> one<00:04:22.639> thing<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:22.910> keep<00:04:23.030> in<00:04:23.150> mind<00:04:23.360> is<00:04:23.600> that

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
now one thing to keep in mind is that

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.510 
now one thing to keep in mind is that
this<00:04:24.050> frequency<00:04:24.500> transmitted<00:04:25.069> I'm<00:04:25.190> holding

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
this frequency transmitted I'm holding

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.770 
this frequency transmitted I'm holding
now<00:04:25.669> is<00:04:25.910> always<00:04:26.600> linked<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.259> one<00:04:27.580> always

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
now is always linked to this one always

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.770 
now is always linked to this one always
so<00:04:29.780> if<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.169> would<00:04:30.349> click<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:31.069> for<00:04:31.280> example<00:04:31.759> I

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.469 

get<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.900> this<00:04:35.990> one<00:04:36.050> now<00:04:36.580> not<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:37.849> the<00:04:38.000> previous

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
get to this one now not to the previous

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.499 
get to this one now not to the previous
one<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:40.310> can<00:04:40.610> you<00:04:41.030> can<00:04:41.060> only<00:04:41.300> use<00:04:41.479> one

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
one so you can you can only use one

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.070 
one so you can you can only use one
frequency<00:04:42.229> transmitter<00:04:43.389> after<00:04:44.389> connection

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
frequency transmitter after connection

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.540 
frequency transmitter after connection
which<00:04:45.440> is<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.590> bit<00:04:45.800> it's<00:04:46.699> not<00:04:46.880> too<00:04:47.030> bad<00:04:47.270> but<00:04:48.550> so

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
which is a bit it's not too bad but so

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.670 
which is a bit it's not too bad but so
then<00:04:49.699> we<00:04:49.759> could<00:04:49.880> change<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.270> back<00:04:50.419> to<00:04:50.680> actually

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
then we could change it back to actually

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.200 
then we could change it back to actually
this<00:04:51.860> links<00:04:52.160> there<00:04:52.370> as<00:04:52.520> well<00:04:52.699> okay<00:04:55.030> so<00:04:56.030> that's

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
this links there as well okay so that's

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.930 
this links there as well okay so that's
how<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.419> all<00:04:56.479> works<00:04:56.949> you<00:04:57.949> can<00:04:58.099> just<00:04:58.280> destroy

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
how it all works you can just destroy

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.339 
how it all works you can just destroy
the<00:04:59.060> frequency<00:04:59.449> transmitter<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.050> just<00:05:00.169> build

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
the frequency transmitter and just build

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:01.450 
the frequency transmitter and just build
a<00:05:00.440> new<00:05:00.560> one<00:05:00.710> because<00:05:00.800> they're<00:05:01.009> kind<00:05:01.190> of<00:05:01.280> cheap

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
a new one because they're kind of cheap

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.990 
a new one because they're kind of cheap
anyways<00:05:01.880> that's<00:05:02.810> what<00:05:02.900> I<00:05:02.990> usually<00:05:03.199> do<00:05:03.729> so<00:05:04.729> that

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
anyways that's what I usually do so that

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.270 
anyways that's what I usually do so that
is<00:05:05.240> pretty<00:05:05.630> much<00:05:05.750> everything<00:05:05.960> to<00:05:06.320> do<00:05:06.620> with<00:05:06.830> the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
is pretty much everything to do with the

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.270 
is pretty much everything to do with the
teleporter<00:05:07.940> and<00:05:08.680> probably<00:05:09.680> next<00:05:09.830> tutorial<00:05:10.220> I

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
teleporter and probably next tutorial I

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.740 
teleporter and probably next tutorial I
might<00:05:10.460> have<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.639> look<00:05:10.759> at<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.030> teleport<00:05:11.479> pipes

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
might have a look at the teleport pipes

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.749 
might have a look at the teleport pipes
as<00:05:12.110> well<00:05:12.139> because<00:05:12.530> they're<00:05:12.680> pretty<00:05:12.889> cool<00:05:13.099> even

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
as well because they're pretty cool even

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.670 
as well because they're pretty cool even
though<00:05:13.970> as<00:05:14.210> you<00:05:14.240> can<00:05:14.509> see<00:05:14.840> from<00:05:15.229> my<00:05:15.409> overview

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
though as you can see from my overview

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.159 
though as you can see from my overview
II<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:16.099> use<00:05:16.490> a<00:05:16.520> red<00:05:16.789> power<00:05:17.030> pipes<00:05:17.300> everywhere

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
II I use a red power pipes everywhere

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.490 
II I use a red power pipes everywhere
but<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:19.159> teleport<00:05:19.550> pipes<00:05:19.789> are<00:05:19.940> pretty<00:05:20.150> cool

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
but the teleport pipes are pretty cool

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.200 
but the teleport pipes are pretty cool
so<00:05:21.500> thanks<00:05:21.860> for<00:05:21.919> watching<00:05:21.979> if<00:05:22.310> you<00:05:22.849> have

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
so thanks for watching if you have

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
anything else you'd like a tutorial let

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.080 
anything else you'd like a tutorial let
me<00:05:25.220> know<00:05:25.370> and<00:05:25.699> I'll<00:05:26.180> probably<00:05:26.659> do<00:05:27.020> them<00:05:27.139> and

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
me know and I'll probably do them and

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:38.300 
me know and I'll probably do them and
yeah<00:05:29.090> I'll<00:05:29.360> see<00:05:29.870> you<00:05:29.960> guys<00:05:30.050> next<00:05:30.199> time
