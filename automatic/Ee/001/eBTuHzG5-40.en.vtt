00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.920
 if karadzic fitness and bodybuilding 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.920
 lifestyle worldwide 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.710
 So what's up with people here with me 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.040
 another episode games ono was and today 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.750
 with the dumbbells cover an exercise 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.189
 I never know that far 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.900
 did not even show this in life 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.760
 construction costs in any case not for 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.550
 the chest and that's where it starts 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.489
 the difference between dumbbells 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.620
 Covers for the chest and without further ado 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.420
 prefer trains for the back for the laz 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.970
 or the senators 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.800
 Here, too, is much argued what is 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.140
 because the difference or certain people 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.570
 claim yes it would only be for a muscle 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.170
 really necessary and it's just people 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.960
 You can do the exercise both as well 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.609
 the back as well as for the breast 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.230
 used here make it for the big ones 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.800
 mast the targeted difference 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.960
 I push the basin up that 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.730
 both lights at the other exercise though 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.070
 I want to meet the latissimus 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.690
 then I press the pool the ass 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.520
 down and here I do exactly that 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.620
 On the contrary , here is the range 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.930
 of motion a bit different here 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.210
 should you look that poor like 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.760
 a fanal not bent so blatantly 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.370
 and above all you should with the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.710
 trade further up so come with 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.740
 the one with the back you have there 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.700
 usually a slightly different range of 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.900
 Of course I will be the motion 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.410
 back exercises sometime also 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.000
 demonstrate 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.030
 but now here for the big one makes the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.140
 By the way, to my defense 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.850
 itself not very long 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.860
 I have done it a few times and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.110
 Since I got her from Mike Hawthorn 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.060
 personally and by ralf müller 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.770
 personally shown 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.870
 such a really cool situation I 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.790
 were great had garden training with 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.990
 micro heard that was filmed 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.110
 Maybe we will even do the scene 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.000
 still get and then suddenly as me 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.140
 Mike was directly involved in training that way 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.640
 I hardly ever said that anymore 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.450
 a bit further up with the trade 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.040
 suddenly ralf möller came into the ins 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.420
 said yes you have to go here a bit 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.490
 continue to come up that goes like this 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.720
 not and people since then I feel the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.220
 Exercise better than ever 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.239
 So that was really a tough one 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.989
 type that is just waiting here 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.720
 it starts 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.160
 you might see that again if 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.780
 when I come back up the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.030
 last centimeter up there 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.980
 they are really crucial to this 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.480
 hard contraction in the chest too 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.190
 I have to say for sure 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.380
 me, the 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.820
 what more and more an exercise so have 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.590
 I always did that too 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.700
 heard so Arnold Schwarzenegger 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.760
 who always talked about it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.950
 through the exercise another breast too 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.830
 get or have something to have 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.510
 Of course, be a bit tall yourself 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.420
 if you think about it more than once 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.030
 you can shape your muscles 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.500
 technically not much change the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.970
 starting points where they are turned on 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.830
 are genetically predetermined 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.840
 you can just just the total volume 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.180
 of the muscle enlarge and thereby 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.440
 of course optically an illusion 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.940
 let arise that the muscle 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.540
 maybe a little bit further and 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.820
 become greater now again 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.520
 important here, the basin pushes upwards 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.260
 this is very important in the chest 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.900
 Variant else you have in any case 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.510
 to top no right contraction 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.150
 which I would recommend here in the 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.220
 lower part not quite so far behind 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.470
 to go downstairs now with for the last one 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.000
 no stretch wanted to create in the here 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.500
 Leitz in the chest that means you have to 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.540
 also a little less away from yours 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.209
 body of your head and a bit 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.890
 stay closer to the head it is still hard 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.660
 to explain I really imagine it 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.760
 always so that i have the elbows 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.260
 not as blatantly a deer as in the back 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.450
 but rather a bit neutral old 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.860
 and he tries to stay upside down 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.530
 especially me on the screens here 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.750
 to focus up and that is really 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.200
 the heavy people this is no beginner 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.850
 Exercise so people who still have problems 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.400
 When you press the breast to the right breast 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.019
 The worries feel this here at most 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.280
 maybe to earn so maybe 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.380
 as it did in the first game two 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.670
 years showed a bit of blood 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.860
 to get in but a rule is 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.230
 does not require such a simple exercise 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.910
 also a certain shoulder mobility 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.040
 that it's not so easy for everyone 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.780
 I avoided the exercise for a long time because 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.070
 she did not do my shoulder well 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.350
 meanwhile I'm lucky 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.209
 pretty good start with my whole 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.580
 mobility exercise with therapy change 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.859
 which I often talk about 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.290
 and showed so that's first 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.510
 line the most important thing that you like 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.340
 said the basin above holds her 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.810
 you focused on the screens and 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.780
 that you also exercise with accordingly 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.919
 moderate dish so start up it 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.990
 really good to feel 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.169
 I am personally even 30 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.370
 kilo if i hear then i have 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.990
 really me and i do honest 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.510
 told 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.390
 I have seen little're rhapsody 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.810
 just for me so the best effect 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:51.180
 And importantly, they are not too blatant 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.860
 you should angle especially up there 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.970
 not actually train the triceps 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.320
 that happens to many people in the 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.750
 exercises to pump the connections 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.430
 Triceps also have that we have ralf 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.920
 müller and michael they a bit 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.350
 explains that just that everyone there too 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.970
 I knew that you did not do it 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.410
 but must have just noticed then 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.030
 that I never did it anyway 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.040
 Here you can see that I am part of it 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.810
 but a little bit of lincoln, that is 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.220
 is important people try the exercise out 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.750
 is a pretty crass exercise if you can 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.550
 Once mastered me over 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.440
 happy and in general 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.820
 Of course, again over a thumb 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.720
 high the series you come with you 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.100
 really good 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.070
 and of course we will do that 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.100
 full and yes I would say until the 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.910
 next video and skin purely man 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.770
 sees himself 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.770
 this happens
