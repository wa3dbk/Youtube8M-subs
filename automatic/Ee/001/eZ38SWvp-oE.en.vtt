00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.899 

hi<00:00:00.299> guys<00:00:00.510> so<00:00:00.840> we<00:00:01.079> just<00:00:01.110> solve<00:00:01.770> for<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.429> yellow

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
hi guys so we just solve for the yellow

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.340 
hi guys so we just solve for the yellow
side<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:03.659> we're<00:00:04.319> now<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.690> solving<00:00:06.690> for<00:00:07.049> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
side and we're now on to solving for the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.250 
side and we're now on to solving for the
corners<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.099> again<00:00:09.090> we're<00:00:09.300> keeping<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
corners and again we're keeping the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.280 
corners and again we're keeping the
yellow<00:00:10.530> side<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.250> top<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.059> we're<00:00:12.719> just<00:00:12.960> going

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
yellow side on top and we're just going

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.930 
yellow side on top and we're just going
to<00:00:13.469> rotate<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.700> top<00:00:15.179> side<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.929> our<00:00:16.560> cube<00:00:16.940> to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
to rotate the top side of our cube to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.529 
to rotate the top side of our cube to
align<00:00:18.390> any<00:00:18.840> corner<00:00:19.500> pieces<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.730> rotate<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.449> at

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
align any corner pieces so rotate you at

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.500 
align any corner pieces so rotate you at
the<00:00:21.689> top<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.140> your<00:00:22.289> cube<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.830> yellow<00:00:23.039> side

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
the top of your cube the yellow side

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.210 
the top of your cube the yellow side
around<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.099> I<00:00:26.210> have<00:00:27.590> these<00:00:28.590> two<00:00:28.650> corners

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
around and I have these two corners

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.170 
around and I have these two corners
aligned<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.359> green<00:00:30.869> red<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.439> yellow<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
aligned the green red and yellow and the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.420 
aligned the green red and yellow and the
yellow<00:00:33.570> red<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.559> blue

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
yellow red and blue

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.760 
yellow red and blue
so<00:00:35.880> my<00:00:36.360> corners<00:00:36.840> are<00:00:38.510> these<00:00:39.510> two<00:00:39.780> corners<00:00:40.290> or

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
so my corners are these two corners or

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.970 
so my corners are these two corners or
you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:42.320> opposite<00:00:43.320> corners<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:43.950> this

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you can have opposite corners like this

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.049 
you can have opposite corners like this
one<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:47.370> correct<00:00:47.670> corners

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
one I have this one the correct corners

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.410 
one I have this one the correct corners
are<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.059> want<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
are here and here so the way we want to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.490 
are here and here so the way we want to
hold<00:00:51.649> when<00:00:52.649> we're<00:00:52.860> solving<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:54.600> step<00:00:54.930> we

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
hold when we're solving for this step we

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.340 
hold when we're solving for this step we
want<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.860> corners<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.610> either<00:00:57.510> diagonally

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
want the corners to be either diagonally

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.599 
want the corners to be either diagonally
like<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.480> one<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.690> back<00:01:01.050> left<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.980> front

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
like this one in the back left and front

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.980 
like this one in the back left and front
right<00:01:03.140> or<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.589> want<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.610> correct<00:01:06.420> corners

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
right or we want the to correct corners

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.440 
right or we want the to correct corners
in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.830> back<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.430> our<00:01:08.670> cube<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.430> so

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
in the back of our cube like that so

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.170 
in the back of our cube like that so
here<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:13.650> using<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.909> has

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
here we have I'm using the one that has

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.530 
here we have I'm using the one that has
the<00:01:15.600> two<00:01:16.259> corners<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> back<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.210> start

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the two corners in the back so to start

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.640 
the two corners in the back so to start
we're<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> use<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.070> pattern<00:01:20.400> RI<00:01:21.650> which

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
we're going to use this pattern RI which

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.810 
we're going to use this pattern RI which
is<00:01:22.860> right<00:01:24.439> down<00:01:25.439> towards<00:01:26.250> those<00:01:26.900> F<00:01:28.820> front

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
is right down towards those F front

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.550 
is right down towards those F front
clockwise<00:01:32.930> RI<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:36.180> right<00:01:36.560> counterclockwise

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
clockwise RI the right counterclockwise

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.910 
clockwise RI the right counterclockwise
towards<00:01:38.520> us<00:01:40.850> BB<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.240> we're<00:01:43.020> turning<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.680> back

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
towards us BB and we're turning the back

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.999 
towards us BB and we're turning the back
clockwise<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.659> we're<00:01:45.810> turning<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.590> back<00:01:46.829> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
clockwise so we're turning the back of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.219 
clockwise so we're turning the back of
our<00:01:47.159> cube<00:01:48.200> clockwise<00:01:49.200> once<00:01:51.079> clockwise<00:01:52.399> twice

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
should have your corners lined up so

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.619 
should have your corners lined up so
mine<00:02:54.280> are<00:02:54.750> lined<00:02:55.750> up<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:57.459> that's<00:02:57.730> what<00:02:58.030> yours

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
mine are lined up so that's what yours

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.080 
mine are lined up so that's what yours
should<00:02:58.750> look<00:02:59.079> like<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.620> I<00:03:00.280> have<00:03:00.519> one<00:03:00.760> side

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
should look like and I have one side

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.030 
should look like and I have one side
complete<00:03:01.659> and<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:03.340> edge<00:03:03.549> pieces<00:03:04.000> are<00:03:04.840> out<00:03:05.829> of

complete and the edge pieces are out of
place<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.579> we<00:03:07.269> can<00:03:07.420> go<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.930> next<00:03:08.109> video<00:03:08.379> to

place and we can go to the next video to

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.410 
place and we can go to the next video to
solve<00:03:09.190> will<00:03:09.819> this<00:03:10.000> cube

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.240 

if<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.890> have<00:03:15.160> your<00:03:15.640> corners<00:03:16.180> diagonally<00:03:17.250> like

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
if you have your corners diagonally like
