the<00:00:02.429> external<00:00:02.790> mean<00:00:03.570> major<00:00:03.959> reasons<00:00:04.500> for

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
the external mean major reasons for

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.140 
the external mean major reasons for
getting<00:00:06.210> under<00:00:06.420> eye<00:00:06.589> darkness<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:08.340> first<00:00:08.639> is

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
getting under eye darkness that first is

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.450 
getting under eye darkness that first is
Sun<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.490> smoke<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.240> other<00:00:13.139> pollutants<00:00:13.860> from

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
Sun and smoke and other pollutants from

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.800 
Sun and smoke and other pollutants from
the<00:00:14.639> environment<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.870> cause<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:17.810> they

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the environment they cause the they

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.029 
the environment they cause the they
cause<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:20.689> skins<00:00:21.689> network<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.380> collagen<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
cause the skins network of collagen and

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.349 
cause the skins network of collagen and
elastin<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:24.260> deteriorate<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
elastin to deteriorate and and the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.720 
elastin to deteriorate and and the
delicate<00:00:27.689> under-eye<00:00:27.960> area<00:00:28.410> will<00:00:29.039> show<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
delicate under-eye area will show the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.089 
delicate under-eye area will show the
damage<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.080> first<00:00:31.320> place<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.740> show<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
damage it's the first place to show that

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.760 
damage it's the first place to show that
damage<00:00:34.430> okay<00:00:35.430> now<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.840> second<00:00:37.260> reason<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
damage okay now the second reason is the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.030 
damage okay now the second reason is the
UV<00:00:38.219> rays<00:00:39.000> from<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> Sun<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.739> spoke<00:00:40.980> about

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
UV rays from the Sun and I spoke about

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.979 
UV rays from the Sun and I spoke about
this<00:00:41.430> when<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> talked<00:00:42.390> about<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.210> my

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
this when I talked about you know my

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.340 
this when I talked about you know my
glasses<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.710> other<00:00:46.739> video<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.989> UV

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
glasses the other video and so the UV

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.010 
glasses the other video and so the UV
rays<00:00:49.789> what<00:00:50.789> they<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.480> increase<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
rays what they do is they increase the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.880 
rays what they do is they increase the
size<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.710> number<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.640> blood<00:00:54.539> vessels<00:00:54.890> vessels

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
size and number of blood vessels vessels

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.529 
size and number of blood vessels vessels
and<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:57.750> shows<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:59.039> shows<00:00:59.760> us<00:00:59.940> dark

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and that shows that shows us dark

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.830 
and that shows that shows us dark
circles<00:01:01.340> under<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.370> eye

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.370 

another<00:01:06.840> reason<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.820> aging<00:01:09.390> aging<00:01:10.229> is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
another reason is the aging aging is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.620 
another reason is the aging aging is
something<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.400> know<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> natural<00:01:11.820> aging<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
something you know the natural aging the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.420 
something you know the natural aging the
natural<00:01:13.020> aging<00:01:13.140> process<00:01:13.409> something<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.310> we

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
natural aging process something that we

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.210 
natural aging process something that we
cannot<00:01:14.729> control<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.799> happens<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.950> everybody

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
cannot control it happens to everybody

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.140 
cannot control it happens to everybody
and<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:20.180> again<00:01:21.180> first<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.610> under<00:01:23.939> eyelid

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and so again first like the under eyelid

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.640 
and so again first like the under eyelid
skin<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.720> pretty<00:01:25.259> delicate

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
skin is pretty delicate

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.300 
skin is pretty delicate
so<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> first<00:01:26.729> place<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.060> shows<00:01:28.310> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so it's the first place that shows the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.890 
so it's the first place that shows the
damage<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.030> result<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.869> aging

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
damage or the result of the aging

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.679 
damage or the result of the aging
process<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.189> will<00:01:32.400> show<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.060> under<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
process so it will show on on under the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:42.710 
process so it will show on on under the
eye<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.740> surface<00:01:40.430> now<00:01:41.430> daughter<00:01:41.790> for<00:01:42.180> for

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
eye as on surface now daughter for for

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.289 
eye as on surface now daughter for for
the<00:01:43.200> dark<00:01:43.439> circles<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.070> there's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.549> reason

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the dark circles now there's a reason

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.999 
the dark circles now there's a reason
for<00:01:45.509> buff<00:01:45.780> finish<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.320> under-eye

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
for buff finish and that under-eye

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
for buff finish and that under-eye
puffiness<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.790> course<00:01:48.030> sometimes<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.659> wake

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
puffiness of course sometimes you wake

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.800 
puffiness of course sometimes you wake
up<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.409> you're<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:51.000> wake<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.570> sleep
