00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
running on 500 MB of RAM so the overall

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.539 
running on 500 MB of RAM so the overall
performance<00:03:30.200> when<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.739> comes<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.129> day-to-day

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.530 
performance when it comes to day-to-day
usage<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:32.090> much<00:03:32.720> smoother<00:03:33.079> on<00:03:33.379> this<00:03:33.889> one<00:03:34.099> as

one or even lower than this one in terms
of<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.609> price<00:03:55.819> so<00:03:56.329> that<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:56.690> going<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.989> be<00:03:57.079> the

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
of the price so that is going to be the

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.469 
of the price so that is going to be the
five<00:03:57.440> strongest<00:03:57.919> 5th<00:03:58.639> strongest<00:03:59.120> point<00:03:59.299> for

00:03:59.469 --> 00:03:59.479 
five strongest 5th strongest point for

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.390 
five strongest 5th strongest point for
this<00:03:59.569> device<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.319> let<00:04:00.470> me<00:04:00.590> just<00:04:00.709> highlight<00:04:00.949> the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
this device so let me just highlight the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.689 
this device so let me just highlight the
weak<00:04:01.819> points<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:02.659> will<00:04:02.900> start<00:04:03.199> with<00:04:03.470> the

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699 
weak points and I will start with the

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.430 
weak points and I will start with the
LED<00:04:04.699> flash<00:04:04.909> so<00:04:05.329> again<00:04:05.780> this<00:04:05.959> device<00:04:06.229> is<00:04:06.409> a

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
LED flash so again this device is a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.719 
LED flash so again this device is a
pretty<00:04:06.680> good<00:04:06.889> camera<00:04:07.159> performance

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:07.729 
pretty good camera performance

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.849 
pretty good camera performance
everything<00:04:08.000> is<00:04:08.269> good<00:04:08.510> but<00:04:09.049> LED<00:04:09.440> flash<00:04:09.680> is

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
everything is good but LED flash is

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.110 
everything is good but LED flash is
something<00:04:10.190> which<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.459> missing<00:04:10.849> on<00:04:11.000> this

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
something which is missing on this

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.210 
something which is missing on this
device<00:04:11.419> again<00:04:12.049> low<00:04:12.409> light<00:04:12.590> performance<00:04:12.620> of

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
device again low light performance of

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.830 
device again low light performance of
the<00:04:13.310> device<00:04:13.519> is<00:04:13.729> pretty<00:04:13.970> decent<00:04:14.359> but<00:04:14.510> in<00:04:14.599> case

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
the device is pretty decent but in case

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.170 
the device is pretty decent but in case
you<00:04:14.959> would<00:04:15.079> like<00:04:15.139> to<00:04:15.500> use<00:04:15.739> LED<00:04:16.280> flash<00:04:16.609> for<00:04:16.880> some

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
you would like to use LED flash for some

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.699 
you would like to use LED flash for some
of<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.510> scenarios<00:04:18.109> in<00:04:18.229> which<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.470> are<00:04:18.590> taking

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
of the scenarios in which you are taking

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.949 
of the scenarios in which you are taking
photos<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.340> dark<00:04:19.669> environment<00:04:20.299> then<00:04:20.720> in<00:04:20.840> that

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
photos of dark environment then in that

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.170 
photos of dark environment then in that
case<00:04:21.199> it<00:04:21.349> helps<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:21.949> you<00:04:22.669> do<00:04:22.820> not<00:04:22.970> have

device second weakest point of this

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.550 
device second weakest point of this
device<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:28.550> that<00:04:28.729> no<00:04:29.300> front<00:04:29.630> camera<00:04:29.960> there<00:04:30.440> is

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
device is that no front camera there is

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.230 
device is that no front camera there is

another weak weak point for this device

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.610 
another weak weak point for this device
so<00:04:34.849> you<00:04:34.909> cannot<00:04:35.389> do<00:04:35.630> video<00:04:35.930> call<00:04:36.229> very

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
so you cannot do video call very

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.420 
so you cannot do video call very
properly<00:04:37.010> on<00:04:37.219> this<00:04:37.370> device<00:04:37.610> again<00:04:37.909> you<00:04:38.060> can

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
camera the video call experience will

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.570 
camera the video call experience will
not<00:04:45.270> be<00:04:45.420> that<00:04:45.570> great<00:04:45.900> so<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.190> going<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.490> be

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
not be that great so this is going to be

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.060 
not be that great so this is going to be
the<00:04:47.670> second<00:04:47.970> weak<00:04:48.150> point<00:04:48.450> of<00:04:48.600> Lumia<00:04:49.410> 630<00:04:49.830> that

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.400 
the second weak point of Lumia 630 that
is<00:04:50.220> it<00:04:50.580> does<00:04:50.760> not<00:04:50.790> have<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:51.180> front<00:04:51.480> camera<00:04:51.750> the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
is it does not have a front camera the

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.220 
is it does not have a front camera the
third<00:04:52.620> weakest<00:04:52.980> point<00:04:53.220> of<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.460> Lumia<00:04:54.120> 630<00:04:54.960> is

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
third weakest point of the Lumia 630 is

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.580 
third weakest point of the Lumia 630 is
the<00:04:55.530> cost<00:04:56.360> cost<00:04:57.360> minimization<00:04:57.870> which<00:04:58.410> they

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
the cost cost minimization which they

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.010 
the cost cost minimization which they
have<00:04:58.770> actually<00:04:59.100> done<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.430> cost<00:05:00.020> effective

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
have actually done the cost effective

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.090 
have actually done the cost effective
measures<00:05:01.320> which<00:05:01.470> they<00:05:01.620> have<00:05:01.770> done<00:05:01.950> to

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
measures which they have done to

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.530 
measures which they have done to
actually<00:05:02.400> make<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.730> phone<00:05:02.970> cheaper<00:05:03.360> for

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
actually make this phone cheaper for

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.020 
actually make this phone cheaper for
them<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.870> make<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.320> for<00:05:05.070> this<00:05:05.250> they<00:05:05.520> have<00:05:05.550> done

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
them to make and for this they have done

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.550 
them to make and for this they have done
is<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.210> they<00:05:06.660> have<00:05:06.810> removed<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.230> camera

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
is that they have removed the camera

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.380 
is that they have removed the camera
shutter<00:05:07.740> key<00:05:07.950> and<00:05:08.130> they<00:05:08.670> have<00:05:08.910> actually

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
shutter key and they have actually

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.000 
shutter key and they have actually
removed<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.840> touch<00:05:10.020> capacitive<00:05:10.440> cut<00:05:10.620> key

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
removed the touch capacitive cut key

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.560 
removed the touch capacitive cut key
which<00:05:11.250> were<00:05:11.400> there<00:05:11.580> on<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.880> body<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.480> the

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
which were there on the body of the

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.360 
which were there on the body of the
phone<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:12.930> now<00:05:13.320> there<00:05:13.620> is<00:05:13.650> in<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.040> display

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
phone and now there is in the display

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.190 
phone and now there is in the display
I'm<00:05:14.580> not<00:05:15.030> against<00:05:15.450> the<00:05:15.570> touch<00:05:15.720> capacitive

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
I'm not against the touch capacitive

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.680 
I'm not against the touch capacitive
keys<00:05:16.440> which<00:05:16.680> are<00:05:16.890> within<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.760> display<00:05:18.090> but

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
keys which are within the display but

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.960 
keys which are within the display but
again<00:05:18.930> they<00:05:19.500> does<00:05:19.890> take<00:05:20.220> some<00:05:20.460> part<00:05:20.640> of<00:05:20.760> screen

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
again they does take some part of screen

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.340 
again they does take some part of screen
revolution<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.540> effective<00:05:21.900> resolution<00:05:22.020> in

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
revolution the effective resolution in

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.290 
revolution the effective resolution in
the<00:05:22.440> device<00:05:22.650> is<00:05:22.830> effective<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.490> again<00:05:24.150> the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
the device is effective and again the

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.540 
the device is effective and again the
bezel<00:05:24.600> is<00:05:24.690> not<00:05:25.050> thin<00:05:25.590> over<00:05:25.980> here<00:05:26.160> even<00:05:26.430> after

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
bezel is not thin over here even after

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.090 
bezel is not thin over here even after
this<00:05:26.880> so<00:05:27.420> the<00:05:27.540> bezel<00:05:27.840> is<00:05:28.020> again<00:05:28.440> kind<00:05:28.650> of<00:05:28.860> thick

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
this so the bezel is again kind of thick

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.510 
this so the bezel is again kind of thick
even<00:05:29.250> with<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.790> kind<00:05:30.060> of<00:05:31.070> scenario<00:05:32.070> when<00:05:32.400> we

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
even with this kind of scenario when we

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.980 
even with this kind of scenario when we
have<00:05:32.700> touch<00:05:32.850> capacitive<00:05:33.240> button<00:05:33.480> so<00:05:33.630> if<00:05:33.840> the

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
have touch capacitive button so if the

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.450 
have touch capacitive button so if the
bezel<00:05:34.290> was<00:05:34.470> thinner<00:05:34.740> then<00:05:34.980> I<00:05:35.160> would<00:05:35.340> have

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
bezel was thinner then I would have

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.130 
bezel was thinner then I would have
expected<00:05:36.180> this<00:05:36.330> phone<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:36.750> be<00:05:36.840> much<00:05:36.990> better

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
expected this phone to be much better

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.080 
expected this phone to be much better
and<00:05:37.470> again<00:05:37.890> this<00:05:38.310> is<00:05:38.460> something<00:05:38.610> which<00:05:38.910> I

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
and again this is something which I

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.300 
and again this is something which I
count<00:05:39.690> as<00:05:39.810> a<00:05:39.900> weakest<00:05:40.260> point<00:05:40.470> this<00:05:40.950> one<00:05:41.160> in

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
count as a weakest point this one in

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.580 
count as a weakest point this one in
this<00:05:41.430> one<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:41.640> would<00:05:41.850> count<00:05:42.150> as<00:05:42.330> one<00:05:42.600> so<00:05:43.080> there

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
this one I would count as one so there

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.110 
this one I would count as one so there
are<00:05:43.680> three<00:05:43.950> weak<00:05:44.160> points<00:05:44.550> I<00:05:44.640> would<00:05:44.700> like<00:05:44.820> to

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
are three weak points I would like to

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.330 
are three weak points I would like to
say<00:05:45.330> for<00:05:45.810> this<00:05:45.990> device<00:05:46.260> and<00:05:46.590> there<00:05:46.920> are<00:05:47.040> five

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
say for this device and there are five

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.820 
say for this device and there are five
strong<00:05:47.670> point<00:05:47.940> for<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.240> lumia<00:05:48.540> 630<00:05:48.780> so<00:05:49.590> make

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
strong point for the lumia 630 so make

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.120 
strong point for the lumia 630 so make
sure<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.730> decide<00:05:51.540> based<00:05:52.410> on<00:05:52.560> these<00:05:52.800> points

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
sure you decide based on these points

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.310 
sure you decide based on these points
whenever<00:05:53.700> you<00:05:54.000> decide<00:05:54.390> to<00:05:54.600> buy<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:54.810> Nokia
