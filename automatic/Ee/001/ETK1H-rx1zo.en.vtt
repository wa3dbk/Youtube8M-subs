bit<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:31.380> fact<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.800> guess<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.580> know<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:32.940> too

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
bit more fact I guess you know not too

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.300 
bit more fact I guess you know not too
much<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.450> see<00:01:33.659> businesses<00:01:34.159> it's<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
much all see businesses it's the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.860 
much all see businesses it's the
evidence<00:01:35.550> I've<00:01:36.000> seen<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:36.330> over<00:01:36.420> power<00:01:36.750> in

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
evidence I've seen all over power in

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.510 
evidence I've seen all over power in
their<00:01:37.050> own<00:01:37.080> delay<00:01:37.590> although<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> string

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
their own delay although or the string

their own delay although or the string
bean<00:01:38.790> radio<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.570> I've<00:01:40.470> been<00:01:40.800> drinking

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
bean radio so I've been drinking

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.230 
bean radio so I've been drinking
first<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.750> delay<00:01:43.380> time<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.240> instead

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
first of all the delay time so instead

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.899 
first of all the delay time so instead
of<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.570> from<00:01:45.780> 20<00:01:46.470> milliseconds<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.460> 7

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
of going from 20 milliseconds to 7

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.840 
of going from 20 milliseconds to 7
seconds<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.510> now<00:01:48.810> goes<00:01:49.170> from<00:01:49.590> around<00:01:50.549> 200

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
seconds it now goes from around 200

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.890 
seconds it now goes from around 200
milliseconds<00:01:51.690> object<00:01:52.250> 875<00:01:53.250> seconds<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
milliseconds object 875 seconds in the

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.490 
milliseconds object 875 seconds in the
mid<00:01:55.080> position<00:01:55.860> around<00:01:57.409> 389<00:01:58.700> and<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:01.080> feedback

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
mid position around 389 and the feedback

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.430 
mid position around 389 and the feedback
we<00:02:02.400> also<00:02:02.520> narrow<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.330> down<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:04.049> bit

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
we also narrow that down a bit

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.039 
we also narrow that down a bit
so<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.159> doesn't<00:02:05.369> go<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:06.200> go<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.350> hundred<00:02:07.849> it

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
so it doesn't go to go to a hundred it

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.009 
so it doesn't go to go to a hundred it
takes<00:02:10.049> like<00:02:10.319> waters<00:02:10.709> around<00:02:11.189> three<00:02:11.459> repeats

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
takes like waters around three repeats

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.920 
takes like waters around three repeats
for<00:02:13.019> four<00:02:13.409> and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:15.269> five<00:02:15.569> apiece

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
for four and then up to like five apiece

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.910 
for four and then up to like five apiece
when<00:02:16.170> its<00:02:16.970> maximum<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.409> only<00:02:19.409> one<00:02:19.590> repeat

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
when its maximum and only one repeat

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.699 
when its maximum and only one repeat
when

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
when

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:35.339 
when
goes<00:02:20.829> all<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.730> way<00:02:21.939> down<00:02:24.239> just<00:02:25.239> right<00:02:34.349> it's

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
goes all the way down just right it's

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.670 
goes all the way down just right it's
just<00:02:35.439> like<00:02:36.000> Taylor's<00:02:37.000> office<00:02:37.150> oh<00:02:37.719> yeah<00:02:37.959> right

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
just like Taylor's office oh yeah right

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:50.449 
just like Taylor's office oh yeah right
Stan<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:46.650> four<00:02:47.650> or<00:02:47.799> five<00:02:47.829> repeats<00:02:48.400> take<00:02:49.139> this

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
Stan and four or five repeats take this

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.170 
Stan and four or five repeats take this
it's<00:02:51.459> uh<00:02:52.620> it's<00:02:53.620> not<00:02:53.889> over<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.340> ish<00:02:54.489> it's<00:02:54.849> just

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
it's uh it's not over the ish it's just

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.420 
it's uh it's not over the ish it's just
what<00:02:55.419> you<00:02:55.569> get<00:02:55.750> for<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.169> somehow<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.159> breathe

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
what you get for that somehow to breathe

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.340 
what you get for that somehow to breathe
as<00:02:57.639> well<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.909> know<00:02:58.000> yeah<00:02:59.340> perfect
