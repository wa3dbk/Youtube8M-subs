00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
 It 's been a long time since I really seriously reviewed it 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.580
 pr 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.660
 Though it is super huge going sap of so-called camera bag 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.830
 If it turns around, it is this kind of usual rucksack to a rather big type 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.180
 I see 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:26.560
 First of all, the structure inside is completely different as an overwhelming difference 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.980
 It looks like this for the price divided into upper and lower two like this 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.849
 Six ne box technique 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:36.230
 This parting can of course be removed 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:41.059
 It's common in the travel bag because it and can be removed spot 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:45.320
 Also who you have can joke to be something also put underwear or below that inner 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.739
 Of course you have the same structure, but it doesn't open like this 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.970
 you know 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.050
 The opposite is open quite well 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:56.670
 There was an insole and it was like this. It was divided into six. 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.180
 Does not leak to everyone we entered Well and Ru This is was able to remove remains this 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.920
 Horror 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.820
 Surely it is about 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:09.220
 I will look older sister like a you are giving away beer something in that baseball field 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:13.250
 Well then this middle way key and entrance partition are also divided into upper and lower manga comics this 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:17.630
 The divider can be removed 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.720
 It looks like Doraemon's pocket, and if you put back the zipper outside 1 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.370
 Can be used as individual rucksacks 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:31.670
 Where to put this tripod with a distinctly different length and weight 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:33.240
 It is here the individual most bottom outer part of the bag and remove the Peron Te magic 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.259
 Butt is quite open 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.420
 It's a sturdy pocket, and it's coming out under one piece 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:47.130
 It plunged one place at the cheek of this under pocket and lock the feet 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.939
 There is a part to lock the version urgently here too, so I will close it and put it outside 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.979
 That's right 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.260
 Oh, I wanted to carry this tripod on my back rather than winning as a yacht bag 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.760
 By 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.320

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.000
