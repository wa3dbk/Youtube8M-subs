00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
way I wouldn't turn them and it makes me

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.829 
way I wouldn't turn them and it makes me
play<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> little<00:00:20.460> differently<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.210> I'm<00:00:21.599> wide

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
play a little differently so I'm wide

want<00:02:13.049> this<00:02:13.139> time<00:02:13.379> TomTom<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.069> sound<00:02:14.249> like

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
want this time TomTom to sound like

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.960 
want this time TomTom to sound like
and<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.480> want<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.750> one<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.930> go<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.489> sampled

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.790 
and I want this one to go and I sampled
that<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.810> when<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:18.959> trigger<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.530> I'd<00:02:19.680> be

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
that and so when I trigger that I'd be

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.910 
that and so when I trigger that I'd be
playing<00:02:19.980> did<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.400> did<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:21.810> me<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.410> sample

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
playing did you did you of me a sample

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.559 
playing did you did you of me a sample
of<00:02:22.980> my<00:02:23.130> voice<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:23.910> break<00:02:24.120> down<00:02:24.150> my

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
of my voice and you can break down my

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.290 
of my voice and you can break down my
setup<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.349> basic<00:02:25.800> four<00:02:26.069> drum<00:02:26.310> setup<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:27.000> what

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
setup to a basic four drum setup of what

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.059 
setup to a basic four drum setup of what
I<00:02:27.630> started<00:02:28.080> with<00:02:28.200> three<00:02:28.410> drums<00:02:28.680> actually

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
I started with three drums actually

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.910 
I started with three drums actually
snare<00:02:29.610> drum<00:02:29.849> TomTom<00:02:30.450> bass<00:02:30.720> drum<00:02:31.020> hi-hat<00:02:31.440> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
snare drum TomTom bass drum hi-hat and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.920 
snare drum TomTom bass drum hi-hat and
maybe<00:02:32.489> add<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.849> floor<00:02:33.120> Tom<00:02:33.390> over<00:02:33.630> there<00:02:33.750> that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
maybe add a floor Tom over there that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.890 
maybe add a floor Tom over there that
was<00:02:34.050> my<00:02:34.170> next<00:02:34.819> optional<00:02:35.819> extra<00:02:36.209> but<00:02:36.630> really

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
was my next optional extra but really

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.630 
was my next optional extra but really
everything<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.440> do<00:02:37.500> can<00:02:37.769> be<00:02:37.920> broken<00:02:38.099> down<00:02:38.310> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
everything I do can be broken down to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.820 
everything I do can be broken down to
that<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.420> could<00:02:39.630> happily<00:02:39.930> play<00:02:40.170> all<00:02:40.380> day<00:02:40.560> on

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
that and I could happily play all day on

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.770 
that and I could happily play all day on
any<00:02:41.010> kind<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.370> music<00:02:41.700> with<00:02:41.940> those<00:02:42.209> four<00:02:42.480> drums

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
any kind of music with those four drums

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.839 
any kind of music with those four drums
the<00:02:43.380> difference<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:44.010> tonality<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:44.760> have

the difference of tonality is we have

conversationally<00:02:50.730> because<00:02:51.120> they<00:02:51.660> follow<00:02:51.930> the

another electronic trigger in the middle

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.960 
another electronic trigger in the middle
of<00:03:28.590> my<00:03:28.709> acoustic<00:03:29.160> drums<00:03:29.430> there<00:03:29.700> are<00:03:29.790> foot

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
of my acoustic drums there are foot

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.699 
of my acoustic drums there are foot
triggers<00:03:30.299> for<00:03:30.569> electronic<00:03:31.140> samples<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.680> I

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
triggers for electronic samples that I

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.130 
triggers for electronic samples that I
set<00:03:32.040> off<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:33.390> for<00:03:33.660> even<00:03:33.870> from<00:03:34.019> the

set off and and for even from the
electronic<00:03:34.650> head<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.799> can<00:03:34.980> reach<00:03:35.130> lots<00:03:35.489> of

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
electronic head I can reach lots of

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.250 
electronic head I can reach lots of
acoustic<00:03:36.120> stuff<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.630> can<00:03:36.810> get<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.109> a<00:03:37.140> real

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
acoustic stuff so I can get to a real

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.949 
acoustic stuff so I can get to a real
snare<00:03:37.709> drum<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.100> real<00:03:38.549> TomTom<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.239> real

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
snare drum a real TomTom and real

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.770 
snare drum a real TomTom and real
cymbals<00:03:40.440> because<00:03:40.650> as<00:03:41.310> fun<00:03:41.819> as<00:03:42.000> electronic

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
cymbals because as fun as electronic

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.780 
cymbals because as fun as electronic
drums<00:03:43.200> are<00:03:43.380> as<00:03:43.590> much<00:03:43.709> versatility<00:03:44.370> as<00:03:44.639> they

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
drums are as much versatility as they

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.699 
drums are as much versatility as they
have<00:03:45.000> now<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.780> surface<00:03:46.079> even<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.440> quite

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
have now and the surface even is quite

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.650 
have now and the surface even is quite
nice<00:03:46.889> to<00:03:47.069> play<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.459> but<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.030> can<00:03:48.180> never<00:03:48.389> have

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
nice to play on but it can never have

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.199 
nice to play on but it can never have
the<00:03:48.690> dynamics<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.590> moving<00:03:49.980> air<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.970> real

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
the dynamics of moving air that real

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.270 
the dynamics of moving air that real
drums<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.690> cymbals<00:03:52.019> can<00:03:52.170> have<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.980> it's<00:03:53.160> the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
drums and cymbals can have so it's the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.860 
drums and cymbals can have so it's the
combination<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:54.060> them<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.420> gives<00:03:54.600> me<00:03:54.750> the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
combination of them that gives me the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.890 
combination of them that gives me the
dynamism<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.799> acoustic<00:03:56.700> drums<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.209> then<00:03:57.750> the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
dynamism of acoustic drums and then the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.160 
dynamism of acoustic drums and then the
rich<00:03:58.109> avoid<00:03:58.739> virtual<00:03:59.579> Orchestra<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.420> sounds

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
rich avoid virtual Orchestra of sounds

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.259 
rich avoid virtual Orchestra of sounds
that<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.470> electronic<00:04:02.280> drums<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.730> offer<00:04:02.910> so

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
that the electronic drums can offer so

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.140 
that the electronic drums can offer so
each<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.840> them<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.079> tool<00:04:04.639> as<00:04:05.639> part<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
each of them is a tool as part of the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.479 
each of them is a tool as part of the
sound<00:04:06.420> palette<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:07.350> be<00:04:07.440> applied<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:08.040> do<00:04:08.340> the
