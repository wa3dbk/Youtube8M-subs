00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.040
 atomic 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.120
 today I'm going to talk about games 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.190
 video 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.660
 it's here 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.160
 video games when I think about it that makes 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.120
 part all our childhood I do not know 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.710
 you but me when I was little 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.790
 I abuse and often video games from 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.320
 blow my parents were doing me often 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.360
 limit using a small timer that 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:38.800
 sounded after an hour who plays who 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:39.879
 does not have my heart beats but hey it does not 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.720
 do not walk all the time 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.430
 take people for idiots and 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.660
 especially not his parents so I'm 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.980
 often ended when I'm abusing it 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.059
 their kind my father confiscate me the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.140
 joysticks to be sure I'm not playing 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.409
 more then there you go get 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:01:01.390
 until I find them not this 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:01:02.890
 that he himself has to handle them when 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.210
 I was little I was super naive is 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.470
 quite happy I was thoroughly in 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.850
 the world of video games and drawings 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.720
 animated for example when I was 6 years old 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.760
 I thought that ninja turtles 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.110
 really existed but really then I 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.110
 wanted to share my food with them 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.640
 and I gave food in the United States 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.400
 already well donatello it's a four 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.050
 wheels wrong otherwise I also remember to 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.690
 the time of the game boy and the sega 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.860
 megadrive 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.970
 thank you generally you are I was taking 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.740
 often the most proud because time 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.090
 do not take really healthy and suddenly you 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.540
 blow in like a big pig for 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.540
 clean them 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.510
 and ben no it was just a pedestrian 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.890
 game otherwise I also remember that 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.160
 I was too lazy to put away my games 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.690
 outdoors 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.250
 So I'm all in the football 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.060
 first box that I found and after 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.230
 when you're looking for a specific game it's 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.670
 not very obvious to find him and 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.840
 problem is that it's already hard and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.340
 every game launch you find yourself 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.880
 in your console has taken to hope that the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.880
 game starts correctly 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.319
 in fact if a game that always made me 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.330
 laugh it's a game on nintendo ds that 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.450
 simulates a virtual pet 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.769
 they called it ok netanyahu 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.180
 the idea and I find that you pass when 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.880
 even for a bowl it was talking a dog 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:40.010
 virtual screen a console with the sword 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:40.010
 ladies did not validate it 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.900
 you imagine if it goes on soon 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.130
 will be able to see virtual girls for 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.910
 chips them repressed and cdd 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.410
 I was not missing it's delirium 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.670
 speaking of delirium I know 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.440
 when he plays some video games they 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.610
 become super violent but really 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:17.850
 not feel like they're playing their life 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:22.920
 the basil marca fucking fucking whore 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.359
 of pressure usually when you speak 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.370
 of video games there is live the clichÃ© of 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.510
 nolife arcades gamer you know those 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.040
 who abuse video games to the point of 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.510
 to leave their real life it's true that 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.329
 it's fucking you guys me I'm you 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.639

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:43.920
 the eye and that's yes my only friend she 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.060
 the problem with pgc memories that 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.739
 it is so said he that you in hand 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.190
 who are deeply committed to 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.150
 How old 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.150

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.340
 hopeless 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.870
 believe me I also remember when 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.430
 I was in fifth I knew 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.390
 better the cheat codes of gtr than 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.340
 Pythagore's theorem 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.540
 is still serious air of a 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.050
 left air down right or left 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:24.190
 badoit mole and I'm sure I'm not 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.720
 the only one there is something you already have 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.530
 maybe had to notice if you play the 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.790
 online video game 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.230
 when a guy meets you 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.670
 brand who play video games often 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.990
 it gets big but when comes the 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.410
 kind of da the potato kg and that's 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:40.140
 since those of his mother you see said 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:48.580

 new jurors certainly call you 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.440
 how true it is funny I 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.580
 finds that video games do not need to 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.160
 to abuse that remains a way of 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.210
 leisure fun entertainment there 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.600
