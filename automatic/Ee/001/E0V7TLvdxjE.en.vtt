00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.460
 Is all right with you? 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.470
 today I'll show you the functions 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.019
 the automatic cameras 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.479
 it is in this case here we are 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.130
 showing our camera particularly 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:34.280
 but it's the following 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.160
 these functions exist almost in 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.670
 all existing cameras 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.030
 in the market since a compact a cyber 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.980
 shot with a semi professional would be a 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.109
 3 has four and is is the cameras 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.350
 semi-professionals and professionals 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:59.449
 there are also automatic systems here 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.030
 aoki here take a look at some three 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.540
 system functions is two systems 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.950
 which are widely used 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.530
 Usually, you buy the camera. 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.710
 photographic still not have the domain 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.100
 then you are usually advised to 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.719
 to use these two systems here 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.659
 which is a system 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:26.950
 fully automatic such child then 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:30.159
 here you can see it already on days 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.280
 here is automatic or if you are 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.200
 camera that will do everything for you 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.869
 logical that there are some advantages and 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.659
 Disadvantages I jumped here you do not have 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.549
 absolute control over nothing that 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.799
 Camera controls 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.590
 she thinks the flash should be used him 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.569
 already going to raise the camera flash the iso 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.849
 is also automatic as those that 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.909
 situation you do not have an iso control 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:57.009
 and iso is particularly a 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.619
 important detail if you want 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.770
 quality in your photograph then the 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.500
 the next judgment so that you know it is 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.619
 in relation to quality, the lower the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.140
 The better is the final quality of your 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.209
 I zoomed in because 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.489
 less previously collected as in the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.010
 films once we had what 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.260
 less grain and what digital is not 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.959
 different if you use a lot of 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.700
 then it begins to appear what the 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.829
 noises in the photo then 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.560
 always use more 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:32.019
 low since in the total automatic system 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.260
 here it is possible you see it 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.849
 he is going to elect the iso touch the flash 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.859
 You will also get married and live 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.900
 situation is dim it will already 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.720
 automatically flash the flash for you 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.720
 in relation to speed and also the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.250
 shutter he who will elect to ok let's go 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.370
 see what happens here 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.430
 he already lived here looks 60 speed 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:01.150
 4 opening my fame and an iso 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.859
 Portion this is made the photo by it is 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.290
 which then even the focus was 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:08.440
 will automatically focus on the subject and 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.870
 here is the photograph made now let's 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.359
 put another automatic system and 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.139
 This one is already going to say so you already 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:19.239
 has a little better control already 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:22.910
 before your camera 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:29.240
 the order is that you can elect 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.770
 it's okay to 70 400 euros in court attack 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.930
 with iso 400 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.420
 If I want a lower judgment, do not 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.640
 patio meanwhile the lowest I have 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.930
 best quality in my creation has 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.820
 today it's okay since what happens 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.130
 one of the important things in photography 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.920
 and the photometry is okay 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:54.470
 a priori the photometer is here they have 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.380
 What do you mean? 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.880
 in the program system 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.100
 only you saw that we already 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.020
 we get what has the control of laughter 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.330
 That's a big deal already. 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.740
 the flash drive also I call it 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.660
 if I want 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.700
 If I do not take a picture, how was that? 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.150
 just download the flash it will not 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.160
 detonate the flash light here in case 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.620
 Let's just leave the flash on. 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.290
 I put the iso 100 and we're going to do the 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.370
 photo and already chose 60 with 4 the photometer 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.710
 it's in the middle 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.230
 just make strong is here the result 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:32.180
 of the photo a system p 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:35.600
 the program here now had a system m 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.800
 manual because the manual 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.550
 to iacc if we are going to elect the iso to 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.310
 opening including the speed of ok 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.790
 and here you notice that here would be what 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.700
 the photometer zeroed 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.980
 if I want I can do it I can 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:05:00.830
 think a little less 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:04.880
 Let's see the result of this fault then 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.760
 here you can see the difference of the 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.340
 fully automatic pd system 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.950
 program that is much like similar 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.440
 the fully automatic photo and the 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.500
 manual system you can already notice 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.340
 like I was able to control what I 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.500
 one thing has 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.370
 called color temperature or note 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.770
 that this photo is already there in the part of 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.900
 down the law in the details and 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.430
 appear that yellowish tone is more 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.370
 beautiful most delicious 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.440
 so the photo is already already giving a point 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.180
 aspect is what people 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.300
 I hope you have enjoyed your 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.300
 tips okay and then starts to use the ok
