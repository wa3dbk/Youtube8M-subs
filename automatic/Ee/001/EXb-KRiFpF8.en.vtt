00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and loop it around on top again and you

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.590 
and loop it around on top again and you
get<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.520> crazy<00:02:05.759> little<00:02:06.060> bun<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.509> is

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
of it so I'm going to go through that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.920 
of it so I'm going to go through that
one<00:02:10.020> more<00:02:10.080> time<00:02:10.170> I'm<00:02:11.450> doing<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.569> slowly<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
one more time I'm doing it slowly to

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.790 
one more time I'm doing it slowly to
