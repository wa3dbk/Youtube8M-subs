a<00:01:52.320> fifth<00:01:52.649> base<00:01:52.920> 2<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.460> fourth<00:01:53.729> base<00:01:53.939> is

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
a fifth base 2 so this fourth base is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.819 
a fifth base 2 so this fourth base is
going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> go<00:01:54.390> down<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.200> fifth<00:01:55.470> base<00:01:55.649> has

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
going to go down but that fifth base has

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.249 
going to go down but that fifth base has
just<00:01:56.009> gotten<00:01:56.189> up<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> running<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.259> shutter

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
just gotten up and running and shutter

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.539 
just gotten up and running and shutter
definitely<00:01:58.710> taking<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> lead<00:01:59.310> here

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
definitely taking a lead here

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.219 
definitely taking a lead here
economically<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.299> he<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.600> protect<00:02:00.990> his

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
economically if he can protect his

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.450 
economically if he can protect his
secondaries<00:02:01.710> though<00:02:01.860> because<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.219> doesn't

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
secondaries though because it doesn't

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.800 
secondaries though because it doesn't
look<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.579> he's<00:02:02.880> able<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.270> protect<00:02:03.540> them<00:02:03.689> at

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
look like he's able to protect them at

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.720 
look like he's able to protect them at
the<00:02:03.899> moment

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
the moment

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.340 
the moment
shy<00:02:05.730> and<00:02:05.910> pushing<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.360> with<00:02:06.540> tanks<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
shy and pushing out with tanks and and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.320 
shy and pushing out with tanks and and
the<00:02:10.550> confrontation<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.730> then<00:02:11.880> ended<00:02:12.240> up

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the confrontation just then ended up

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.070 
the confrontation just then ended up
being<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.530> wash<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:14.400> um<00:02:14.690> shutter<00:02:15.690> was<00:02:15.840> able<00:02:16.020> to

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
being a wash but um shutter was able to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.570 
being a wash but um shutter was able to
take<00:02:16.200> down<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.770> commencer<00:02:17.190> now<00:02:17.460> if

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
take down that the commencer now if

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.100 
take down that the commencer now if
shrine<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.030> moving<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.630> other<00:02:18.750> command

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
shrine is moving for that other command

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.949 
shrine is moving for that other command
center<00:02:19.320> too<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:20.030> those<00:02:21.030> rice<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.840> to

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
center too and those rice going and to

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.260 
center too and those rice going and to
pick<00:02:22.110> off<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.380> tank<00:02:22.680> right<00:02:23.340> move<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.120> race

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
pick off that tank right move the race

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.240 
pick off that tank right move the race
are<00:02:24.660> picking<00:02:25.080> off<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.320> glass<00:02:25.530> those<00:02:25.860> those

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
are picking off the glass those those

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.650 
are picking off the glass those those
forces<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.850> undefended<00:02:27.209> from<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.570> air

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
forces are undefended from the air

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.330 
forces are undefended from the air
another<00:02:27.930> glass<00:02:28.170> coming<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.950> COMSAT

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
another glass coming in but the COMSAT

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.850 
another glass coming in but the COMSAT
is<00:02:29.490> gone<00:02:29.730> now<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.660> those<00:02:31.170> tanks<00:02:31.590> are<00:02:31.650> going<00:02:31.800> to

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
is gone now and those tanks are going to

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.699 
is gone now and those tanks are going to
be<00:02:31.920> able<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.130> hold<00:02:32.220> off<00:02:32.430> those<00:02:32.640> glass<00:02:32.940> now<00:02:33.209> so

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
be able to hold off those glass now so

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.780 
be able to hold off those glass now so
this<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:34.740> not<00:02:35.010> looking<00:02:35.130> good<00:02:35.310> for<00:02:35.459> shutter

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
this is not looking good for shutter

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.310 
this is not looking good for shutter
because<00:02:36.060> he's<00:02:36.180> spent<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> lot<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.750> money<00:02:36.989> on

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
because he's spent a lot of money on

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.229 
because he's spent a lot of money on
those<00:02:37.500> command<00:02:37.830> centers<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.520> get<00:02:38.670> more<00:02:38.820> bases

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
those command centers to get more bases

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.150 
those command centers to get more bases
and<00:02:39.390> now<00:02:39.780> shutter<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.290> basically<00:02:40.770> destroying

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
and now shutter is basically destroying

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.380 
and now shutter is basically destroying
them<00:02:41.340> those<00:02:41.520> rates<00:02:41.790> are<00:02:41.940> coming<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.270> very

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
them those rates are coming in very

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.530 
them those rates are coming in very
handy<00:02:42.630> after<00:02:42.900> all<00:02:43.670> tanks<00:02:44.670> mine's<00:02:45.000> going<00:02:45.300> down

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
handy after all tanks mine's going down

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.670 
handy after all tanks mine's going down
lines<00:02:45.810> going<00:02:46.020> down<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.530> proved

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
lines going down this can be proved

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.160 
lines going down this can be proved
again<00:02:46.980> oh<00:02:47.160> shit<00:02:47.790> okay<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.300> bonds<00:02:48.900> only<00:02:49.050> took

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
again oh shit okay the bonds only took

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.590 
again oh shit okay the bonds only took
out<00:02:49.350> one<00:02:49.500> tank<00:02:49.850> he<00:02:50.850> managed<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.120> destroy<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
out one tank he managed to destroy the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.780 
out one tank he managed to destroy the
other<00:02:51.720> mines<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.140> one<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.470> good<00:02:52.620> oh<00:02:52.860> shit

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.930 
off those tanks so sure doing a very
good<00:02:58.650> job<00:02:58.770> running<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.459> those<00:02:59.610> vultures

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
good job running in those vultures

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.490 
good job running in those vultures
that's<00:03:00.330> all<00:03:00.450> he<00:03:00.540> had<00:03:00.690> was<00:03:00.720> vultures<00:03:01.230> didn't

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
that's all he had was vultures didn't

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.650 
that's all he had was vultures didn't
have<00:03:01.620> any<00:03:01.739> tanks<00:03:02.100> around<00:03:02.340> very<00:03:02.970> few<00:03:03.209> tanks<00:03:03.450> on

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
have any tanks around very few tanks on

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.090 
have any tanks around very few tanks on
shorter<00:03:03.930> side<00:03:04.110> doing<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.739> very<00:03:04.890> good<00:03:04.980> job

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100

shorter side doing a very good job
running<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.610> those<00:03:05.700> vultures<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.180> basically

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
running in those vultures and basically

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.990 
running in those vultures and basically
sacrificing<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.470> vultures<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.640> tanks

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
sacrificing the vultures for the tanks

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.520 
sacrificing the vultures for the tanks
and<00:03:09.150> that's<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.450> very<00:03:09.720> good<00:03:09.780> trade-off<00:03:10.170> when

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
and that's a very good trade-off when

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.039 
and that's a very good trade-off when
you're<00:03:10.680> about<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:11.010> lose<00:03:11.160> your<00:03:11.220> secondary

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
you're about to lose your secondary

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.970 
you're about to lose your secondary
finally<00:03:13.049> shy<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.320> putting<00:03:13.500> up<00:03:13.590> another<00:03:13.799> base

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
finally shy and putting up another base

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.900 
finally shy and putting up another base
in<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.280> top<00:03:14.430> top<00:03:15.239> part<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.510> map<00:03:15.690> around<00:03:15.959> 11

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
in the top top part of the map around 11

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.479 
in the top top part of the map around 11
so<00:03:17.910> as<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:19.590> said<00:03:19.739> shutter<00:03:19.950> doing<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.250> very<00:03:20.370> good

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
so as I said shutter doing a very good

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.180 
so as I said shutter doing a very good
job<00:03:21.049> using<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.140> vultures<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.650> he<00:03:22.709> had<00:03:22.890> I

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
job using the vultures that he had I

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.560 
job using the vultures that he had I
wonder<00:03:23.760> why<00:03:23.910> he<00:03:23.940> doesn't<00:03:24.239> have<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.450> many

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
wonder why he doesn't have that many

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.220 
wonder why he doesn't have that many
tanks<00:03:25.019> out<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.170> haven't<00:03:25.380> seen<00:03:25.560> them<00:03:25.650> in<00:03:25.739> tanks

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
tanks out I haven't seen them in tanks

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.470 
tanks out I haven't seen them in tanks
perhaps<00:03:28.230> he's<00:03:28.410> behind<00:03:28.680> economic<00:03:29.220> no<00:03:30.180> he's<00:03:30.360> not

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
perhaps he's behind economic no he's not

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.170 
perhaps he's behind economic no he's not
behind<00:03:30.720> economically<00:03:31.670> we'll<00:03:32.670> see<00:03:32.850> where<00:03:33.030> he's

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
behind economically we'll see where he's

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.880 
behind economically we'll see where he's
using<00:03:33.450> his<00:03:33.540> resources<00:03:33.840> i<00:03:34.170> guess<00:03:34.320> i<00:03:34.560> guess

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
using his resources i guess i guess

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.870 
using his resources i guess i guess
maybe<00:03:35.100> he<00:03:35.489> doesn't<00:03:35.610> have<00:03:35.790> enough<00:03:37.430> gas<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.700> tank

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
maybe he doesn't have enough gas in tank

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.410 
maybe he doesn't have enough gas in tank
to<00:03:39.060> make<00:03:39.209> tanks<00:03:39.480> or<00:03:39.690> something<00:03:41.030> but<00:03:42.030> uh<00:03:42.060> i

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
to make tanks or something but uh i

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.630 
to make tanks or something but uh i
guess<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.959> problem<00:03:43.140> with<00:03:43.410> with<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:43.890> also<00:03:44.340> is

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
guess the problem with with that also is

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.660 
guess the problem with with that also is
he<00:03:45.500> shines<00:03:46.500> continues<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.519> air

he shines continues to have that air

about twice the mineral intake that
shutter<00:06:24.570> does<00:06:24.780> right<00:06:24.990> now<00:06:25.199> so<00:06:25.740> even<00:06:26.130> though<00:06:26.190> it

every other base on the map right now he

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.830 
every other base on the map right now he
is<00:06:59.280> building<00:06:59.550> a<00:06:59.789> command<00:07:00.180> center<00:07:00.240> at<00:07:00.510> the<00:07:00.539> last

he's<00:07:05.820> got<00:07:06.000> Forces<00:07:06.539> camp<00:07:06.750> there<00:07:07.020> so<00:07:07.500> shorter

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
he's got Forces camp there so shorter

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.110 
he's got Forces camp there so shorter
can't<00:07:08.039> even<00:07:08.250> try<00:07:08.430> and<00:07:08.490> take<00:07:08.669> that<00:07:08.699> because

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
can't even try and take that because

can't even try and take that because
he's<00:07:09.270> got<00:07:09.449> a<00:07:09.479> force<00:07:09.750> of<00:07:09.870> tanks<00:07:10.199> just<00:07:10.320> chillin

now oh that's a brilliant place one of

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.050 
now oh that's a brilliant place one of
those<00:07:19.889> tanks<00:07:20.190> there<00:07:20.340> right<00:07:20.490> by<00:07:20.610> that<00:07:20.789> little

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 
those tanks there right by that little

those tanks there right by that little
that<00:07:21.750> little<00:07:22.430> choke<00:07:23.430> point<00:07:23.700> so<00:07:24.630> they're

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
that little choke point so they're

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.300 
that little choke point so they're
pretty<00:07:25.169> well<00:07:25.289> protected<00:07:25.410> by<00:07:25.800> the<00:07:25.860> landmass

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
pretty well protected by the landmass

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.450 
this time the Rays are going to be able

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.360 
this time the Rays are going to be able
to<00:07:30.570> pick<00:07:30.660> off<00:07:30.840> those<00:07:31.050> tanks<00:07:31.440> planning<00:07:32.160> lines

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
to pick off those tanks planning lines

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.680 
to pick off those tanks planning lines
down<00:07:32.639> it's<00:07:32.880> not<00:07:33.000> going<00:07:33.090> to<00:07:33.180> do<00:07:33.300> a<00:07:33.330> whole<00:07:33.510> lot<00:07:33.539> of

down it's not going to do a whole lot of

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.240 
down it's not going to do a whole lot of
good<00:07:33.900> I<00:07:34.020> don't<00:07:34.169> know<00:07:34.229> why<00:07:34.380> shine<00:07:34.919> hasn't

gotten some kind of detection though for
those<00:07:36.690> mines<00:07:37.220> but<00:07:38.220> in<00:07:38.340> a<00:07:38.430> case<00:07:38.690> shudders<00:07:39.690> just

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 
those mines but in a case shudders just

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.469 
those mines but in a case shudders just
could<00:07:40.080> been<00:07:40.260> completely<00:07:40.800> boxed<00:07:41.070> in<00:07:41.370> and<00:07:41.639> it's

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 
could been completely boxed in and it's

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.839 
could been completely boxed in and it's
only<00:07:42.660> a<00:07:42.810> matter<00:07:42.930> of<00:07:43.050> time<00:07:43.139> he<00:07:43.470> realizes<00:07:43.860> it<00:07:44.160> and

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:44.849 
only a matter of time he realizes it and

only a matter of time he realizes it and
finally<00:07:45.090> GG's<00:07:45.539> he<00:07:45.750> has<00:07:45.840> no<00:07:46.020> forces<00:07:46.470> left<00:07:46.710> and

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:47.419 
finally GG's he has no forces left and

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:50.390 
finally GG's he has no forces left and
