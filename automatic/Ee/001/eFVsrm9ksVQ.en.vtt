00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.540
 Talk to people, welcome to another one. 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.090
 Video fox channel takes the design is more 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.660
 a video of our lady of cro n 3 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.699
 and it's this video here guys you go 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.070
 learn how to navigate here through the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.230
 shortcut keys and mouse ok 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.390
 the day before the previous video you 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.130
 they saw how it works - the options 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.380
 that we are - it was a very big video 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.700
 but this one will actually be a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.860
 very short video 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.750
 Okay, I'll kill you with it's simple. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.340
 It really is simple for those who already have 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.219
 some experience with one with the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.829
 3d software or March 3 for example I 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.280
 I think you should be able to work in a 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.010
 good here in the network noc 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.690
 Good, I'm leaving the game mode and we're going 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570
 over there 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.100
 good to navigate first as I am 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.080
 doing up and down here 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.330
 simply you will click on the scrotum 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.260
 mouse that ball of val z is just click 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.380
 in it you will drag if you want 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.570
 said it would be a kind of pan am ac 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.420
 in the fall onwards would be the scroll of the mouse 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.560
 It's scrolling the mouse scroll. We have 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.720
 one zum zum're giving forward as 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.939
 back is with the left mouse button to 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.590
 Here you have this kind of orbits 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.920
 it would be an organ that we could 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.320
 orbiting here to the sides is to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.320
 any side that with the button 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.829
 right mouse button 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.610
 Do you have this kind of orbit okay? 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.659
 Good now for example if I want to get 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.840
 there in the front but the mouse is very slow 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:07.259
 I can also navigate the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:09.660
 Shortcut wsb the ws only the key 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.590
 that we use in video games and just 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.030
 move around 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.140
 here at the front is no different 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.270
 what I'm doing here to sail well 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.990
 I'm on the client side by pressing 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.240
 simply ow and using the orbit nÃ© 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.140
 orbit here with the right button of the 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.209
 Mouse 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.830
 so you can make it right there a lot 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:37.510
 accuracy when moving around 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:39.930
 ok its very easy here with the com 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.900
 You have here to go back, you can. 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.040
 come here with owe to the sides 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.080
 with a and b 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:53.050
 ok it 's really very simple 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.400
 good, but one of you is probably 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.440
 It's going to be at this speed here. It's okay. 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.550
 slow to get on the other side of the map 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.640
 so here we have this speedy cab 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.690
 we have to have these three speeds 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.500
 pre-determined here by cre andino 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:15.010
 that this point 1 is very slow and 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.880
 with the speed in which it was and 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.140
 o 10 can see that this group is 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.049
 very fast 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.980
 he is really very fast then the 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.320
 people come in places with speed 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.230
 very large it increases both the 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.040
 speed w 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:41.200
 s will b as well as the mouse 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:44.620
 Okay, everything stays much faster then it is 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.200
 good to come back here for 1 if you want 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.180
 for example speed of 5 but has no 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.880
 speed 5 here you can come here 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.310
 in speed edit 5 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.310
 It's there you have to speed 5 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:03.070
 if you want the speed of 3 too 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.540
 which puts three you can move 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:10.450
 at the speed of 3 right then you 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.820
 can see that it really is very simple 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.609
 even the navigation here navigation 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:20.590
 by the shortcut keys on the high end in 3 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.690
 then as I said in the previous video and 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.039
 if you want more customer videos 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.850

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.000
 click on I liked this 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.310
 on the touch channel and so I'll know that 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.210
 Are you enjoying the videos and I'm going
