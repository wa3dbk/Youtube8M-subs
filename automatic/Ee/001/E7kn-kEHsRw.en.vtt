00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.029
 it's all later and now one of the key 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:06.480
 moments of our broadcast here on the right hand 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.820
 from me on the frontal area appears 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.659
 human intellect 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.279
 Anatoly Vasserman 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.069
 Anatoly I understand that you 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:15.839
 Today, just shocked as it is now accepted 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.110
 say yes 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.420
 hello dear that verifiers 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.420
 Russia 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.249
 in Moscow nowadays alive remind 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.330
 last summer 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.810
 and again discuss the danger of forest and 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.310
 peat fires 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.190
 Today in Russia, almost 100 large 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.640
 more than two hundred forest fires 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.050
 thousand hectares 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.329
 At first, I had almost 14 of them. 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.990
 thousand more in April there were 11 times more 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.760
 than on the same days last year on 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.010
 140 times more space 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.810
 in 2010, 200 were affected by wildfires 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.450
 settlements 19 regions of the federation 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.170
 burned more than three thousand houses 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.670
 62 people died total damage amounted to 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.670
 over 12 billion rubles 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.260
 specialists of many departments and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.950
 public organizations 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.969
 back in February warned about 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.119
 The dangers of the causes are many more from the past 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.680
 years in areas already held fires 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.009
 left a lot of dry dead wood and I 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.850
 no one had time to remove from many sites 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.500
 forest fields and rivers there are no clearly defined 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.520
 the hosts that is for and protection and bringing in 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.570
 order nobody answers 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.659
 from last yearâ€™s experience in the forest code 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.470
 Many amendments have been made. 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.320
 restore the old system of forest protection 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.080
 but there is no money in the budget 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.330
 on new measures and work in the nose 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.930
 there is simply no domain that word for 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.520
 wrecking the whole overalls saloon 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.729
 structures of our society could not 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.720
 survive the fire prevention 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.700
 but there is in my opinion a more serious reason 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.680
 even in the suburbs where the housing market 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.399
 well-developed fire victims out of ten 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:02.909
 preferred name monetary compensation 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.979
 to buy a new home 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.999
 from construction ordering smart account 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.670
 new buildings on the old place and themselves 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.190
 authorities are interested in 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.620
 new construction at least because in 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.769
 in many regions, fire victims sometimes 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.569
 spend money received for 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.590
 burnt movable property not for 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.709
 new purchases they purposefully something 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.669
 who even on alcohol 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.250
 at least modern services 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.930
 at the Cathedral of passion for freebies but to 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.370
 for the time being she was assured not only 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.220
 difficult to feed healthy and more 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.330
 and the opportunity to earn 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.830
 actually run now set 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.090
 possible directions 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.310
 our earnings are small in the main 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.209
 trade will give bull raw materials 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.439
 the only hope for improvement 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.439
 welfare remains compensation 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.429
 if the misfortune is not many hunt him 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.899
 on the shoulders do not establish a normal economy 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:59.239
 the whole country will burn the pen itself 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.929
 I hope next time I will tell you something
