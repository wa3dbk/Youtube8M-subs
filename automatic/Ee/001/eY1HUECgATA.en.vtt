00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.220
 international for what it concerns 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.720
 the ice cream luck we decided with 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.180
 organization in agreement with one 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.740
 deviation let's select 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.510
 most important locations for both 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.340
 Today 's gaming market 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.530
 traditional but also especially for 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.270
 the future one for what is to come 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.510
 in these countries we are present or 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.100
 through our commercial branches 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.350
 or through nenÃ¨ partners 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.990
 independent, however, always persecuted 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.330
 of our sales team will give 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.710
 manager because today maybe one of the 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.020
 Our company's most important resources 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.470
 of the commercial strength they give is known 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.229
 that while producing different and famous 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.780
 tastes particularly appreciated by children 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.350
 we want to describe what they are 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.960
 now entered the history of ice cream e 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.410
 instead the news of 2013 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.420
 after children children have always been the 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.960
 customer rate of tooth Prince 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.360
 battery 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.900
 our great successes surely 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.600
 we can remember the cookies that 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.560
 has become one of the most tastes today 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.080
 appreciated in ice cream a gelato a 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.630
 cookie troina man variegated by one 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.910
 chocolate sauce and crunchy biscuits 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.670
 as well as what is a cream 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.100
 spreadable with cocoa and hazelnuts had it 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.030
 same results because it has become 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.040
 today one 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.340
 right missing enabled is an ice cream not 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.290
 ice cream that is the consistency and the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.050
 creaminess of an ice cream 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.610
 even if it is not really true 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.330
 compensated from the point of view of 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.830
 composition 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.080
 we also did this year 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.810
 white version so scalable tear 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.459
 white that is called that other then 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.290
 in our shop window 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.110
 the idea is precisely that of pushing 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.810
 consumer to draw the finger with the 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.690
 finger the ice cream to then request in 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.970
 different way also to propose from the point 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.670
 view of my ice cream makers and this year 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.660
 our big news is 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.610
 particularly suitable for the world i 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.620
 children because we made an agreement 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.840
 collaboration with hello kitty that today 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.239
 I think it's the heart of a brand one of the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.150
 strong winds in terms of notoriety on 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.060
 market that for the first time enters 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.250
 ice cream shop and will help I'm sure 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.319
 also to increase the traits where 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.870
 series characters because it is a brand 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.330
 which attracts and attracts very strongly 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.760
 especially children also girls e 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.590
 not just because I believe it has a lot 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.840
 to read mom too 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.180
 the passion for this because it was 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.540
 given what he would say to a mother 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.090
 relatively to the genuineness of the ice cream 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.470
 for children to let them know that not 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.440
 put one of the very great 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.470
 ice cream lovers 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.870
 and this passion for ice cream brings us 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.880
 to be almost maniacs that paranoid 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.530
 as for quality and 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.540
 quality regarding ice cream 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.550
 however it refers to naturalness 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.290
 and visibility of the ingredients 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.780
 we have worked on research and development and 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.150
 polytechnique control of gates of 20 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.710
 people who continually do research 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.920
 to identify the best ingredients 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.210
 products to offer to our customers 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.280
 for what concerns our ways 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.380
 we absolutely don't use aromas 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.360
 Artificial dyes has always been the 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.640
 our say main direction if 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.280
 this through the highest quality 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.450
 mothers can rest easy because 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.940
 in the evening we have that product 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.170
 absolutely genuine and natural the 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.300
 passion that will distinguish us from that 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.370
 however always ask for products 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.889
 best ice cream products 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.270
 submit our 10 to the 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.529
 village there are moments 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.229
 animation of cat and own ipad 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:46.569
 wants to describe from a preview of 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.459
 these social initiatives true love and 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.679
 tell too many things because I wish that 

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:52.959
 there was a little more surprises for how much 

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:55.149
 was the great public expected 

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:58.389
 this wonderful location I can say that 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:05:00.549
 we have created various various situations 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.589
 activities to involve the most 

00:05:00.549 --> 00:05:04.899
 possible for children to let in more 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:07.029
 possible in the world of ice cream 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:10.029
 then the laboratories where they can 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:13.839
 however get your hands pasta dei 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:17.349
 games we ask for kraft to get them 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:19.860
 we say to respond better to this a 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:23.280
 this activity therefore does not 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.169
 talk too much about what in detail 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.060
 but we will certainly do 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.029
 but it is an event where the child is 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.629
 central and where it will surely have way of 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.629
 have fun
