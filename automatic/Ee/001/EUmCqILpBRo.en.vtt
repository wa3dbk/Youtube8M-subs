00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.220
 suddenly dozens of tents and the side of the houses stood at intersections 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.369
 and roundabouts in innocence 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.710
 the tents appear to be part of a playful campaign by the youth panel 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.960
 municipality oorschot the housing shortage among young people in our country is high and there 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.140
 a municipality should start doing something about it in the short term while becoming 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.089
 getting closer to the real thing 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:33.210
 Wilders will come to the door for the role of the young so that the rise was 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.880
 big 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.700
 the word is not over yet 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.050
 his son has that 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.280
 can become a number of people in the short term and then in the long term 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.790
 it has to be added that a lot of houses are added, so there the work is 300 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.640
 many new youth housing 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.460
 And all that for an affordable price to resolve the prices on the not 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.680
 so minor 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.130
 we want to become a catalan the first reaction, especially from the city council 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.350
 was by his 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.330
 which indicates that the problem is seriously unknown 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
 we are also currently preparing a policy vision 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.460
 the public housing ebbelaar 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.160
 so one that mills that these people 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.720
 they have invested in this promotion 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.550
 the intention is that in January 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.130
 but that is never discussed in the city council 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.740
 so then you will have youth housing the problem in my opinion came from one 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.330
 give more prominent place to get thanks 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.960
 partly thanks to this promotion 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.980
 their response but it's nice to hear though if they want something else 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.780
 be developed 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.510
 the storm rabo project quickly is fair the neighborhood short-term some 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.470
 when it becomes complex for young people we want it to happen in the long term 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.040
 It is thought that smokers 30 to 40 years look ahead to the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.540
 city ​​council to good intentions 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.740
 Of course he knows him for a while standing in our country, the share of Ajax is there 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.210
 then they may all be what we were but what makes the latter whole 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.360
 par to build some projects and major blows 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.700
 it is now time to be the official part for everything again 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.799
 want to break down especially if they leave it neat
