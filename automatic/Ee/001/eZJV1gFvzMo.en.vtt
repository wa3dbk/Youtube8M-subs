if that happens to turn the thing on
nope<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.739> guess<00:03:41.919> not<00:03:42.370> where's<00:03:42.579> about<00:03:42.819> this<00:03:43.030> the

nope I guess not where's about this the

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:50.009 
nope I guess not where's about this the
power<00:03:43.419> button<00:03:43.750> it's<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.049> side<00:03:48.870> perhaps<00:03:49.870> I

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
power button it's on the side perhaps I

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.680
