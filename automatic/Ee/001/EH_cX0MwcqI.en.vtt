00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.580
 let's do fourth root from there 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:15.640
 let's represent and it's 0 + 1 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.840
 if it is left is zero 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.840
 and vÃ©lez 1 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.289
 the module is obviously 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.829
 one 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:35.640
 and the argument is the tangent arc of 1 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:39.260
 match 0 which is 90 degrees worth 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.210
 then the number in polar form 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.210
 64 of 190 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.790
 the fourth root module of one is one 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:59.980
 and the angles that come out are 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:07.060
 90 0 x 360 match 4 90 + 1 for 360 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:12.150
 match 4 90 + 2 for 360 match 4 and 90 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.150
 + 3 x 360 match 4 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.640
 90 match 4 is 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.820
 22 5 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.680
 90 360 match 4 is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.700
 102 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.700
 as 5 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.640
 92 x 360 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.960
 match 4 is 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.360
 200 25 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.800
 and 90 plus 3 by 360 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.760
 match 4 equals 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.890
 292 5 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.890
 how it represents those four numbers 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.740
 this is the real line 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.850
 and these are the complex numbers 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.580
 to put the one here 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.330
 1 - 1 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.650
 - yes 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.650
 I'm going to put the angles 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.440
 this would be 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.780
 90 180 270 and 360 will be again 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:55.140
 the number 1 22 5 would be 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.140
 and 2.5 more or less here 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.209
 all these points of the circle have a 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.209
 module of 1 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.220
 the 1 112 5 would be 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.220
 more or less here 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.810
 the 200 25 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.230
 more or less here 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.680
 1 292.5 would be 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.200
 more or less here 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.040
 this figure that they form if they were 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.950
 perfectly drawn would be a square 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.129
 all four are the same 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.129
 distance 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.090
 because the distance between them is 90 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.090
 degrees 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.600
 it's like how is the fourth root the 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.460
 angle that they form is a quarter of 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.460
 90 which is 22 5
