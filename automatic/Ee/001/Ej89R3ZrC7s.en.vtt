00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.300

 real that they took the bullets and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.000
 they added different circuits 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.949
 electronic devices to make it functional 2 in

 creator of resident evil who some 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.850
 He said he would opt before losing the 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.960
 head to see resident evil 4 in 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.000
 playstation 23 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.830
 the first saga of video games 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.110
 Pokemon is the invention of a company 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.820
 Japanese called game freak where the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.619
 person must fulfill the mission of 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.710
 train all the pokemon to 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.780
 meet various missions for questions 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.550
 economic game freak was seen in the 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.080
 need to license the product and 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.869
 they went to bands and to engage 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.880
 negotiations the company rejected the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.759
 offer then considered that it was not a 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.979
 finally profitable business nintendo 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:37.360
 he acquired them and showed him band and what 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.369
 wrong they were 4 mario part 8 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.220
 it was removed and modified in the kingdom 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.679
 united- because the character k 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.570
 he said the spastic spastic word is 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.710
 a word they use in the UK- 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.929
 to offend the disabled 5 the 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.840
 initial town of pokemon gold and silver it 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:59.940
 originally called silent hill is a 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.940
 obvious reference to the silent hill game 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.399
 during the development of google guard 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.580
 the Cyclops had visible pains 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.530
 7 the beautiful visual style sisa island 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.150
 originally it was going to be like that of 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.370
 Donkey Kong Country from Super Nintendo 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.860
 but miyamoto did not agree 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.750
 so I redesign the elements of art 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.280
 originals so that they looked as if 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.989
 were drawn with crayons 8 during 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.610
 the development of angry birds 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.709
 rovio had the idea that the enemies 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.459
 pigs were the epidemic 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.060
 swine flu 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.450

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.599
 9 the first appearance of mario was in 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.269
 donkey kong but it was not called mario 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.060

 video 9 in the done key game with 64 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.209
 the weapons were originally pistols 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.579
 but they were redesigned so that the 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.609
 game had a qualification suitable for 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.609
 children 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.500
 bread fox who makes the voice of for 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.030

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.440

 in playstation all starz battle royal the 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.740
 boss polygon man was actually the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.470
 1995 original playstation mascot 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.769
 was supposed to demonstrate the power of 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.790
 the ps1 but was excluded shortly after 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.060
 that the console was announced 12 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.130
 in mario paper of nintendo 64 week and 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.160
 he keeps his diary in a secret basement 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.710
 under his house in there is a page where 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.600

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.280

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.500
 own adventure 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.490
 this is a reference to the wish mansion 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.760
 that at that time was in development 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.590
 perishes in the green pokemon the music of 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.320
 town the band was changed in the 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.780
 North American version because 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.420
 it had a very high tone and it was said that 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.120
 it caused headaches there are also rumors 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.190
 saying that there were Japanese children who 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.900
 they committed suicide after hearing this 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:10.770
 song 14 the original name of mario 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.690
 bros was not mario nor jungmann 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.129
 when miyamoto created mario he called 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.840
 'Mr. video 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.940
 fifteen 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.130
 samu without you are going to be characters 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.380
 unlockable in the wing version of 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.150
 Marvel Ultimate Alliance the 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.889
 developers showed it to 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.340
 nintendo but in the version of 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:34.940
 playstation 2 nintendo was enraged 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:37.700
 and demanded its removal 16 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.760
 it was thought to create a counterpart of ph 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.610
 mario 64 call for wild pich and 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:48.170
 but this proposal was finally 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:50.420
 rejected by miyamoto 17 the design of 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.150
 mario was originally a zip line 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.160
 red with blue shirt but nintendo 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.720
 exchange colors before 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.630
