00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.190 
quit just minimum days is about three -
it<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.439> doesn't<00:01:34.710> work<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.159> -<00:01:36.200> but

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it really just doesn't work with - but

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.140 
it really just doesn't work with - but
this<00:01:37.320> guarantees<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.430> win<00:01:38.610> pretty<00:01:38.880> much

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
this guarantees you to win pretty much

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.600 
this guarantees you to win pretty much
every<00:01:39.659> time<00:01:39.869> there's<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.710> few<00:01:40.950> unlucky<00:01:41.310> teams

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
every time there's a few unlucky teams

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120 
every time there's a few unlucky teams
will<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.600> way<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.899> offset<00:01:43.350> when<00:01:44.040> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
will just the way that offset when you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
will just the way that offset when you
just<00:01:44.280> start<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> match<00:01:44.880> they're<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.869> at

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
just start the match they're just not at

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.510 
just start the match they're just not at
a<00:01:46.049> decent<00:01:46.290> position<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.340> doesn't

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
a decent position so it just doesn't

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.539 
a decent position so it just doesn't
work<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.119> well

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.609 

but<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.479> should<00:01:51.659> definitely<00:01:51.810> help<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:54.619> now

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
but this should definitely help you now

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
but this should definitely help you now

because it's helped me a lot and just

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.619 
because it's helped me a lot and just
like<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> days<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.970> want<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> reroll

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
like the days that you want to reroll

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.420 
like the days that you want to reroll
and<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> only<00:02:12.989> need<00:02:13.170> two<00:02:13.379> more<00:02:13.410> here<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.340> I

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and see I only need two more here and I

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.740 
and see I only need two more here and I
would<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.610> got<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.910> poker<00:02:15.180> achievement

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
would have got that poker achievement

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.220 
would have got that poker achievement
sadly<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.110> didn't<00:02:16.410> get<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:17.959> it's<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.049> for

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
sadly I didn't get it but it's just for

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.710 
sadly I didn't get it but it's just for
two<00:02:19.410> days<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.860> just<00:02:19.890> doesn't<00:02:20.250> work<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.879> if<00:02:21.209> you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
two days it just doesn't work so if you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.250 
two days it just doesn't work so if you
get<00:02:21.900> lucky

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
get lucky

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.610 
get lucky
which<00:02:22.700> evens<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.819> odds<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:24.150> mean<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:25.079> odds<00:02:25.349> of

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
which evens the odds I mean the odds of

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.490 
which evens the odds I mean the odds of
actually<00:02:25.920> getting<00:02:26.180> five<00:02:27.180> different<00:02:28.049> days

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
actually getting five different days

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.229 
actually getting five different days
five<00:02:29.010> different<00:02:29.190> days<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.700> mean<00:02:29.790> five<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
five different days I mean five are the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.930 
five different days I mean five are the
same<00:02:30.450> days<00:02:30.709> it's<00:02:31.709> very<00:02:31.950> difficult<00:02:32.400> unless<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
same days it's very difficult unless the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.819 
same days it's very difficult unless the
death<00:02:33.150> increases<00:02:33.510> your<00:02:33.810> odds<00:02:33.840> again<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.620> I

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
death increases your odds again and so I

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.430 
death increases your odds again and so I
