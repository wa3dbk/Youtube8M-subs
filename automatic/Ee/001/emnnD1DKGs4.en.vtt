it's at least two to three inches deep

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.990 
it's at least two to three inches deep
now<00:00:43.530> take<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:43.890> styrofoam<00:00:44.070> creation<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
now take your styrofoam creation and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.639 
now take your styrofoam creation and
glue<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> thick<00:00:45.450> foam<00:00:45.660> riser<00:00:45.989> somewhere<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
glue a thick foam riser somewhere on the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.200 
glue a thick foam riser somewhere on the
side<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.219> push<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> whole<00:00:47.789> thing<00:00:48.000> into<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
side then push the whole thing into the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.630 
side then push the whole thing into the
sand<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.750> stands<00:00:49.050> upright<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.219> sprinkle

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
sand so it stands upright if we sprinkle

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160 
sand so it stands upright if we sprinkle
a<00:00:50.700> bunch<00:00:50.879> more<00:00:50.969> sand<00:00:51.360> around<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> styrofoam

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
a bunch more sand around the styrofoam

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.840 
a bunch more sand around the styrofoam
mold<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.680> should<00:00:52.890> hold<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> firmly<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.610> place

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
mold it should hold it firmly in place

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.610 
mold it should hold it firmly in place
and<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.449> you're<00:00:54.629> adding<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.020> sand<00:00:55.289> make<00:00:55.500> sure

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and as you're adding the sand make sure

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.110 
and as you're adding the sand make sure
the<00:00:55.739> foam<00:00:55.920> riser<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.399> poking<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the foam riser is poking up out of the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.639 
the foam riser is poking up out of the
center<00:00:57.480> that's<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:58.020> important

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
center that's really important

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.260 
center that's really important
now<00:00:59.190> when<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> sand<00:00:59.699> covers<00:01:00.030> everything

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
now when the sand covers everything

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.610 
now when the sand covers everything
completely<00:01:00.870> give<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> bucket<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> little

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
completely give the bucket a little

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470 
completely give the bucket a little
shake<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.280> level<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.609> out<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.940> fill<00:01:03.120> any<00:01:03.270> gaps

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
shake to level it out and fill any gaps

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.509 
shake to level it out and fill any gaps
around<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> styrofoam<00:01:04.320> underneath<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
around the styrofoam underneath it's a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.679 
around the styrofoam underneath it's a
good<00:01:05.670> idea<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> little<00:01:06.330> spray<00:01:06.659> bottle

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
good idea to have a little spray bottle

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.660 
good idea to have a little spray bottle
handy<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.560> spritz<00:01:07.950> some<00:01:08.100> water<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
handy so you can spritz some water and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.550 
handy so you can spritz some water and
moisten<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> top<00:01:09.330> layer<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> sand<00:01:10.020> this

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
moisten the top layer of the sand this

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.660 
moisten the top layer of the sand this
way<00:01:10.770> you'll<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:10.979> able<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.280> build<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.549> volcano

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
way you'll be able to build a volcano

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
way you'll be able to build a volcano
around<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> foam<00:01:12.659> riser<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.229> act<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> funnel

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
around the foam riser to act as a funnel

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.070 
around the foam riser to act as a funnel
leading<00:01:14.310> down<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> styrofoam<00:01:15.150> now<00:01:15.810> here's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
leading down to the styrofoam now here's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.170 
leading down to the styrofoam now here's
where<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.290> magic<00:01:16.740> begins<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.159> happen<00:01:17.549> when<00:01:18.060> we

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
where the magic begins to happen when we

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.910 
where the magic begins to happen when we
pour<00:01:18.450> molten<00:01:18.659> aluminum<00:01:19.229> into<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.439> makeshift

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
pour molten aluminum into the makeshift

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.890 
pour molten aluminum into the makeshift
funnel<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> foam<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> bottom<00:01:21.299> vaporizes

10 minutes and the metal should be hard

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.870 
10 minutes and the metal should be hard
enough<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.890> grip<00:01:35.159> onto<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> pair<00:01:35.850> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
enough to grip onto it with a pair of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
enough to grip onto it with a pair of
pliers<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.869> pull<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.170> up<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> sand<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
pliers so pull it up out of the sand and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.800 
pliers so pull it up out of the sand and
you'll<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.549> styrofoam<00:01:38.820> creation<00:01:39.630> is

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
you'll see your styrofoam creation is

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.780 
you'll see your styrofoam creation is
just<00:01:39.840> transformed<00:01:40.680> into<00:01:40.890> solid<00:01:41.340> aluminum

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
just transformed into solid aluminum

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.300 
just transformed into solid aluminum
almost<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.450> magic<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.860> want<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> make<00:01:44.189> it

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
almost like magic if you want to make it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.770 
almost like magic if you want to make it
look<00:01:44.430> nicer<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.210> clean<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> rough

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
look nicer you can clean up the rough

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
look nicer you can clean up the rough
edges<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> file<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.860> some<00:01:46.979> sandpaper<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
edges with a file and some sandpaper and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.819 
edges with a file and some sandpaper and
that's<00:01:48.149> how<00:01:48.360> simple<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> make<00:01:49.229> anything

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that's how simple it is to make anything

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.460 
that's how simple it is to make anything
you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.460> into<00:01:50.820> solid<00:01:51.210> metal<00:01:51.509> by<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
you can think of into solid metal by the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.780 
you can think of into solid metal by the
way<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.799> also<00:01:52.920> works<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.369> housing

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
way this also works with housing

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.149

sword<00:01:56.490> into<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> sand<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.479> ten<00:01:57.659> minutes

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
sword into the sand and ten minutes

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.899 
sword into the sand and ten minutes
later<00:01:58.110> pulled<00:01:58.469> out<00:01:58.590> an<00:01:58.680> identical<00:01:59.189> copy<00:01:59.399> cast

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
later pulled out an identical copy cast

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.510 
later pulled out an identical copy cast

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
