00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
here and this one was ip55 and 57 so

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.670 
here and this one was ip55 and 57 so
resistant<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.609> dust<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.510> water<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.260> this

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
resistant to dust and water and this

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.009 
resistant to dust and water and this
tablet<00:03:14.129> has<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.489> same<00:03:14.730> feature<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.930> is

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
here we go so let's say think of a girl

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.390 
here we go so let's say think of a girl
in<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.819> bathroom<00:03:29.819> or<00:03:30.299> whatever<00:03:31.079> on<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.220> beach

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400

in the bathroom or whatever on the beach
and<00:03:32.940> if<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:34.250> happens<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.549> it's<00:03:35.730> no<00:03:35.940> problem<00:03:36.359> at

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
and if it happens so it's no problem at

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.220 
and if it happens so it's no problem at
all<00:03:36.630> with<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:37.019> one<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.769> it's<00:03:38.299> up<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.359> 30

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
all with this one so it's up to 30

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.979 
all with this one so it's up to 30
minutes<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:41.190> death<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.700> one<00:03:42.090> meter<00:03:42.329> no

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
minutes in a death of one meter no

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.259 
minutes in a death of one meter no
problem<00:03:43.380> at<00:03:43.500> all<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.010> we<00:03:44.190> tried<00:03:44.579> it<00:03:44.760> over<00:03:45.030> here

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
problem at all and we tried it over here

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.569 
problem at all and we tried it over here
it's<00:03:45.480> indeed<00:03:46.230> no<00:03:46.500> problem<00:03:46.919> you<00:03:47.130> can<00:03:47.160> use<00:03:47.549> it

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
it's indeed no problem you can use it

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.180 
it's indeed no problem you can use it
afterwards<00:03:48.180> not<00:03:48.750> underwater<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.889> course

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
afterwards not underwater of course
