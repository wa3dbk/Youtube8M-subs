00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400
 uy 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.840
 hello youtube friends here two that 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.690
 I 'm going to bring them 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.410
 for a good lineup to play at 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.650
 egm 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.160
 well I call myself 5 games who wants 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.160
 add me 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.900
 let's have a moment 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.070
 and well I bring you here the alignment 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.960
 the lighting would have to be 45 1 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.379
 it's a good alignment that my husband 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 perfectly during this season I 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.030
 with the tottenham 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.030
 and here I bring you the tactics 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.440
 we have to play hard we have to try 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.860
 Quick 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.070
 and here in line tactics just attack 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.900
 the attacking midfielders and the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.960
 defenses hold back 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.000
 the advanced tactics are man to 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.750
 man 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.480
 and the offside tactics do not 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.640
 you have to keep it neutral the mentality 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.640
 the speed one touch the pressure to 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 74% 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.960
 now I let you see my team 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.990
 aica 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.680
 for me the most important thing is the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.890
 midfielders as you will see I know I have to 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.490
 a lot all go from 90 there are some 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.740
 that have more than 100 as you see herrera 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.099
 or iniesta 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.130
 and good for what I told you is better 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.810
 have midfielders because they 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.819
 they can play all the portions 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.780
 as much as defense 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.780
 or attackers 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.060
 enough here I do not have very good 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.170
 I only have in Rodriguez 110 dry without 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.580
 defenses I also have few walker 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:41.550
 cavour vertonghen and with care 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.550
 the goalies all pass the hundred 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.390
 and well I say yes that's all thanks 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.050
