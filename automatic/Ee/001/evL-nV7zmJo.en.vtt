 you 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.610
 beauty is the following I had never done 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:23.779
 no event with my subscribers there 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.400
 and today I decided to set up this clan of 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.189
 enrolled to participate in a war 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.189
 nuclear energy, and the following 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.670
 and I played there on facebook, did not I? 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.960
 I have and I released the last video about 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.199
 this khan 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.080
 I was going to mount a clan war bruno clash and there 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.000
 cv 8 will be enrolled 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.860
 first edition cv 8 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.460
 I called the crowd started to arrive. 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.989
 people all by their side and crowded clan 50 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.570
 Guys there and there the next thing yesterday is us 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.309
 We seek war but did not get the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.769
 result until this morning arrived from 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.500
 morning had not turned out not to have libos 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.930
 war has not resulted in any club 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.240
 opponent is the following one we were 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.520
 talking there and we 're there with 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.100
 some partnerships were ominous 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.770
 were there liked liked and we are 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.400
 talking there I listen to this morning and 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.080
 there we had the brilliant idea of 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.700
 trying to marry a war we do the 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.370
 I left this clan that I had 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.590
 created and does not have a secondary field with 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.130
 same name only by changing the flag of the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.740
 plan and then I asked 25 guys from this clan 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.830
 come with me 24 actually right then it would be 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.530
 I'm 24 or younger and I took my 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.080
 main chance account of 9 and then I asked 24 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.480
 cv 8 of those guys that went with me to 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.040
 created from the clan there in the clan stayed there had 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.740
 that you get 9 and there 24 faces if you also v8 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.390
 so the bone liked or did not participate 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.150
 of this war with plants 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.970
 main voices did not have an account 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.190
 but within the expected power 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.799
 balance the clan and participate 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.289
 so there tim and off they got all the 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.940
 my writings in this kan and I went to 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.159
 this other clan with all the others 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.409
 then we split the pan in half 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.200
 forming the two clubs with the same name 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.960
 and then we bolted strategy of power 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.300
 get to 1 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.760
 balance and weight 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.790
 plan to seek war at the same time. 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:34.780
 time and marry to find one with 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:38.110
 other and the result you will see war 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.200
 epic is historical in clash classes never 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.810
 I saw you on youtube on youtube a candinho 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.600
 tuber against another clan of his own then 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.270
 We agreed a war was entered. 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.700
 against inscribed writing and then have the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.310
 youtube if one on each side and there we 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.980
 It's going to be a war that is 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.930
 The idea is a war made up of 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.710
 bruno clash with bruno clash writings 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.480
 and look here crazy in my see the result 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.100
 She's going to be a party. Imagine all 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.810
 funds are friends everyone likes the same 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.120
 thing is the following will have coverage 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.710
 Overall the two sides so I would go back 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.080
 this clan but I'm going to record the videos 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.600
 of this clan of sicÃ¡n there are also the 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.890
 also the victories over the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.810
 best attacks 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.830
 So I'll have full coverage. I promised. 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.600
 to him that I'm going to do a cover 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.940
 very crazy, worthy of all my 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.870
 written and they all enjoyed one 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.480
 channel partnership will be top and the pink 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.700
 littÃ­n the gas do not help me in this 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.500
 All logistic then will have them video 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.530
 also on their channel are also 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.050
 covering it too and I think it was soon there 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.370
 propose to clear this barrier 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.700
 break this barrier breaking the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.770
 paradigm of not being able to combine 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.410
 in certain many people talk is 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.110
 combined as in war but never a 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.570
 Youtube channel has placed 50 homes that 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.120
 follow he broke half made two plans 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.170
 and made beat with each other this is 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.420
 historic 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.430
 and then it will be very crazy result then 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.880
 I hope you like it, I see now 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.860
 video showing the two clans a few 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.010
 guys who are going to participate 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.990
 valuing the subscribers there showing the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.780
 clans showing how we go to war 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.730
 and it's very cool you'll see I think 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.280
 which will get very crazy and from 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.810
 tomorrow will be total war of subscribers 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.390
 Classic bruno subscribers bruno 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.700
 clash plus a total harmony is very 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.110
 crazy and a new thing is a new thing 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.300
 on youtube and clash club 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.580
 and from now on we already have this 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.650
 idea that can combine wars and 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.360
 we can do different things 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.280
 just think a little bit just went out a little 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.370
 out of the box there we can 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.050

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.140
 We rode this beauty there
