long<00:02:38.120> time<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.600> build<00:02:39.640> like<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.760> mentioned<00:02:41.180> in

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
long time to build like I mentioned in

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.600 
long time to build like I mentioned in
my<00:02:43.480> genome<00:02:44.480> soar<00:02:44.980> review<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.160> did<00:02:46.400> and
