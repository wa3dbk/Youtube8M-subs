00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
basically it's really simple most you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.240 
basically it's really simple most you
probably<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.260> about<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.770> you've<00:01:10.920> got<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
probably know about it all you've got to

probably know about it all you've got to
do<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.700> press<00:01:12.119> f3<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.340> coordinates<00:01:14.820> will

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
do is press f3 and your coordinates will

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.100 
do is press f3 and your coordinates will
appear<00:01:15.330> which<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.960> X<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> x<00:01:18.110> y&amp;z

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
appear which is the X and the x y&amp;z

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.760 
appear which is the X and the x y&amp;z
which<00:01:20.100> are<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.990> in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> left<00:01:22.350> top<00:01:22.740> corner

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
which are like in the left top corner

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.870 
which are like in the left top corner
you<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.030> them<00:01:25.400> letters<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you know to see all them letters and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.260 
you know to see all them letters and
stuff<00:01:27.270> numbers<00:01:28.549> like<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> second<00:01:30.000> paragraph

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
stuff numbers like the second paragraph

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.640 
stuff numbers like the second paragraph
is<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.759> bit<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> coordinates<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.470> I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
is the bit with the coordinates so if I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.010 
is the bit with the coordinates so if I
go<00:01:34.890> up<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.810> down<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.920> y<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.820> changes<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:40.250> I<00:01:41.250> go

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
go up and down the y one changes if I go

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.560 
go up and down the y one changes if I go
it<00:01:43.020> also<00:01:43.170> says<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.619> west<00:01:44.009> east<00:01:44.460> north<00:01:45.000> south

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it also says like west east north south

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.530 
it also says like west east north south
so<00:01:46.259> right<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:46.560> I'm<00:01:46.710> facing<00:01:47.340> west<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.149> go

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
so right now I'm facing west if I go

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.469 
so right now I'm facing west if I go
west<00:01:48.869> or<00:01:49.399> east<00:01:51.290> my<00:01:52.290> x<00:01:52.979> coordinates<00:01:53.729> change<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
west or east my x coordinates change and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.149 
west or east my x coordinates change and
if<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.110> go<00:01:55.320> north<00:01:55.799> or<00:01:56.329> south<00:01:57.329> my<00:01:58.259> Zed<00:01:58.710> corners

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
if I go north or south my Zed corners

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.389 
if I go north or south my Zed corners
change<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> want<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.020> check<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.649> X<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
change so I want you to check your X and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.179 
change so I want you to check your X and
z<00:02:02.579> coordinates<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.540> why<00:02:03.960> isn't<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:04.590> important

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
z coordinates the why isn't as important

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.920 
z coordinates the why isn't as important
is<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.909> down<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.450> basically

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
stuff you put it in your ender chest and

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.789 
stuff you put it in your ender chest and
then<00:04:02.700> kill<00:04:03.700> yourself<00:04:04.230> respawn<00:04:05.230> in<00:04:05.470> your<00:04:05.620> bed

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
then kill yourself respawn in your bed

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.180 
then kill yourself respawn in your bed
and<00:04:07.109> yeah<00:04:08.109> if<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.379> can't<00:04:08.620> make<00:04:08.829> an<00:04:08.949> end<00:04:09.099> just

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
and yeah if you can't make an end just

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.030 
and yeah if you can't make an end just
or<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:09.760> don't<00:04:10.000> have<00:04:10.090> one<00:04:10.299> with<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:10.720> then<00:04:11.530> yeah

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
or you don't have one with you then yeah

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.309 
or you don't have one with you then yeah
this<00:04:12.669> trick<00:04:13.030> probably<00:04:13.389> won't<00:04:13.569> work<00:04:13.720> then

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
this trick probably won't work then

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.409 
this trick probably won't work then
you're<00:04:14.440> trying<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:14.829> craft<00:04:15.160> one<00:04:15.549> or<00:04:15.849> just<00:04:16.239> have

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
you're trying to craft one or just have

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.300 
you're trying to craft one or just have
one<00:04:16.630> on<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.109> I<00:04:17.320> don't<00:04:17.680> know<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.099> then<00:04:18.190> when

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
one on you I don't know and then when

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.219 
one on you I don't know and then when
you're<00:04:18.489> back<00:04:18.640> at<00:04:18.669> your<00:04:18.849> house<00:04:19.060> just<00:04:19.690> making

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
you're back at your house just making

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.780 
you're back at your house just making
you<00:04:20.409> ender<00:04:20.739> chest

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
you ender chest

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.770 
you ender chest
and<00:04:23.520> when<00:04:24.520> you<00:04:24.640> open<00:04:24.910> it<00:04:25.030> your<00:04:25.180> stuff<00:04:25.450> will<00:04:25.630> be

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
and when you open it your stuff will be

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.410 
and when you open it your stuff will be
in<00:04:25.810> there<00:04:26.140> so<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.890> will<00:04:27.070> die<00:04:27.340> or<00:04:27.550> lose<00:04:27.760> your<00:04:27.970> XP

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
in there so you will die or lose your XP

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.360 
in there so you will die or lose your XP
but<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.290> important<00:04:29.620> most<00:04:29.710> important<00:04:30.190> stuff

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
but the important most important stuff

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.330 
but the important most important stuff
which<00:04:30.520> is<00:04:30.550> just<00:04:30.670> your<00:04:31.210> stuff<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:33.130> most

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
which is just your stuff the most

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.220 
which is just your stuff the most
important<00:04:33.790> thing<00:04:33.970> which<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.360> your<00:04:34.630> stuff<00:04:34.930> will

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
important thing which is your stuff will

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.070 
important thing which is your stuff will
be<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.710> you'll<00:04:36.370> still<00:04:36.580> have<00:04:36.760> it<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:36.970> know<00:04:37.950> so

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
be and you'll still have it you know so

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.470 
be and you'll still have it you know so
yeah<00:04:41.080> of<00:04:41.710> course<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.250> think<00:04:42.580> one<00:04:42.970> more<00:04:43.000> trick

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
yeah of course I think one more trick

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.200 
yeah of course I think one more trick
which<00:04:43.810> is<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.830> if<00:04:45.130> you've<00:04:45.640> made<00:04:45.850> your<00:04:46.030> house

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
which is that if you've made your house

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.880 
which is that if you've made your house
close<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.260> way<00:04:47.440> you<00:04:47.500> like<00:04:47.890> first<00:04:48.250> Pond

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
close the way you like first Pond

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.690 
close the way you like first Pond
usually<00:04:50.890> where<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.190> first<00:04:51.490> spawn<00:04:51.850> is<00:04:52.350> not

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
usually where you first spawn is not

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.000 
usually where you first spawn is not
that<00:04:54.700> mad<00:04:55.000> but<00:04:55.210> it's<00:04:55.360> quite<00:04:55.750> near<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.380> zero

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
that mad but it's quite near to the zero

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.630 
that mad but it's quite near to the zero
coordinates<00:04:57.610> which<00:04:57.790> is<00:04:57.970> X<00:04:58.240> 0<00:04:58.660> and<00:04:58.990> Z<00:04:59.320> zero<00:04:59.680> so

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
coordinates which is X 0 and Z zero so

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.620 
coordinates which is X 0 and Z zero so
it's<00:05:00.790> quite<00:05:01.060> near<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.630> know<00:05:02.310> so<00:05:03.310> um<00:05:03.610> yeah<00:05:04.450> I'm

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
it's quite near you know so um yeah I'm

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.200 
it's quite near you know so um yeah I'm
gonna<00:05:04.780> go<00:05:05.230> there<00:05:05.470> which<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:05.800> this<00:05:06.190> way<00:05:06.520> so<00:05:07.030> what

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
gonna go there which is this way so what

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.520 
gonna go there which is this way so what
you're<00:05:07.360> gonna<00:05:07.510> have<00:05:07.600> to<00:05:07.810> do<00:05:07.960> is<00:05:08.140> you're<00:05:08.320> gonna

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
you're gonna have to do is you're gonna

you're gonna have to do is you're gonna
go<00:05:08.800> all<00:05:09.100> the<00:05:09.220> way<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.370> this<00:05:09.720> zero<00:05:10.720> coordinates

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
go all the way to this zero coordinates

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.220 
go all the way to this zero coordinates
and<00:05:12.390> once<00:05:13.390> you're<00:05:13.570> there<00:05:13.600> I'm<00:05:13.900> not<00:05:14.020> going<00:05:14.170> to

block for example duh just grab like a
lot<00:05:20.020> dirt<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:21.610> what<00:05:21.730> you're<00:05:21.880> gonna<00:05:21.970> do<00:05:22.240> is

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
lot dirt and what you're gonna do is

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.510 
lot dirt and what you're gonna do is
you're<00:05:22.990> gonna<00:05:23.110> start<00:05:23.680> nerd<00:05:23.920> folding<00:05:24.400> no

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
you're gonna start nerd folding no

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.400 
you're gonna start nerd folding no
polling<00:05:24.940> is<00:05:25.030> just<00:05:25.240> jumping<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:25.930> placing<00:05:26.320> a

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
polling is just jumping and placing a

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.680 
polling is just jumping and placing a
block<00:05:26.530> underneath<00:05:26.950> you<00:05:27.250> so<00:05:28.030> start<00:05:28.300> doing<00:05:28.540> this

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
block underneath you so start doing this

fairly high I guess
just<00:05:35.020> stop<00:05:35.920> look<00:05:36.550> around<00:05:36.910> and<00:05:37.270> you<00:05:37.960> should<00:05:38.230> be

just stop look around and you should be

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.020 
just stop look around and you should be
able<00:05:38.440> to<00:05:38.560> see<00:05:38.710> your<00:05:38.860> house<00:05:38.980> I<00:05:39.280> can't<00:05:39.700> see<00:05:39.880> my
