00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
1.3 point to this psych I 1121 and let's

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.310 
1.3 point to this psych I 1121 and let's
go<00:00:06.150> ahead<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.420> get<00:00:06.600> started<00:00:06.799> so<00:00:07.799> um<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:09.320> was

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
go ahead and get started so um I was

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.860 
go ahead and get started so um I was
going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.010> do<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.759> furnace<00:00:12.210> tutorials<00:00:12.660> and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
going to do the furnace tutorials and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.780 
going to do the furnace tutorials and
I've<00:00:13.320> been<00:00:13.530> doing<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.009> lot<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.309> research<00:00:14.759> into

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
I've been doing a lot of research into

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.900 
I've been doing a lot of research into
that<00:00:15.179> arm<00:00:17.090> unfortunately<00:00:18.260> again<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.910> some

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that arm unfortunately again for some

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.140 
that arm unfortunately again for some
most<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.869> my<00:00:22.170> tutorials<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.830> generally<00:00:23.670> use<00:00:23.699> my

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
most of my tutorials I generally use my

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.640 
most of my tutorials I generally use my
own<00:00:24.300> code<00:00:24.630> or<00:00:24.900> standard<00:00:25.859> code<00:00:26.130> um<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.930> for

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
own code or standard code um and I for

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.339 
own code or standard code um and I for
the<00:00:28.769> furnace<00:00:29.039> tutorial<00:00:29.490> I've<00:00:29.970> been<00:00:30.390> having<00:00:31.170> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
the furnace tutorial I've been having to

the furnace tutorial I've been having to
make<00:00:31.500> my<00:00:32.279> own<00:00:32.309> code<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.090> make<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.450> furnaces

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
make my own code to make the furnaces

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.950 
make my own code to make the furnaces
which<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.940> difficult<00:00:36.950> in<00:00:38.090> many<00:00:39.090> ways<00:00:39.600> but

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
which can be difficult in many ways but

currently I'm having a bit of difficulty
with<00:00:42.930> making<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.350> block<00:00:43.590> multi-textured<00:00:44.219> so

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
with making the block multi-textured so

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.190 
with making the block multi-textured so
anyway<00:00:45.989> um<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.620> figured<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:47.789> I've<00:00:48.780> been

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200

anyway um I figured you know I've been
working<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:50.010> two<00:00:50.550> days<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.930> need

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
to get a modern tutorial out there so um

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.260 
to get a modern tutorial out there so um
this<00:00:57.059> will<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:58.129> unfortunately<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> furnace

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
this will not unfortunately be a furnace

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.840 
this will not unfortunately be a furnace
tutorial<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.840> had<00:01:00.960> been<00:01:01.170> hoping<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.770> get<00:01:02.640> one

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
tutorial I had been hoping to get one

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.830 
tutorial I had been hoping to get one
out<00:01:03.030> I'm<00:01:03.270> sorry<00:01:03.870> um<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.909> will<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.299> those<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.630> as

out I'm sorry um I will get those out as

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.750 
out I'm sorry um I will get those out as
soon<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.400> figure<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.560> anyway<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.770> do

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
soon as I figure this out anyway I do

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.270 
soon as I figure this out anyway I do
actually<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.500> still<00:01:14.159> be

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
actually think this will still be

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.149 
actually think this will still be
interesting<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.060> um<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:16.080> went<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.979> can

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
interesting for you um I went in you can

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.859 
interesting for you um I went in you can
see<00:01:17.310> I've<00:01:17.430> already<00:01:17.700> been<00:01:18.060> declaring<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
see I've already been declaring the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
see I've already been declaring the
furnace<00:01:19.200> stuff<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:20.070> i<00:01:20.100> went<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> i<00:01:20.850> set

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
furnace stuff but i went in and i set

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.740 
furnace stuff but i went in and i set
the<00:01:21.180> tutorial<00:01:21.630> block<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:23.420> resistance<00:01:24.420> five

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the tutorial block to resistance five

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.640 
the tutorial block to resistance five
because<00:01:25.320> we'll<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:27.259> doing<00:01:28.259> stuff<00:01:28.380> with

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
because we'll be doing stuff with

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.050 
because we'll be doing stuff with
destroying<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.250> block<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.610> survival<00:01:30.030> mode

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
destroying the block in survival mode

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.640 
destroying the block in survival mode
and<00:01:31.310> i<00:01:32.310> don't<00:01:33.090> want<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> at<00:01:33.479> resistance<00:01:34.200> 25

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
and i don't want it at resistance 25

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.870 
and i don't want it at resistance 25
because<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.100> would<00:01:35.250> take<00:01:35.400> forever<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
because that would take forever to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.330 
because that would take forever to
destroy<00:01:36.320> anyway<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.920> we're<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.280> be

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
destroy anyway what we're going to be

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.200 
destroy anyway what we're going to be
doing<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.700> setting<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.829> block<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:41.970> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
doing is setting up the block so that it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.460 
doing is setting up the block so that it
drops<00:01:42.439> XP<00:01:43.439> when<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.220> break<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.700> um<00:01:45.470> it's

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
drops XP when you break it um it's

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.770 
drops XP when you break it um it's
actually<00:01:46.890> pretty<00:01:47.009> simple<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.570> want

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
actually pretty simple so what we want

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.200 
actually pretty simple so what we want
is<00:01:48.930> public<00:01:49.670> void<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:51.290> block<00:01:52.670> destroyed<00:01:54.229> by

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
is public void on block destroyed by

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.649 
is public void on block destroyed by
claire<00:01:58.159> world<00:01:59.159> world<00:02:00.079> into<00:02:01.079> r1<00:02:01.820> actually<00:02:02.820> into

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
claire world world into r1 actually into

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.249 
claire world world into r1 actually into
x<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.170> y<00:02:05.130> int<00:02:05.549> z<00:02:06.390> int<00:02:07.369> meta<00:02:08.989> we're<00:02:09.989> not<00:02:10.140> going

x and y int z int meta we're not going

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.960 
x and y int z int meta we're not going
to<00:02:10.319> mess<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.770> one<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.430> that's<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
to mess with that one but that's the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.550 
to mess with that one but that's the
cassettes<00:02:12.300> metadata

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
cassettes metadata

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.020 
cassettes metadata
um<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.239> all<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.690> really<00:02:15.870> want<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.530> this

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
um and all you really want to do is this

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.610 
um and all you really want to do is this
obviously<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.569> called<00:02:18.989> when<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.290> block

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
obviously this is called when the block

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.690 
obviously this is called when the block
is<00:02:19.650> destroyed<00:02:20.190> by<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.489> player<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:23.069> what<00:02:23.580> we

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
is destroyed by the player so what we

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.630 
is destroyed by the player so what we
want<00:02:23.849> to<00:02:23.910> do<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:25.560> dot<00:02:26.160> drop<00:02:27.800> XP<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:29.040> block

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
want to do is this dot drop XP on block

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.420 
want to do is this dot drop XP on block
break<00:02:30.680> world<00:02:31.680> X<00:02:32.519> Y<00:02:33.480> C<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.450> believe<00:02:36.720> is

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
break world X Y C and this I believe is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.550 
break world X Y C and this I believe is
the<00:02:38.430> quantity<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.569> we're<00:02:39.989> going<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.230> want<00:02:40.440> to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the quantity that we're going to want to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.460 
the quantity that we're going to want to
drop<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.280> an<00:02:42.239> easy<00:02:42.390> way<00:02:42.630> if<00:02:42.840> you're<00:02:42.959> testing

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
drop and an easy way if you're testing

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.320 
drop and an easy way if you're testing
stuff<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.069> just<00:02:44.280> hover<00:02:44.489> over<00:02:44.880> an<00:02:45.000> eclipse

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
stuff you can just hover over an eclipse

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.850 
stuff you can just hover over an eclipse
and<00:02:45.510> it'll<00:02:45.750> give<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:47.030> data<00:02:48.739> generally<00:02:49.739> it

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
and it'll give you the data generally it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.979 
and it'll give you the data generally it
gives<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:52.010> data<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:55.560> individual<00:02:56.989> I'm

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
gives you data on the individual I'm

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.479 
gives you data on the individual I'm
assuming<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.799> is<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.069> amount<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.370> want

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
assuming this is the amount you want

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.370 
assuming this is the amount you want
dropped<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.330> I'm<00:03:00.690> going<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.900> set<00:03:01.080> this<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.349> a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
dropped so I'm going to set this to a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.850 
dropped so I'm going to set this to a
hundred<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.269> we'll<00:03:03.269> see<00:03:03.450> how<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:03.630> goes

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
hundred and we'll see how that goes

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.300 
hundred and we'll see how that goes
because<00:03:04.860> we<00:03:05.430> all<00:03:05.580> know<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.500> 100<00:03:07.500> XP<00:03:07.739> being

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
because we all know that 100 XP being

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.650 
because we all know that 100 XP being
dropped<00:03:08.519> by<00:03:08.700> single<00:03:09.030> block<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.420> not

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
dropped by single block is not

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.520 
dropped by single block is not
overpowered<00:03:10.319> at<00:03:10.530> all<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:12.110> let<00:03:13.110> me<00:03:13.230> fit<00:03:13.410> this

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
overpowered at all and let me fit this

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.400 
overpowered at all and let me fit this
to<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.830> screen<00:03:14.900> single-player<00:03:15.900> new<00:03:16.620> world

a<00:03:48.480> certain<00:03:48.810> pickaxe<00:03:51.319> because<00:03:52.319> I've<00:03:52.620> gotten

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
a certain pickaxe because I've gotten

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.620 
a certain pickaxe because I've gotten
requests<00:03:53.519> for<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.269> haven't<00:03:54.480> really

placed down the tutorial block and it's

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:09.229 
placed down the tutorial block and it's
not<00:04:02.489> working<00:04:02.850> but<00:04:03.239> oh<00:04:06.829> right<00:04:07.829> old<00:04:08.549> code<00:04:09.000> can<00:04:09.209> be

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
not working but oh right old code can be

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
the ken block's day method look so we

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.390 
the ken block's day method look so we
don't<00:04:14.519> need<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.850> anymore<00:04:15.410> at<00:04:16.410> all<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:18.019> the

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
multi-textured block is working if the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.420 
multi-textured block is working if the
furnace<00:04:32.389> wasn't<00:04:32.960> working<00:04:33.590> for<00:04:33.620> whatever<00:04:34.069> even

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430

annoying okay anyway um we may be
getting<00:04:42.349> our<00:04:42.999> the<00:04:43.999> growth<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.300> block<00:04:45.199> which

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:45.469 
getting our the growth of block which

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:51.119 
getting our the growth of block which
would<00:04:46.340> be<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.759> bit<00:04:46.969> amusing<00:04:48.699> anyway<00:04:49.699> now<00:04:49.999> if<00:04:50.330> we

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
would be a bit amusing anyway now if we

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.230 
would be a bit amusing anyway now if we
place<00:04:52.129> it<00:04:52.159> we<00:04:53.090> won't<00:04:53.330> get<00:04:53.599> the<00:04:53.719> diamond<00:04:54.050> blocks

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
place it we won't get the diamond blocks

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.959 
place it we won't get the diamond blocks
okay<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.569> you<00:04:57.560> can<00:04:57.740> see<00:04:57.889> it<00:04:58.159> just<00:04:58.189> gave<00:04:58.550> us<00:04:58.759> a

okay and you can see it just gave us a

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.480 
okay and you can see it just gave us a
hundred<00:04:59.210> experience<00:04:59.960> swords<00:05:00.229> ah<00:05:00.379> that<00:05:01.340> was<00:05:01.460> a

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
if you just wanted the code you can end

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.420 
if you just wanted the code you can end
now<00:05:21.199> I'm<00:05:21.469> just<00:05:21.710> going<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:22.009> test<00:05:22.250> this<00:05:22.370> the
