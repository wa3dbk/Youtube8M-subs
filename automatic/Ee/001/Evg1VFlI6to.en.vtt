through<00:00:05.970> Jitsu<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.540> think<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:06.960> due<00:00:07.109> to

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
through Jitsu I think that in due to

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.690 
through Jitsu I think that in due to
variation<00:00:07.859> might<00:00:08.010> be<00:00:08.130> better<00:00:08.340> than<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
variation might be better than the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.129 
variation might be better than the
inferno<00:00:09.059> because<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.510> mid-range<00:00:09.780> sore

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
inferno because of the mid-range sore

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.509 
inferno because of the mid-range sore
it's<00:00:10.410> probably<00:00:10.830> good<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.010> punishing<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:13.519> I'm

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
it's probably good for punishing so I'm

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.770 
it's probably good for punishing so I'm
gonna<00:00:14.639> stay<00:00:14.849> with<00:00:14.940> ninjutsu<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.450> see<00:00:15.630> what<00:00:15.750> i

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
gonna stay with ninjutsu and see what i

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.130 
gonna stay with ninjutsu and see what i
can<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.850> inferno<00:00:17.850> seems<00:00:18.240> alright<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.990> it's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
can do inferno seems alright but it's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.840 
can do inferno seems alright but it's
kind<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.380> like<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.920> cheap<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.640> trying
