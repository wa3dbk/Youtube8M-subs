00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
then you can always add more resistance

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.209 
then you can always add more resistance
as<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.190> start<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:01.079> begin<00:01:01.410> I'm<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.100> show

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the next move is cranking with a single

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.179 
the next move is cranking with a single
left<00:01:26.880> he's<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.229> crank<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.070> his

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
left he's going to now crank with his

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.100 
left he's going to now crank with his
left<00:01:31.909> secondly<00:01:32.909> we're<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.360> try<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
left secondly we're going to try the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140 
left secondly we're going to try the
cranking<00:01:34.619> double<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.700> he's<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> have

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
cranking double so he's going to have

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.770 
cranking double so he's going to have
both<00:01:36.329> arms<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.930> at<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> same<00:01:37.409> exact<00:01:37.799> time

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.830 

right<00:01:42.380> lastly<00:01:43.190> is<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.490> split<00:01:43.880> where<00:01:44.690> you

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
right lastly is the split where you

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.460 
right lastly is the split where you
actually<00:01:45.050> go<00:01:45.410> one<00:01:45.890> at<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.130> time

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
actually go one at a time

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.010 
actually go one at a time
wonderful<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.400> then<00:01:49.940> our<00:01:50.270> next<00:01:50.420> movement<00:01:50.750> is

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
wonderful so then our next movement is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.800 
wonderful so then our next movement is
to<00:01:51.260> do<00:01:51.410> everything<00:01:51.770> standing<00:01:52.760> so<00:01:53.510> go<00:01:53.630> ahead

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
to do everything standing so go ahead

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.160 
to do everything standing so go ahead
and<00:01:53.930> stand<00:01:54.140> up<00:01:54.880> position<00:01:55.880> yourself<00:01:56.270> far

and stand up position yourself far

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.300 
and stand up position yourself far
enough<00:01:57.380> from<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.710> crank<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.010> where<00:01:58.190> you're

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
enough from the crank to where you're

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.070 
enough from the crank to where you're
not<00:01:58.400> you<00:01:58.640> know<00:01:58.760> jamming<00:01:59.180> into<00:01:59.330> yourself<00:01:59.869> but

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
not you know jamming into yourself but

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.880 
not you know jamming into yourself but
that<00:02:00.229> you're<00:02:00.440> comfortable<00:02:02.619> slight<00:02:03.619> bend<00:02:03.830> in

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
that you're comfortable slight bend in

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.920 
that you're comfortable slight bend in
the<00:02:04.010> elbow<00:02:04.369> when<00:02:04.550> your<00:02:04.700> hand<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.210> far<00:02:05.420> away<00:02:05.540> and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
the elbow when your hand is far away and

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.169 
the elbow when your hand is far away and
now<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.619> can<00:02:06.830> do<00:02:06.920> all<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.310> same<00:02:07.550> movements<00:02:08.090> in

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
now you can do all the same movements in

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.810 
now you can do all the same movements in
this<00:02:08.330> exact<00:02:08.690> same<00:02:08.899> position<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:09.950> let's<00:02:10.700> go

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
this exact same position so let's go

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.270 
this exact same position so let's go
ahead<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.060> show<00:02:11.180> them<00:02:11.330> single<00:02:11.660> right<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:16.130> try

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
ahead and show them single right and try

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.770 
ahead and show them single right and try
not<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.489> bend<00:02:16.850> too<00:02:17.060> much<00:02:17.209> into<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:17.720> you

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
not to bend too much into it so you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.360 
not to bend too much into it so you
might<00:02:17.900> want<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.110> step<00:02:18.290> back<00:02:18.320> good<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.190> just

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
might want to step back good and just

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.590 
might want to step back good and just
adjust<00:02:19.489> yourself<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.239> you're<00:02:20.390> comfortable
