00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 with these 600 we are in minecraft 1.7 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040
 10 points and let's see a mod a bowl 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.650
 which is pretty cool but gives very bad 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.910
 roll that is is time is very very wrong 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.680
 roll this mold travel that the zombies 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.310
 above all he says that also the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.270
 skeletons but the skeletons I do not see it 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.700
 especially the zombies are more 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.210
 smart 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.360
 and nothing is cool, I assure you today 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.360
 missing 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.190
 the versions that now 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.149
 the zombies can come out in hordes 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.469
 like that and blow out 45 there and 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.110
 I do not know if you notice but they are 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.020
 approaching the house 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.670
 well the question is that the zombies in 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.950
 this way they will go where there is light 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.170
 which is not cool either, nothing 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.929
 code because it gives very bad rollete then 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.180
 they have improved them, the zombies are running 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.920
 plus 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.570
 but look how they are around here 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.650
 of light a lot of sodium 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.650
 if I open they will enter 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.890
 / I do not want to see if you go 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.440
 end the zombie and there 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.250
 here he will not come in and he says you do not like what 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.160
 what's inside the house 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.120
 Tell me about zombies that are coming 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.320
 apart from that it comes in a montonazo 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.950
 because it comes a lot 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.049
 they are smarter they are faster 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.979
 look how all come to light is that 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:39.950
 stream then another thing is that in this 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.810
 other 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.810
 if we get hit by blood 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.480
 uff what bad roll you have what unit is 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.420
 accumulates all here can not go out alone 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.040
 with tacos are supposed to be friends now 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.800
 yes they come out when they look survival yes 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.590
 that you leave the question is that they can 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.940
 hit punches if we can bleed and if 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.610
 they lower us a lot the life we go to in 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.700
 big periodically this what does 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.320
 is to attract more zombies thing is that I do not 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.240
 you say you have to have bad parents 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.230
 of mold 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.950
 you see shanghai casino 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.540
 apart from that they are faster besides it is 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.560
 you can tell they're fast that's what 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.840
 worst 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.650
 I prefer laporta face 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.950
 come in waves as I say something that is 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.540
 has done through night oysters not 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.200
 had seen the tri lost good the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.769
 bleeding 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.739
 the question is that when bleeding as I say 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.930
 they are attracting more and more zombies then 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.360
 come for the light to my mom late 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.940
 really, there's nothing worse than 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.890
 this of light 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.770
 this is where the light is going to come the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.270
 zombies do not cool anything 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.010
 but nothing at all come as a 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.959
 pry 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.920
 and that's the worst there is but good 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.950
 there is also another little thing and that is that 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.340
 zombies listen to the noise is to say yes 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.650
 we start to apply they will listen to us 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.560
 and they will come for us 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.010
 is that it is the worst I swear I will go 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.510
 putting lights to see 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.489
 if by a casual start to approach 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.489
 zombies let's remove this and be 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.850
 the natural version is removed 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.640
 I prefer that it be removed that I am going to 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.300
 where it's okay the light is tomic it seems 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.300
 what happens a little 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.260
 now you approach the light 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.960
 is that this approach to the light 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.960
 nothing is cool because usually 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.410
 We obviously have houses with light 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.170
 this leads to the mind 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.070
 I guess tracking deviates do not look at the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.360
 what is here and this is for people 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.220
 that mole complicate the minecraft more 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.280
 Well, more, actually, it's not bigger 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.290
 complicated but to make it difficult 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.340
 look bad roll gives me this of the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.220
 zombies especially when you chop like I say you 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.770
 they hear from farther away you know how with the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.060
 torches is exactly the same as I put 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.750
 torch here you have seen agreement 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.950
 zombies that from here or so super far 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.370
 Well, the question is that of normal 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.010
 they see obviously practice but what 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.169
 they listen then they approach then yes 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.580
 they're going to look for you, that's why I say what 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.340
 very bad age who do these 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.449
 these are the true ones but good 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.409
 this is the mode does not bring anything else 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.809
 simply more intelligence speed 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.969
 and little else for the 2000s that now 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:43.229
 they pursue good light they approach 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:44.879
 pry the light hear the noises and 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.119
 that now can bleed and that attracts more 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.800
 zombies in short if it gave ball to complicate 

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:52.789
 the oyster minecraft is that look at the one 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.789
 it arms I want a moment 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.449
 the skeletons are also supposed to 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.919
 they have also improved them 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.919
 if I'm bleeding 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:06.329
 yes because I have I think I have three 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:06.329
 hearts or something like that and the zombies here 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.760
 you look like zombie vampires but good as 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.570
 inscriptions for the 1 point 7.10 is 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.570
 so bad roll 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.340
 bye
