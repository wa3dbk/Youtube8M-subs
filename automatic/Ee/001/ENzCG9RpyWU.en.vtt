in a couple things but I just want you
to<00:00:07.109> see<00:00:07.290> some<00:00:07.470> numbers<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:07.980> these<00:00:08.099> machines

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
to see some numbers on these machines

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.480 
to see some numbers on these machines
that<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.240> build<00:00:09.710> this<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> liner<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.460> can

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
that I build this is a liner you can

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.310 
that I build this is a liner you can
tell<00:00:11.790> obviously<00:00:11.940> because<00:00:12.509> there's<00:00:12.719> minimal

burner or spring seat another thing you
want<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.670> look<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:17.970> when<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.210> buy<00:00:18.240> machines

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
want to look for when you buy machines

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.970 
want to look for when you buy machines
wherever<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.070> buy<00:00:20.189> them<00:00:20.340> from<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:21.859> this<00:00:24.980> head

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
wherever you buy them from is this head

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.220 
wherever you buy them from is this head
is<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.820> directly<00:00:27.510> over<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> center<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
is is directly over the center of the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.470 
is is directly over the center of the
rear<00:00:28.349> coil<00:00:28.650> as<00:00:28.830> possible<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:30.029> too<00:00:30.240> far

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
rear coil as possible if it's too far

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.170 
rear coil as possible if it's too far
back<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.470> know<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:35.280> changes<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> duty<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
back you know it it changes the duty of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.330 
back you know it it changes the duty of
the<00:00:36.360> other<00:00:37.020> machine<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.500> was<00:00:37.590> too<00:00:37.770> far<00:00:37.950> forward

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the other machine it was too far forward

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.790 
the other machine it was too far forward
it<00:00:39.030> also<00:00:39.239> changes<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> duty<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> machine

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
it also changes the duty of the machine

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.520 
it also changes the duty of the machine
you<00:00:41.670> want<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> centered<00:00:42.570> directly<00:00:42.899> over<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
you want it centered directly over the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.760 
you want it centered directly over the
most<00:00:44.539> directly<00:00:45.539> over<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.379> center<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.680> the

most directly over the the center of the
rear<00:00:46.860> coil<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.820> centered<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.020> can

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
rear coil as centered on that as you can

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.560 
rear coil as centered on that as you can
get<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.649> did<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.579> way<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
get if they did if it's not that way you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.100 
get if they did if it's not that way you
know<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.170> right<00:00:52.469> anyway

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
know it's not right anyway

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.760 
know it's not right anyway
this<00:00:55.110> rear<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:56.010> spring<00:00:56.579> gap<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.120> between

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
this rear this spring gap here between

this rear this spring gap here between
the<00:00:58.770> where<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> armature<00:00:59.850> bar<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> rear

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the where the armature bar and the rear

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.389 
the where the armature bar and the rear
spring<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.050> that's<00:01:01.770> among<00:01:02.100> amount<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
spring you see that's among amount of

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.359 
spring you see that's among amount of
gap<00:01:02.579> allows<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> machine<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.600> cycle<00:01:04.049> fast

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
gap allows the machine to cycle fast

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.780 
gap allows the machine to cycle fast

plus the rear short front spring we're

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.510 
plus the rear short front spring we're
gonna<00:01:08.909> turn<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> six<00:01:09.780> volts<00:01:10.520> I'm

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
gonna turn it on it's a six volts I'm

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.859 
gonna turn it on it's a six volts I'm
going<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> turn<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.180> let<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
going to turn it on just let you see the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.950 
going to turn it on just let you see the
cycles<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.500> everything

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.380 

138<00:01:18.960> cyber<00:01:19.649> for<00:01:19.950> second<00:01:20.430> 61%<00:01:20.880> busy

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
138 cyber for second 61% busy

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.010 
138 cyber for second 61% busy
specifically<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.079> Duty<00:01:22.350> okay<00:01:26.780> leave<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> on

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
specifically in Duty okay leave it on

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.170 
specifically in Duty okay leave it on
the<00:01:28.170> curb<00:01:28.350> are<00:01:28.939> rolling

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the curb are rolling

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
the curb are rolling
I<00:01:32.240> think<00:01:33.240> cycling<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.110> could<00:01:34.500> change<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.950> duty

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
I think cycling I could change the duty

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.789 
I think cycling I could change the duty
on<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.610> by<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.179> gotta<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> core<00:01:37.590> Heights

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
on that by I gotta just the core Heights

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.050 
on that by I gotta just the core Heights
on<00:01:38.039> here<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> machine<00:01:38.579> isn't<00:01:38.729> completely

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
on here the machine isn't completely

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.639 
on here the machine isn't completely
done<00:01:39.360> yet<00:01:39.539> but<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.899> wanted<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> see
