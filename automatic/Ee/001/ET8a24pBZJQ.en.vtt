00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.920
 everyone here we are again with new 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.930
 video on this occasion we are going to teach you 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.210
 how can they create a point of 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.640
 restoration in what the system 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.830
 operative windows 8 at the request of 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
 some of the various subscribers 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.400
 also for windows 8 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.500
 some will ask and what and what 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.079
 means that point of restoration 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.210
 Restoration point is done as 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.980
 security measure in case in some 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.690
 moment the operating system starts to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 fail begins to show you some 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.460
 mistakes is also made if in some 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 you have installed a program 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.410
 like those transformation kits and then 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.809
 there is no way to uninstall it 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.910
 for this, because you have already created a 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.340
 Restoration point can return your 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.940
 operating system to a point one x 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.879
 point in time before having 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.379
 happened the error then we are going to 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.570
 show them how can we just go 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.050
 to look for the configuration option and 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.700
 inside d 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.180
 prayer can also go for talent and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.410
 control but I will use the system 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.270
 remembering steps for new delays 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.120
 time then let's go where it says 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.460
 pc information and we will leave this 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.470
 screen where the features are 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.630
 of the operating system in this case 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.000
 windows obama system protection and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.560
 inside of coming system let's go 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.170
 to the option here in the bottom 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.780
 let's put create in general 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.369
 let's put any name 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.770
 to what is the point of restoration 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:44.090
 They could put any name to their liking 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.860
 I do not know'll put point d 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.100
 restoration or something like that and just 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.330
 we can create and depending on the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 files and of all the programs that 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.610
 they have installed on the operating system 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.990
 it may delay the process because if 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.920
 we finish tells us the point of 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.450
 restoration was created correctly 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.690
 once we have finished the process 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.310
 we have already created the restoration point 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.750
 as a security measure so that when 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.460
 any problem in our 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.070
 computer we can return 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.570
 at a certain point in time that 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.130
 we have already created this position 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.170
 restoration to return it simply 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.210
 let's do the same procedure and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.700
 let's locate the option section of the 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.620
 system and within this screen 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.130
 let's go where it says restore 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.810
 system and let's choose another point in 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.790
 instead of not what it shows us because 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.680
 shows us a very recent date and 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.830
 let's choose another point of 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.050
 restoration which we will choose the 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.810
 point that we have given 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.620
 previously configured so that the 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.970
 computer can return to that point 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.950
 created but I think this one glass about 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.270
 all to those users who ask 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.250
 how a restoration point is made in 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.110
 it is theme for tivo windows 3 boiled 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.420
 subscribe give her in almost that she likes 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.910
 the video that supports a lot to that 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.220
 the channel can reach more to more 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.500
 users that can solve some that 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.130
 another problem they have related to 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.130
 technology
