levels well water or just want added

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.050 
levels well water or just want added
protection<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.530> then<00:01:45.189> you<00:01:45.280> also<00:01:45.490> have<00:01:45.880> the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
protection and then you also have the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.630 
protection and then you also have the
options<00:01:46.510> of<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.110> energy<00:01:48.100> frequency

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
levels of acidic and one purify clean

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.990 
levels of acidic and one purify clean
water<00:01:59.200> mode<00:01:59.439> you've<00:02:00.189> got<00:02:00.369> all<00:02:00.549> your<00:02:00.729> buttons

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
water mode you've got all your buttons

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.450 
water mode you've got all your buttons
up<00:02:01.330> here<00:02:01.360> in<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.810> front<00:02:02.080> it's<00:02:02.650> very<00:02:02.680> easy<00:02:03.220> to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
up here in the front it's very easy to

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.240 
up here in the front it's very easy to
read<00:02:03.670> LED<00:02:04.000> panel<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.380> system<00:02:05.590> comes<00:02:06.070> in

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
read LED panel and this system comes in

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.199 
read LED panel and this system comes in
two<00:02:06.579> different<00:02:06.939> colors<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:08.019> pH<00:02:08.590> testing<00:02:09.209> with

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
two different colors the pH testing with

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.390 
two different colors the pH testing with
the<00:02:10.390> system

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the system

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.940 
the system
so<00:02:11.940> because<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.690> eleven<00:02:13.200> plates<00:02:13.500> on<00:02:13.769> this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
so because of the eleven plates on this

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.970 
so because of the eleven plates on this
and<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.489> eight<00:02:14.730> hundred<00:02:14.760> watts<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.510> power

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
and up to eight hundred watts of power

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.320 
and up to eight hundred watts of power
we<00:02:16.980> actually<00:02:18.830> should<00:02:19.830> be<00:02:20.040> getting<00:02:20.430> eleven<00:02:21.120> to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
we actually should be getting eleven to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.809 
we actually should be getting eleven to
twelve<00:02:21.599> ph<00:02:22.110> depending<00:02:23.099> upon<00:02:23.220> your<00:02:23.519> source

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
twelve ph depending upon your source

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.199 
twelve ph depending upon your source
water<00:02:24.680> let's<00:02:25.680> see<00:02:25.950> what<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.370> outputs<00:02:26.970> here

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
water let's see what this outputs here

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.250 
water let's see what this outputs here
on<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.750> level<00:02:28.349> for<00:02:28.620> pH<00:02:32.569> so<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:33.870> starting<00:02:34.140> off

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
on the level for pH so it's starting off

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.899 
on the level for pH so it's starting off
around<00:02:34.500> 11<00:02:35.329> 111<00:02:36.650> -<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.220> still<00:02:38.519> climbing

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
around 11 111 - and it's still climbing

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.479 
around 11 111 - and it's still climbing
and<00:02:39.329> again<00:02:40.019> like<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.379> said<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.890> that's<00:02:41.069> because

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
and again like I said if that's because

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.860 
and again like I said if that's because
of<00:02:41.970> these<00:02:42.120> large<00:02:43.069> eleven<00:02:44.069> plates<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.910> all<00:02:45.629> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
of these large eleven plates and all the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.930 
of these large eleven plates and all the
watts<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.739> power<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.190> are<00:02:47.340> going<00:02:47.519> into<00:02:47.760> this

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
watts of power that are going into this

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.240 
watts of power that are going into this
system<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.900> we're<00:02:49.079> really<00:02:49.349> able<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.829> get<00:02:50.220> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
system that we're really able to get a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.559 
system that we're really able to get a
high<00:02:50.700> pH<00:02:51.599> range<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.609> so<00:02:53.609> as<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.390> it's

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
high pH range on it so as you see it's

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.030 
high pH range on it so as you see it's
climbing<00:02:54.930> up<00:02:55.440> 11:3<00:02:56.420> close<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.569> eleven<00:02:57.989> for<00:02:58.260> pH

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
climbing up 11:3 close to eleven for pH

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.420 
climbing up 11:3 close to eleven for pH
the<00:03:00.000> next<00:03:00.390> generation<00:03:01.049> M<00:03:01.230> eleven<00:03:01.859> is<00:03:02.069> the
