so<00:00:01.350> in<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:01.560> video<00:00:01.709> we're<00:00:01.949> going<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.100> take<00:00:02.220> a

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so in this video we're going to take a

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.329 
so in this video we're going to take a
look<00:00:02.520> at<00:00:02.730> how<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.030> dynamically<00:00:04.020> drive<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.799> joint

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
look at how to dynamically drive a joint

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.990 
look at how to dynamically drive a joint
chain<00:00:05.670> via<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.720> spline<00:00:07.440> ik'<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.670> dynamic

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
chain via a spline ik' and a dynamic

hair<00:00:09.750> curve<00:00:10.490> what<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.519> have<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:11.940> very<00:00:12.150> quickly

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
hair curve what I have here very quickly

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.070 
hair curve what I have here very quickly
is<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.660> have<00:00:12.990> polygon<00:00:13.980> geometry<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.929> can

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
is I have polygon geometry and you can

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.510 
is I have polygon geometry and you can
see<00:00:16.260> I'll<00:00:16.320> turn<00:00:16.500> off<00:00:16.619> x-ray<00:00:16.980> joints<00:00:17.190> real

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
see I'll turn off x-ray joints real

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.730 
see I'll turn off x-ray joints real
quick<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.820> get<00:00:17.910> listed<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.300> bit<00:00:18.510> better<00:00:18.740> there

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
quick to get listed a bit better there

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.330 
quick to get listed a bit better there
is<00:00:19.920> my<00:00:20.100> polygon<00:00:20.490> geometry<00:00:22.039> turn<00:00:23.039> back<00:00:23.189> on

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
is my polygon geometry turn back on

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.179 
is my polygon geometry turn back on
x-ray<00:00:23.730> joints<00:00:23.910> you'll<00:00:24.240> notice<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.769> also

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
x-ray joints you'll notice that I also

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.759 
x-ray joints you'll notice that I also
have<00:00:26.789> I'll<00:00:27.090> turn<00:00:27.269> off<00:00:27.390> display<00:00:27.840> polygons<00:00:28.529> I

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
have I'll turn off display polygons I

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.849 
have I'll turn off display polygons I
have<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.670> joint<00:00:30.029> chain<00:00:30.480> here<00:00:31.109> right<00:00:31.380> now<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
have a joint chain here right now and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.850 
have a joint chain here right now and
here's<00:00:32.790> my<00:00:33.000> hyper<00:00:33.210> graph<00:00:33.480> set<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:33.899> I've<00:00:34.110> got<00:00:34.350> my

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
here's my hyper graph set up I've got my

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.030 
here's my hyper graph set up I've got my
joints<00:00:35.340> five<00:00:35.550> joints<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:37.079> polycube

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
joints five joints and one polycube

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.799 
joints five joints and one polycube
which<00:00:38.340> has<00:00:38.460> been<00:00:38.579> extruded<00:00:39.059> into<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.510> hair

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
which has been extruded into this hair

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.750 
which has been extruded into this hair
piece<00:00:40.520> so<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:42.480> now<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
piece so what I'm going to do now is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.000 
piece so what I'm going to do now is
first<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.270> set<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.690> curve<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
first I'm going to set up a curve that I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.880 
first I'm going to set up a curve that I
can<00:00:47.160> use<00:00:47.340> along<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.739> going

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
can use along this to do that I'm going

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.979 
can use along this to do that I'm going
to<00:00:49.920> go<00:00:50.010> into<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> curves<00:00:50.730> tab<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.420> grab<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
to go into the curves tab and grab the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.880 
to go into the curves tab and grab the
EP<00:00:52.469> curve<00:00:52.800> tool<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:54.809> draw<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.199> out<00:00:55.350> correctly

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
EP curve tool to draw this out correctly

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.580 
EP curve tool to draw this out correctly
I'm<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> hold<00:00:56.489> down<00:00:56.579> V<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.989> snap<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
I'm going to hold down V for snap to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.670 
I'm going to hold down V for snap to
point<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.160> I'm<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.000> click<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.719> each<00:01:01.620> one

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
point and I'm going to click on each one

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.050 
point and I'm going to click on each one
of<00:01:02.219> my<00:01:03.290> joints<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:06.119> will<00:01:06.299> create<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
of my joints and that will create a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.640 
of my joints and that will create a
curve<00:01:09.060> point<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:10.409> each<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.010> those<00:01:11.600> joints

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
curve point at each one of those joints

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.600 
curve point at each one of those joints
here<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.799> hyper<00:01:13.950> graph<00:01:14.220> now<00:01:14.430> you'll

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
here in the hyper graph now you'll

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.380 
here in the hyper graph now you'll
notice<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.830> curve<00:01:17.210> now<00:01:18.210> this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
notice that I have a curve now this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.230 
notice that I have a curve now this
curve<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.049> was<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> move<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.880> it's<00:01:20.880> literally

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
curve if I was to move it it's literally

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.050 
curve if I was to move it it's literally
just<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.840> curve<00:01:22.430> we're<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.640> put<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.820> back

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
just a curve we're going to put it back

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
just a curve we're going to put it back
into<00:01:24.330> place<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:25.170> right<00:01:25.320> now<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.720> curve

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
into place for right now so this curve

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.440 
into place for right now so this curve
is<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.220> eventually<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.579> controlling

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
is going to eventually be controlling

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.289 
is going to eventually be controlling
our<00:01:30.689> entire<00:01:31.049> joint<00:01:31.590> chain<00:01:32.030> what<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
our entire joint chain what I'm going to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.819 
our entire joint chain what I'm going to
do<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.630> I'm<00:01:33.869> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.140> select<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.619> curve

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
do is I'm going to select the curve

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.340 
do is I'm going to select the curve
first<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.790> want<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> test<00:01:36.600> its<00:01:36.810> dynamic

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
first I want to test its dynamic

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.580 
first I want to test its dynamic
attributes<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.570> I'm<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
attributes and to do that I'm going to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.200 
attributes and to do that I'm going to
go<00:01:40.740> into<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.700> dynamics<00:01:42.600> menu<00:01:43.200> set<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.210> under

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
go into the dynamics menu set and under

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.249 
go into the dynamics menu set and under
hair<00:01:46.430> I'm<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> choose<00:01:47.939> make<00:01:48.390> selected

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
hair I'm going to choose make selected

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.670 
hair I'm going to choose make selected
curves<00:01:49.700> dynamic<00:01:50.899> doing<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.259> turn<00:01:52.500> my

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
curves dynamic doing this will turn my

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.569 
curves dynamic doing this will turn my
curve<00:01:52.950> into<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> dynamic<00:01:53.729> curve<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:56.040> when<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> do

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
curve into a dynamic curve so when I do

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.429 
curve into a dynamic curve so when I do
that<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.119> bring<00:01:57.299> my<00:01:57.420> hyper<00:01:57.600> graphic<00:01:57.990> over<00:01:58.290> here

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
that I bring my hyper graphic over here

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.510 
that I bring my hyper graphic over here
you'll<00:01:58.560> notice<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.009> whole<00:01:59.219> bunch<00:01:59.430> of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you'll notice I have a whole bunch of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.940 
you'll notice I have a whole bunch of
new<00:01:59.729> nodes<00:01:59.969> created<00:02:00.509> I've<00:02:00.630> got<00:02:00.810> my<00:02:01.409> joints<00:02:01.799> my

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
new nodes created I've got my joints my

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.830 
new nodes created I've got my joints my
cube<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.399> had<00:02:02.549> before<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.719> my

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
cube which I had before I have my

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.620 
cube which I had before I have my
original<00:02:03.960> curve<00:02:04.530> here<00:02:05.189> curve<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.540> I've

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
original curve here curve one but I've

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.779 
original curve here curve one but I've
also<00:02:06.780> created<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.259> hair<00:02:07.439> system<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.220> group<00:02:08.610> for

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
also created a hair system a group for

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.510 
also created a hair system a group for
this<00:02:08.879> with<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> follicle<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.190> another<00:02:11.190> hair

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
this with a follicle and another hair

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.880 
this with a follicle and another hair
system<00:02:11.910> output<00:02:12.330> curve

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
system output curve

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.280 
system output curve
with<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.430> very<00:02:13.640> important<00:02:14.060> curve<00:02:14.330> -<00:02:14.720> which

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
with this very important curve - which

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.930 
with this very important curve - which
is<00:02:15.410> going<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.620> be<00:02:15.740> our<00:02:15.890> dynamic<00:02:16.430> curve<00:02:16.760> that

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
is going to be our dynamic curve that

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.250 
is going to be our dynamic curve that
we're<00:02:17.090> going<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.240> be<00:02:17.330> using<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.170> minute

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
we're going to be using in just a minute

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.860 
we're going to be using in just a minute
so<00:02:19.990> what<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.050> have<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.560> set<00:02:22.100> up<00:02:22.280> I'm<00:02:23.270> going<00:02:23.690> to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
so what I have this set up I'm going to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.220 
so what I have this set up I'm going to
set<00:02:24.410> my<00:02:24.590> time<00:02:24.950> line<00:02:25.280> here<00:02:25.790> at<00:02:26.270> about<00:02:26.420> 200

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
set my time line here at about 200

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.200 
set my time line here at about 200
frames<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.830> scale<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.280> out<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:28.820> can<00:02:28.970> test

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
frames and scale this out so I can test

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.590 
frames and scale this out so I can test
it<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:30.230> hit<00:02:30.410> play<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.970> notice<00:02:32.480> really

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
it and I hit play and you notice really

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.790 
it and I hit play and you notice really
not<00:02:32.810> much<00:02:32.990> happens<00:02:34.780> nothing<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.930> moving<00:02:36.230> here

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
not much happens nothing is moving here

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.980 
not much happens nothing is moving here
and<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.670> reason<00:02:37.880> for<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.720> actually

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
and the reason for that is actually

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.070 
and the reason for that is actually
because<00:02:39.620> my<00:02:40.330> follicle<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.510> hair<00:02:41.720> system

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
because my follicle and hair system

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.350 
because my follicle and hair system
right<00:02:42.200> now<00:02:42.260> are<00:02:43.220> being<00:02:43.459> sort<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.820> trapped<00:02:44.150> in

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
right now are being sort of trapped in

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.300 
right now are being sort of trapped in
place<00:02:44.600> at<00:02:44.930> both<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.410> beginning<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.070> curve

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
place at both the beginning of the curve

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.150 
place at both the beginning of the curve
and<00:02:46.520> at<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.209> end<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.720> like<00:02:47.810> having<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.500> root

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
and at the end it's like having a root

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.699 
and at the end it's like having a root
for<00:02:49.490> your<00:02:49.580> hair<00:02:49.790> at<00:02:49.970> both<00:02:50.510> ends<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.560> of

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
for your hair at both ends and I of

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.979 
for your hair at both ends and I of
course<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.130> want<00:02:52.370> my<00:02:52.489> root<00:02:52.850> at<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.600> bottom

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
course just want my root at the bottom

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.949 
course just want my root at the bottom
side<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.400> I'm<00:02:55.580> going<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.820> select<00:02:56.380> my<00:02:57.910> follicle

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
side so I'm going to select my follicle

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.170 
side so I'm going to select my follicle
that<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.200> follicle<00:03:00.770> for<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.160> hair<00:03:01.370> and

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
that is the follicle for the hair and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.720 
that is the follicle for the hair and
I'm<00:03:03.170> going<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.440> say<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.160> attribute<00:03:04.640> editor

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
I'm going to say in the attribute editor

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.910 
I'm going to say in the attribute editor
instead<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.300> point<00:03:05.630> locking<00:03:06.080> at<00:03:06.230> both<00:03:06.500> ends

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
instead of point locking at both ends

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.290 
instead of point locking at both ends
let's<00:03:07.730> point<00:03:08.030> lock<00:03:08.270> at<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.080> base<00:03:09.440> and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
let's point lock at just the base and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.660 
let's point lock at just the base and
now<00:03:11.300> when<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.630> hit<00:03:11.810> play<00:03:12.280> you'll<00:03:13.280> know<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:13.550> is

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
now when I hit play you'll know this is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.729 
now when I hit play you'll know this is
curve<00:03:13.970> is<00:03:14.180> going<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.390> start<00:03:14.570> to<00:03:14.720> flex<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.440> little

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
curve is going to start to flex a little

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.009 
curve is going to start to flex a little
bit<00:03:15.920> here<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:17.030> problem<00:03:17.330> is<00:03:17.390> it's<00:03:17.510> not<00:03:17.600> going

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
bit here the problem is it's not going

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.460 
bit here the problem is it's not going
very<00:03:18.049> very<00:03:18.530> far<00:03:19.900> this<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.019> going<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.230> kind<00:03:21.410> of

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
very very far this is going to kind of

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.590 
very very far this is going to kind of
hold<00:03:21.650> up<00:03:21.890> right<00:03:22.040> there<00:03:22.100> well<00:03:23.060> in<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.330> hair

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
hold up right there well in the hair

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.240 
hold up right there well in the hair
system<00:03:24.049> shape<00:03:24.380> node<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.799> reason<00:03:25.040> why<00:03:25.130> this

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
system shape node the reason why this

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.770 
system shape node the reason why this
isn't<00:03:25.430> going<00:03:25.549> much<00:03:25.760> further<00:03:26.090> is<00:03:26.360> because<00:03:26.660> my

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
isn't going much further is because my

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.350 
isn't going much further is because my
stiffness<00:03:27.260> scale<00:03:28.010> needs<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.850> be<00:03:28.940> altered

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
stiffness scale needs to be altered

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.390 
stiffness scale needs to be altered
right<00:03:29.570> now<00:03:29.750> it's<00:03:29.989> at<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.170> selected<00:03:30.709> value<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.070> 1

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
right now it's at a selected value of 1

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.390 
right now it's at a selected value of 1
meaning<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.269> hair<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.630> entirely<00:03:33.110> stiff<00:03:33.680> I'm

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
meaning the hair is entirely stiff I'm

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.009 
meaning the hair is entirely stiff I'm
going<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:34.730> slide<00:03:35.000> this<00:03:35.180> down<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.510> little<00:03:35.660> bit

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
going to slide this down a little bit

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.740 
going to slide this down a little bit
you<00:03:36.769> can<00:03:36.860> see<00:03:37.100> I<00:03:37.130> can<00:03:37.459> pull<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:38.180> down<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.480> set

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
you can see I can pull this down and set

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.009 
you can see I can pull this down and set
my<00:03:38.840> selected<00:03:39.230> value<00:03:39.440> about<00:03:39.880> almost<00:03:40.880> 0.4<00:03:41.750> there

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
my selected value about almost 0.4 there

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.930 
my selected value about almost 0.4 there
and<00:03:42.260> I've<00:03:42.709> got<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.890> little<00:03:43.040> graph<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.850> by

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
and I've got a little graph and by

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.600 
and I've got a little graph and by
editing's<00:03:44.360> graph<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:45.200> can<00:03:45.950> essentially<00:03:46.250> change

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
editing's graph I can essentially change

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.900 
editing's graph I can essentially change
how<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:46.940> stiffness<00:03:47.570> works<00:03:47.890> across<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.489> whole

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
how the stiffness works across the whole

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.539 
how the stiffness works across the whole
hair<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:51.620> is<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:51.830> value<00:03:52.070> that<00:03:52.160> I<00:03:52.310> kind<00:03:52.489> of

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
hair and this is a value that I kind of

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.550 
hair and this is a value that I kind of
like<00:03:52.730> here<00:03:52.910> I've<00:03:52.970> got<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.120> nice<00:03:53.299> tapering<00:03:53.900> curve

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
like here I've got a nice tapering curve

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.449 
like here I've got a nice tapering curve
to<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:57.260> now<00:03:57.380> I've<00:03:57.560> got<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.769> curve<00:03:58.010> working

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
to it so now I've got the curve working

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.860 
to it so now I've got the curve working
dynamically<00:03:59.090> but<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.660> don't<00:04:00.049> have<00:04:00.380> this<00:04:01.040> curve

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
dynamically but I don't have this curve

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.160 
dynamically but I don't have this curve
pulling<00:04:02.870> in<00:04:02.989> joint<00:04:03.230> chain<00:04:03.500> with<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:05.690> set

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
pulling in joint chain with it so to set

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.280 
pulling in joint chain with it so to set
that<00:04:06.500> up<00:04:06.790> what<00:04:07.790> I'm<00:04:07.880> going<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.090> do<00:04:08.269> is<00:04:08.510> I'm

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
that up what I'm going to do is I'm

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.220 
that up what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.560> create<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:09.860> spline<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.489> K<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:12.049> let<00:04:12.170> me

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
going to create a spline I K and let me

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.900 
going to create a spline I K and let me
make<00:04:12.410> this<00:04:12.530> window<00:04:12.739> smaller<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:13.549> we<00:04:13.579> can<00:04:13.700> see

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
make this window smaller so we can see

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.630 
make this window smaller so we can see
this<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:14.750> bit<00:04:14.870> better<00:04:15.019> here<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.799> just<00:04:16.280> want<00:04:16.579> to

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
this a bit better here I just want to

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.280 
this a bit better here I just want to
keep<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:16.970> all<00:04:17.239> out<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:17.900> open

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.370 

to<00:04:22.770> create<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.520> spline<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:23.910> K<00:04:24.230> normally<00:04:25.230> that

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
to create the spline I K normally that

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.080 
to create the spline I K normally that
would<00:04:25.530> create<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:26.010> curve<00:04:26.370> with<00:04:26.850> this<00:04:28.670> on<00:04:29.670> to<00:04:30.000> the

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
would create a curve with this on to the

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.000 
would create a curve with this on to the
joint<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.510> create<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.810> supply<00:04:31.050> by<00:04:31.200> K<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.590> a

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
joint so to create a supply by K and a

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.950 
joint so to create a supply by K and a
curve<00:04:32.700> along<00:04:32.850> with<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.270> but<00:04:33.390> we<00:04:33.480> already<00:04:33.750> have

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
curve along with it but we already have

curve along with it but we already have
a<00:04:33.990> curve<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:36.180> setting<00:04:36.570> this<00:04:36.690> up<00:04:36.870> I'm<00:04:37.380> going

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
a curve so in setting this up I'm going

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
you can make a dynamic joint chain to

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.000 
you can make a dynamic joint chain to
control<00:06:14.550> things<00:06:14.700> like<00:06:14.880> tails<00:06:15.690> or<00:06:16.170> antlers<00:06:16.650> or
