targeting today this is part 7 of our
targeting<00:00:17.039> series<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.520> what's<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.090> one

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
targeting series and what's this one

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.970 
targeting series and what's this one
about<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> about<00:00:19.109> targeting<00:00:19.650> when<00:00:19.830> your

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
about this is about targeting when your

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.950 
about this is about targeting when your
parallel<00:00:20.369> parking<00:00:20.789> now<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.779> actually

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
parallel parking now this is actually

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.540 
parallel parking now this is actually
going<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> combination<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:23.189> what<00:00:23.400> you're

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
going to be a combination of what you're

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.980 
going to be a combination of what you're
doing<00:00:23.580> when<00:00:24.119> you're<00:00:24.180> looking<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.480> ahead<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
doing when you're looking up ahead and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.779 
doing when you're looking up ahead and
also<00:00:25.320> what<00:00:25.800> you're<00:00:25.980> doing<00:00:26.279> when<00:00:26.490> you're

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
also what you're doing when you're

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.849 
also what you're doing when you're
backing<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.720> then<00:00:28.080> as<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.410> mentioned<00:00:28.769> earlier

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
backing and then as we mentioned earlier

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.919 
backing and then as we mentioned earlier
about<00:00:29.580> pulling<00:00:30.060> through<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.300> space<00:00:30.630> when<00:00:30.840> you

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
about pulling through the space when you

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.569 
about pulling through the space when you
pull<00:00:31.140> through<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> parking<00:00:31.650> space<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.219> really

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
pull through a parking space it's really

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.459 
pull through a parking space it's really
the<00:00:32.730> same<00:00:32.759> principle<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.870> difference<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
the same principle the difference is

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.790 
the same principle the difference is
that<00:00:34.649> what<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> advance<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.410> when

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
that what you do in advance is that when

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.170 
that what you do in advance is that when
you<00:00:37.920> spot<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.430> space<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> you're<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you spot the space that you're going to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.400 
you spot the space that you're going to
go<00:00:39.329> into<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.719> course<00:00:39.870> you're<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> pull

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
go into of course you're going to pull

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440 
go into of course you're going to pull
up<00:00:40.530> next<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.070> space<00:00:41.340> past<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.120> then

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
up next to that space past it and then

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.729 
up next to that space past it and then
you're<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> back<00:00:42.960> into<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you're going to back into it like that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.799 
you're going to back into it like that
but<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.820> actually<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.629> have

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
but what you do actually is you have

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.840 
but what you do actually is you have
several<00:00:46.079> targets<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.800> why<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.550> first

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
several targets here why the first

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.299 
several targets here why the first
target<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.660> pull<00:00:48.840> over<00:00:48.980> almost<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.100> pull

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
target is to pull over almost like pull

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.200 
target is to pull over almost like pull
over<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> curb<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.879> course<00:00:51.059> you're<00:00:51.149> not

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
over to the curb of course you're not

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.670 
over to the curb of course you're not
pulling<00:00:51.390> over<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.750> far<00:00:51.930> you're<00:00:52.410> pulling

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
pulling over that far you're pulling

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
pulling over that far you're pulling
over<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.129> there's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> park<00:00:53.670> video<00:00:53.820> here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
over to it there's a park video here

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
over to it there's a park video here
another<00:00:54.510> park<00:00:54.780> vehicle<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:55.289> here<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.860> you're

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
another park vehicle back here so you're

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.340 
another park vehicle back here so you're
pulling<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.460> next<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.090> even<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
pulling up next to even or just a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.160 
pulling up next to even or just a
slightly<00:00:58.680> past<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.430> part<00:00:59.760> car<00:01:00.270> next<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
slightly past that part car next to it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.689 
slightly past that part car next to it
so<00:01:01.320> you've<00:01:01.710> already<00:01:02.039> drawn<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.399> path<00:01:02.579> again

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
so you've already drawn that path again

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.609 
so you've already drawn that path again
your<00:01:02.969> target<00:01:03.300> should<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.510> way<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.080> not

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
your target should be way up at not

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.530 
your target should be way up at not
looking<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> car<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.970> you're<00:01:06.150> looking<00:01:06.479> at

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
looking at that car if you're looking at

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.969 
looking at that car if you're looking at
the<00:01:06.659> card<00:01:06.869> where<00:01:07.080> does<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> vehicle<00:01:07.590> go<00:01:07.710> goes

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the card where does the vehicle go goes

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.950 
the card where does the vehicle go goes
into<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> remember<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> vehicle<00:01:09.450> goes<00:01:09.659> well

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
into it remember the vehicle goes well

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.570 
into it remember the vehicle goes well
you're<00:01:10.080> looking<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.710> project<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.280> path

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you're looking you project that path

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.730 
you're looking you project that path
ahead<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.970> come<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:12.479> parallel<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
ahead you come up what parallel to it

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.190 
ahead you come up what parallel to it
that's<00:01:14.250> right<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.700> even<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.270> then

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that's right and even with them then

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.770 
that's right and even with them then
when<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.799> back<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.700> your<00:01:17.850> target<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.540> now

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
when you back up was your target you now

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.350 
when you back up was your target you now
have<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.470> target<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.060> that's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
have to what target like that that's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.910 
have to what target like that that's
right<00:01:21.540> your<00:01:21.869> target<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.259> coming<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.860> out

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
right your target is coming in and out

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.950 
right your target is coming in and out
so<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.640> draw<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.450> mind's<00:01:24.720> eye

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
so you have to draw in your mind's eye

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.899 
so you have to draw in your mind's eye
while<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.860> look<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.189> rear<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.670> path

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
while you look to the rear of the path

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.370 
while you look to the rear of the path
that<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.360> rear<00:01:27.600> pivot<00:01:27.900> point<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that the rear pivot point is going to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.990
