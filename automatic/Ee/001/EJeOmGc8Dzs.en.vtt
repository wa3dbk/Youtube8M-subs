felt<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.729> nice<00:02:05.880> smooth<00:02:06.380> perfectly

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
felt so it's a nice smooth perfectly

matter<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:08.040> be<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> little<00:03:08.610> thinner<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.780> could

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
matter it be a little thinner it could

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.290 
matter it be a little thinner it could
be<00:03:10.080> something<00:03:10.470> as<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.400> know<00:03:11.490> like<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:12.060> this

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
parallel but whatever get in there we'll

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.040 
parallel but whatever get in there we'll
just<00:03:20.730> go<00:03:20.910> with<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.209> mark<00:03:21.510> I've<00:03:21.690> got<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:24.989> you

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
got that one when I got this other one

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.610 
got that one when I got this other one
up<00:03:26.700> here<00:03:26.820> I'll<00:03:27.510> do<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.840> other<00:03:27.989> side<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.530> then

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
up here I'll do the other side and then

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.020 
up here I'll do the other side and then
we'll<00:03:28.770> pull<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:28.950> out<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.310> boat<00:03:29.459> okay<00:03:29.880> I've

we'll pull it out of the boat okay I've
got<00:03:30.209> my<00:03:30.420> mark<00:03:30.660> here<00:03:30.989> forward<00:03:31.770> back<00:03:32.459> here's<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
got my mark here forward back here's the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.760 
got my mark here forward back here's the
long<00:03:33.150> side<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:33.690> will<00:03:33.870> be<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.110> longest<00:03:34.260> point

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
long side this will be the longest point

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.430 
long side this will be the longest point
this<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.340> my<00:03:35.459> top<00:03:35.700> angle<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.989> I'm<00:03:37.080> going<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.290> go

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
this is my top angle so I'm going to go

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.910 
this is my top angle so I'm going to go
and<00:03:37.910> set<00:03:38.910> up<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.270> mark<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.900> am<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.470> still<00:03:40.530> in

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
and set up and mark on it am I still in

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.180 
and set up and mark on it am I still in
yeah<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:43.230> then<00:03:43.350> slide<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.739> up<00:03:44.100> because

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
yeah and then slide it up because

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.070 
yeah and then slide it up because
that'll<00:03:44.519> be<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.760> long<00:03:45.000> angled<00:03:45.330> longest<00:03:45.900> point

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
that'll be the long angled longest point

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.150 
that'll be the long angled longest point
up<00:03:46.260> here<00:03:46.790> mark<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.239> then<00:03:49.019> pick<00:03:49.410> up<00:03:49.440> my<00:03:49.830> side

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
up here mark it and then pick up my side

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.310 
up here mark it and then pick up my side
angle<00:03:50.550> that<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.730> head<00:03:51.060> I'll<00:03:51.870> go<00:03:52.050> with<00:03:52.080> the

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
angle that I head I'll go with the

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.900 
angle that I head I'll go with the
longer<00:03:52.709> one<00:03:52.860> here<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.480> then<00:03:54.480> come<00:03:54.510> over<00:03:55.110> and

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
longer one here and then come over and

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
longer one here and then come over and
slide<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:56.970> up

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.750 

to<00:04:03.930> match<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:05.780> go<00:04:06.780> back<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.290> top<00:04:07.530> again

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.610 

and<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:12.240> is<00:04:12.360> where<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.660> have<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:13.020> flip<00:04:13.410> over

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
and this is where you have to flip over

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.909 
and this is where you have to flip over
the<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:15.390> tool<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:16.250> then<00:04:17.250> come<00:04:17.519> back<00:04:17.549> in<00:04:18.919> to

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
the the tool and then come back in to

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.370 
the the tool and then come back in to
here<00:04:21.740> and<00:04:22.740> then<00:04:22.800> go<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:24.540> opposite<00:04:25.050> here

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
here and then go to the opposite here

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.980 
here and then go to the opposite here
again<00:04:25.710> measure<00:04:26.040> up<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.870> side<00:04:28.200> angle<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:29.990> it's

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
again measure up the side angle and it's

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.540 
again measure up the side angle and it's
flopped<00:04:31.560> around<00:04:31.770> two<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.840> lined<00:04:33.840> up<00:04:34.520> with<00:04:35.520> the

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
flopped around two and lined up with the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.750 
flopped around two and lined up with the
side<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:38.540> we<00:04:39.540> come<00:04:39.810> back<00:04:39.990> up<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:41.220> our<00:04:41.370> starting

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
side and we come back up to our starting

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.030 
side and we come back up to our starting
point<00:04:41.970> right<00:04:42.240> here<00:04:42.500> I'll<00:04:43.500> go<00:04:43.710> ahead<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:43.890> do

point right here I'll go ahead and do

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.250 
point right here I'll go ahead and do
this<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.220> cut<00:04:44.460> them<00:04:44.580> out<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:44.700> come<00:04:44.940> back<00:04:45.230> ok<00:04:46.230> I

so I know where to put on the gob of gel

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.940 
so I know where to put on the gob of gel
magic<00:06:16.900> so<00:06:17.080> I<00:06:17.140> can<00:06:17.320> set<00:06:17.500> it<00:06:17.620> in<00:06:17.710> place<00:06:17.740> and

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
magic so I can set it in place and

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.090 
magic so I can set it in place and
wedding<00:06:18.370> well<00:06:18.790> it<00:06:18.910> blew<00:06:19.060> on<00:06:19.830> just<00:06:20.830> fitting

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
good enough now that I know I'll have

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.390 
good enough now that I know I'll have
plenty<00:06:22.810> of<00:06:23.020> squeeze<00:06:23.380> out<00:06:23.590> when<00:06:23.800> I<00:06:23.890> do<00:06:23.950> add<00:06:24.220> to

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
plenty of squeeze out when I do add to

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.280 
plenty of squeeze out when I do add to
gel<00:06:24.640> magic<00:06:25.030> so<00:06:25.240> let<00:06:25.660> me<00:06:25.750> go<00:06:25.870> ahead<00:06:25.900> and<00:06:26.110> do<00:06:26.260> that

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
gel magic so let me go ahead and do that

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.060 
gel magic so let me go ahead and do that
now<00:06:26.470> and<00:06:27.540> that'll<00:06:28.540> be<00:06:28.720> probably<00:06:29.080> the<00:06:29.350> end<00:06:29.620> of

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
now and that'll be probably the end of
