tanks<00:00:07.980> they're<00:00:08.130> using<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.910> Wraith<00:00:09.090> as<00:00:09.269> well

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
tanks they're using the Wraith as well

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.080 
tanks they're using the Wraith as well
the<00:00:10.320> Wraith<00:00:10.500> even<00:00:10.860> survives<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.370> battle<00:00:11.670> that

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
the Wraith even survives the battle that

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.640 
the Wraith even survives the battle that
was<00:00:12.240> absolutely<00:00:12.480> huge<00:00:12.929> because<00:00:13.170> now<00:00:13.349> washing

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
was absolutely huge because now washing

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.220 
was absolutely huge because now washing
is<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.130> definitive<00:00:14.910> advantage<00:00:15.420> definite

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
is it a definitive advantage definite

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.720 
is it a definitive advantage definite
advantage<00:00:16.619> there's<00:00:17.039> not<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> halt<00:00:17.520> with

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
advantage there's not a halt with

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.310 
advantage there's not a halt with
something<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.570> died<00:00:18.840> i'm<00:00:18.960> not<00:00:19.050> sure<00:00:19.199> maybe

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
something just died i'm not sure maybe

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.660 
something just died i'm not sure maybe
he<00:00:19.470> turned<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.890> an<00:00:20.010> SUV<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:20.400> something

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
he turned this in an SUV or something

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.179 
he turned this in an SUV or something
like<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:22.020> was<00:00:22.680> word<00:00:22.800> i<00:00:22.890> just<00:00:23.070> cut

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
like that on that was word i just cut

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.029 
like that on that was word i just cut
the<00:00:23.279> end<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.460> an<00:00:23.550> explosion<00:00:23.820> there<00:00:24.859> but<00:00:25.859> yeah

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the end of an explosion there but yeah

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.089 
the end of an explosion there but yeah
they<00:00:26.730> caution<00:00:27.630> has<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> huge<00:00:28.320> huge<00:00:28.590> advantage

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
they caution has a huge huge advantage

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.250 
they caution has a huge huge advantage
right<00:00:29.250> now<00:00:29.310> because<00:00:30.119> madalas<00:00:30.810> had<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> chance

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
right now because madalas had a chance

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.569 
right now because madalas had a chance
to<00:00:31.439> go<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.679> there<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:31.980> try<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.399> some

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
to go in there and try and do some

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.090 
to go in there and try and do some
damage<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.059> his<00:00:33.180> base<00:00:33.649> because<00:00:34.649> he<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:34.950> going

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
damage to his base because he was going

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
damage to his base because he was going
to<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.510> theoretical<00:00:37.050> tech

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
to have to have the theoretical tech

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.330 
to have to have the theoretical tech
advantage<00:00:37.620> because<00:00:37.710> he<00:00:37.860> had<00:00:37.950> seized<00:00:38.129> mode

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
advantage because he had seized mode

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.040 
advantage because he had seized mode
first<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:39.030> wash<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.510> fighting<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.930> off

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
first but wash and fighting that off

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.560 
first but wash and fighting that off
means<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.500> now<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.250> he's<00:00:41.640> he's<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
means that now that he's he's not at a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.660 
means that now that he's he's not at a
disadvantage<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.350> his<00:00:43.890> economy<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.430> way

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
disadvantage and his economy is way

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.600 
disadvantage and his economy is way
kicked<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> they're<00:00:45.870> both<00:00:46.460> Midas<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
kicked in and they're both Midas has a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
kicked in and they're both Midas has a
second<00:00:47.969> factory<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.920> moment

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
second factory up but in just a moment

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
second factory up but in just a moment
Pasha<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.420> five<00:00:52.020> factories

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
Pasha is going to have five factories

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799 
Pasha is going to have five factories
two<00:00:52.739> minuses<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.090> that's<00:00:54.510> basically

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
two minuses for and that's basically

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.350 
two minuses for and that's basically
going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.670> that's<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.090> really

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
going to be that's going to be really

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.790 
going to be that's going to be really
really<00:00:57.600> tough<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.960> my<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> come<00:00:58.649> back

my god um anyways and midas hopefully
gets<00:01:13.470> his<00:01:13.590> fish<00:01:13.770> factory<00:01:14.400> down<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.760> no<00:01:15.090> he

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
gets his fish factory down with no he

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.670 
gets his fish factory down with no he
did<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> stitch<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.259> down<00:01:16.409> before

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
did get a stitch back to down before

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
did get a stitch back to down before
that<00:01:16.830> bear<00:01:16.979> expert<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.909> he's<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.360> be

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that bear expert now so he's going to be

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.890 
that bear expert now so he's going to be
okay<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.170> minute<00:01:19.640> until<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.299> next<00:01:21.600> set<00:01:21.869> of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
okay for a minute until the next set of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
okay for a minute until the next set of
basis<00:01:22.380> goes<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.830> they're<00:01:23.250> probably<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
basis goes up they're probably going to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.490 
basis goes up they're probably going to
make<00:01:23.909> third<00:01:24.119> basis<00:01:24.509> each<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:24.930> before<00:01:25.320> too

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
make third basis each of them before too

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.920 
make third basis each of them before too
long<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:26.850> i'll<00:01:27.030> help<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> make<00:01:27.390> remake

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
long and then i'll help to make remake

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.240 
long and then i'll help to make remake
that<00:01:27.960> barrack<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:28.890> factors

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that barrack so you can get more factors

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.340 
that barrack so you can get more factors
by<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> meantime<00:01:29.759> two<00:01:30.570> basis<00:01:30.900> versus<00:01:31.229> two

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
by the meantime two basis versus two

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.810 
by the meantime two basis versus two
bases<00:01:31.680> five<00:01:32.280> factors<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.240> five<00:01:33.420> factories<00:01:34.820> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
bases five factors of five factories the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.370 
bases five factors of five factories the
only<00:01:36.030> difference<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.259> now

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
only difference that they have right now

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.649 
only difference that they have right now
is<00:01:37.500> i<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.240> washington<00:01:39.240> has<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.390> few

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
is i think that washington has a few

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.109 
is i think that washington has a few
more<00:01:39.780> forces<00:01:40.350> minus<00:01:41.280> has<00:01:41.460> goliath<00:01:41.909> but

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
more forces minus has goliath but

for those two tanks they're going to try

I<00:02:54.650> think<00:02:54.860> that<00:02:54.950> was<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.100> really<00:02:55.250> good<00:02:55.430> move<00:02:55.580> that

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
I think that was a really good move that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.300 
I think that was a really good move that
is<00:02:56.060> going<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:56.300> put<00:02:56.450> mines<00:02:56.810> everywhere<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.560> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
is going to put mines everywhere and the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.970 
is going to put mines everywhere and the
rates<00:02:58.580> still<00:02:59.000> marauding<00:02:59.600> around<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.200> think<00:03:00.920> it

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
rates still marauding around I think it

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.930 
rates still marauding around I think it
might<00:03:01.130> have<00:03:01.190> gotten<00:03:01.340> taken<00:03:01.490> off<00:03:01.670> by<00:03:01.700> that

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
might have gotten taken off by that

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.760 
might have gotten taken off by that
glides<00:03:02.390> actually<00:03:02.690> all<00:03:03.020> those<00:03:03.290> mines<00:03:03.500> gonna<00:03:03.680> go

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
glides actually all those mines gonna go

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.470 
glides actually all those mines gonna go
off<00:03:03.860> he<00:03:04.010> might<00:03:04.040> kill<00:03:04.310> zone<00:03:04.610> Mike<00:03:05.120> ozone

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
off he might kill zone Mike ozone

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.880 
off he might kill zone Mike ozone
