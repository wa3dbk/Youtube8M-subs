00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
have seen these hands on just figured

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.599 
have seen these hands on just figured
this<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.529> nice<00:00:19.680> fall<00:00:20.010> day<00:00:20.039> that's

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
the salt that's the Wasatch Mountains

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.000 
the salt that's the Wasatch Mountains
that's<00:00:23.519> right<00:00:23.699> here<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:23.970> Salt<00:00:24.330> Lake<00:00:24.390> City<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
that's right here in Salt Lake City and

Sportline sedan this is the all wheel
drive<00:00:31.980> version<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.940> thought<00:00:33.149> I'd<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.420> give

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
drive version so I thought I'd just give

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.870 
drive version so I thought I'd just give
you<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> quick<00:00:33.870> rundown<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.380> everything<00:00:34.880> before

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
I get it rolling here so as you can see

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.479 
I get it rolling here so as you can see
this<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> completely<00:00:40.620> stock<00:00:40.890> system<00:00:41.190> it's

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
handle it's a traditional flip top style

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.490 
handle it's a traditional flip top style
kind<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> nitros<00:01:11.960> this<00:01:12.960> engine<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
kind of like the nitros this engine is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.700 
kind of like the nitros this engine is
as<00:01:13.619> an<00:01:13.770> OG<00:01:14.189> 270<00:01:14.909> RC<00:01:15.299> which<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> 26<00:01:16.320> cc<00:01:16.680> engine

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
as an OG 270 RC which is a 26 cc engine

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.240 
as an OG 270 RC which is a 26 cc engine
I<00:01:17.270> just<00:01:18.270> barely<00:01:19.020> clean<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> air<00:01:19.680> filter<00:01:20.100> as

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
I just barely clean the air filter as

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.560 
I just barely clean the air filter as
well<00:01:20.280> since<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:20.880> pretty<00:01:21.000> dirty<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
well since it's pretty dirty from the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.100 
well since it's pretty dirty from the
last<00:01:21.869> outing<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.479> see<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:24.990> it's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
last outing so as you can see here it's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.410 
last outing so as you can see here it's
pretty<00:01:25.290> basic<00:01:25.500> layout<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.340> got<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> standard

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
pretty basic layout it's got a standard

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
pretty basic layout it's got a standard
sized<00:01:27.600> throttle<00:01:28.049> brake<00:01:28.200> servo<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:29.070> got<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sized throttle brake servo it's got a

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.330 
sized throttle brake servo it's got a
quarter<00:01:29.820> scale<00:01:30.060> size<00:01:30.829> steering<00:01:31.829> servo<00:01:32.130> there

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
quarter scale size steering servo there

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.300 
quarter scale size steering servo there
it's<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> high-tech<00:01:32.759> 805<00:01:33.600> mg<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.380> that's<00:01:35.009> ass<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's a high-tech 805 mg and that's ass a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.749 
it's a high-tech 805 mg and that's ass a
voxel<00:01:35.759> 251<00:01:36.479> mg<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> throttle

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
voxel 251 mg for the for the throttle

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.940 
voxel 251 mg for the for the throttle
brake<00:01:38.970> there<00:01:39.210> what's<00:01:40.170> pretty<00:01:40.380> cool<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:40.860> you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
brake there what's pretty cool is if you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.710 
brake there what's pretty cool is if you
look<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.150> kind<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.600> this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
look right here you can kind of see this

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.410 
look right here you can kind of see this
black<00:01:43.100> piece<00:01:44.100> raised<00:01:44.430> off<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.670> chassis<00:01:45.180> there

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
black piece raised off the chassis there

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
black piece raised off the chassis there
along<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.290> underneath<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:49.009> underneath<00:01:50.009> the

along with underneath the underneath the
exhaust<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.790> engine<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.270> that's

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
exhaust and the engine here that's

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.929 
exhaust and the engine here that's
actually<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.320> belt<00:01:52.560> tunnel<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
actually the the belt tunnel for the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.050 
actually the the belt tunnel for the
all-wheel-drive<00:01:54.240> system<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:56.009> belt<00:01:56.399> truck

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
all-wheel-drive system so a belt truck

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.389 
all-wheel-drive system so a belt truck
goes<00:01:57.450> around<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.200> differential<00:01:58.860> inside

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
goes around the differential inside

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.359 
goes around the differential inside
there<00:01:59.780> goes<00:02:00.780> all<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.079> way<00:02:01.290> through<00:02:01.409> up<00:02:01.829> around

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
there goes all the way through up around

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.980 
there goes all the way through up around
the<00:02:02.520> front<00:02:02.700> diff<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.450> completely

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the front diff so it's a completely

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.190 
the front diff so it's a completely
sealed<00:02:04.640> system<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.930> don't<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
sealed system so that you don't have to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.479 
sealed system so that you don't have to
worry<00:02:07.320> about<00:02:07.409> getting<00:02:07.590> rocks<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.310> things

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
worry about getting rocks and things

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.469 
worry about getting rocks and things
like<00:02:08.640> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
like that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.420 
like that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
the drive shafts up front just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.619 
the drive shafts up front just
normal<00:02:14.110> dog<00:02:14.319> bones<00:02:14.620> they're<00:02:14.950> pretty<00:02:15.159> beefy

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
normal dog bones they're pretty beefy

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.380 
normal dog bones they're pretty beefy
it's<00:02:16.629> got<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> lower<00:02:17.379> anti-sway<00:02:18.340> bars<00:02:18.610> alloy

it's got a lower anti-sway bars alloy
shock<00:02:19.720> bodies<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:21.519> another<00:02:21.760> pretty

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
shock bodies and then another pretty

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.970 
shock bodies and then another pretty
little<00:02:22.360> trick<00:02:22.659> unit<00:02:23.049> is<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.439> it<00:02:23.860> has

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
little trick unit is is it has

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.339 
little trick unit is is it has
mechanical<00:02:24.340> front<00:02:24.819> brakes<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:26.049> can<00:02:26.170> see

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
mechanical front brakes you can see

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.770 
mechanical front brakes you can see
right<00:02:26.500> here<00:02:26.530> they're<00:02:26.860> cable<00:02:27.250> operated<00:02:27.780> with

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
right here they're cable operated with

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.880 
right here they're cable operated with
the<00:02:28.860> servo<00:02:29.860> they're<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:31.450> pretty<00:02:32.019> standard<00:02:32.590> set

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the servo they're so pretty standard set

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.240 
the servo they're so pretty standard set
up<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:34.420> figure<00:02:34.750> will<00:02:34.989> run<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.829> around<00:02:35.980> a

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
up just figure will run it around a

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.490 
up just figure will run it around a
little<00:02:36.489> bit<00:02:36.609> I've<00:02:36.819> got<00:02:36.970> my<00:02:37.120> replay<00:02:37.569> stuck<00:02:38.290> on

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
little bit I've got my replay stuck on

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.460 
little bit I've got my replay stuck on
the<00:02:38.650> on<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.939> top<00:02:40.120> there<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.959> can<00:02:41.140> we

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
the on the top there so that it can we

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.589 
the on the top there so that it can we
can<00:02:41.650> get<00:02:41.769> some<00:02:41.980> onboard<00:02:42.430> video<00:02:43.090> while<00:02:43.480> we're

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
can get some onboard video while we're

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.440 
can get some onboard video while we're
at<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.849> just<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.370> my<00:02:48.519> head<00:02:48.730> strap<00:02:49.090> for

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
at it so just this is my head strap for

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.300 
at it so just this is my head strap for
the<00:02:49.540> GoPro<00:02:50.019> it's<00:02:50.200> pretty<00:02:50.409> sweet<00:02:50.709> it's<00:02:50.950> it's

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
the GoPro it's pretty sweet it's it's

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.240 
the GoPro it's pretty sweet it's it's
pretty<00:02:51.489> convenient<00:02:52.109> this<00:02:53.109> is<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.379> radio<00:02:53.739> that

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
pretty convenient this is the radio that

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.140 
pretty convenient this is the radio that
you<00:02:54.280> get<00:02:54.639> the<00:02:55.450> radio<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:56.079> a<00:02:56.109> it's<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:57.150> robotronic

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
you get the radio is a it's a robotronic

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.629 
you get the radio is a it's a robotronic
3<00:02:58.689> channel<00:02:59.049> 2.4<00:02:59.620> gigahertz<00:02:59.829> entry-level

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
3 channel 2.4 gigahertz entry-level

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.349 
3 channel 2.4 gigahertz entry-level
computer<00:03:00.970> radio<00:03:01.389> it's<00:03:02.319> it's<00:03:02.980> OAM<00:03:03.549> through<00:03:04.090> air

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
computer radio it's it's OAM through air

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.479 
computer radio it's it's OAM through air
Tronics<00:03:04.959> so<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.650> pretty<00:03:05.829> decent<00:03:06.069> little

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
Tronics so it's a pretty decent little

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.670 
Tronics so it's a pretty decent little
setup<00:03:06.700> I'll<00:03:07.329> eventually<00:03:07.689> change<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.319> out<00:03:08.439> with

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
setup I'll eventually change it out with

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.000 
setup I'll eventually change it out with
my<00:03:08.950> arrow<00:03:09.459> XM<00:03:09.970> 11<00:03:10.389> but<00:03:10.629> I'm<00:03:11.590> just<00:03:11.799> trying<00:03:11.980> to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
my arrow XM 11 but I'm just trying to

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.879 
my arrow XM 11 but I'm just trying to
get<00:03:12.159> used<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.670> since<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:14.590> what<00:03:14.739> most

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
get used to it since this is what most

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.009 
get used to it since this is what most
people<00:03:15.220> will<00:03:15.370> drive<00:03:15.609> with<00:03:15.849> it<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.780> buy<00:03:16.959> the

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
people will drive with it that buy the

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.439 
people will drive with it that buy the
car<00:03:17.290> from<00:03:17.439> us<00:03:17.620> new<00:03:17.889> so<00:03:18.250> I've<00:03:18.940> already<00:03:19.209> kind<00:03:19.299> of

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:19.449 
car from us new so I've already kind of

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.939 
car from us new so I've already kind of
got<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.660> warmed<00:03:19.930> up<00:03:20.109> so<00:03:20.349> it<00:03:20.410> should<00:03:20.560> just<00:03:20.590> fire

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
got it warmed up so it should just fire

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.430 
got it warmed up so it should just fire
up<00:03:21.190> here
