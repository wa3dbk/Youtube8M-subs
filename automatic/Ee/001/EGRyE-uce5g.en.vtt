00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
along with cement from sadly tonight

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.169 
along with cement from sadly tonight
we're<00:00:13.650> here<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.860> talk<00:00:14.009> about<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> simple

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
we're here to talk about the I simple

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.220 
we're here to talk about the I simple
transient<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.109> 77<00:00:16.800> iPod<00:00:17.250> interface<00:00:18.020> an<00:00:19.020> old

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
transient is 77 iPod interface an old

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.650 
transient is 77 iPod interface an old
jewelery<00:00:19.560> interface<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.270> piece<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
jewelery interface so this piece is a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.779 
jewelery interface so this piece is a
basically<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.220> hardwired

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
basically what it is is it's a hardwired

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.540 
basically what it is is it's a hardwired
FM<00:00:24.210> modulated<00:00:24.750> unit<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.279> allow

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
FM modulated unit that is going to allow

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.169 
FM modulated unit that is going to allow
you<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.789> get<00:00:27.750> your<00:00:28.050> iPhone<00:00:28.560> or<00:00:29.279> iPod<00:00:29.699> device

playing into your car through an FM

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.910 
playing into your car through an FM
modulated<00:00:33.510> signal<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.469> actually<00:00:34.800> going

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
modulated signal and it's actually going

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.370 
modulated signal and it's actually going
to<00:00:34.980> charge<00:00:35.309> your<00:00:35.579> device<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> same<00:00:36.960> time

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
to charge your device at the same time

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440 
to charge your device at the same time
right<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:38.280> not<00:00:38.460> like<00:00:38.610> any<00:00:38.820> other<00:00:38.940> FM

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
right it's not like any other FM

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.850 
right it's not like any other FM
modulator<00:00:39.899> where<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.170> wireless<00:00:40.410> is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
modulator where it's wireless is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410 
modulator where it's wireless is
actually<00:00:41.129> directly<00:00:41.610> wired<00:00:41.850> through<00:00:42.300> your

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
actually directly wired through your

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.770 
actually directly wired through your
car's<00:00:42.660> antenna<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.770> what<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> does<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
car's antenna so what it does it it

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
car's antenna so what it does it it
interferes<00:00:45.780> your<00:00:46.020> FM<00:00:46.379> antenna<00:00:46.829> that's<00:00:47.309> coming

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
interferes your FM antenna that's coming

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.270 
interferes your FM antenna that's coming
in<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.910> put<00:00:48.149> your<00:00:48.300> iPod<00:00:48.719> or<00:00:48.960> pretty<00:00:49.890> much<00:00:50.039> any

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
in and put your iPod or pretty much any

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.939 
in and put your iPod or pretty much any
other<00:00:50.430> auxiliary<00:00:51.180> device<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.140> it

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
other auxiliary device that you have it

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.700 
other auxiliary device that you have it
could<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.489> Zune<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.149> could<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.510> any<00:00:55.230> anything

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
could be a Zune it could be any anything

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.139 
could be a Zune it could be any anything
with<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> headphone<00:00:56.100> jack<00:00:56.370> basically<00:00:57.030> your

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
with a headphone jack basically your

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.779 
with a headphone jack basically your
phone<00:00:57.469> and<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.070> play<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.430> right<00:00:59.460> through<00:00:59.730> your

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
phone and and play it right through your

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.310 
phone and and play it right through your
Syria<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:00.960> set<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
Syria so what we do is we set it to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.789 
Syria so what we do is we set it to
usually<00:01:01.739> 88.9<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.180> car<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:04.110> hit<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.619> hit

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
usually 88.9 and in a car we hit you hit

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.670 
usually 88.9 and in a car we hit you hit
a<00:01:04.830> switch<00:01:05.100> turns<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.240> transmits<00:01:07.170> only

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
a switch turns this on transmits only

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.130 
a switch turns this on transmits only
this<00:01:07.860> through<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.610> car<00:01:08.880> radio<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.960> can
