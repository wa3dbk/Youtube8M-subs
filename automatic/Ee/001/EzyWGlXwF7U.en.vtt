can kind of see see some parts of it

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.249 
can kind of see see some parts of it
just<00:05:23.159> are<00:05:23.460> just<00:05:24.120> little<00:05:24.509> pockets<00:05:24.960> of<00:05:25.050> egg

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
just are just little pockets of egg

just are just little pockets of egg
white<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:27.180> don't<00:05:27.300> want<00:05:27.509> that<00:05:27.659> so<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:28.229> want<00:05:28.500> to

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
white you don't want that so you want to

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.240 
white you don't want that so you want to
mix<00:05:29.250> it<00:05:29.490> pretty<00:05:30.060> well<00:05:30.300> but<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:31.740> don't<00:05:31.770> want<00:05:32.099> to

mix it pretty well but you don't want to

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.829 
mix it pretty well but you don't want to
use<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:32.430> blender<00:05:32.939> and<00:05:33.060> blend<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.539> all<00:05:33.629> together

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:33.839 
use a blender and blend it all together

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:38.450 
use a blender and blend it all together
because<00:05:34.259> then<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.919> egg<00:05:35.639> whites<00:05:35.909> will<00:05:37.069> the<00:05:38.069> air

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
because then the egg whites will the air

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.110 
because then the egg whites will the air
bubbles<00:05:38.969> and<00:05:39.149> the<00:05:39.240> egg<00:05:39.389> whites<00:05:39.629> will<00:05:39.839> pop<00:05:41.120> so

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
bubbles and the egg whites will pop so

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.559 
bubbles and the egg whites will pop so
that's<00:05:42.569> it<00:05:43.279> set<00:05:44.279> the<00:05:44.370> oven<00:05:44.520> to<00:05:44.729> about<00:05:45.060> 300

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569

degrees and put it in the center of the

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:49.790 
degrees and put it in the center of the
pan<00:05:47.689> of<00:05:48.689> course<00:05:48.930> while<00:05:49.110> you're<00:05:49.139> doing<00:05:49.589> all

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
outside just you want to do this so that

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.309 
outside just you want to do this so that
the<00:06:02.729> bottom<00:06:03.089> of<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.419> of<00:06:03.719> the<00:06:04.080> cake<00:06:04.289> pan

doesn't<00:06:04.979> get<00:06:05.099> too<00:06:05.279> hot<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.819> they'll<00:06:06.060> burn<00:06:06.300> the

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:06.629

cake so right now it's like a nice
insulator<00:06:10.560> so<00:06:10.889> that<00:06:11.099> they'll<00:06:11.699> slowly<00:06:12.419> cook<00:06:12.930> it

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
insulator so that they'll slowly cook it

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.579 
insulator so that they'll slowly cook it
to<00:06:13.289> 300<00:06:13.889> 300<00:06:14.699> degrees<00:06:15.089> I'll<00:06:15.870> put<00:06:16.050> this<00:06:16.169> in<00:06:16.229> for

to 300 300 degrees I'll put this in for

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:23.210 
to 300 300 degrees I'll put this in for
about<00:06:16.800> one<00:06:17.069> hour

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
hour and 15 minutes for 300 degrees I

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.830 
hour and 15 minutes for 300 degrees I
poked<00:06:30.160> it<00:06:30.310> right<00:06:30.460> here<00:06:30.700> nothing<00:06:31.390> comes<00:06:31.600> out

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840
