00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.589
 that all delighted to find on live 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.450
 race for which program this Tuesday 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.560
 June 17th the quinté is addressed to the jumpers 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.830
 and take place on the racecourse of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.120
 dieppe 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.740
 here is my selection at once 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.170
 patients made October 11 a rochelais 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.849
 he just ran in steeple-chase but 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.199
 the horse has already proved that he was 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.300
 performant and besides it ends 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.490
 second of this race last 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.630
 I also have you that patrician quinton the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.710
 prefers accordingly for this 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.910
 Logically rendezvous the horse 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.619
 should fight for the first places 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.760
 we will ask him eight old mervans who 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.099
 comes to find its shape by finishing at 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.510
 the arrival of a quinté + second 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.040
 lastly auteuil confirmed me will be 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.079
 logically expected the wall also threat 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.760
 the hymn game said in linder clans are 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.800
 pretty confident with the horse that was 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.809
 spared a horse that in this lot of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.070
 can the first roll anyway 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.930
 he proved he had the means 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.879
 the union dreads a success like a long 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.410
 training of the previous city 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.550
 probably found quite well on 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.270
 the scale of values must be enough 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.980
 to be in the know 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.840
 lemieux found while exploring a horse 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.399
 who was arrested in the last 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.210
 turning last time you have to 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.520
 buy back to find opponents 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.780
 more in its hollow the olympio nir 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.070
 who will have to regain weight 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.789
 all of his rivals of the day but he 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.280
 has just won 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.510
 moreover on the course that we 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.710
 interested in an event where the wind 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.200
 that of his rivals of the day 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.330
 he too will be eager to repeat 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.520
 then for places I'll remember u9 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.510
 vianès in my opinion ian s has no more 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.100
 room for maneuver at this level of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.479
 competition that said he's still 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.159
 Presented wisely by François 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.689
 nicolle he's in shape he should be 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.689
 please on this course is enough to 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.860
 to interfere in the winning quinté 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.229
 be careful also in this test 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 at number 14 romeo ungraised him too 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.740
 seems barred for the first places 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.909
 but I know that philippe way is 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.650
 not negative for obtaining a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.729
 accessit and the horse as such 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.570
 may well come hard on the reports 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.130
 of the quinté 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.210
 us encrypted summary for this 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.120
 competition on the 11th of 8th the 6th on the 12th 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.340
 followed by 3 of 1 of the nine and 14 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.900
 in case of non starters or for regret 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.390
 I will quote number 13 or she is 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.920
 named is largely the size of a 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.960
 lot like that one and like that one 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.350
 but whose form remains subject to 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.119
 bail 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.710
 for resuming the program 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.080
 dieppe always philippe confident way 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.940
 that six years a recital valtat in this 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.680
 race to claim the horse faces a 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.180
 nice opportunity to play first 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.220
 roles his main opponent will be without 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.740
 doubt that six years of virginia desires 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.910
 so match to 2,600 1,602,602 so serene 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.009
 it's a matter of printing for your 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.050
 binoculars order the sands of olonne en 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.270
 meeting ii at the coast he is confident that 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.790
 without a gap in a which has two successes 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.020
 in as many benefits this year 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.280
 nothing stands in the way of a confirmation the 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.840
 mare to stay well she will make a 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.410
 once again his race opposition the 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.580
 105 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.680
 a navy that started victoriously 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.840
 on the transfer account we will try to 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.090
 preserve his invincibility and the 106 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.350
 also to this cra who is on the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.519
 rising and that must finish on the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.830
 podium of a race like this 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.850
 in the third 309 idea then get 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.140
 notice several times in 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.310
 province aligns itself from this 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.049
 test with ambitions to half 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.400
 of trust the horse will enjoy himself on 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.850
 this run of holding and in these 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.350
 terms 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.810
 for this horse a little immature he 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.190
 should also play the victory he has 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.170
 perfectly means my opinion of 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.120
 pass the pole in the lead 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 in the sixth I advise you 603 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.220
 early grasshoppers that started well on 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.959
 brooms lately it was this prono 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.340
 Compiegne confirmation stretched the horse 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.030
 accused of logis progress on 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.180
 this benefit 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.930
 concerning the 601 to mx may 2 stivell it 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.180
 comes from 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.000
 ahead of the 603 so atos new 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.430
 but know that the beginnings of this without 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.629
 an almunia stivell on the racecourse of 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.489
 angers lion running in April was 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.719
 satisfactory and if we judge on 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.879
 this benefit he has perfectly the 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.829
 means of him also playing the first 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.420
 3.6 3.6 roles on a target price is at 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.939
 sands of olonne with sands-of 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.040
 meeting the first with the 101 la 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.859
 third expression 9 and the sixth is 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.569
 the 6 years 3 and the 6 in a word 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.319
 also on the meeting 80 scenes I 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.209
 several favorites and you 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.829
 tell him the 208 doe of the cloud she 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.329
 is estimated she has three races 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.669
 three wins this is a filly of 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.989
 quality in my opinion she can succeed the 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.730
 goes from four to the blood 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.590
 three awakening tapes to what's left over 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.669
 two successes in cherbourg and then recently to 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.950
 vincennes confirmation also 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:49.260
 expected from 108.2 are three for the 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.669
 radius 4 to vincennes in the 4th always 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.709
 vincennes i know philippe georges 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.250
 or I really like the 450 and 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.049
 export 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.489
 from his late protected 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.780
 gains better so keep him in good 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.040
 rank of your games for potential 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.299
 paired with the 406 which finds here a 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.280
 a great opportunity to get in 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.290
 evidence its wins a choice that's all 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.879
 to perform well under the saddle and who 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.549
 rarely disappointed in this discipline 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.720
 and the 403 alchemist deyn who stays on 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.139
 a success on the course that we 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.060
 interested 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.239
 it must also be enough to make 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.090
 the arrival of this event 405 406 and 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.580
 403 for this meeting 96 small word 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.599
 also on the 608 biscuits of lavera 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.889
 remember I told you 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.270
 during his last success the horse 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.780
 started under the saddle about to 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.040
 caen 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.300
 he imposed himself easily it's a 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.280
 choice that is cut to succeed in 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.660
 discipline is what has always 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.000
 indicated the jewelry family and in this 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.230
 lot this 608 biscuits of lavera seems to me 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.610
 able to confirm in the region 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.050
 Paris after a good victory 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.490
 acquired on the flights of horns 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.810
 opposition quickly biscuits lavera for a 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.300
 confirmation for those targeted to 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.580
 vincennes in meeting iv the second the 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.060
 4th and 6th very good game at all good 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.060
 day yesterday
