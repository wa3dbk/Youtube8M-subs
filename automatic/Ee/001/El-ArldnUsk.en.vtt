00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:18.210
 the price of gold rose in a way 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:21.210
 fast between the year 2003 and 2011 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.510
 and reached a historic high of 900 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.529
 dollars the ounce which is about 45 euros per 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.710
 gram 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.769
 and there are various reasons that explain the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.969
 Gold price growth some 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.969
 reasons that he achieved and is like the others 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.350
 others the raw materials that your 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.329
 price depends on supply and demand 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.460
 and during these years there was a great 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.590
 lawsuit that came from china and india 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.600
 poor countries that are getting richer 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.539
 whose citizens also want to buy 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.680
 jewelry therefore increases 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.239
 systematically demand for gold and for 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.180
 so the price goes up as it went up 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.239
 the price of oil wood from 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.699
 all all the raw materials but 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.300
 gold has another important factor that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.390
 is that it is the refuge in him 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.280
 wants to which they want to go to people 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.190
 that is very afraid of the collapse of the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.190
 economy in times of crisis over 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.690
 all financial when you do not know for sure 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.460
 if the money you have put in the bag 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.960
 you will recover it when you do not know 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.000
 sure if the money you 've put in 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.410
 a house you will recover when 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.240
 he is not even sure that the 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.430
 you will recover them because the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.260
 bank may fail and it is not clear that 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.450
 the guarantee funds have their have 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.270
 enough money in these moments of 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.270
 panic a lot of people go and buy by 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.940
 because once the crisis ends, 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.909
 we know if there will be banks and there will be will be 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.310
 if there will be homes or if there will be 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.999
 the deposits what we do know for sure 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.770
 is that if we have kept a gold thread 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.750
 in the drawer or under the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.530
 pillow there will be and we can 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.079
 sell and we can live and therefore 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.689
 during the panic period there was a 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.109
 great demand for people in a state of 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.750
 panic that bought gold these people have 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.819
 disappeared the Chinese are still buying 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.860
 gold the Indians is still charging but the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.099
 people coming from the panic has stopped 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.410
 have panic because the big ones the 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.010
 great catastrophes that should come in 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.730
 2012-2013 never materialized europe 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.519
 the cliff never broke the price 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.920
 US fiscal did not materialize on 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.200
 forced landing forced landing 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.750
 the india of the china never 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.760
 materialized the global financial crisis 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.390
 that had to collapse the system 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.780
 corrupt financial since it did not appear 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.760
 even the wars between Iranian 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.700
 israel for the uranium issue 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.430
 enriched that he was buying 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.550
 neither step and therefore these these 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.800
 great potential for catastrophe not 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.739
 have appeared and therefore already now 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.440
 it does not make any sense to have gold because 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.140
 have gold gold is a precious metal 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.860
 that does not pay dividends or pay interest and 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.440
 therefore if one has honor saved 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.599
 a lot of time then ends up losing 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.970
 money because unlike bonuses 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.739
 or unlike the actions that pay 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.299
 dividends do not pay interest that gold 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.360
 does not pay anything and therefore once 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.160
 the gold disappeared the investors it 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.549
 they are removing above and this makes 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.950
 from the year 2011 until today gold has 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.220
 lost again in almost the third part 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.220
 of its value
