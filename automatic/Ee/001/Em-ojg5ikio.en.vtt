it has a dropped ceiling here drop to
seven<00:00:21.470> feet<00:00:21.740> which<00:00:22.130> made<00:00:22.460> this<00:00:22.760> space<00:00:23.180> that<00:00:23.210> I

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
seven feet which made this space that I

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.560 
seven feet which made this space that I
have<00:00:23.689> as<00:00:23.869> you<00:00:23.900> can<00:00:23.990> see<00:00:24.699> horizontal<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.539> I

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
have as you can see horizontal so I

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.810 
have as you can see horizontal so I
chose<00:00:27.080> to<00:00:27.410> put<00:00:27.619> two<00:00:27.800> pieces<00:00:28.039> of<00:00:28.189> art<00:00:28.460> together

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.120 
chose to put two pieces of art together
I<00:00:29.090> thought<00:00:29.420> black<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:30.050> white<00:00:30.289> photos<00:00:30.980> would

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
I thought black and white photos would

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.650 
I thought black and white photos would
be<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.369> way<00:00:31.490> to<00:00:31.519> go<00:00:31.820> instead<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:32.420> using

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
be the way to go instead of using

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.830 
be the way to go instead of using

actually three-dimensional it is a shelf
we're<00:02:25.880> going<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.060> place<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.390> on<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.600> wall<00:02:26.780> do

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
we're going to place it on the wall do

we're going to place it on the wall do
you<00:02:27.020> see<00:02:27.230> how<00:02:27.410> now<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> vertical<00:02:29.480> piece

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
you see how now this is a vertical piece
