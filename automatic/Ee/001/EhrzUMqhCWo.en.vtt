00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.660 
right there because it's just not no
insulation<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:22.290> cast<00:04:22.890> iron<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.460> most

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
insulation so cast iron is the most

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.440 
insulation so cast iron is the most
effective<00:04:24.450> heating<00:04:24.750> element<00:04:25.110> on<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.290> planet

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
effective heating element on the planet

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.990 
effective heating element on the planet
