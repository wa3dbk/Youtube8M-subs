members and I want to address a question
that's<00:00:09.510> fast<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:10.290> lot<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.740> times<00:00:10.920> when<00:00:11.070> they

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
that's fast a lot of times when they

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.669 
that's fast a lot of times when they
when<00:00:11.460> they<00:00:11.580> see<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:12.269> what<00:00:12.389> we<00:00:12.540> do<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.080> stick

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
when they see that what we do is stick

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.200 
when they see that what we do is stick
fighting<00:00:13.860> hence<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.340> -<00:00:14.730> stick<00:00:14.880> fighter<00:00:15.030> Club

fighting hence the - stick fighter Club
name<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.690> how<00:00:15.960> practical<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.770> martial<00:00:17.130> art

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
name and how practical a martial art

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.189 
name and how practical a martial art
like<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.699> when<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.510> relying<00:00:18.840> mostly<00:00:18.990> on

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
like this is when it's relying mostly on

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.460 
like this is when it's relying mostly on
sticks<00:00:20.600> people<00:00:21.600> don't<00:00:21.750> carry<00:00:22.080> sticks<00:00:22.350> around

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
sticks people don't carry sticks around

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.509 
sticks people don't carry sticks around
with<00:00:22.740> them<00:00:22.859> all<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> time<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.340> that's<00:00:23.400> really

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
with them all the time and that's really

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.040 
with them all the time and that's really
the<00:00:23.760> basis<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.210> question<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.900> that's

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the basis for the question and that's

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.170 
the basis for the question and that's
really<00:00:25.439> not<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.619> point<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:26.490> train<00:00:27.000> with

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
really not the point we train with

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.419 
really not the point we train with
sticks<00:00:27.650> for<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> lot<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.010> different<00:00:29.279> reasons

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
sticks for a lot of different reasons

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.820 
sticks for a lot of different reasons
one<00:00:30.269> reason<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> stick<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> really

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
one reason is that a stick is a really

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.100 
one reason is that a stick is a really
simple<00:00:32.640> representative<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> any<00:00:33.780> kind<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
simple representative of any kind of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.360 
simple representative of any kind of
implement<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.680> find<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.040> ground

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
implement you can find on the ground

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.580 
implement you can find on the ground
whether<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.390> an<00:00:36.630> actual<00:00:37.079> branch<00:00:37.380> or

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
whether that be an actual branch or

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.229 
whether that be an actual branch or
stick<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> ground<00:00:38.250> whether<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
stick on the ground whether that be a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.510 
stick on the ground whether that be a
lead<00:00:39.629> pipe<00:00:39.840> or<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> piece<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.410> PVC<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> piece

lead pipe or a piece of PVC or a piece
of<00:00:41.700> wood<00:00:41.879> or<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.329> baseball<00:00:42.629> bat<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
of wood or a baseball bat it's all the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.369 
of wood or a baseball bat it's all the
mechanics<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> learn<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:46.020> these

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
mechanics of what you learn with these

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.520 
mechanics of what you learn with these
more<00:00:46.590> formal<00:00:46.920> training<00:00:47.190> stick<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:48.530> easily

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
more formal training stick is easily

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.630 
more formal training stick is easily
applicable<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> self-defense<00:00:50.399> situation

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
applicable to a self-defense situation

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.970 
applicable to a self-defense situation
it's<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> reasons<00:00:51.750> why<00:00:51.980> something

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it's one of the reasons why something

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.619 
it's one of the reasons why something
like<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> reasons<00:00:54.539> why

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
like this just one of the reasons why

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.970 
like this just one of the reasons why
something<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.829> well

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
something like this is really well

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.729 
something like this is really well
matched<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> person<00:00:58.140> who<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.559> as

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
matched for a person who is not as

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.900 
matched for a person who is not as
physically<00:00:59.129> strong<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.520> their<00:00:59.670> attacker

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
physically strong as their attacker

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
physically strong as their attacker
maybe<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:00.930> default<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> using<00:01:01.620> tools

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
maybe because we default to using tools

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490 
maybe because we default to using tools
so<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> smaller<00:01:03.149> person<00:01:03.539> who<00:01:03.870> picks<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.290> tool

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
so a smaller person who picks up a tool

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.250 
so a smaller person who picks up a tool
and<00:01:04.890> very<00:01:05.040> easily<00:01:05.309> level<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> playing<00:01:06.030> field

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
and very easily level the playing field

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
and very easily level the playing field
against<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> larger<00:01:07.590> attacker<00:01:07.890> now<00:01:08.610> what<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
against the larger attacker now what I

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.969 
against the larger attacker now what I
want<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> show<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.260> how<00:01:10.500> some<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
want to show in this is how some of the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.260 
want to show in this is how some of the
principles<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.580> using<00:01:11.729> stick<00:01:12.210> apply<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:13.320> other

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
principles of using stick apply to other

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
principles of using stick apply to other
self-defense<00:01:15.270> scenarios<00:01:15.720> okay<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.920> use<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
self-defense scenarios okay we use a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
self-defense scenarios okay we use a
certain<00:01:17.700> couple<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.060> coordination<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.810> we're

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
certain couple of coordination of we're

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.760 
certain couple of coordination of we're
going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.200> persons<00:01:19.439> I'm<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> bow<00:01:19.740> in

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
going to do persons I'm going to bow in

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.760 
going to do persons I'm going to bow in
nutrition<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.810> we're<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.259> pin<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:22.710> we

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
nutrition and we're going to pin what we

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.260 
nutrition and we're going to pin what we
call<00:01:22.920> open<00:01:23.220> position<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.700> we're<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.090> do

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
call open position and we're going to do

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
call open position and we're going to do
a<00:01:24.540> double<00:01:25.170> stick<00:01:25.439> drill<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.770> call<00:01:25.920> four<00:01:26.130> count

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
a double stick drill we call four count

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.920 
a double stick drill we call four count
four<00:01:26.939> count<00:01:27.119> works<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
four count works like this we do a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:45.219 
four count works like this we do a
forehand

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.679 

okay<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:47.790> people<00:01:48.090> look<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.540> it's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
okay so people look at that and it's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.789 
okay so people look at that and it's
like<00:01:48.810> okay<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.079> when<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.439> ever<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.740> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
like okay so when are you ever going to
