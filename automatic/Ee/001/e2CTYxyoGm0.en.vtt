00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.670
 Hello dear friends, I already 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.050
 many times answered this question what 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.029
 better pray quiet 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.130
 or moment flock in this case we are strength 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.720
 we play barbarians and despite that you 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.430
 continue to ask this question therefore 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.960
 I want to record a separate video and more 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.059
 this question does not go back now 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.789
 we'll do a simple experiment with you 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.279
 we have two prayers one is the cross 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.009
 lok'tar on which there is a physical 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.960
 the elements of cole and akasha causes anyone to turn 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.569
 attention critical damage at 80 20 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.890
 percent just from a little 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.720
 ok but a little bit the other way 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.850
 we have a district rondoval with very good 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.250
 Prokom this ancient amulet and he 900 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.780
 power plus 100 critical damage more 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.820
 impossible and nine and a half 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.640
 eco inox black thorn probability 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.130
 critical strike we let's compare 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.200
 In a big way this amulet is better than numbers 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.170
 he is much better but strength in him instead 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.680
 see the elements with what damage gives us 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.320
 tom years with the elements with the physical he gives 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.980
 us two million freak now we change 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.590
 him to 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.710
 ron gave whose things are much better but 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.859
 power instead of poems and we get 1 million 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.850
 nine hundred and forty eight thousand damage so 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:11.890
 that even despite the more modest use 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.380
 at the cross blektornn and he gives us more 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.469
 damage because there are elements instead 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.990
 force what to say about the situation in 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.170
 which here we would not have 900 power 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.030
 750 if the medallion were not ancient what 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.740
 to say that it would be if 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.090
 here front or there would be no weave 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.159
 critical damage was bender 85 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.299
 the element gives us more damage even if 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.280
 without the elements we would have higher numbers 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.319
 so it seems to me there is no point for 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.479
 reflections if we use only 1 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.469
 the verses are definitely in the omelet better on 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.840
 the role of his poems 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.520
 if we use a lot of elements like 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.679
 in the case of the arch for example with through became 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.329
 face then of course in the ears lift 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.219
 intelligence and all four elements 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.139
 intelligence would you then we find ourselves in 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.509
 plus but if as it happens with 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:00.909
 barbarians we have only one element combat 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.219
 it is better to beg and there was an element 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.289
 they are power that will be power we 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.119
 just saw a wonderful use with 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.690
 force loses the middle trick with 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.680
 elements but that there were no 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.390
 misunderstandings let's still small 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.170
 nuance still clarify look 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.640
 this amulet is better than this one but this one 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.580
 amulet is better than this 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.050
 Suppose we do not compare 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.420
 physical elements here are windows and let's say 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.800
 that verse on there are verses here is this amulet 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.390
 caved in so badly that his contribution 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.030
 in damage despite the fact that there are poems 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.459
 they will have less mainstage than this 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.239
 amulet that is such a simple form 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.730
 in the end the poorly awakened element is worse 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.520
 what's great bending amine stud 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.190
 well awakened mines become worse than 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.550
 middle caved in and the element's Friends 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.700
 everything 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.320
 I was as detailed as possible more 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.239
 convincingly answer this question I already 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.700
 not able if still remain 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.440
 questions i give up i have nothing here 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.630
 I can't say any more thanks 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.340
