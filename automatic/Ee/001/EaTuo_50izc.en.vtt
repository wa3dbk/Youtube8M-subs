1080<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.030> first<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> mean<00:00:57.899> my<00:00:58.140> friend<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
1080 the first one I mean my friend it

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
1080 the first one I mean my friend it
does<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.489> different

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
does one it's a little different

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.819 
does one it's a little different
variation<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.300> mine's<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> first<00:01:01.050> true

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
variation but mine's the first true

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.260 
variation but mine's the first true
double<00:01:02.430> one<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.789> they<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.030> done<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
double one that they was done a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.450 
double one that they was done a
competition<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.199> I'll<00:01:04.860> claim<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.250> one

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
competition so I'll claim that one

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.469 
competition so I'll claim that one
because<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.060> different<00:01:06.330> than

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
because I do a little different than

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.730 
because I do a little different than
what<00:01:06.540> Shaun<00:01:06.810> -<00:01:07.020> Shaun<00:01:07.080> does<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> little

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
what Shaun - Shaun does a little

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
what Shaun - Shaun does a little
different<00:01:08.100> way<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:09.299> probably<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
different way and so that's probably the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.039 
different way and so that's probably the
new<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.150> they<00:01:12.150> asked<00:01:12.540> one

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
new one that I do a lot they asked one

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
new one that I do a lot they asked one
of<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.200> friends<00:01:13.530> who's<00:01:13.650> an<00:01:13.770> agent<00:01:14.100> who's<00:01:14.280> done
