00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.469
 very good that there are people first is a 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.910
 new channel video and this time 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.439
 I'm here to show you something that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.119
 I think it can be more interesting and that 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.270
 I will try to laugh showing you in a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.789
 series of videos and it's very simple like 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.099
 you know I have the privilege between 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.110
 quotes to be able to access the server 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.059
 tests to the pp server and I know that many 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.619
 of you then you can not access in 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.690
 three clear I feel obligated 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.770
 in quotation marks that of course the people who 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.239
 can access the pepe server and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.770
 You can try all the news that is 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.989
 are implementing on this server 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.340
 Well, of course, if he adapts to play in this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.500
 server so when it's already 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 officially, obviously, people 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.160
 that has already played in the pp will have 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.680
 certain advantage then what is it that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.579
 happens what do I want to try then 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.989
 since many many of you 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.370
 you can not play because at least 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.290
 see a little bit the news that is 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.300
 They are that they are working to make 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.980
 on this server and that's going to be what 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.380
 that I will try to go teaching in a 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.149
 series of videos that I will be doing in 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.860
 first place today is simply something very 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.229
 basic always just teach then 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.549
 a little bit what is visual the jungle 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.799
 let's dedicate enough videos to 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.729
 teach what is the whole topic this of the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.219
 cradle because it will radically change 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.049
 everything is going to change both the use 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.220
 it's more going to change the camps go 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.050
 to change is not going 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.130
 the same route is m that takes 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.990
 doing so far is not going to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.150
 can start with red or blue 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.640
 simply for the times and everything is going to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.290
 change so it's going to be pretty 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.880
 important to keep in mind let's go 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.380
 to the jungle of the enemy to see all 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.180
 the divers since in mine I have done 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.610
 a pair and such to go testing and 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.520
 testing things to get closer to 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.679
 use the dragon first 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.630
 as you saw the typical dragon is worth the 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.899
 highlight for good what is all the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.939
 map is pretty cool as we have already 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.469
 seen in other videos just what 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.939
 is the visual and here we have the dragon 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.439
 good as you see here already has the bar 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.420
 of life which will be easier smith 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.000
 ea also see that this is white is 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.640
 different is not how it is like pink 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.780
 violet something something weird not and you see that 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.799
 it also puts the damage it inflicts is 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.200
 say no need to put the cursor 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.649
 on paper that makes 480 but what 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.420
 see here is , and if more and if it plis 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.700
 here we see that we have here is where 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.380
 now the ghost would be that strange 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.959
 turbid ugly that is because now there is a 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.640
 kind of giant toad gargoyle with 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.519
 a huge chin and normal horns 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.319
 well this is the blue that has its 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.849
 essence of the mandelman there is all the 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.040
 host but they change a little visual 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.230
 and we'll see what a little more give 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.430
 little things, and as you can see, good is 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.750
 must also to life bar so that 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.120
 be a little easier to smith e ar and 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.220
 the whole subject here we have the wolves the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.290
 typical wolves but they do have a 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.420
 something more important our wolves 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.890
 are not the typical wolves his he is that 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.510
 we have so far and well then a 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.079
 bit graphically a little bit better 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.540
 we have the towers and the whole host 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.249
 of no hit let's go to the ghosts 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.150
 or good old ghosts better 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.249
 said the ghosts that we have 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.499
 currently in the 2014 season but in 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.120
 2015 will be like that, it transforms 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.590
 a kind of crows birds that you 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.569
 continue with the look as you see I'm going 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.219
 changing and they follow me with the look the 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.239
 very bastards want me not to put them 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:05.540
 no egg here so it can not 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.150
 burst there is no more and as I say the smile 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.620
 it changes the sense quite and as you see 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.569
 it's pink, but this has an explanation 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.519
 let's put it as you see apart from 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.840
 I have studied it and that is 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.239
 because the use of the bytes and it's going to give 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.889
 pretty much more importance let's go 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.969
 to finish seeing the jungle I will explain 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.949
 this a little better here we have the 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.030
 red as you see it then good still 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.319
 being red you see the life bar 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.599
 to make it much more powerful is Peter 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.769
 and finally the golem equals 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.030
 start more camps that we will go 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.699
 explaining in other short videos the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.019
 basic and goals of a lifetime 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.819
 we can also kill you if we want 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.980
 It's not enough, it's quite true 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.049
 Easy to play olive-tree promises and 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.549
 it took a long time and yes it did not 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.010
 killed a lot at the beginning or nothing 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.000
 it's a lot easier than we have pim 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.340
 pam 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.060
 and fact is worth the golems and as you see here 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.380
 we have a buffet worth this is already 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.060
 explain in more detail to all videos 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.890
 but this is a buffet that give them the 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.360
 fucking bodies that give you a solid 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.370
 that tells you that you are walking you can hear 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.440
 a fucking raven in the background and that's because 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.910
 we have a very good fire is similar to 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.170
 what would be an oracle that we can have 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.660
 now for football is the truth that goes 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.210
 to come in handy to clean things is 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.130
 because here you can see 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.010
 to an enemy that we can see a mood 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.210
 equal and discouraged is not to say a point 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.010
 now that it's enough to complicate a 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.280
 little bit all this more than what is already 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.620
 as an oracle that will come because of 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.240
 luxury and as I say then we will enter 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.620
 in detail a bit is each 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.760
 camp and all because yes that is 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.710
 true that some camps can 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.600
 things now and that will be good 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.160
 understand it also the new route of the 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.230
 jungle or what are we going to do because 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.820
 I already say in the times of respawn the 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.880
 first appearance times better said 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.260
 they are not the same ie 155 does not come out 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.060
 the blue does not come out red so 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.530
 obviously you have to change the tower 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.820
 that look at a shield we will also see a 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.790
 little too the whole subject this one 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.990
 the map interferes and well you leave it 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.910
 bait as I said you see here the 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.710
 this shtick does and we see the damage this 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.850
 it's like always but what is it 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.170
 happen let's give more importance to 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.430
 enamel in the sense that clear to 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.810
 beginning when we went with jungle 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.310
 we have to catch is might power to 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.570
 try to play a little bit faster 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.370
 because we already know joint without smile 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.440
 it depends what is suffers enough 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.000
 they stick for a long time because they took that 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.100
 but what happens then that in law came 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.750
 some jungles for that ability was 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.300
 a little good if you had your 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.280
 importance of face then to steal dragon 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.470
 to become a dragon 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.000
 an enemy diver but it really is 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.420
 a skill that was lost between 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.889
 quotes the lay cane online mccain already 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.230
 I was simply losing what I had 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.880
 was that you do some bug was such 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.030
 Now what you are going to do is that you are going to 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.950
 to choose how you want your face is 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.630
 maite is to say that they must of the objects 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.130
 that you buy then you will have a 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.780
 function or another but this case 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.090
 just very quick to not enter 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.950
 in details I have taken this object not already 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.690
 showing and there is nothing left and as you see 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.300
 the smile turns violet on me 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.169
 color and now apart from doing the damage 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.250
 that would do all the ways we see what 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.280
 well apart from doing the damage we are going to 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.410
 throw it so you see we will launch 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.030
 that binds them to the tunnels and apart the 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.380
 this hurt that side as you see 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.000
 I do not hit this one any time 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.919
 simply with smith and as you see I have 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.320
 done damage to this case also what 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.610
 I'll do everything so as you see it's more going 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.680
 to have a little more function because 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.600
 no it's not going to be just a damage anymore 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.600
 run but it depends on the build that you 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.729
 do and so you're going to have a lot 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.960
 more impact on the game in this case 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.729
 I have taken a mike that simply by 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.920
 what it does is study and such and 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.420
 infringe a little 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.460
 but there is some mike that can be 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.390
 throw even on top of champions if 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.310
 You have listened well above 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.410
 champions in nothing of minions but you 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.510
 You can go against an uncle for the subject of 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.090
 against jungle theme of trying to win 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.550
 better and the whole subject and you can prioritize 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.380
 the other is maite then to force it 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.550
 a faster bank or I try to have a 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.170
 skill that you can throw at 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.610
 enemy champion which so far no 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.190
 you can now simply the smile u 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.110
 which is used is for minions and such 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.450
 champions for now you can not do 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.620
 absolutely nothing so I do not go 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.150
 to grate more in this first video 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.160
 we have simply seen what was involved 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.180
 it is the visual we have seen the changes and 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.260
 in the next one and so we're going to 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.430
 try to enter a little more in 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.400
 detail especially on the subject of the 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.930
 jungle that is something that is very important 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.160
 and nothing I hope you like this quite 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.690
 The truth is that I make these videos 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.450
 for you because I know that a lot of people 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.400
 he asks me he hears that you have such a pp account 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.840
 what to say that good if they have 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.250
 many I do not have any more accounts I do not know 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.540
 nor when will it be possible to return to 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.520
 register since a long time ago that 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.690
 you can not and I only can 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.130
 to do from here is therefore good 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.930
 take this account that I have a little 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.850
 in oblivion and such I will try 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.470
 make a series of videos so you do not 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.540
 they are incommunicado with what is going to 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.220
 happen and that we see it among all a 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.590
 little news here 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.840
 so this is all thanks to all the 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.310
 people who support me in the channel that I know 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.900
 I do not say much but I'm very 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.640
 proud of all of you already know 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.020
 that you can give me a like if you like the 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.760
 video or if you do not want to because there is no 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.500
 problem and nothing we 'll see here 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.500
