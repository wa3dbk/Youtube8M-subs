always being able to display the best

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.369 
always being able to display the best
stuff<00:02:48.310> simply<00:02:48.819> because<00:02:49.180> you're<00:02:49.840> holding<00:02:50.260> on

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
good shape and then you're reselling it

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.849 
good shape and then you're reselling it
for<00:02:54.609> more<00:02:54.909> than<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:56.049> bought<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.409> for<00:02:56.650> or

for more than you bought it for or
pretty<00:02:57.190> close<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.900> most<00:02:58.900> cases<00:02:59.200> another

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
pretty close to in most cases another

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.080 
pretty close to in most cases another
thing<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.579> could<00:03:00.730> do<00:03:00.879> is<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.030> could

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
thing that you could do is you could

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.970 
thing that you could do is you could
actually<00:03:01.329> take<00:03:01.659> apart<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.260> sets<00:03:02.500> put<00:03:02.769> them<00:03:02.889> in

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
actually take apart the sets put them in

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.550 
actually take apart the sets put them in
Ziploc<00:03:03.400> bags<00:03:03.730> with<00:03:04.629> the<00:03:04.659> instruction<00:03:05.379> and

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
Ziploc bags with the instruction and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.460 
Ziploc bags with the instruction and
create<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:05.980> system<00:03:06.280> where<00:03:07.239> you're<00:03:08.200> kind<00:03:08.319> of

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
create a system where you're kind of

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.319 
create a system where you're kind of
storing<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.129> old<00:03:09.280> set<00:03:09.549> so<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.819> still<00:03:10.090> have

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
storing the old set so you still have

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.410 
storing the old set so you still have
them<00:03:10.540> they're<00:03:10.689> not<00:03:10.780> displayed<00:03:11.579> but<00:03:12.579> they're

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
them they're not displayed but they're

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.240 
them they're not displayed but they're
still<00:03:13.569> available<00:03:13.840> if<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.709> want<00:03:14.889> to<00:03:14.980> go<00:03:15.069> back

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
still available if you want to go back

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.089 
still available if you want to go back
and<00:03:15.519> build<00:03:15.639> them<00:03:15.819> again<00:03:16.560> they're<00:03:17.560> there<00:03:17.859> and

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
and build them again they're there and

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.759 
and build them again they're there and
what<00:03:18.519> you'll<00:03:18.639> find<00:03:18.879> is<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:20.169> probably<00:03:20.530> won't

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
what you'll find is you probably won't

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:21.869 
what you'll find is you probably won't
build<00:03:20.980> them<00:03:21.099> again<00:03:21.310> because<00:03:21.430> there's<00:03:21.699> new

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
build them again because there's new

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:22.979 
build them again because there's new
stuff<00:03:21.940> coming<00:03:22.150> out<00:03:22.449> and<00:03:22.569> you're<00:03:22.690> not<00:03:22.780> going<00:03:22.930> to

stuff coming out and you're not going to

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.750 
stuff coming out and you're not going to
want<00:03:23.199> to<00:03:23.379> so<00:03:24.129> then<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.370> may<00:03:24.459> want<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.730> think

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
want to so then you may want to think

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.020 
want to so then you may want to think
about<00:03:24.940> hey<00:03:25.410> I've<00:03:26.410> put<00:03:26.769> this<00:03:26.889> away<00:03:27.069> I've<00:03:27.489> put<00:03:27.940> it

in bags it's been there for two years I

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.920 
in bags it's been there for two years I
still<00:03:30.310> haven't<00:03:30.459> built<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.780> don't

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
still haven't built it and I don't

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.750 
still haven't built it and I don't

really care to there's so much cool new

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.610 
really care to there's so much cool new
stuff<00:03:33.790> out<00:03:34.209> I'm<00:03:34.449> more<00:03:34.720> focused<00:03:34.930> on<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.409> and

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
stuff out I'm more focused on that and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.449 
stuff out I'm more focused on that and
then<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.400> may<00:03:36.519> want<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.760> sell<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.030> because

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
then you may want to sell it because

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.860 
then you may want to sell it because
you've<00:03:39.459> realized<00:03:39.909> it's<00:03:40.180> not<00:03:40.299> as<00:03:40.449> important<00:03:40.780> as

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
you've realized it's not as important as

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.539 
you've realized it's not as important as
you<00:03:40.959> thought<00:03:41.169> it<00:03:41.290> was<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.769> then<00:03:42.129> now<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.340> can

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
you thought it was and then now you can

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.129 
you thought it was and then now you can
get<00:03:42.669> money<00:03:42.819> and<00:03:43.060> get<00:03:43.269> more<00:03:43.419> than<00:03:43.599> you<00:03:43.690> pay<00:03:43.840> for

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
get money and get more than you pay for

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.110 
get money and get more than you pay for
it<00:03:44.229> and<00:03:44.620> get<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.889> new<00:03:45.010> stuff<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.760> that's<00:03:45.940> what

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
it and get the new stuff so that's what

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.689 
it and get the new stuff so that's what
I<00:03:46.150> would<00:03:46.209> recommend<00:03:46.449> doing<00:03:46.979> because<00:03:47.979> you

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
I would recommend doing because you

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:53.909 
I would recommend doing because you
can't<00:03:49.060> just<00:03:49.389> keep<00:03:49.859> if<00:03:50.909> you're<00:03:52.560> young<00:03:53.560> and

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
can't just keep if you're young and

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.770 
can't just keep if you're young and
you're<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.430> kid<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.000> your<00:03:55.239> parents<00:03:55.479> are<00:03:55.720> just

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
you're a kid and your parents are just

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.210 
you're a kid and your parents are just
giving<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.169> your<00:03:56.319> bedroom<00:03:56.709> eventually<00:03:57.129> going
