00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 very special video since it's about 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.520
 your strong demand you asked me 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.900

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.340
 my turtle beach dx21 he made the soul 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.170
 I left to get it 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 the fnac you saw them unfortunately we 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.860
 will say that I did not want to make you the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.210
 live discovery because there was 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.839
 noise at home and I wanted 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 absolutely you commented with his px 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.290
 The thing is, I can not 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.970
 comment with the px 22 while he is 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.640
 still in the box you understand me a 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.589
 little illogical 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 simply to tell you yes the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.589
 availability we will say no sorry the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.270
 px 22 compatibility is done on the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.270
 current consoles gene locke to know 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.000
 the ps3 the xbox 360 meters for all those 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.070
 of you who had the xbox one and the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.350
 ps4 is a headset that works at 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.420
 wonder because I have the xbox one and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.360
 at the ps3 and i'm going to hate on 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.610
 the two again and again it's going 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.189
 to say it works perfectly the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.049
 quality we'll say the microphone is really 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.320
 good even if we will say mainly 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.240
 that's what I remember from this bx 22 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.039
 it's his design, you'll see it as you go 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.079
 and as I do not comment live 1 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.640
 so here I show you a time I 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.159
 see the age of the woods the boad 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.770
 I was not the box etc. finally you 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.799
 will have noticed it is its design it is 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.149
 really simple I will confess you too 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.229
 one thing is for all those who have 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.090
 big heads a bit like me 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.250
 big head leads to but hey you 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.049
 it will be understood that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.700
 unfortunately I can not put it to the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.109
 monk reindeer 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.850
 why because there is the lob of 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.009
 maizerets that goes out of the way I put it 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.210
 in slightly oblique and even like 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.770
 we are going to say that he remains well hooked 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.259
 as long as you do not move much 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.509
 head it stays perfect he has a microphone with 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.670
 a light foam like that that we're going 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.860
 to say that they remove any parasite it is 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.540
 really not bad at all yet and 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.480
 always we will say the remote that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.100
 is required and terribly we will say 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.080
 complete so you know how to manage we'll say 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.800
 the bass knows how to handle the sound of the cat 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.500
 you know how to manage we will say are 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.600
 when still of the game so the volume of 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.060
 game from the small remote 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.850
 which binds to it will say integrated helmet 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.500
 the connectivity is super simple so 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.510
 you have an audio rca cable 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.660
 So it is a kind of red cables 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.150
 white that you put behind the TV with 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.970
 a green audio output that you will 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.990
 connected we will say with your famous 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.960
 turtle beach px 22 after which we will say 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.910
 the usb output so that's it's the 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.460
 little bit that you see it's his sister 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.040
 will say that goes back into the green exit 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.170

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.970
