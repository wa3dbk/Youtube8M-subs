some of the judges reactions I think I

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.699 
some of the judges reactions I think I
think<00:03:35.970> we<00:03:36.090> were<00:03:36.209> slightly<00:03:36.480> winded<00:03:37.200> by<00:03:37.409> Len

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
think we were slightly winded by Len

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.780 
think we were slightly winded by Len
weren't<00:03:38.010> we

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
weren't we

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.539 
weren't we
but<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.780> that's<00:03:40.349> what<00:03:40.560> we're<00:03:40.739> there<00:03:40.950> for<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.430> be

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
but I that's what we're there for to be

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.280 
but I that's what we're there for to be
judged<00:03:41.819> by<00:03:42.030> them<00:03:42.329> yeah<00:03:42.599> get<00:03:42.840> their<00:03:43.049> feedback

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
judged by them yeah get their feedback

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.149 
judged by them yeah get their feedback
and<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:44.420> think<00:03:45.420> ultimately<00:03:45.810> when<00:03:46.709> people<00:03:47.069> are

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
and I think ultimately when people are

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.850 
and I think ultimately when people are
hard<00:03:47.340> on<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:48.030> because<00:03:48.599> they<00:03:49.140> care<00:03:49.440> and

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
hard on you is because they care and

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.670 
hard on you is because they care and
they<00:03:50.010> can<00:03:50.220> see<00:03:50.459> what<00:03:50.849> you<00:03:51.120> could<00:03:51.840> be<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.349> so

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
they can see what you could be and so

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.380 
they can see what you could be and so
that's<00:03:52.920> what<00:03:53.220> they<00:03:53.430> were<00:03:53.609> leader<00:03:53.940> they<00:03:54.180> said

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
that's what they were leader they said

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.369 
that's what they were leader they said
it'd<00:03:54.480> have<00:03:54.599> been<00:03:54.629> hard<00:03:54.959> on<00:03:55.049> us<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.260> last

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379

it'd have been hard on us the last
