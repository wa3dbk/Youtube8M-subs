00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 today the boys will give you an example of 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.420
 common in useful and pleasant 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.189
 preparing a really delicate side dish 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.080
 and refined and able to satisfy the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.490
 palate and also to make at the moment 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.340
 to our body 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.139
 the main dish of today will be the thistle 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.690
 here it is, this is the thistle 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.449
 edible commonly known as 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.240
 wild artichoke or in botany 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.099
 as cynara cardunculus as is done 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.199
 quickly review the procedure 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.359
 cleaning since we have already seen it in 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.910
 one of my previous video recipes 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.180
 then I washed it before on the coasts it 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.730
 cut into pieces and now I'm removing 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.320
 the external filaments hard and woody with 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.329
 one peels vegetables 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 after which I will go to tufara all the pieces 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.039
 of charcoal ribs of heat inside 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.920
 a solution of water and lemon juice 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.600
 to avoid blackening once 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.940
 we removed all the filaments from the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.280
 coasts we can dive into the water 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.500
 boiling and already salted and cook for 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.210
 about an hour an hour I don't leave until 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 when the coasts will become 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.510
 here they are soft after an hour of 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.920
 cooking 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.869
 this result clearly has it 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.400
 drained from the soaking water and the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.619
 I let it cool 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.780
 now I want to make a recipe 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.170
 very tasty and inviting ie 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.030
 baked au gratin as you do with 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.189
 the béchamel sauce we have already seen 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.130
 countless times here we have 500 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.729
 milliliters of milk and I go to pour 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.860
 inside a saucepan but not all 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.770
 not all the side a part about 400 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.479
 milliliters a part we keep it 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.909
 because then we're going to melt it a 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.399
 melt the flour in the remaining art 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.530
 flour about 40 grams because I want 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.990
 make a béchamel rather 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.990
 soft like this 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.630
 the milk is almost reaching 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:09.750
 boiling then we go up to taste 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.750
 put some pepper and nutmeg 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.720
 now we join the holy saints here the flour of 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.760
 dissolved in cold milk 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.120
 we mix full achievement precisely 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.120
 boiling 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.780
 you see that slowly the béchamel is 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.660
 thicken let's cook a couple of 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.730
 minutes and we lend with 50 g of 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:45.150
 grana cheese I have now taken a baking sheet 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.230
 from the oven with dimensions of 20 x 25 cm 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.620
 I put 20 grams of melted butter 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.319
 we bury the walls well and then we'll go 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.890
 to sprinkle the whole pan with del 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.890
 breadcrumbs 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.370
 now let's think of a portion of béchamel 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:13.700
 on the bottom a right spoon for 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.700
 make a base like this 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:23.790
 we start to arrange the coasts of 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.769
 card a baking dish the clean weight of 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.130
 card that I didn't tell you before is 500 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.130
 grams 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.450
 therefore I poured the béchamel on the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.510
 surface of the thistles now I go to 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.850
 add a little grated bread that 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.250
 we will need it to make au gratin easier 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.130
 and the gilding to those heated the 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.770
 180 degree oven and now let's go to 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.470
 cook for about 20 25 minutes with 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.810
 aluminum the last five minutes 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.150
 instead we remove the aluminum and there 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.150
 let's brown in the grill function 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:09.230
 these cases must be sensational 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.350
 yes then yes there is a smell let's see 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:20.860
 the consistency and that was formed from 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:24.950
 beautiful golden bern crust here it is 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.510
 let's get settled on a saucer well 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.080
 let's say I made a portion here 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.650
 giant anyway let's say I made it 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.660
 the idea 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.610
 if you want to enrich them even more 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.780
 you can also put a few bits of 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.780
 speck or cooked ham
