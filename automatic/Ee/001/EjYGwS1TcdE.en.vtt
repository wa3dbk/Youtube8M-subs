as loose as a forward placement but at
the<00:01:48.899> same<00:01:49.110> time<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.310> bit

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the same time it can see a little bit

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.910 
the same time it can see a little bit
more<00:01:50.610> Dr<00:01:50.850> having<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> fins

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
more Dr having the fins

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.219 
more Dr having the fins
a little<00:01:52.220> bit<00:01:52.310> closer<00:01:52.549> to<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.909> rail<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.420> also

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
a little bit closer to the rail and also

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.560 
a little bit closer to the rail and also
a<00:01:54.259> little<00:01:54.409> bit<00:01:54.590> closer<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.130> tail<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:56.420> can

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
a little bit closer to the tail you can

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.210 
a little bit closer to the tail you can
also<00:01:56.750> ride<00:01:57.080> one<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.470> bigger<00:01:57.650> fins<00:01:57.890> moved

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
also ride one of the bigger fins moved

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.219 
also ride one of the bigger fins moved
in<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.460> back<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:59.330> single<00:01:59.630> thin<00:01:59.780> physician

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
in the back in a single thin physician

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.870 
in the back in a single thin physician
so<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.619> board<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.009> can<00:02:01.040> ride<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.460> as<00:02:01.820> a

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
so this board you can ride it as a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.580 
so this board you can ride it as a
thruster<00:02:02.450> with<00:02:02.600> three<00:02:02.810> thins<00:02:03.020> in<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.290> rear

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
thruster with three thins in the rear

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.249 
thruster with three thins in the rear
you<00:02:04.159> can<00:02:04.189> ride<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.790> as<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.149> twin<00:02:05.570> fin<00:02:05.840> with<00:02:06.200> the

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
you can ride it as a twin fin with the

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.749 
you can ride it as a twin fin with the
fins<00:02:06.470> in<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.710> middle<00:02:07.040> you<00:02:07.159> can<00:02:07.189> write<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.610> as<00:02:07.700> a

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
fins in the middle you can write it as a

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.210 
fins in the middle you can write it as a
twin<00:02:08.090> fin<00:02:08.330> with<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.690> fins<00:02:08.959> up<00:02:09.500> front<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.190> can

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
twin fin with the fins up front you can

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.040 
twin fin with the fins up front you can
write<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.670> as<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.819> fourth<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:11.390> which<00:02:11.600> four<00:02:11.900> pins

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
write it as a fourth in which four pins

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.570 
write it as a fourth in which four pins
are<00:02:12.170> really<00:02:12.350> big<00:02:12.530> back<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:12.890> surfing<00:02:13.250> right<00:02:13.400> now

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
are really big back in surfing right now

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.270 
are really big back in surfing right now
with<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.330> fins<00:02:14.540> placed<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.860> upper<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
with the fins placed in the upper in the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.860 
with the fins placed in the upper in the
middle<00:02:16.520> positions<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.300> you've<00:02:17.480> got<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.600> lot<00:02:17.840> of

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
middle positions so you've got a lot of

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.840 
middle positions so you've got a lot of
options<00:02:18.260> on<00:02:18.380> this<00:02:18.500> thing<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:18.830> really<00:02:19.100> every

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
options on this thing and really every

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.640 
options on this thing and really every
different<00:02:20.360> placement<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.840> put<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.110> fins<00:02:21.380> it

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
different placement you put the fins it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.040 
different placement you put the fins it
rides<00:02:21.920> completely<00:02:22.519> different<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.900> can

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
rides completely different so you can

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.840 
rides completely different so you can
really<00:02:24.230> customize<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.769> ride<00:02:25.040> for<00:02:25.220> yourself<00:02:25.610> and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
really customize a ride for yourself and

really nice full EBA traction pad
reminds<00:03:45.000> me<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.299> old<00:03:45.329> Astra<00:03:45.720> neck

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
reminds me of the old Astra neck

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.830 
reminds me of the old Astra neck
traction<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.349> always<00:03:46.590> used<00:03:46.829> when<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> certain<00:03:47.310> a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
traction I always used when a certain a

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.670 
traction I always used when a certain a
really<00:03:48.840> good<00:03:48.989> grip<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.439> it<00:03:51.349> relatively<00:03:52.349> light

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
really good grip to it relatively light

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.619 
really good grip to it relatively light
it's<00:03:53.099> actually<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.459> vacuum<00:03:53.819> bag<00:03:54.000> construction

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
it's actually a vacuum bag construction

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.559 
it's actually a vacuum bag construction
board<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.829> more<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.579> high-tech<00:03:57.000> composite

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
board so more of a high-tech composite

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.470 
board so more of a high-tech composite
internals<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.409> and<00:03:59.269> watching<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.299> lot<00:04:00.450> of

the riders get on this thing and just
tear<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:01.980> apart<00:04:02.129> I<00:04:02.579> haven't<00:04:03.150> had<00:04:03.209> one<00:04:03.419> rider

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
tear it apart I haven't had one rider

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.270 
tear it apart I haven't had one rider
tell<00:04:04.049> me<00:04:04.169> anything<00:04:04.379> but<00:04:04.620> it's<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.859> best<00:04:04.889> board

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
tell me anything but it's the best board

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.239 
tell me anything but it's the best board
