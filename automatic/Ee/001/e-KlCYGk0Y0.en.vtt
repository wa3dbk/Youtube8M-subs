and<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.269> most<00:00:28.480> traditional<00:00:28.630> is<00:00:29.019> how<00:00:29.199> arts

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
and the most traditional is how arts

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.589 
and the most traditional is how arts
been<00:00:29.769> taught<00:00:30.009> over<00:00:30.310> time<00:00:30.670> I<00:00:31.000> wrote<00:00:31.390> a<00:00:31.420> book

been taught over time I wrote a book

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.450 
been taught over time I wrote a book
called<00:00:31.660> artist<00:00:32.259> teacher<00:00:32.439> which<00:00:32.950> basically

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
called artist teacher which basically

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.869 
called artist teacher which basically
tracks<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.809> history<00:00:35.290> of<00:00:35.320> art<00:00:35.620> education<00:00:36.070> from

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
tracks the history of art education from

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.270 
tracks the history of art education from
the<00:00:37.450> classical<00:00:37.930> civilizations<00:00:38.649> up<00:00:38.860> into<00:00:39.160> the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
the classical civilizations up into the

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.430 
the classical civilizations up into the
modern<00:00:39.489> in<00:00:39.700> denver<00:00:39.940> area<00:00:40.360> and<00:00:40.719> to<00:00:41.110> me<00:00:41.230> that's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
modern in denver area and to me that's

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.139 
modern in denver area and to me that's
exciting<00:00:41.829> because<00:00:42.070> students<00:00:42.579> often<00:00:43.000> don't

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
exciting because students often don't

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.600 
exciting because students often don't
realize<00:00:43.559> why<00:00:44.559> they're<00:00:44.860> being<00:00:45.070> taught<00:00:45.340> what

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
realize why they're being taught what

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.610 
realize why they're being taught what
they<00:00:45.760> are<00:00:45.969> and<00:00:46.210> i<00:00:46.750> feel<00:00:46.960> we<00:00:46.989> can<00:00:47.230> understand

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
they are and i feel we can understand

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.950 
they are and i feel we can understand
the<00:00:47.710> art<00:00:47.980> of<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.430> time<00:00:48.699> by<00:00:49.270> studying<00:00:49.840> the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
the art of the time by studying the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.740 
the art of the time by studying the
instruction<00:00:50.469> of<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.890> time<00:00:51.190> so<00:00:51.940> art<00:00:52.360> in<00:00:52.629> the

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
instruction of that time so art in the

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.510 
instruction of that time so art in the
21st<00:00:53.170> century<00:00:53.260> looks<00:00:53.739> a<00:00:53.829> lot<00:00:53.949> different<00:00:54.010> than

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
21st century looks a lot different than

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.029 
21st century looks a lot different than
it<00:00:54.670> was<00:00:54.699> in<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:54.969> 19th<00:00:55.420> century<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.109> i<00:00:56.829> feel

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
it was in the 19th century and i feel

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.920 
it was in the 19th century and i feel
like<00:00:57.160> that<00:00:57.340> type<00:00:57.640> of<00:00:57.670> research<00:00:58.120> helps<00:00:58.629> acquit

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
like that type of research helps acquit

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.779 
like that type of research helps acquit
me<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.199> classroom<00:00:59.739> it<00:01:00.190> also<00:01:00.340> helps<00:01:00.730> us

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
me in the classroom it also helps us

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.069 
me in the classroom it also helps us
with<00:01:00.969> our<00:01:01.059> students<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:01.480> be<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.629> better<00:01:01.809> artist

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
with our students to be a better artist

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.840 
with our students to be a better artist
better<00:01:02.620> teachers<00:01:03.039> themselves<00:01:03.280> better

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
better teachers themselves better

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.750 
better teachers themselves better
scholars<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.629> future<00:01:05.019> I<00:01:05.340> like<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.430> provoke

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
scholars the future I like to provoke

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.780 
scholars the future I like to provoke
students<00:01:07.330> with<00:01:07.510> questions<00:01:08.050> get<00:01:09.040> them<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.520> see

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
students with questions get them to see

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.630 
students with questions get them to see
and<00:01:10.090> look<00:01:10.450> deeper<00:01:11.080> individual<00:01:11.800> objects<00:01:12.490> I

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
and look deeper individual objects I

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.120 
and look deeper individual objects I
often<00:01:13.150> start<00:01:13.630> off<00:01:13.870> with<00:01:14.110> what<00:01:14.410> do<00:01:14.470> we<00:01:14.620> see<00:01:14.860> and

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
often start off with what do we see and

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.270 
often start off with what do we see and
then<00:01:15.640> once<00:01:15.910> that<00:01:16.030> is<00:01:16.360> given<00:01:16.840> I<00:01:17.050> dig<00:01:17.590> deeper<00:01:18.100> and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
then once that is given I dig deeper and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.280 
then once that is given I dig deeper and
why<00:01:18.460> do<00:01:18.520> you<00:01:18.670> say<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.540> get<00:01:20.080> them<00:01:20.260> to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
why do you say that and get them to

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.380 
why do you say that and get them to
provide<00:01:20.650> evidence<00:01:21.280> for<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:22.060> things<00:01:22.270> that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
provide evidence for the things that

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.660 
provide evidence for the things that
they're<00:01:22.570> looking<00:01:22.690> at<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.410> faith<00:01:23.740> aspect<00:01:24.460> at
