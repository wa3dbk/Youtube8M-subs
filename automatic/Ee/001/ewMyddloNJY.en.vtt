00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
provides us with the greatest form of

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.670 
provides us with the greatest form of
sustainability<00:00:49.750> which<00:00:49.960> is<00:00:50.140> which<00:00:50.379> is<00:00:50.530> the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
sustainability which is which is the

is in an oil spill this is a it's
continuing<00:00:58.870> right<00:00:59.230> now<00:00:59.380> as<00:00:59.560> I<00:00:59.710> speak<00:00:59.740> to<00:01:00.220> pump

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
continuing right now as I speak to pump

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.600 
continuing right now as I speak to pump
out<00:01:01.329> millions<00:01:01.630> of<00:01:01.930> gallons<00:01:02.320> and<00:01:02.770> has<00:01:03.100> been<00:01:03.400> and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
out millions of gallons and has been and

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.060 
out millions of gallons and has been and
will<00:01:03.760> continue<00:01:03.790> to<00:01:04.300> for<00:01:04.780> who<00:01:05.650> knows<00:01:05.800> how<00:01:05.860> long

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
will continue to for who knows how long

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.920 
will continue to for who knows how long
right<00:01:06.490> now<00:01:06.640> because<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.060> seems<00:01:07.300> that<00:01:07.509> no<00:01:07.780> one

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
right now because it seems that no one

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.300 
right now because it seems that no one
knows<00:01:08.110> what<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.470> do<00:01:08.590> they<00:01:08.800> know<00:01:08.920> how<00:01:09.009> to<00:01:09.040> make<00:01:09.250> a

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
knows what to do they know how to make a

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.490 
knows what to do they know how to make a
hole<00:01:09.610> in<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.940> bottom<00:01:10.750> of<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.960> ocean<00:01:11.259> but<00:01:11.380> they

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
hole in the bottom of the ocean but they

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.460 
hole in the bottom of the ocean but they
don't<00:01:11.650> know<00:01:11.740> how<00:01:11.830> to<00:01:11.860> plug<00:01:12.160> in<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:13.470> that's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
don't know how to plug in and that's

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.609 
don't know how to plug in and that's
scary

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.100 

we<00:01:21.619> have<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:21.829> be<00:01:21.920> very<00:01:22.250> careful<00:01:22.610> about<00:01:23.110> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
we have to be very careful about the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.990 
we have to be very careful about the
areas<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.500> we<00:01:24.740> open<00:01:25.070> up<00:01:25.189> to<00:01:25.880> offshore

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
areas that we open up to offshore

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.960 
areas that we open up to offshore
drilling<00:01:26.570> as<00:01:26.920> we<00:01:27.920> undertake<00:01:28.399> these<00:01:28.610> types<00:01:28.880> of

impacts on our coasts and oceans we

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.480 
impacts on our coasts and oceans we
proceed<00:01:34.970> with<00:01:35.240> real<00:01:35.450> caution<00:01:36.079> and<00:01:36.259> an<00:01:37.009> honest

proceed with real caution and an honest

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.679 
proceed with real caution and an honest
evaluation<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:38.509> what<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.259> can<00:01:39.409> mean<00:01:39.470> for<00:01:40.189> our

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
evaluation of what it can mean for our

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.520 
evaluation of what it can mean for our
economy<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:41.869> our<00:01:42.220> environment<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:45.320> know<00:01:45.439> you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
economy and our environment you know you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.410 
economy and our environment you know you
see<00:01:45.830> dead<00:01:46.039> fish<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.549> then<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.850> start<00:01:47.119> to<00:01:47.179> see

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
see dead fish and then you start to see

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.850 
see dead fish and then you start to see
clumps<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:50.119> oil<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:51.439> see<00:01:51.619> all

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
clumps of of the oil and you see all

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.399 
clumps of of the oil and you see all
these<00:01:52.189> birds<00:01:52.580> some<00:01:53.209> are<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.810> know<00:01:53.899> covered<00:01:54.289> in

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
these birds some are you know covered in

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.620 
these birds some are you know covered in
oil<00:01:54.530> some<00:01:54.890> are<00:01:55.039> not<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:56.060> dolphins

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
oil some are not and the dolphins

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.149 
oil some are not and the dolphins
swimming<00:01:56.959> around<00:01:57.289> and<00:01:57.649> I<00:01:57.770> think<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.069> other

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
swimming around and I think the other

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.260 
swimming around and I think the other
side<00:01:58.369> of<00:01:58.399> is<00:01:58.580> you<00:01:58.670> realize<00:01:58.909> these<00:01:59.000> dolphins

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
side of is you realize these dolphins

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.740 
side of is you realize these dolphins
are<00:01:59.509> swimming<00:01:59.810> in<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.229> very<00:02:00.560> toxic<00:02:00.770> water

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
are swimming in this very toxic water

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.469 
are swimming in this very toxic water
any<00:02:02.750> animal<00:02:03.649> that<00:02:03.679> it<00:02:04.190> goes<00:02:05.030> up<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.420> the

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
any animal that it goes up to the

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.999 
any animal that it goes up to the
surface<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:05.869> water<00:02:05.959> that<00:02:06.229> rests<00:02:06.590> on<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.830> water

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
surface of water that rests on the water
