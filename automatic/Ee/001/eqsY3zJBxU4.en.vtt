offers<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.120> first<00:02:48.120> non<00:02:48.900> laser<00:02:49.230> method<00:02:49.739> of

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
offers the first non laser method of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.449 
offers the first non laser method of
tattoo<00:02:50.579> removal<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:53.989> think<00:02:54.989> laser<00:02:55.620> works<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.430> a

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
tattoo removal I think laser works for a

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.289 
tattoo removal I think laser works for a
lot<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.790> people<00:02:58.670> unfortunately<00:02:59.670> there<00:03:00.060> are<00:03:00.120> so

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
lot of people unfortunately there are so

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.289 
lot of people unfortunately there are so
many<00:03:00.420> variables<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:01.489> depend<00:03:02.489> on<00:03:02.639> human<00:03:03.090> body

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
many variables that depend on human body

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.520 
many variables that depend on human body
and<00:03:03.950> how<00:03:04.950> people<00:03:05.400> interact<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:07.410> know

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
and how people interact you know

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.530 
and how people interact you know
internally<00:03:07.920> because<00:03:08.310> essentially<00:03:09.180> when<00:03:09.450> you

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
internally because essentially when you

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.500 
internally because essentially when you
get<00:03:09.690> lasered<00:03:10.109> you<00:03:10.350> have<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.769> ingest<00:03:11.250> all<00:03:11.910> that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
get lasered you have to ingest all that

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.190 
get lasered you have to ingest all that
ink<00:03:13.459> you're<00:03:14.459> not<00:03:14.609> removing<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.239> thermally

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
ink you're not removing it thermally

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.199 
ink you're not removing it thermally
you're<00:03:16.440> actually<00:03:16.680> pushing<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.730> farther<00:03:17.970> into

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
you're actually pushing it farther into

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.020 
you're actually pushing it farther into
the<00:03:18.299> skin<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.489> we're<00:03:20.489> going<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.639> spend<00:03:20.850> about

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the skin and we're going to spend about

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.789 
the skin and we're going to spend about
twelve<00:03:21.420> hundred<00:03:21.510> dollars<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.200> far<00:03:22.230> on<00:03:22.590> laser

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
twelve hundred dollars so far on laser

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.960 
twelve hundred dollars so far on laser
and<00:03:23.329> never<00:03:24.329> had<00:03:24.480> any<00:03:24.690> good<00:03:24.780> luck<00:03:24.840> with<00:03:25.139> it<00:03:25.319> and

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
and never had any good luck with it and

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.490 
and never had any good luck with it and
there<00:03:26.970> weren't<00:03:27.150> very<00:03:27.269> many<00:03:27.540> alternatives<00:03:28.350> you

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
there weren't very many alternatives you

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.860 
there weren't very many alternatives you
either<00:03:28.590> live<00:03:28.859> with<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.069> craft<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.120> two<00:03:30.389> or<00:03:30.420> you

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
either live with a craft a two or you

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.140 
either live with a craft a two or you
get<00:03:31.739> laser<00:03:31.920> at<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.250> bunch<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.579> times<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.030> I

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150
