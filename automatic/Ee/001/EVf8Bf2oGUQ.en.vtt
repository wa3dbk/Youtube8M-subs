00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.870
 those people I hope in short how 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.540
 we have done until now I have 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.460
 liked at this point I would say that 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.380
 we can go a little further with the 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.550
 achievements obviously if you are there 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.200
 pissing off because I don't have it yet 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.609
 fixed the roof because they were still 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.859
 fixed the inventory 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.720
 Well I very often register everything in 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.210
 a single session then when there 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.689
 I promise to record things and then that 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.300
 football to record of this book ii 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.670
 fertility function daddio when vi 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.100
 I promise to reorganize things then 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.780
 I don't do it is probably because I am 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.750
 record everything below and then 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.970
 technically I can't can't do it 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.489
 but just interrupts just a little 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.890
 time to devote to without registering a 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:56.119
 I will gladly do the exit 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.379
 so what am I doing to you ok to 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:59.449
 we have to cook a little bread 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.670
 already who we are but we must dedicate ourselves to 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.979
 some achievements because we're a bit 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.900
 lose you thinking the same thing 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.840
 maybe not maybe you like to see sti 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.060
 wastes time doing crap then sly 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.570
 flap league of proof ok so we have to 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.420
 mount on pork and it is part for 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.550
 take a saddle hoping to have one 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.650
 normal star and not just those stars 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.630
 stupid that they will be for the chocobos or al 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.280
 christ there are normal mykonos stars 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.440
 to normal 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.600
 ok it looks like i don't have a saddle 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.490
 so I can't complete the moment it is 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.940
 that tests what I know you 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.550
 stars 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.270
 unless you can craft them 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.920
 thanks to some way chocobo federer 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.409
 saddle how do you treat the road 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.510
 to normal one cannot therefore cannot 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.680
 I must find him by force not an angel 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.350
 so yesterday 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.760
 total joy I have to face some 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.920
 other from anci a true fortune of 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.870
 find saddles and apparently not 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.080
 I know the chocobos are starting one 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.880
 sort of natural selection and therefore 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.160
 three remained for some reason 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.670
 you want to spit stipule I don't do it 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.040
 nothing for the moment thanks thanks 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.560
 wind and dedicate ourselves some more 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.090
 in the meantime, he tries ok, so I have 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.190
 immediately found there mind that does to 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.500
 our case is new under a certain point 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.510
 of view because it belongs to the tree of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.430
 things but she doesn't care anyway 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.080
 found a city that is part of 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.250
 crazy horse myths so it's a new one 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.000
 tree of trials that I have ever 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.510
 faced and requires to craft a 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.610
 tacit cobo i am talking about and requires to 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.200
 a happy drugged face that comes from 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.600
 that life of Italy does not matter 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.540
 origin of crafting a shield 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.400
 simply using the le chips 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.560
 meteorite chips and a better one 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.320
 leave of meteorite let me immediately byrne 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.489
 look at his civ man in practice 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.820
 precisely it is simply what has me 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.970
 told kraft legion enemies an access 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.400
 ok and to do so obviously with texts not 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.450
 so can do matthew wright where i am 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.030
 he picked the place where you want to improve shield 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.069
 shields here it is with redstone chip 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.690
 great icomos we have all that 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.519
 we need have we perhaps what city 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.040
 obviously not, they will not be unequal here 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.769
 certainly not unequal here was in something 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.640
 what is free about this is ours 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.470
 3123 more in the redzone we have more 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.680
 of the lousy stone we have 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.200
 seems to be here in boston, however, serves another 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.810
 damn it was another miter or maybe 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.650
 it's OK to go drag this m com 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.599
 okay okay optimistic files okay 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.790
 optimistic file breaks everything then 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.390
 let's do like this 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.890
 no it is not good that joy of joy 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.190
 very hard then species by species 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.230
 why not say this we are going to do 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.260
 our cobas toni as poor people 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.620
 since it seems strange to us we have another 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:59.049
 what but do you fuck us now we are out but 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:05.810
 then come here where there is falling 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:08.030
 12 and we are in place yes present a 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.430
 agent that I made like ages ago maybe 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.530
 even months ago and I haven't yet 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.730
 sorry sorry it's a tour and that 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.889
 should go to the other side of the 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.919
 little house to allow me a climb and the 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:24.229
 the more easier descent so yes 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:28.760
 those files also understood me 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:33.500
 knows sa germain and now with this mi 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:36.530
 pull now I understand what this is for 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.729
 what it takes to create a shield that 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.830
 protect us from weight meteorites 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:45.029
 so that there are no house then 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.789
 I'll do it right away I 'll go over here if 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:51.360
 tried if I could catch the ladder 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:59.249
 parkour would be much easier 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.939
 of life the nation door ok no begins a 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.469
 to rain 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:06.479
 roma that goes ok to males with corn di 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:09.349
 then place some glass that is 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.300
 smash easily do some parkour 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.339
 he good bam bam bam 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.930
 we put the best action I think 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:19.169
 it would be strange that it does not attract the 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.909
 meteorite and place it I had the 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.689
 we do things to climb on 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:27.930
 let's see here beach shield zhao jing ok 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.460
 I hope he's not a genius 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.740
 we hope he does not expose to 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.779
 meteorites in fact and that holds us a lot 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.129
 very far away 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:37.710
 then now he is afraid what I must do 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:39.029
 is to follow our tree 10 mans 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.069
 so we immediately got a look 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.659
 what else is missing from the info limits want 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:48.749
 york was a half-time upgrade like that 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:50.939
 I do upgrade to peak demand 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:53.310
 how do i get it to open then me 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:56.610
 interviewed Isner Chosen Mouth Major from 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.770
 his or this thing then 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.419
 meanwhile I want to try to do that 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.120
 what they suggested me ie achievement 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.330
 to enhance the best film using 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.979
 the rugby george m 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:13.459
 so there is read in short stuff is 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:16.459
 so I bend here and try with the right 

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:16.459
 no 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.040
 ok but not enough 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.180
 I don't know how to increase it precisely 8 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:33.650
 I will discover my god has enlightened and 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:36.980
 obviously what is that dot at the top or 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:48.730
 my god a wolf is a ufo what the hell 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:52.580
 or something that started it ok ok 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.870
 so I have to get more of these 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.660
 gems and therefore this if ours 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:00.800
 next mission to empower 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.780
 this cool shield finally I have 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.540
 something to do people can leave 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:09.080
 around in the rain they burn wasps if 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:11.460
 a fucking I feel lightning or my god 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.110
