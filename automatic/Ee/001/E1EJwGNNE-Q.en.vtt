there<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.369> my<00:01:53.549> mind<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.540> little<00:01:55.049> pop-up<00:01:55.259> flash

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
there in my mind the little pop-up flash

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.679 
there in my mind the little pop-up flash
you<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.909> little<00:01:57.030> bit<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.329> feel<00:01:57.540> that's

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
you know for a little bit of feel that's

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.420 
you know for a little bit of feel that's
okay<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.110> probably<00:01:58.530> want<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.740> lose<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.219> hood

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
okay you probably want to lose the hood

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.550 
okay you probably want to lose the hood
because<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.969> hood<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.450> introduce<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.290> shadow

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
because the hood can introduce a shadow

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.819 
because the hood can introduce a shadow
especially<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.159> wider<00:02:02.460> angles<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.500> just

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
especially a wider angles but it just

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.429 
especially a wider angles but it just
works<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.520> well<00:02:05.899> first<00:02:06.899> let's

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
works really really well first let's

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.600 
works really really well first let's
just<00:02:07.500> run<00:02:07.770> through<00:02:07.799> some<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.310> different

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
just run through some of the different

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460 
just run through some of the different
features<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.450> doesn't<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.049> focus

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
features so it doesn't have focus

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.840 
features so it doesn't have focus
peaking<00:02:10.679> that's<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.190> little<00:02:11.430> bit<00:02:11.549> annoying

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
peaking that's a little bit annoying

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.460 
peaking that's a little bit annoying
especially<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.630> you're<00:02:12.750> not<00:02:12.840> familiar<00:02:13.049> with

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
especially if you're not familiar with

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.240 
especially if you're not familiar with
using<00:02:13.769> their<00:02:14.519> EVF<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.109> I<00:02:16.320> am<00:02:16.799> so<00:02:17.040> used

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
using their EVF on this one I am so used

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.819 
using their EVF on this one I am so used
to<00:02:17.370> using<00:02:17.609> a<00:02:17.940> proper<00:02:18.359> optical<00:02:19.109> viewfinder

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
to using a proper optical viewfinder

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.650 
to using a proper optical viewfinder
that<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.579> did<00:02:20.760> take<00:02:20.970> me<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.150> little<00:02:21.239> while<00:02:21.390> to

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
that it did take me a little while to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.120 
that it did take me a little while to
get<00:02:21.750> my<00:02:21.930> head<00:02:22.140> around<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.799> does<00:02:22.950> with

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
get my head around it and it does with

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
get my head around it and it does with
any<00:02:23.160> camera<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.820> has<00:02:24.090> one<00:02:24.299> of<00:02:24.420> these<00:02:24.540> sort<00:02:24.870> of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
any camera that has one of these sort of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.470 
any camera that has one of these sort of
view<00:02:25.140> finders<00:02:25.530> an<00:02:25.650> electronic<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:27.150> if

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
view finders an electronic one but if

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.990 
view finders an electronic one but if
you<00:02:27.959> spend<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.530> time<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.769> find<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.730> can

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
you spend the time and find that you can

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.870 
you spend the time and find that you can
manage<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.050> with<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.860> kind<00:02:32.129> of<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.340> view<00:02:32.550> fine

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
manage it with that kind of a view fine

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.110 
manage it with that kind of a view fine
then<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:34.050> good<00:02:34.080> as<00:02:34.590> most<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.460> just

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
then this is as good as most of just

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.730 
then this is as good as most of just
about<00:02:36.270> any<00:02:36.480> other<00:02:36.570> one<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.020> I've<00:02:37.170> tested<00:02:37.410> out

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
about any other one that I've tested out

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.280 
about any other one that I've tested out
there<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:39.120> screen<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.600> really<00:02:39.900> really<00:02:40.080> nice

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
there the screen is really really nice

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.170 
there the screen is really really nice
and<00:02:40.320> whilst<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.100> doesn't<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.550> focus<00:02:41.910> peaking

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and whilst it doesn't have focus peaking

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.790 
and whilst it doesn't have focus peaking
it<00:02:42.480> does<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.960> function<00:02:43.410> I'll<00:02:43.530> show<00:02:43.740> you

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
it does have a function I'll show you

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.000 
it does have a function I'll show you
now<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.850> can<00:02:45.120> throw<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.720> into<00:02:45.840> manual<00:02:46.560> focus

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
now you can throw it into manual focus

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.340 
now you can throw it into manual focus
and<00:02:47.190> then<00:02:47.700> tap<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.000> wheel<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.840> back<00:02:49.020> and

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
and then tap the wheel on the back and

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.200 
and then tap the wheel on the back and
it<00:02:49.500> will<00:02:49.680> bring<00:02:50.460> up<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.760> three<00:02:51.000> time

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
it will bring up a three time

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.480 
it will bring up a three time
magnification<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.740> do<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.160> manual

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
magnification for you to do your manual

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.480 
magnification for you to do your manual
focusing<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.260> then<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.860> think<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.340> can

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
focusing and then if you I think you can

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.120 
focusing and then if you I think you can
adjust<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.030> yet<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.450> go<00:02:57.570> into<00:02:57.600> ten<00:02:58.200> time<00:02:58.500> so

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
adjust it yet to go into ten time so

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.460 
adjust it yet to go into ten time so
that's<00:02:59.880> really<00:03:00.360> handy<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.960> make<00:03:00.990> sure<00:03:01.290> that

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
that's really handy to make sure that

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.760 
that's really handy to make sure that
you<00:03:01.620> nail<00:03:01.770> your<00:03:01.800> focus<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:04.230> auto<00:03:04.410> focus

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
you nail your focus the auto focus

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.520 
you nail your focus the auto focus
however<00:03:05.160> works<00:03:05.760> brilliantly<00:03:06.210> I<00:03:06.780> mean<00:03:07.050> really

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
however works brilliantly I mean really

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.330 
however works brilliantly I mean really
really<00:03:07.650> well<00:03:08.130> as<00:03:08.910> well<00:03:09.450> as<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> lot<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.500> DSLRs<00:03:11.250> I

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
really well as well as a lot of DSLRs I

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.740 
really well as well as a lot of DSLRs I
found<00:03:11.550> this<00:03:11.700> one<00:03:11.940> really<00:03:12.210> was<00:03:12.450> good<00:03:12.660> at

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
found this one really was good at

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.840 
found this one really was good at
focusing<00:03:13.170> even<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.620> lower<00:03:13.800> light<00:03:14.070> situations

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
focusing even in lower light situations

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.330 
focusing even in lower light situations
and<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.750> low-light<00:03:16.140> focus<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.100> fact

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
and the low-light focus and the fact

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.250 
and the low-light focus and the fact
that<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.580> had<00:03:17.730> an<00:03:17.820> EVF<00:03:18.240> didn't<00:03:18.780> get<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.140> way

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
that it had an EVF didn't get in the way

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.000 
that it had an EVF didn't get in the way
of<00:03:19.290> me<00:03:19.560> recently<00:03:19.770> doing<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.490> photo<00:03:21.090> shoot<00:03:21.510> a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
of me recently doing a photo shoot a

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.590 
of me recently doing a photo shoot a
studio<00:03:23.010> shoot<00:03:23.340> with<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:23.730> one<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.240> a<00:03:24.360> dark

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
studio shoot with this one in a dark

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.450 
studio shoot with this one in a dark
studio<00:03:25.080> using<00:03:25.530> studio<00:03:25.830> lights<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.220> bring<00:03:26.370> the

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
studio using studio lights to bring the

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.640 
studio using studio lights to bring the
model<00:03:26.730> up<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.270> was<00:03:27.570> still<00:03:27.780> able<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.080> get<00:03:28.200> focus

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
model up it was still able to get focus

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.950 
model up it was still able to get focus
without<00:03:29.490> any<00:03:29.910> trouble<00:03:30.270> at<00:03:30.360> all<00:03:30.390> so<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.840> was

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
without any trouble at all so I was

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.170 
without any trouble at all so I was
really<00:03:31.200> impressed<00:03:31.530> with<00:03:31.740> that<00:03:31.770> what<00:03:32.700> else<00:03:32.910> I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
really impressed with that what else I

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.790 
really impressed with that what else I
love<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.840> it's<00:03:33.960> got<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.170> exposure<00:03:34.440> comp

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800
