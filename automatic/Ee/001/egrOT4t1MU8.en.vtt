00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.490
 the gastric tube operation or slip 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.129
 Gastrectomy is a new and excellent 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.770
 surgical technique to combat 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.410
 Obesity is about 8 years old 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.700
 and currently it is approved or 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.370
 supported by all societies 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.930
 scientists we were pioneers in 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.630
 Spain in the implementation of this 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.040
 technique together with two other teams and 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.860
 we currently have a long 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.619
 experience with more than 310 patients 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.720
 intervened and up to 5 years of evolution 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.329
 has been the technique that has displaced 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.550
 almost all cases of gastric band 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.530
 I do in the part of the gastric bypass and 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.630
 is the one that gives more interest in the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.190
 clinic currently experience with 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.040
 our patients has been frankly 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.739
 good with very satisfied patients 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.899
 a good weight loss good quality 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.790
 life with few controls power 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.370
 doctors do not have to take vitamins from 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.620
 for life etcetera nevertheless in spite of 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.350
 its apparent simplicity is an operation 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.290
 delicate and should only perform equipment 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.960
 with great experience in surgery of the 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.149
 obesity by laparoscopy the operation 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.830
 It has important technical difficulties 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:10.910
 that if they are not resolved with 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.910
 and may end up producing leaks or 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.060
 fistulas that can be complicated 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.830
 solve and asymmetric dilations that 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.530
 in the long run they can lead to a 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.860
 recovery of lost weight this is 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.480
 solve by performing a plasty 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.550
 perfectly tubular and the narrowest 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.620
 possible we fulfill the 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.970
 quality parameters recommended by the 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.250
 American Association of Surgery 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.120
 bariatric for this operation that are 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.729
 a possible mortality lower than 0 25% and 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.360
 possible minor complications of 2% 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.150
 we also have the great fortune that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.590
 310 patients operated on we have not 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.140
 had no case of mortality 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.869
 We currently perform this technique 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.490
 laparoscopic mini-invasive surgery or 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.810
 assisted single port that is a 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.229
 evolution of laparoscopic surgery 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.840
 conventional this technique allows a 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.940
 rapid recovery of the patient because 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.729
 there is less aggression towards 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.040
 organism and we also get in 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.310
 cicatriciales minimum marks because 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.319
 operates through man 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.770
 where scars are not noticed with 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.050
 small supports we also use the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.270
 Quick recovery method 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.130
 postoperative called fast track that 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.560
 it allows us that the patient only 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.660
 need a 48- hour stay in the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.780
 hospital and can return to a life 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.870
 normal in 17 days although it is the operation 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.640
 more physiological or natural can not 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.730
 used in all patients because 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.069
 is less effective in cases of 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.530
 great rallies and sweet eaters 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.099
 and in principle it should not be used with 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.650
 BMI is above 45 in any case 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.349
 patient must be aware that he has 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.569
 that change your lifestyle improve 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.549
 your nutritional habits being 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.799
 careful with meals and perform 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.329
 physical exercise usually in 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.939
 our website can find information 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.939
 more detailed about this technique thank you
