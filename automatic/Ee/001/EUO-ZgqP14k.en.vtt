00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.919 
about momentum it's all about taking
advantage<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.849> your<00:00:11.969> opponent<00:00:12.420> at<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.570> moment

component<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> math<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.850> really

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
component of the math all that is really

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.299 
component of the math all that is really
important<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.600> once<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.930> lose<00:00:34.140> control<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:35.100> a

heads-up match it's somewhat difficult

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.650 
heads-up match it's somewhat difficult
to<00:00:38.219> regain<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> back<00:00:38.820> especially<00:00:39.390> against<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
to regain it back especially against a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.209 
to regain it back especially against a
good<00:00:39.750> player<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.320> once<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.620> person<00:00:41.040> has

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
good player because once that person has

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.530 
good player because once that person has
that<00:00:41.370> they're<00:00:41.520> gonna<00:00:41.640> seize<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.090> hang<00:00:42.420> on

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that they're gonna seize it and hang on

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.560 
that they're gonna seize it and hang on
to<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> you're<00:00:43.559> kind<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.920> forced<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:45.030> really

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
to it you're kind of forced to be really

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.910 
to it you're kind of forced to be really
focused<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.079> has<00:00:46.230> an<00:00:46.350> edge<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.800> are

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
focused and has an edge because you are

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.250 
focused and has an edge because you are
playing<00:00:47.160> every<00:00:47.430> hand<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.870> involved

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
playing every hand and you're involved

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.930 
playing every hand and you're involved
in<00:00:49.320> every<00:00:49.559> pot<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> pots<00:00:50.309> go<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.640> quickly

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
in every pot and the pots go so quickly

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240 
in every pot and the pots go so quickly
it's<00:00:51.360> way<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:51.960> more<00:00:51.989> than<00:00:52.250> tournament

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
it's way it's way more than tournament

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520 
it's way it's way more than tournament
that<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.090> kind<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> difficult<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:55.020> lose

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that it's kind of difficult to lose

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.049 
that it's kind of difficult to lose
focus<00:00:55.770> while<00:00:56.129> you're<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.340> heads-up<00:00:56.610> match<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
focus while you're in heads-up match I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.779 
focus while you're in heads-up match I
really<00:00:57.600> actually<00:00:57.719> try<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> figure<00:00:58.350> out<00:00:58.640> what<00:00:59.640> I

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
really actually try to figure out what I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.200 
really actually try to figure out what I
can<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:01.129> discern<00:01:02.129> from<00:01:02.430> any<00:01:02.820> little

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
can what I can discern from any little

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.490 
can what I can discern from any little
action<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:03.629> opponent<00:01:03.960> does<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.290> can

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
action my opponent does so I can

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.070 
action my opponent does so I can
basically<00:01:05.000> formulate<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.210> game<00:01:06.240> plan<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.869> fast

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
basically formulate a game plan as fast

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.980 
basically formulate a game plan as fast
as<00:01:07.229> possible<00:01:07.290> I'm<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:09.119> testing<00:01:09.810> him

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
as possible I'm not really testing him

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
as possible I'm not really testing him
so<00:01:10.290> much<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:11.070> trying<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> take<00:01:12.000> whatever

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
so much as just trying to take whatever

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.230 
so much as just trying to take whatever
little<00:01:12.869> information<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.710> or<00:01:13.950> use<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.520> just

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
little information I see or use and just

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.539 
little information I see or use and just
add<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> pile<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:17.040> deviate

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
add it on the pile and and then deviate

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.609 
add it on the pile and and then deviate
my<00:01:17.670> plate<00:01:17.909> from<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.960> really<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.409> about

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
my plate from there it really is about

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.920 
my plate from there it really is about
aggression<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.610> that's<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
aggression but because that's like a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.100 
aggression but because that's like a
very<00:01:22.430> elementary<00:01:23.430> requirement<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.600> heads<00:01:24.900> up

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
very elementary requirement for heads up

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.929 
very elementary requirement for heads up
for<00:01:25.500> me<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.130> view<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.640> much<00:01:26.790> as

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
for me I don't really view it so much as

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.690 
for me I don't really view it so much as
aggression<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:28.680> win<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> match<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.460> view

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
aggression to win the match as I view

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.210 
aggression to win the match as I view
the<00:01:30.119> necessity<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.630> control<00:01:31.259> what's<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.159> on

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the necessity to control what's going on

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980 
the necessity to control what's going on
for<00:01:32.610> instance<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.970> sometimes<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.689> might<00:01:33.780> be

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
for instance like sometimes it might be

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.130 
for instance like sometimes it might be
better<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.850> get<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.360> check<00:01:36.630> call<00:01:36.840> if

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
better to get your to like check call if

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.450 
better to get your to like check call if
your<00:01:37.320> opponent's<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.799> tilted<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.250> might<00:01:38.369> be

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
your opponent's like tilted it might be

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.340 
your opponent's like tilted it might be
better<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> lot<00:01:39.420> more<00:01:39.450> passive<00:01:40.110> lines

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
better to take a lot more passive lines

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.690 
better to take a lot more passive lines
and<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> form<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.280> aggression<00:01:41.490> because

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and it is a form of aggression because

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
and it is a form of aggression because
you're<00:01:41.970> controlling<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:42.899> you're<00:01:43.290> you're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you're controlling then you're you're

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.469 
you're controlling then you're you're
kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.189> owning<00:01:44.520> them<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.090> long<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
kind of owning them so as long as you

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.630 
kind of owning them so as long as you
control<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> match<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
control the match and you you have a
