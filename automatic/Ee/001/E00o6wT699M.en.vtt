00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.200
 hello there haven't been any videos for a long time 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.059
 and today the package has been unpacked 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:29.820
 inside of which there is a module 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:37.890
 stun gun packed modestly here 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:41.489
 such a module is a wire for the arrester 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.210
 and the power wires of the module itself is flooded 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:50.340
 some kind of resin module parameters 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.239
 powered by a voltage of 3.6 volts let's 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.460
 try to connect it and look at 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.020
 spark that in general he can give at all 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.629
 I have an idea to make a potato 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.370
 gun and this module I need in order 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.370
 to ignite the gas mixture 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.040
 we will power the lithium battery 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.930
 from one street battery well and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.600
 let's make such an improvised 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.689
 discharger but here somewhere around one 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.689
 centimeter 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.520
 Of course it is better to do on the rations we 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 We will do so to a 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.820
 to show 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:01.299
 so our arrester is so fixed 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:06.409
 in a way that you can see better from 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:10.340
 I hope I can see I take off my mobile phone 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.239
 unfortunately I donâ€™t have a camera yet 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.860
 that it never acquired 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.840
 nothing soon I think the camera 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:25.299
 still I will have so I connect 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:32.230
 I think that red is + white from minus 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:36.280
 so try nothing happens 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.519
 strange try less 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.519
 try this 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.580
 there is 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.400
 cleanliness is a big problem to build 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:59.350
 something like that immediately smelled that smell 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.350
 as ozone does not penetrate means less 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.330
 need less for example on so 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.390
 Well, here we are 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:29.379
 today stun module I think 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:31.349
 gas he will wait quietly all thanks 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.239
 what were watching 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.319
 I hope that the video with potato cannon 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.410
 I will still do it and show you to everyone 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.410
 until
