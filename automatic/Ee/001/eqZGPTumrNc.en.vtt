 the girl who was swimming in the lake and was

 beaten by this monster 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.960
 [music] 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.970
 so that's what it means to hit nearby stood 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.520
 a guy and he jumped into the water to swim 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.620
 to the boat and drive her to the beach but from 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.810
 water rose a huge beast

 like a frog just not a frog 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.340
 columba such stood looked at all this 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.060
 and then drove the beast through prayer 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.740
 end gradually over all descriptions people 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.400
 started to imagine what it looks like 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.400
 this monster 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.240
 London doctor throws Wilson argued 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.320
 that the monster photographed by chance 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.780
 when traveled was 1934 people 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.570
 were gullible naive and did not know what 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.150
 there was actually a dream 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.970
 accomplice in general, the main photo of Messi 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.740
 fake but sonar study revealed 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.350
 what is at the great depth of this lake 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.180
 inhabited by huge objects capable 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.220
 self climb swim and so 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.530
 further but what is it so far no one 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:15.720
 found out 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:19.330
 [music] 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.920
 in 2007 gordon holmes decided 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.989
 place microphones in the lake and 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.489
 explore the beeps he noticed 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.709
 movement under the water and immediately got 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.560
 camera and filmed like the head of it 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.670
 creatures sometimes crawls to the surface 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.280
 experts confirmed that the film 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.799
 authentic 15 meter creature moving 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.110
 at a speed of 10 kilometers per hour but this 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.299
 the film is not considered compelling why 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.269
 you ask because scientists 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.900
 there was an opinion that it could be 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:51.910
 giant beetle or worm bastard matt 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.519
 people love that is a 15 meter worm a 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.880
 that under normally same not the sucker Nessky 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.880
 monster 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.930
 it seems to me or it looks like a tank 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.040
 it's a huge caterpillar 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.110
 even google saw this something and no this 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.510
 a boat 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:48.770
 why don't people believe this legend by 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:50.600
 heading out the amount of biomass in the lake 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.090
 not enough to feed such 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.790
 paunch of a tinkoff monster and his whole family 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.680
 Well, if she is and Scotland in the bearded 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.780
 times covered with ice 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.670
 and scientists unknown animals who 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.680
 can survive in such conditions on the other 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.810
 parties who believe they say that missy 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.730
 sails through underground tunnels into the sea 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:12.680

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.180
 good money earn on tourists 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.460
 wishing to see this monster is possible 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.010
 carry it once and existed well not easy 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.270
 same as the legend would like to write to me 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.380
 believe but since there is not one 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.260
 proof of 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:32.000
 Hard to believe everything while you are 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.220
 remind my brother have one more 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.470
 theory he suggested that it is possible in 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.780
 world there is a temporary hole so 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.060
 such creatures appear as 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.400
 Loch Ness monster snowman and 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:48.410
 immediately disappear so nobody can them
