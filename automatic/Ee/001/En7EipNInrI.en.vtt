build everything is Ian and working like
a<00:00:11.639> champ<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.559> should<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> once<00:00:13.860> over<00:00:14.130> here<00:00:16.190> of

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
a champ so should be a once over here of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:39.460 
a champ so should be a once over here of
the<00:00:17.460> whole<00:00:17.699> system

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.050 

everything<00:00:40.470> fit<00:00:41.240> relatively<00:00:42.240> well<00:00:43.250> I<00:00:44.250> had

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
everything fit relatively well I had

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.930 
everything fit relatively well I had
plans<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.600> running<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.440> return<00:00:47.190> hose<00:00:47.490> out

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
plans of running this return hose out

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.900 
plans of running this return hose out
the<00:00:48.150> back<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> case<00:00:48.720> and<00:00:49.080> up<00:00:49.430> and<00:00:50.430> through

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the back of the case and up and through

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.600 
the back of the case and up and through
here<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.770> that<00:00:52.770> did<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.010> work<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.550> just

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
here but that did not work out just

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.510 
here but that did not work out just
because<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.540> wires<00:00:55.380> and<00:00:55.920> these<00:00:56.070> things<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
because of wires and these things are a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.820 
because of wires and these things are a
pain<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.880> ass<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.739> you

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
pain in the ass because you know you

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.960 
pain in the ass because you know you
don't<00:00:58.920> realize<00:00:59.220> how<00:00:59.370> many<00:00:59.430> wires<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.940> have

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
don't realize how many wires you have

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.240 
don't realize how many wires you have
until<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.570> actually<00:01:00.720> start<00:01:01.250> putting

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
until you actually start putting

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.980 
until you actually start putting
together<00:01:02.309> your<00:01:02.520> computer<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:05.000> it's<00:01:06.000> uh<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.630> did

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
together your computer but it's uh I did

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.969 
together your computer but it's uh I did
the<00:01:07.080> best<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.440> could

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the best I could

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
the best I could
it's<00:01:08.729> tough<00:01:08.970> sometimes<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.690> these

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's tough sometimes you get these

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.440 
it's tough sometimes you get these
things<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.369> bend<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.580> rout<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.970> way<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.119> want

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
things to bend and rout the way you want

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.790 
things to bend and rout the way you want
but<00:01:13.910> I<00:01:14.910> do<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> best<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.990> keep<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.530> clean

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
but I do the best to keep this as clean

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.880 
but I do the best to keep this as clean
as<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.100> possibly<00:01:17.640> could<00:01:18.290> I'll<00:01:19.290> show<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.800> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
as I possibly could I'll show you the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:33.730 
as I possibly could I'll show you the
back<00:01:20.070> side<00:01:20.400> here

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.160 

lots<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> lots<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.400> wires<00:01:35.870> one<00:01:36.870> thing<00:01:37.050> that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
lots and lots of wires one thing that

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.310 
lots and lots of wires one thing that
really<00:01:37.350> irritates<00:01:37.860> me<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.190> these<00:01:38.340> things<00:01:39.080> um<00:01:40.080> I

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
really irritates me of these things um I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.020 
really irritates me of these things um I
can<00:01:40.500> understand<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.160> reasoning<00:01:41.550> for<00:01:41.610> putting

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
can understand the reasoning for putting

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.580 
can understand the reasoning for putting
them<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:42.900> daisy<00:01:43.080> chain<00:01:43.380> knees

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
them you know with daisy chain knees

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.140 
them you know with daisy chain knees
like<00:01:43.830> this<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:45.780> honestly<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:47.670> love<00:01:47.970> to

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
like this but honestly I would love to

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.050 
like this but honestly I would love to
see<00:01:48.360> some<00:01:48.900> kind<00:01:49.050> of<00:01:49.140> an<00:01:49.260> option<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.740> comes

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
see some kind of an option that comes

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.490 
see some kind of an option that comes
with<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.230> you<00:01:52.230> know<00:01:52.940> one<00:01:53.940> on<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.990> end<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
with just you know one on the end and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.870 
with just you know one on the end and
then<00:01:55.740> maybe<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.130> said<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.400> two<00:01:56.550> and<00:01:56.730> then

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
then maybe you said it two and then

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.610 
then maybe you said it two and then
three<00:01:56.910> so<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.870> can<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.170> kind<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.410> choose

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
three so you can just kind of choose

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:07.130 
three so you can just kind of choose
depending<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.280> wanted<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> do<00:02:06.140> try

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
depending on what you wanted to do try

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.710 
depending on what you wanted to do try
to<00:02:07.200> keep<00:02:07.380> her<00:02:07.470> as<00:02:07.560> tight<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:07.890> possible

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
to keep her as tight as possible

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.070 
to keep her as tight as possible
something<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:10.520> I<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:12.240> not<00:02:12.360> aware<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.690> but

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
something that I was not aware of but

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.290 
something that I was not aware of but
I'm<00:02:13.410> now<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.520> tell<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.730> guys<00:02:14.880> about<00:02:15.030> is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
I'm now and can tell you guys about is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
I'm now and can tell you guys about is
if<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.900> plan<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.200> installing<00:02:16.650> an<00:02:17.040> SSD<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:18.320> one

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
if you plan on installing an SSD in one

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.960 
if you plan on installing an SSD in one
of<00:02:19.380> these<00:02:19.500> cases<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.340> you're<00:02:20.580> going<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.850> do

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
of these cases and you're going to do

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.200 
of these cases and you're going to do
this<00:02:21.120> mod<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.950> actually<00:02:22.950> chop<00:02:23.220> off<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
this mod you actually chop off the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.720 
this mod you actually chop off the
bottom<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.160> actually<00:02:26.459> supposed<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.670> be

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
bottom this is actually supposed to be

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.490 
bottom this is actually supposed to be
mounted<00:02:27.090> down<00:02:27.240> here<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.930> tops<00:02:28.140> will<00:02:28.350> seat

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
mounted down here and the tops will seat

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.370 
mounted down here and the tops will seat
mounted<00:02:28.740> up<00:02:28.860> here<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.600> had<00:02:30.600> kind<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.230> guy

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
mounted up here so I had kind of a guy

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.980 
mounted up here so I had kind of a guy
over<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.709> up<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.010> there<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:32.640> there

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
over that up in there but it's in there

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.890 
over that up in there but it's in there
good<00:02:37.489> everything<00:02:38.489> should<00:02:38.730> work<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.480> champ

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
good everything should work like a champ

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.310 
good everything should work like a champ
so<00:02:40.790> as<00:02:41.790> far<00:02:41.970> as<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.209> system<00:02:42.420> build<00:02:42.810> goes<00:02:43.020> this

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
so as far as the system build goes this

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.890 
so as far as the system build goes this
will<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.739> last<00:02:43.920> video<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.670> do<00:02:45.570> plan<00:02:45.840> on

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
will be the last video I do plan on

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.350 
will be the last video I do plan on
overclocking<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:47.190> I'll<00:02:48.120> do<00:02:48.300> some

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
overclocking this so I'll do some

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.650 
overclocking this so I'll do some
overclock<00:02:48.840> videos<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.470> then<00:02:49.620> give<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.040> some

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
overclock videos and then give you some
