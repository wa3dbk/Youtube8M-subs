00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:08.770
 hi everyone to taqueros transfer the 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.410
 samsung galaxy 13 for us to see the 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.780
 new samsung watch on samsung galaxy 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.330
 of a watch that as we have seen the 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.599
 presentation tries to be a connection 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.060
 between the phone and in this case the 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.279
 that is, try to be on the one hand 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.270
 offer us different options but 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.820
 especially so that we have the 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.180
 information from one device in the other 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.570
 yes to the small screen of 1.65 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.030
 inches with a resolution of just how 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.910
 320 x 320 pixels we see that the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.890
 device is simple is especially 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.079
 great as we can see in the photos and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.730
 The quality of the good screen is the 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.829
 better but in this case it 's pretty 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.199
 subjective is more than enough for 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.829
 that we are from the terminal only has one 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.870
 physical button that we have here and since 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.350
 he just turn on the screen the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.289
 we pay 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.050
 we left the applications on the one hand 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.610
 in the main menu by sliding the finger 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.509
 horizontal we have the applications 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.190
 main but then at the bottom we have 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.680
 all the package applications we have for 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.530
 example peace we have the pedometer we have 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.440
 few applications to take care 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.150
 courier register it called 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.920
 one of the functions that we have already seen 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.980
 that was the possibility of making cameras 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.330
 with this little camera that we have here 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.280
 obviously the quality is not the best 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.120
 of all but in this case it is more than 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.460
 enough 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.170
 but I feel like this device is like 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.800
 we can see moves with enough 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.960
 fluent and samsung is promised that 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.960
 we will have an autonomy of 25 hours 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.950
 the truth is the first sensation with the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.460
 device has been pretty good going 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.860
 pretty good and it's a little better than 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.960
 the images that we saw in the prototype 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.300
 everything is much more compact 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.620
 the design is quite good and now what 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.360
 It remains to be seen if it will really be 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.420
 hollow because we can have many 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.830
 options in your will draw from the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.180
 respective applications so that 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.610
 developers are going to adapt their 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.740
 creations but it is the truth that is a 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.050
 pretty interesting gadget there will be that 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.430
 see what the final price will be and it's a 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.500
 pity that in this case then stay 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.120
 simply limited to using it with 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.370
 devices of the galaxy family of 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.490
 samsung that is, we will not be able to use it 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.680
 nor with sony mobiles very good with htc 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.900
 yes for now and we'll see the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.570
 developer community as already 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.890
 it's been usual to learn a 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.100
 little the original limits of this 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.100
 device 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.170
 well then samsung galaxy days the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.900
 device complement of nou 3 and the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.659
 rest of devices does not have will be the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.299
 launch galaxy s 4 galaxy s3 and 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.540
 the two maintenance companies 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.650
 coastal of course the clock function 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.840
 notifications any notification 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.930
 that we reach the sea â€‹â€‹as we can see 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.750
 we will see the device in the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.099
 screen but if we want to expand it to 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.450
 take us to the device by the hand 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.420
 it automatically unlocks that 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.360
 application 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.010
 voice memo we can take voice notes and 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.140
 they will also be synchronized and 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.360
 matching with our device every 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.640
 connection goes by virtue they are sent 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.520
 the voice notes and also the smartphone 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.520
 no 3 converts it to text does the voice to 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.580
 text then boix asking what 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.810
 time will man an appointment I have 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.550
 something to do tomorrow because it does not stop 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.080
 interacting with the calendar with the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.830
 notifications with email with all 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.850
 the gallery applications because it has 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.400
 camera a 1.9 megapixel camera and 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.200
 then we can see of course the 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.780
 applications that the images that we have 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.870
 taken by the camera the gesture of returning 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.870
 behind 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.959
 and to controller the music we have in 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.760
 the smartphone and we are listening to the 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.010
 tied we can control it from here in 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.430
 the sac action goes up the volume any 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.040
 Metro mode counts the steps we take 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.210
 for associated with the exercise and others 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.730
 objects that we commented on that 4 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.500
 the settings of course although many 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.880
 of the adjustments are controlled from elevate 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.740
 with installing applications for example 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.920
 the one of the smartphone change the interface 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.080
 it's also a companion device makes 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.970
 some things for yourself the camera the 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.820
 record voice notes but it will always go 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.240
 associated with installed applications 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.570
 forever 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.620
 all this is in the American part 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.620
 we are again
