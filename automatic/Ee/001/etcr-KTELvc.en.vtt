00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
let's let's look at this let's do all

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.560 
let's let's look at this let's do all
this<00:00:54.440> I<00:00:54.920> think<00:00:55.130> in<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.400> last<00:00:55.520> three<00:00:55.940> days<00:00:55.970> I've

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
this I think in the last three days I've

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.200 
this I think in the last three days I've
learned<00:00:57.230> more<00:00:57.470> than<00:00:57.500> I<00:00:57.770> have<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:58.880> know<00:00:59.030> and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
learned more than I have you know and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.510 
learned more than I have you know and
many<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.960> my<00:00:59.989> management<00:01:00.560> classes<00:01:00.920> combined

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
many of my management classes combined

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.310 
many of my management classes combined
just<00:01:01.790> because<00:01:02.149> he<00:01:02.360> really<00:01:02.690> gets<00:01:02.870> down<00:01:02.960> to<00:01:03.290> the

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
just because he really gets down to the

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.499 
just because he really gets down to the
nitty-gritty<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.190> exactly<00:01:05.059> how<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.270> do

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
nitty-gritty the exactly how to do

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.210 
nitty-gritty the exactly how to do
something<00:01:05.899> we<00:01:05.990> have<00:01:06.140> these<00:01:06.290> expectations<00:01:06.680> of

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
something we have these expectations of

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.350 
something we have these expectations of
how<00:01:07.340> we're<00:01:07.520> supposed<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.880> present<00:01:08.090> ourselves

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
how we're supposed to present ourselves

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.690 
how we're supposed to present ourselves
as<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.780> teacher<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.290> classroom<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:10.009> no<00:01:10.580> one

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
as a teacher in the classroom but no one

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.480 
as a teacher in the classroom but no one
ever<00:01:10.759> tells<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.210> exactly<00:01:11.300> how<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.780> do<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.490> it's

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
ever tells you exactly how to do it it's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.130 
ever tells you exactly how to do it it's
just<00:01:13.729> kind<00:01:13.940> of<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.090> generalization<00:01:14.690> a<00:01:14.930> broad

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
just kind of a generalization a broad

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.130 
just kind of a generalization a broad
idea<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:15.710> really<00:01:16.130> like<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.610> fact<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.140> you

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
idea so I really like the fact that you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.870 
idea so I really like the fact that you
actually<00:01:18.259> stand<00:01:18.649> up<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.130> walk<00:01:19.280> through<00:01:19.340> and

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
actually stand up and walk through and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.690 
actually stand up and walk through and
have<00:01:20.149> to<00:01:20.360> model<00:01:21.370> exactly<00:01:22.370> how<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.549> would

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
have to model exactly how you would

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.719 
have to model exactly how you would
interact<00:01:22.970> with<00:01:23.270> students<00:01:23.750> how<00:01:24.440> you<00:01:24.500> would<00:01:24.770> run

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
interact with students how you would run

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.950 
interact with students how you would run
the<00:01:25.850> procedures<00:01:27.010> so<00:01:28.010> I<00:01:28.040> think<00:01:28.360> it<00:01:29.360> gives<00:01:29.750> you

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
the procedures so I think it gives you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.899 
the procedures so I think it gives you
tools<00:01:30.260> that<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.010> actually<00:01:31.190> use<00:01:31.400> and

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
tools that you can actually use and

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.930 
tools that you can actually use and
implement<00:01:32.799> because<00:01:33.799> he<00:01:34.190> breaks<00:01:34.430> it<00:01:34.610> down<00:01:34.729> in

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
implement because he breaks it down in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.820 
implement because he breaks it down in
such<00:01:35.150> a<00:01:35.180> way<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:35.450> makes<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.990> very<00:01:36.049> easy<00:01:36.350> and

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
such a way that makes it very easy and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.170 
such a way that makes it very easy and
practical<00:01:37.010> for<00:01:37.490> new<00:01:37.580> teachers<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:38.090> be

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
practical for new teachers to be

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.030 
practical for new teachers to be
successful<00:01:39.850> he<00:01:40.850> has<00:01:41.240> real<00:01:41.570> insight<00:01:42.049> into<00:01:42.650> the

reality of how challenging it is to work

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
a real classroom and he has a way of

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.200 
a real classroom and he has a way of
making<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:57.020> very<00:01:57.890> possible<00:01:58.549> for<00:01:58.850> even<00:01:58.970> new

but<00:02:05.330> gives<00:02:05.540> them<00:02:05.720> an<00:02:05.810> opportunity<00:02:05.900> to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
but gives them an opportunity to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.830 
but gives them an opportunity to
practice<00:02:06.799> those<00:02:06.950> skills<00:02:07.070> as<00:02:07.400> well<00:02:07.690> it's<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.750> lot

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
practice those skills as well it's a lot

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.640 
practice those skills as well it's a lot
of<00:02:08.959> time-saving<00:02:09.590> stuff<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.429> lot<00:02:10.610> of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
of time-saving stuff and a lot of

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.470 
of time-saving stuff and a lot of
self-preservation<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:14.120> teaching

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
self-preservation in the teaching

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.900 
self-preservation in the teaching
because<00:02:14.600> teaching<00:02:15.019> can<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.170> very<00:02:15.470> stressful

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
because teaching can be very stressful

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.520 
because teaching can be very stressful
and<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:17.060> lot<00:02:17.570> of<00:02:17.630> teachers<00:02:17.750> burnt<00:02:18.140> out<00:02:18.260> quickly

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
and a lot of teachers burnt out quickly

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.160 
and a lot of teachers burnt out quickly
so<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.430> think<00:02:19.519> one<00:02:20.299> of<00:02:20.329> the<00:02:20.480> main<00:02:20.510> threats<00:02:21.049> of

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
so I think one of the main threats of

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.240 
so I think one of the main threats of
this<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.650> help<00:02:21.799> you<00:02:22.480> relax<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:24.680> calmed

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
this is to help you relax to be calmed

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.390 
this is to help you relax to be calmed
use<00:02:25.520> your<00:02:26.060> calmness<00:02:26.480> as<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.720> strength<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.400> it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
use your calmness as a strength and it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.339 
use your calmness as a strength and it
really<00:02:28.580> drives<00:02:28.849> home<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.120> point<00:02:29.239> that<00:02:29.599> when

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
really drives home the point that when

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.520 
really drives home the point that when
you

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
you

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.270 
you
you're<00:02:31.150> angry<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:36.050> makes<00:02:36.110> your<00:02:36.590> blood

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
you're angry it makes your blood

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.699 
you're angry it makes your blood
pressure<00:02:37.670> rise<00:02:37.970> makes<00:02:38.840> your<00:02:39.020> voice<00:02:39.050> louder

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
pressure rise makes your voice louder

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.410 
pressure rise makes your voice louder
and<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:42.170> makes<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:43.160> weaker<00:02:43.790> teacher<00:02:44.030> in

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
and that makes you a weaker teacher in

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.210 
and that makes you a weaker teacher in
effect<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.940> learning<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.980> spread<00:02:48.980> jobs

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
effect so learning of spread jobs

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.300 
effect so learning of spread jobs
conference<00:02:49.520> to<00:02:49.880> me<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.150> really<00:02:50.600> about

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
conference to me is really about

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.490 
conference to me is really about
teachers<00:02:52.310> preserving<00:02:53.000> their<00:02:53.120> own<00:02:53.270> power<00:02:54.170> and

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
teachers preserving their own power and

teachers preserving their own power and
strength<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:55.940> they<00:02:56.120> have<00:02:56.330> time<00:02:56.600> at<00:02:56.750> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
strength so that they have time at the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.900 
strength so that they have time at the
end<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.080> day<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:58.069> be<00:02:58.100> with<00:02:58.310> their<00:02:58.459> families

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
and that was my favorite just because I

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.280 
and that was my favorite just because I
can<00:03:27.380> see<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:28.390> actually<00:03:29.390> having<00:03:29.720> use<00:03:29.959> in<00:03:30.170> the

definitely good to have that training

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.240 
definitely good to have that training
with<00:03:38.150> us<00:03:38.360> actually<00:03:38.630> using<00:03:39.440> our<00:03:39.560> body<00:03:39.769> language

to show that we mean business it's not

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.530 
to show that we mean business it's not
something<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.920> ever<00:03:42.950> thought<00:03:43.130> of<00:03:43.340> before<00:03:43.640> so

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
something I ever thought of before so

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.000 
something I ever thought of before so
that's<00:03:44.900> good<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.170> was<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.530> good<00:03:45.650> thing<00:03:45.860> to

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
that's good that was a good thing to

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.160 
that's good that was a good thing to
have<00:03:46.160> he<00:03:47.120> provides<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.989> structure<00:03:48.769> for

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
have he provides a structure for

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.479 
have he provides a structure for
bringing<00:03:51.170> all<00:03:51.320> of<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.650> pieces<00:03:51.860> of<00:03:52.190> teacher

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
bringing all of the pieces of teacher

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.460 
bringing all of the pieces of teacher
because<00:03:52.790> teaching<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:53.450> complex<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.110> is<00:03:54.320> an

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
because teaching is so complex it is an

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.370 
because teaching is so complex it is an
art<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:54.950> is<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.100> science<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.850> is<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.600> hard<00:03:57.140> and

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
art it is a science it is it is hard and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.870 
art it is a science it is it is hard and
people<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:58.040> aren't<00:03:58.310> teachers<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.700> don't

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
people that aren't teachers I don't

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.210 
people that aren't teachers I don't
think<00:03:59.090> understand<00:03:59.780> the<00:04:00.320> complexity<00:04:00.950> that

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
think understand the complexity that

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.759 
think understand the complexity that
teaching<00:04:01.700> really<00:04:02.000> brings<00:04:02.239> but<00:04:02.989> he<00:04:03.200> takes<00:04:03.500> it

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
teaching really brings but he takes it

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.060 
teaching really brings but he takes it
as<00:04:03.950> far<00:04:04.340> as<00:04:04.579> a<00:04:05.030> hierarchy<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.870> what<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:06.650> can<00:04:06.829> do

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
as far as a hierarchy of what you can do

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.130 
as far as a hierarchy of what you can do
in<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.370> beginning<00:04:07.670> that's<00:04:08.359> the<00:04:08.630> cheapest

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
in the beginning that's the cheapest

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.400 
in the beginning that's the cheapest
thing<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:09.440> do<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.950> most<00:04:11.200> biggest<00:04:12.200> bang<00:04:12.380> for

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
thing to do the most biggest bang for

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.890 
thing to do the most biggest bang for
your<00:04:12.620> buck<00:04:12.680> by<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:14.180> know<00:04:14.269> structuring<00:04:14.810> the

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
your buck by you know structuring the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.319 
your buck by you know structuring the
classroom<00:04:15.320> for<00:04:15.739> success<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.340> then<00:04:16.940> going

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
classroom for success and then going

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.330 
classroom for success and then going
through<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.720> different<00:04:18.109> stages<00:04:18.140> of<00:04:18.620> how<00:04:19.280> do

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
through the different stages of how do

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.400 
through the different stages of how do
you<00:04:19.519> get<00:04:19.729> kids<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.269> not<00:04:20.660> do<00:04:20.930> what<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.200> don't

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
you get kids to not do what you don't

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.990 
you get kids to not do what you don't
want<00:04:21.620> them<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.859> do<00:04:21.979> that's<00:04:22.190> inappropriate<00:04:22.430> and

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
want them to do that's inappropriate and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.240 
want them to do that's inappropriate and
then<00:04:23.390> another<00:04:23.870> step<00:04:24.260> up<00:04:24.410> how<00:04:24.680> do<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.890> get<00:04:25.100> them

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
then another step up how do you get them

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.460 
then another step up how do you get them
to<00:04:25.280> do<00:04:25.729> what<00:04:25.760> you<00:04:26.090> want<00:04:26.300> them<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.510> do<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:26.960> then

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
to do what you want them to do and then

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.930 
to do what you want them to do and then
when<00:04:27.710> that<00:04:27.860> doesn't<00:04:28.070> work<00:04:28.220> what's<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.820> other

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
when that doesn't work what's the other

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.940 
when that doesn't work what's the other
alternative<00:04:29.150> but<00:04:29.600> he<00:04:30.140> pulls<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.530> all<00:04:30.740> together

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
alternative but he pulls it all together

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.290 
alternative but he pulls it all together
in<00:04:31.400> such<00:04:31.729> a<00:04:32.560> well<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.740> most<00:04:33.979> thorough<00:04:34.760> way<00:04:35.060> of

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
in such a well the most thorough way of

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.230 
in such a well the most thorough way of
looking<00:04:35.810> at<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.320> whole<00:04:36.500> system<00:04:36.800> not<00:04:37.340> just<00:04:37.370> one

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
looking at the whole system not just one

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.540
