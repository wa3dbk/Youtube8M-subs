the second time that I've played on Pat
Rafter<00:00:20.189> arena<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.270> know<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.510> an

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
Rafter arena and you know it's an

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.240 
Rafter arena and you know it's an
amazing<00:00:21.990> cordon<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.500> much<00:00:22.619> fun<00:00:22.830> when<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.070> have

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
amazing cordon so much fun when you have

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.700 
amazing cordon so much fun when you have
the<00:00:23.970> whole<00:00:24.119> crowd<00:00:24.390> behind<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.650> know

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the whole crowd behind you and you know

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.320 
the whole crowd behind you and you know
I<00:00:25.769> think<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.130> crowd<00:00:26.640> really<00:00:26.699> helped<00:00:27.150> me<00:00:27.210> get

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
I think the crowd really helped me get

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.019 
I think the crowd really helped me get
through<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.599> second<00:00:27.990> set<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> end<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
through that second set in the end and I

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.490 
through that second set in the end and I
think<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.570> emotion<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.230> kind<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
think it's the emotion just kind of

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.170 
think it's the emotion just kind of
comes<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.009> don't<00:00:32.130> preamp<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.090> or

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
comes out you don't preamp it or

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.389 
comes out you don't preamp it or
anything<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:34.980> turn<00:00:35.280> to
