00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
unfortunately that camera wasn't able to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.420 
unfortunately that camera wasn't able to
autofocus<00:00:54.430> while<00:00:55.180> recording<00:00:56.050> so<00:00:56.800> if<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.160> showed

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
autofocus while recording so if I showed

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.479 
autofocus while recording so if I showed
you<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.700> Polish<00:00:58.270> it<00:00:58.570> was<00:00:58.720> blurry<00:00:59.050> or<00:00:59.620> the<00:01:00.160> name

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
you the Polish it was blurry or the name

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.910 
you the Polish it was blurry or the name
it<00:01:00.910> wouldn't<00:01:01.239> focus<00:01:01.480> like<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.260> one<00:01:02.649> does

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
it wouldn't focus like this one does

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.020 
it wouldn't focus like this one does
this<00:01:03.730> one<00:01:04.000> is<00:01:04.149> way<00:01:04.509> more<00:01:04.839> clearer<00:01:05.470> than<00:01:06.159> that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
this one is way more clearer than that

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.709 
this one is way more clearer than that
one<00:01:07.329> and<00:01:07.359> way<00:01:07.990> more<00:01:08.189> cheaper<00:01:09.189> so<00:01:09.789> I<00:01:09.819> think<00:01:10.359> I'm
