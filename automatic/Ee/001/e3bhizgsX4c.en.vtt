00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.370
 know now what to watch in the sky this 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.590
 week with the naked eye 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.200
 this week we can observe three 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.380
 planets with naked eyes already in the beginning of the night 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.850
 in the northwest direction is Jupiter in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.789
 constellation of twins 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.529
 it is visible until 10 pm 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.690
 on day 4 the moon passes near him 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.640
 martin is northeast visible as a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.949
 bright red star on 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.530
 constellation of virgin it can be 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.540
 observed until 4:30 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.629
 Saturn appears to the east in the constellation 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.600
 pound and can be seen throughout the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.450
 night at night appears the most 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.510
 of the Venus planets that can 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.980
 be seen from 3 and 6 east on 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.980
 constellation of fish 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.450
 the celestial sphere is divided into 88 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.640
 constellations recognized by the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.100
 international astronomical 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.229
 but some of them are much more 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.900
 popular that the others are the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.170
 constellations of the zodiac the word 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.640
 zodiac is of Greek origin and 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.410
 circle of animals 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.890
 the name refers to the constellations 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.810
 that the sun the moon and the planets seem 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.479
 go through their works 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.340
 half of these findings symbolize 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.170
 animals like sheep the bull and the lion 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.810
 to understand the zodiac is important 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.570
 present another well-defined region 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 in the celestial and critical sphere that is the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.940
 way the sun makes the sky along the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.100
 many centuries before Christ the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.860
 astronomers of Babylon had already 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.259
 divided into criticism in 12 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.350
 equal sizes called signs 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.660
 to name these twelve houses 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.030
 the Babylonians were inspired by the 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.700
 nearest astronomical constellations 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.480
 the same ones that we use until today and that 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.670
 are associated with astrological signs 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.380
 one curious thing is that the actual position 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.750
 sound on the celestial sphere 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.480
 it is often different from your home 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.820
 where cocoa, for example, on the 1st of 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.730
 January the sun is going through 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.380
 constellation of Sagittarius to his house where 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.739
 cocoa is capricorn 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.530
 moreover the sun does not travel 12 but yes 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.980
 13 constellations throughout the year will be the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.799
 13th to the Serpentarium 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.019
 this difference has several reasons 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.030
 the astronomical constellations do not 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.750
 all the same size as the houses where 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.720
 there are boxes 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.239
 more important is the influence of the 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.120
 movement of precession of the earth 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.120
 slowly changes the orientation of the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.860
 terrestrial rotation in space in millennia 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.769
 that have passed since the conception of 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.269
 zodiac the apparent position of the sun 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.900
 relation to the stars has already changed 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.739
 considerably this effect only increases 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.930
 with time 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.660
 here two thousand years ago the signs 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.849
 will be displaced almost 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.010
 two months in relation to the 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.290
 true of the sun 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.510
 so do not be alarmed if someone says 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.909
 that your sign may be wrong 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.459
 what they really mean is that the 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.980
 was not in the same constellation as the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.720
 your circle on a day you were born 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.690
 maybe that's why in the horoscope 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.500
 never work until the next program and 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.500
 your books to everyone
