GPM aluminum shocks in the rear plastic
was<00:00:53.179> enough<00:00:53.389> right<00:00:53.629> now<00:00:53.749> but<00:00:53.989> I<00:00:54.199> had<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:55.120> GPM

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
was enough right now but I had the GPM

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.189 
was enough right now but I had the GPM
aluminum<00:00:56.510> drops<00:00:56.809> on<00:00:57.019> it

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
aluminum drops on it

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
dirt track shotgun tires higher how many

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.230 
dirt track shotgun tires higher how many
tires<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:19.010> one<00:01:19.130> problem<00:01:19.370> with<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.670> though<00:01:19.940> is

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
tires is one problem with it though is

tires is one problem with it though is
that<00:01:20.510> I<00:01:20.780> don't<00:01:20.840> know<00:01:21.020> if<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.140> camera<00:01:21.440> can<00:01:21.470> see

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
that I don't know if the camera can see

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.900 
that I don't know if the camera can see
it<00:01:21.980> right<00:01:22.790> there<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.840> along<00:01:24.410> that<00:01:24.980> mine<00:01:25.310> if

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
it right there it's along that mine if

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.950 
it right there it's along that mine if
you<00:01:26.300> just<00:01:26.510> in<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:27.290> that<00:01:27.500> if<00:01:28.070> it's<00:01:28.960> no

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
you just in like that if it's no

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.980 
you just in like that if it's no
temperature<00:01:30.410> change<00:01:30.530> maybe<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:31.810> took<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.900> up

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
temperature change maybe I took the up

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.370 
temperature change maybe I took the up
to<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.170> mountains<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.680> then<00:01:33.830> came<00:01:34.340> back<00:01:34.370> down

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
to the mountains and then came back down

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.680 
to the mountains and then came back down
it<00:01:38.020> cracks<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.350> almost<00:01:39.890> rips<00:01:40.070> off<00:01:40.690> have

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
it cracks and almost rips off have

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.649 
it cracks and almost rips off have
plenty<00:01:42.050> grip<00:01:42.380> though<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:43.310> do<00:01:43.760> use<00:01:44.120> attack<00:01:44.480> on

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
plenty grip though I do use attack on

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.210 
plenty grip though I do use attack on

see<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:50.750> had<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:51.350> fly<00:01:51.560> sky<00:01:51.860> system<00:01:52.310> in<00:01:52.430> place

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
see I had the fly sky system in place

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.420 
see I had the fly sky system in place
honestly<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:55.100> system<00:01:55.550> is<00:01:55.990> not<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.290> best<00:01:57.740> it

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
honestly the system is not the best it

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.330 
honestly the system is not the best it
looks<00:01:58.700> good<00:01:59.060> at<00:01:59.390> first<00:01:59.750> glance<00:01:59.990> but<00:02:00.340> the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
looks good at first glance but the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.149 
looks good at first glance but the
antenna<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:02.030> flimsy<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:03.080> just<00:02:03.590> breaks<00:02:03.950> off

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
antenna is flimsy it just breaks off

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.440 
antenna is flimsy it just breaks off
easily<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.659> when<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:05.900> turn<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.229> on<00:02:07.450> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
easily and when you turn it on the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.980 
easily and when you turn it on the
options<00:02:08.869> are

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
options are

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.800 
options are
okay<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:12.400> no<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.820> expect<00:02:13.300> I'll<00:02:13.450> do<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.570> full

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
okay but no you expect I'll do a full

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.370 
okay but no you expect I'll do a full
review<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.290> later<00:02:14.770> on<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.840> history<00:02:17.350> of

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
review this later on in the history of

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.230 
review this later on in the history of
the<00:02:17.470> channel<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.810> key<00:02:20.620> modal<00:02:21.240> lipo

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
the channel I have a key modal lipo

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.330 
the channel I have a key modal lipo
battery<00:02:22.660> but<00:02:24.990> honestly<00:02:25.990> it's<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:26.590> not<00:02:27.100> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
battery but honestly it's just not the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.270 
battery but honestly it's just not the
best<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:27.970> have<00:02:28.720> Traxxas<00:02:29.230> connectors<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:30.070> I

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
best I have Traxxas connectors that I

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.880 
best I have Traxxas connectors that I
have<00:02:30.760> yet<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.060> solder<00:02:31.570> on<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.960> but<00:02:32.770> I'm

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
have yet to solder on to this but I'm

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.130 
have yet to solder on to this but I'm
just<00:02:32.920> using<00:02:33.160> these<00:02:33.370> cheap<00:02:33.730> ones<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.210> got

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
just using these cheap ones that got

camera it's a little the servo saver in

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.480 
camera it's a little the servo saver in
place<00:03:07.690> for<00:03:08.470> keep<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.740> from<00:03:08.860> flexing<00:03:09.190> because

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
place for keep it from flexing because

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.650 
place for keep it from flexing because
it's<00:03:09.640> already<00:03:09.820> so<00:03:10.000> much<00:03:10.090> reflects<00:03:10.420> in<00:03:10.570> the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
it's already so much reflects in the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.590 
it's already so much reflects in the
plastic<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.230> really<00:03:11.680> doesn't<00:03:12.190> matter

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
plastic it really doesn't matter

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.330 
plastic it really doesn't matter
whatsoever<00:03:13.600> I<00:03:14.080> forgot<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.560> say<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.680> have<00:03:14.860> an<00:03:14.920> HS

p he think this was literally four bucks

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.170 
p he think this was literally four bucks
but<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.190> does<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.670> job<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.920> yeah<00:03:20.920> she<00:03:21.490> cheap

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
but it does the job and yeah she cheap

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.240 
but it does the job and yeah she cheap
stuff<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.690> then<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.380> don't<00:03:23.530> know<00:03:23.590> if<00:03:23.680> there's

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
stuff and then I don't know if there's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.290 
stuff and then I don't know if there's
blue<00:03:24.940> aluminum<00:03:26.100> hex<00:03:27.100> drives<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.700> GPM<00:03:28.150> in

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
blue aluminum hex drives and GPM in

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.840 
blue aluminum hex drives and GPM in
there<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.350> chassis<00:03:32.770> does<00:03:32.950> perform

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
there and the the chassis does perform

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.270 
there and the the chassis does perform
fairly<00:03:34.390> good<00:03:34.570> over<00:03:35.050> multiple<00:03:35.650> types<00:03:36.070> of

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
fairly good over multiple types of

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.430 
fairly good over multiple types of
terrain<00:03:36.570> basically<00:03:37.570> everything<00:03:38.110> except

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
terrain basically everything except

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.740 
terrain basically everything except
grass<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:39.100> has<00:03:39.640> it's<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.270> low<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.660> ground

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
grass it has it's so low to the ground

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.560 
grass it has it's so low to the ground
that<00:03:41.500> clearance<00:03:42.010> on<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.990> say<00:03:45.570> three

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
that clearance on it is say three

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.760 
that clearance on it is say three
quarters<00:03:46.600> of<00:03:47.020> an<00:03:47.140> inch<00:03:47.290> about<00:03:49.770> basically

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
quarters of an inch about basically

00:03:50.770 --> 00:04:00.990 
quarters of an inch about basically
nothing<00:03:55.800> zoom<00:03:56.800> in<00:03:56.950> on<00:03:56.980> that

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.140 

yeah<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:02.080> then<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.650> one<00:04:03.550> other<00:04:03.580> downside

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
yeah and then the one other downside

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.790 
yeah and then the one other downside
about<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.390> chassis<00:04:04.810> is<00:04:05.250> there<00:04:06.250> is<00:04:06.600> slop<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:07.990> a

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
about the chassis is there is slop and a

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.860 
about the chassis is there is slop and a
lot<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:09.700> in<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.300> tires

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
lot of it in the tires

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.590 
lot of it in the tires
and<00:04:11.440> in<00:04:11.680> fact<00:04:11.890> there<00:04:12.100> is<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:12.490> much<00:04:12.760> swap<00:04:13.210> that

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
and in fact there is so much swap that

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.319 
and in fact there is so much swap that
it<00:04:13.900> just<00:04:14.170> go<00:04:14.410> almost<00:04:14.560> gets<00:04:14.860> annoying<00:04:15.100> you<00:04:15.250> have

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
it just go almost gets annoying you have

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.670 
it just go almost gets annoying you have
negative<00:04:16.329> 2<00:04:16.750> degrees<00:04:19.140> positive<00:04:20.140> 30<00:04:20.380> degrees

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
negative 2 degrees positive 30 degrees

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.100 
negative 2 degrees positive 30 degrees
negative<00:04:21.190> 2<00:04:21.519> positive<00:04:22.090> field<00:04:22.540> crease<00:04:22.870> and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
negative 2 positive field crease and

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.160 
negative 2 positive field crease and
that<00:04:23.200> change<00:04:23.980> is<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:24.460> often<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:25.300> would<00:04:25.720> like<00:04:25.960> to

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
that change is so often I would like to

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.200 
that change is so often I would like to
be<00:04:26.320> precise<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.130> point<00:04:27.400> where<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.640> can<00:04:27.880> have

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
be precise to the point where I can have

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.170 
be precise to the point where I can have
negative<00:04:28.720> one<00:04:29.140> degree<00:04:29.500> at<00:04:29.770> full<00:04:30.580> time<00:04:30.790> on<00:04:31.060> the

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
negative one degree at full time on the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.340 
negative one degree at full time on the
rear<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:31.630> it's<00:04:32.440> just<00:04:32.590> not<00:04:32.740> gonna<00:04:32.920> happen<00:04:34.350> and

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
rear but it's just not gonna happen and

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.690 
rear but it's just not gonna happen and
then<00:04:35.590> that's<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:35.890> same<00:04:36.040> with<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.280> front<00:04:36.520> and

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
then that's the same with the front and

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.540 
then that's the same with the front and
also<00:04:39.700> it's<00:04:40.150> at<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.810> top<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:42.250> Front's

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
also it's at the top the Front's

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.340 
also it's at the top the Front's
actually<00:04:42.850> worse<00:04:43.060> because<00:04:43.270> if<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.690> steering

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
actually worse because if the steering

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.370 
actually worse because if the steering
column<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.830> just<00:04:45.070> swap<00:04:45.910> swap<00:04:46.390> swap<00:04:47.370> but<00:04:48.370> I

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
column is just swap swap swap but I

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.840 
column is just swap swap swap but I
guess<00:04:50.380> it's<00:04:50.680> it's<00:04:51.100> good<00:04:51.430> for<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.640> amount<00:04:51.790> of

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
guess it's it's good for the amount of

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.580 
guess it's it's good for the amount of
money<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.300> pay<00:04:52.450> for<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.810> only<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.110> hundred

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
money that you pay for it only a hundred

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.230 
money that you pay for it only a hundred
and<00:04:53.620> thirty<00:04:53.830> dollars<00:04:54.130> u.s.<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:56.020> I<00:04:57.090> will<00:04:58.090> do<00:04:58.180> a

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
and thirty dollars u.s. so I will do a

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.659 
and thirty dollars u.s. so I will do a
running<00:04:58.450> video<00:04:58.720> posted<00:04:59.470> pretty<00:04:59.980> soon

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
running video posted pretty soon

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.150 
running video posted pretty soon
