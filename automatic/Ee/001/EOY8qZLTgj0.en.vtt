because<00:04:42.190> how<00:04:42.460> we've<00:04:42.670> already<00:04:42.910> made<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.780> nail

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
because how we've already made the nail

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.650 
because how we've already made the nail
itself<00:04:44.520> rigid<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:45.700> when<00:04:46.180> we<00:04:46.240> put<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:46.450> glue<00:04:46.630> on

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
itself rigid and when we put the glue on

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.110 
itself rigid and when we put the glue on
there<00:04:46.930> it's<00:04:47.080> going<00:04:47.200> to<00:04:47.290> bond<00:04:47.950> to<00:04:48.430> that<00:04:48.460> so

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
there it's going to bond to that so

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.300 
there it's going to bond to that so
they're<00:04:49.270> going<00:04:49.420> to<00:04:49.480> stay<00:04:49.690> on<00:04:49.720> there<00:04:50.110> I<00:04:50.350> think

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
they're going to stay on there I think

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.070
