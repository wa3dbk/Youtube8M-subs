as with most Brits we're going to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.729 
as with most Brits we're going to
require<00:00:43.370> some<00:00:43.940> yeast<00:00:44.390> mixture<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:45.110> pit

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
top of the water is all frothing we're

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.130 
top of the water is all frothing we're
going<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.369> be<00:01:28.460> adding<00:01:28.789> this<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.539> our<00:01:29.570> dry

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
going to be adding this to our dry

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.900 
going to be adding this to our dry
ingredients<00:01:30.460> now<00:01:31.460> we're<00:01:31.550> going<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.729> do<00:01:31.820> it

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
ingredients now we're going to do it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.940 
ingredients now we're going to do it
slowly<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.450> little<00:01:32.750> bit<00:01:32.840> at<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:32.960> time<00:01:33.050> and<00:01:33.560> making

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
slowly a little bit at a time and making

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.580 
slowly a little bit at a time and making
sure<00:01:34.250> we<00:01:34.399> mix<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.090> quite<00:01:35.360> thoroughly<00:01:35.690> and

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
sure we mix it quite thoroughly and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.590 
sure we mix it quite thoroughly and
between<00:01:37.039> it<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:37.970> it's<00:01:38.180> going<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.360> continue

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
between it so it's going to continue

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.460 
between it so it's going to continue
until<00:01:38.840> we<00:01:39.020> have<00:01:39.110> no<00:01:39.259> more<00:01:39.410> yeast<00:01:39.590> solution<00:01:40.490> and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
until we have no more yeast solution and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.670 
until we have no more yeast solution and
then<00:01:42.470> we're<00:01:42.710> gonna<00:01:42.860> start<00:01:43.160> using<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:43.670> as<00:01:44.680> per

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
then we're gonna start using it as per

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.929 
then we're gonna start using it as per
usual<00:01:45.890> we're<00:01:46.310> going<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.490> give<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:46.729> a<00:01:46.790> good

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
usual we're going to give this a good

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.429 
usual we're going to give this a good
mix<00:01:47.000> until<00:01:47.570> everything<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.869> well<00:01:47.960> combined

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
mix until everything is well combined

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.030 
mix until everything is well combined
and<00:01:49.060> once<00:01:50.060> again<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.330> can<00:01:50.360> cheat<00:01:50.689> by<00:01:51.020> using<00:01:51.320> a

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
and once again you can cheat by using a

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.310 
and once again you can cheat by using a
beater<00:01:52.460> with<00:01:52.610> dough<00:01:52.760> hooks<00:01:53.000> or<00:01:53.869> any<00:01:54.110> other

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
beater with dough hooks or any other

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.410 
beater with dough hooks or any other
appliance<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.799> makes<00:01:55.040> us<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:55.250> lot<00:01:55.520> easier<00:01:55.880> so

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
appliance that makes us a lot easier so

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.820 
appliance that makes us a lot easier so
after<00:01:56.659> we<00:01:56.750> mix<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.049> all<00:01:57.140> together<00:01:57.229> we<00:01:57.799> are

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
after we mix it all together we are

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.219 
after we mix it all together we are
going<00:01:58.189> to<00:01:58.340> get<00:01:58.720> something<00:01:59.720> that<00:01:59.810> looks<00:01:59.990> like

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
going to get something that looks like

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.429 
going to get something that looks like
this<00:02:00.680> and<00:02:01.780> we're<00:02:02.780> just<00:02:02.869> going<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.080> put<00:02:03.350> this

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
this and we're just going to put this

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.590 
this and we're just going to put this
out<00:02:03.650> onto<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.009> lightly<00:02:04.220> floured<00:02:04.729> surface<00:02:04.939> and

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
out onto a lightly floured surface and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.560 
out onto a lightly floured surface and
knead<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.759> it's<00:02:07.759> very<00:02:07.970> important<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.420> you

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
knead it it's very important that you

knead<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.019> dough<00:02:09.049> very<00:02:09.229> well<00:02:09.799> at<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:11.060> end<00:02:11.180> of

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
knead the dough very well at the end of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.819 
knead the dough very well at the end of
the<00:02:11.480> whole<00:02:11.660> kneading<00:02:11.989> process<00:02:12.019> you<00:02:12.620> should

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
the whole kneading process you should

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.500 
the whole kneading process you should
get<00:02:12.980> something<00:02:13.160> that's<00:02:13.340> nice<00:02:13.579> and<00:02:14.150> silky

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
get something that's nice and silky

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.810

pieces<00:02:17.239> up<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:18.110> just<00:02:18.320> ensures<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.769> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
pieces up this just ensures that the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.830 
pieces up this just ensures that the
bread<00:02:19.549> itself<00:02:20.000> will<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.329> nice<00:02:20.510> texture

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
bread itself will have a nice texture

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.590 
bread itself will have a nice texture
when<00:02:21.079> cooked<00:02:21.579> and<00:02:22.579> everything<00:02:22.820> puffs<00:02:23.390> up

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
when cooked and everything puffs up

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.380 
when cooked and everything puffs up
nicely<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.290> make<00:02:25.040> sure<00:02:25.070> take<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.880> extra<00:02:26.209> time

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
nicely so make sure take the extra time

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.930 
nicely so make sure take the extra time
and<00:02:26.450> knead<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.810> well<00:02:27.250> we<00:02:28.250> know<00:02:28.430> knead<00:02:28.640> the

and knead it well we know knead the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.229 
and knead it well we know knead the
dough<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:30.140> rise<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.920> for<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.850> yeast<00:02:32.060> to

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
dough to rise and for the yeast to

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.360 
dough to rise and for the yeast to
activate<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.860> we're<00:02:33.980> going<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.160> do<00:02:34.250> we're

to ten pita breads now all we're going
to<00:03:23.239> do<00:03:23.299> is<00:03:23.420> form<00:03:23.689> balls<00:03:24.079> out<00:03:24.319> of<00:03:24.349> each<00:03:24.590> section

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
to do is form balls out of each section

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.750 
to do is form balls out of each section
and<00:03:25.639> we're<00:03:26.420> gonna<00:03:26.510> let<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:26.750> rest<00:03:26.989> for<00:03:27.230> about<00:03:27.760> 15
