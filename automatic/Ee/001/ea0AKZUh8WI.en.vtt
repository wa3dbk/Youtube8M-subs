00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.440
 windows 8 that the time of innovation of the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.539
 things new with 28 is a system and 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.840
 also the first teaser but that already brings 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.880
 advantages and dirty things only in your 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.310

 s1 andrade who are old are more 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.710
 better in terms of both the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.950
 pre-history of the apple store we have 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.309
 available applications to increase 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.129
 its diversity and diversity of

 internet the device with windows phone 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.350
 it is still very primitive because 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.480
 He is new and new teaching was a little 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.890
 developer applications 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.109
 are working on it 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.070
 with time as it has been improving and 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.610
 it will pass in terms of security 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.750
 because the android is already out of date in 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.280
 security terms 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.159
 anyone can reach and simply 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.430
 put an application here in its entirety 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.420
 your android system but you can take 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.759
 careful about it 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.979
 Doing what, how do you take care? 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.320
 contracts of this type by downloading 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.750
 searching apps having 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.810
 sure of everything not to do things 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.990
 or mats is this 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.900
 s all the applications that go to the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.250
 apple store are tested before then 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.710
 so she does not leave these kinds of 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.950
 invading applications said system 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.740
 enter and misalignment between machine but with the
