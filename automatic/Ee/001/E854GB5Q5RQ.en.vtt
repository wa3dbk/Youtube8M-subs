with home sharing and that difficulty

with home sharing and that difficulty
was<00:06:17.509> our<00:06:17.690> own<00:06:17.870> fault<00:06:17.900> because<00:06:18.530> we<00:06:18.889> had<00:06:19.039> not

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
was our own fault because we had not

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.089 
was our own fault because we had not
updated<00:06:19.520> our<00:06:20.090> itunes<00:06:20.900> to<00:06:21.590> the<00:06:21.740> latest<00:06:21.889> version

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.430 
should work it didn't and that's because
we<00:06:29.300> were<00:06:29.449> not<00:06:29.690> running<00:06:29.900> the<00:06:30.080> latest<00:06:30.229> version
