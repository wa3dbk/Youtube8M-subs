well<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.410> weld<00:02:14.910> plate<00:02:15.910> on<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.239> front

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
well this up weld plate on the front

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.150 
well this up weld plate on the front
here<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.050> keep<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.440> from<00:02:17.650> squishy<00:02:17.920> note

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
here just to keep this from squishy note

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.729 
here just to keep this from squishy note
same<00:02:18.489> thought<00:02:18.760> one<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:21.480> did<00:02:22.480> as<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.560> can

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
out it was all basically all rotted in

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.180 
out it was all basically all rotted in
the<00:02:29.800> side<00:02:30.010> pieces<00:02:30.280> there<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:30.730> okay<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:32.190> I'm

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
the side pieces there so okay but I'm

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.680 
the side pieces there so okay but I'm
just<00:02:33.280> gonna<00:02:33.400> pull<00:02:33.640> all<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.880> plywood<00:02:34.030> off<00:02:34.420> and

stuff are yeah here I'll fire up the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.640 
stuff are yeah here I'll fire up the
engine<00:02:48.430> for<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.670> guys<00:02:50.100> see<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:53.080> is<00:02:53.230> electric

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
engine for you guys see it is electric

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.050 
engine for you guys see it is electric
start<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:53.980> don't<00:02:54.190> have<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.459> battery<00:02:54.610> hooked<00:02:54.850> up

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
start I don't have the battery hooked up

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.319 
start I don't have the battery hooked up
right<00:02:55.239> now<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:59.170> I'll<00:02:59.320> just<00:02:59.380> pull<00:02:59.709> start<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.160> I

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
right now so I'll just pull start it I

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.580 
right now so I'll just pull start it I
got<00:03:01.329> your<00:03:01.570> gas<00:03:01.690> here<00:03:03.329> on<00:03:04.329> your<00:03:04.690> chokes<00:03:04.959> chokes

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
got your gas here on your chokes chokes

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:33.710 
got your gas here on your chokes chokes
on<00:03:06.299> fresh<00:03:07.299> gas<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.810> it

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.170 

and<00:03:34.720> there<00:03:35.080> she<00:03:35.290> goes

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
and there she goes

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.910 
and there she goes
probably<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.270> fifth<00:03:37.450> time<00:03:37.630> fifth<00:03:38.500> or<00:03:38.650> sixth

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
probably the fifth time fifth or sixth

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.980 
probably the fifth time fifth or sixth
time<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.100> started<00:03:39.520> up<00:03:39.700> I'm<00:03:39.880> just<00:03:40.090> starting<00:03:40.900> it

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
time I started up I'm just starting it

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.510 
time I started up I'm just starting it
up<00:03:41.110> just<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.350> make<00:03:41.560> sure<00:03:41.590> it's<00:03:41.830> not<00:03:41.920> rattling

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
up just to make sure it's not rattling

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.730 
up just to make sure it's not rattling
around<00:03:42.580> too<00:03:42.850> much<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:46.080> did<00:03:47.080> let<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.410> run<00:03:47.560> for

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
around too much and I did let it run for

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.260 
around too much and I did let it run for
about<00:03:47.830> 15<00:03:48.340> matches<00:03:48.580> to<00:03:49.030> get<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.050> through<00:03:50.230> the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
about 15 matches to get it through the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.500 
about 15 matches to get it through the
surrounding<00:03:52.270> it

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
surrounding it

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.740 
surrounding it
