desert eagle I'm sure you guys are
familiar<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.830> pretty<00:00:23.039> much<00:00:23.220> in

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
familiar with it it's pretty much in

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.150 
familiar with it it's pretty much in
every<00:00:23.490> game<00:00:24.619> these<00:00:25.619> things<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:26.130> just

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
every game these things are just

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.210 
every game these things are just
powerful<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.180> hell<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.990> mean<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.980> just

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
powerful as hell I mean it's just

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.790 
powerful as hell I mean it's just
ridiculous<00:00:30.080> unfortunately<00:00:31.080> though<00:00:31.320> they're

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
ridiculous unfortunately though they're

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.010 
ridiculous unfortunately though they're
really<00:00:32.369> loud<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.210> what's<00:00:33.360> nice<00:00:33.510> about<00:00:33.570> them

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
really loud but what's nice about them

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.500 
really loud but what's nice about them
is<00:00:34.170> they're<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.649> powerful<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:36.149> doesn't

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
is they're so powerful that it doesn't

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.299 
is they're so powerful that it doesn't
matter<00:00:36.660> where<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.020> hit<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> zombie<00:00:37.620> it'll<00:00:38.190> at

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
matter where you hit the zombie it'll at

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.940 
matter where you hit the zombie it'll at
least<00:00:38.480> fall<00:00:39.480> it'll<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.140> least<00:00:40.170> fall<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
least fall it'll at least fall to the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.520 
least fall it'll at least fall to the
ground<00:00:41.030> but<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> mean<00:00:42.300> there<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.260> some

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
ground but I mean there are like some

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.740 
ground but I mean there are like some
cutbacks<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.190> these<00:00:44.340> they're<00:00:44.750> incredibly

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
cutbacks to these they're incredibly

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.459 
cutbacks to these they're incredibly
loud<00:00:46.280> incredibly<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.610> powerful<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.200> sense

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
loud incredibly like powerful in a sense

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.610 
loud incredibly like powerful in a sense
that<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.770> mean<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.219> got<00:00:50.399> high<00:00:50.610> recoil<00:00:51.620> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that I mean it's got high recoil it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.260 
that I mean it's got high recoil it
doesn't<00:00:53.039> even<00:00:53.129> matter<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.030> 50

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
doesn't even matter that it's a 50

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
doesn't even matter that it's a 50
caliber<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.750> still<00:00:55.020> can't<00:00:55.320> penetrate<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
caliber you still can't penetrate the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.040 
caliber you still can't penetrate the
armor<00:00:56.219> these<00:00:56.430> stupid<00:00:57.000> armored<00:00:57.360> zombies<00:00:57.809> you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
armor these stupid armored zombies you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.500 
armor these stupid armored zombies you
cannot<00:00:58.469> there's<00:00:59.219> nothing<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.910> other

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
cannot there's nothing that can other

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.009 
cannot there's nothing that can other
than<00:01:00.809> grenades<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.750> just

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
than grenades you know but it is just

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
than grenades you know but it is just
ridiculous<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.159> thing<00:01:05.339> doing<00:01:05.549> how

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
ridiculous what is that thing doing how

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.200 
ridiculous what is that thing doing how
powerful<00:01:06.750> these<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.380> mean<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
powerful these are I mean it just it's a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.000 
powerful these are I mean it just it's a
showstopper<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:10.080> exactly<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
showstopper it's exactly what it is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.480 
showstopper it's exactly what it is
I've<00:01:11.400> also<00:01:11.610> got<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.210> me<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:13.280> sniper<00:01:14.280> rifle

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
I've also got with me a sniper rifle

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.600 
I've also got with me a sniper rifle
that's<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> 50<00:01:15.210> caliber<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> bit

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that's a 50 caliber this is just a bit

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.080 
that's a 50 caliber this is just a bit
different<00:01:18.200> it's<00:01:19.200> still<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:19.979> 50<00:01:20.610> caliber

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
different it's still you know 50 caliber

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.200 
different it's still you know 50 caliber
it's<00:01:21.810> amazing<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.500> loved<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.100> death<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it's amazing I loved it to death but the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.149 
it's amazing I loved it to death but the
thing<00:01:24.390> about<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.409> recoil<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.009> this

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
thing about this is the recoil and this

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
thing about this is the recoil and this
is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> lot<00:01:26.580> different<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.540> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
is a lot different as you can see it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.569 
is a lot different as you can see it
actually<00:01:28.229> stops<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
actually stops you

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.429 
actually stops you
I<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:30.090> alerted<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.570> horde<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:31.110> I'm<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
I just alerted a horde now I'm in a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.230 
I just alerted a horde now I'm in a
little<00:01:31.650> bit<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.979> trouble<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.520> it'll<00:01:33.030> actually

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
little bit of trouble but it'll actually

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.200 
little bit of trouble but it'll actually
stop<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:34.619> moving<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.090> little

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
stop you from moving so that's a little

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.270 
stop you from moving so that's a little
different<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.049> what's<00:01:37.259> really<00:01:37.650> really<00:01:38.100> nice

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
different but what's really really nice

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.160 
different but what's really really nice
about<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.670> kind<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.970> gun<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.079> get

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
about this kind of gun is if we can get

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.190 
about this kind of gun is if we can get
a<00:01:40.229> zombie<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> volunteer<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.930> watch<00:01:42.930> real

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
a zombie to volunteer and watch real
