00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
with that because I know I wasn't a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.630 
with that because I know I wasn't a
hundred<00:00:49.320> percent<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
hundred percent you know I was like I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.860 
hundred percent you know I was like I
know<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.850> was<00:00:51.030> probably<00:00:51.210> about<00:00:51.360> ninety<00:00:51.780> percent

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
know I was probably about ninety percent

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.470 
know I was probably about ninety percent
and<00:00:52.320> what<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.219> jumped<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> Saturday

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and what we jumped in this on a Saturday

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.779 
and what we jumped in this on a Saturday
so<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.719> didn't<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.620> everything<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.430> pull<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
so we didn't do everything to pull it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.970 
so we didn't do everything to pull it
completely<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.809> at<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> same<00:00:58.260> time<00:00:58.559> we

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
completely but at the same time we

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.799 
completely but at the same time we
didn't<00:00:59.219> take<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.550> granted<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> know<00:01:00.480> was

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
can change those make those subtle

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.140 
can change those make those subtle
changes<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.580> bring<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> glutes<00:01:09.030> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
changes to bring the glutes and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.060 
changes to bring the glutes and
hamstrings<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.810> much<00:01:09.960> tighter<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.560> then

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
hamstrings and much tighter and then

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.530 
hamstrings and much tighter and then
with<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.340> advice<00:01:11.670> I'll<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.060> able<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> come<00:01:12.390> in

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
that and then someone could slip in just

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.510 
that and then someone could slip in just
get<00:02:17.450> tighter<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.840> take<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.380> spot<00:02:18.590> for<00:02:18.830> me<00:02:18.950> so

I<00:02:19.550> didn't<00:02:19.850> push<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.120> as<00:02:20.360> much<00:02:20.540> as<00:02:20.570> i<00:02:20.810> would<00:02:20.870> have

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
I didn't push it as much as i would have

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.440 
I didn't push it as much as i would have
liked<00:02:21.530> because<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.980> as<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.460> said<00:02:22.700> eat<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.330> I

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
liked because I as you said eat it I

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.140 
liked because I as you said eat it I
could<00:02:23.630> anymore<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:24.260> think<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:25.150> hindsight

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
could anymore I think that in hindsight

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.240 
could anymore I think that in hindsight
that<00:02:26.420> would<00:02:26.750> help<00:02:26.900> tremendously<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:28.190> I

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
that would help tremendously so I

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.800 
that would help tremendously so I
learned<00:02:28.490> you<00:02:28.880> know<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.390> lie<00:02:29.540> fighters

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
learned you know that's a lie fighters

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.630 
learned you know that's a lie fighters
from<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:30.020> veteran<00:02:30.380> but<00:02:30.410> at<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.770> same<00:02:30.980> time<00:02:31.250> I

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
from a veteran but at the same time I

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.730 
from a veteran but at the same time I
feel<00:02:32.180> good<00:02:32.390> about<00:02:32.450> what<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.870> still<00:02:33.260> did<00:02:33.530> do

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
feel good about what I still did do

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.890 
feel good about what I still did do
because<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.160> didn't<00:02:34.490> slip<00:02:34.670> enough<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.690> be<00:02:35.810> able

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
because I didn't slip enough to be able

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.080 
because I didn't slip enough to be able
to<00:02:36.140> overcome<00:02:36.590> would<00:02:36.920> be<00:02:37.070> taken<00:02:37.430> away<00:02:37.550> from<00:02:37.730> me

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
to overcome would be taken away from me

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.960 
to overcome would be taken away from me
