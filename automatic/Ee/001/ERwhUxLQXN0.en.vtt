00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
so God we started this project about

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.980 
so God we started this project about
three<00:00:16.529> years<00:00:16.619> ago<00:00:16.789> based<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:18.029> ubuntu<00:00:18.300> informal

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
types and twitter me go about a couple

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.310 
types and twitter me go about a couple
of<00:00:22.380> months<00:00:22.619> ago<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.750> degrees<00:00:24.750> were<00:00:24.990> switched

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
of months ago so degrees were switched

of months ago so degrees were switched
amiga<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.910> actually<00:00:27.410> have<00:00:28.410> here

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
amiga was that we actually have here

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.269 
amiga was that we actually have here
amigo<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.429> very<00:00:30.210> optimized<00:00:31.279> operating

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
amigo have very optimized operating

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.430 
amigo have very optimized operating
system<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.730> tablets<00:00:33.149> especially<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.170> item

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
system for tablets especially for item

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.190 
system for tablets especially for item
based<00:00:34.590> architecture<00:00:34.940> it's<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.120> very<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:37.170> know

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
based architecture it's a very you know

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.110 
based architecture it's a very you know
comprehensive<00:00:38.010> comprehensive<00:00:38.670> operating

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
comprehensive comprehensive operating

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.630 
comprehensive comprehensive operating
system<00:00:39.450> which<00:00:39.629> which<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.290> are<00:00:40.379> used<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.520> on

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
system which which we are used to but on

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790 
system which which we are used to but on
the<00:00:41.730> other<00:00:41.879> hand<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.690> very<00:00:42.960> lightweight<00:00:43.200> so

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the other hand it's very lightweight so

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.709 
the other hand it's very lightweight so
for<00:00:44.160> example<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.820> boot<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.120> time<00:00:45.149> only

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
for example we have a boot up time only

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.350 
for example we have a boot up time only
16<00:00:46.230> seconds<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.160> were<00:00:47.219> sent<00:00:47.610> by<00:00:47.789> recovery

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
16 seconds and we were sent by recovery

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.869 
16 seconds and we were sent by recovery
time<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.930> second<00:00:49.489> all<00:00:50.489> thanks<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> me<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
time one second all thanks to me go so I

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.209 
time one second all thanks to me go so I
can<00:00:53.940> show<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.199> yeah<00:00:55.559> that'd<00:00:55.949> be<00:00:55.980> great

can have a quick look party for the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.109 
can have a quick look party for the
system<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.610> sadly

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
system so you can see so it's it's sadly

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.649 
system so you can see so it's it's sadly
me<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:12.930> 1.0<00:01:13.590> printer<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:15.150> adapted<00:01:15.570> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
me or 1.0 printer and we just adapted a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.020 
me or 1.0 printer and we just adapted a
special<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> make<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.740> touch<00:01:16.950> screens<00:01:17.250> so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
special you I make more touch screens so

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
special you I make more touch screens so
for<00:01:18.720> example<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.740> yeah<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
for example you can see here yeah the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
for example you can see here yeah the
opinion<00:01:21.000> would<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.240> call<00:01:21.420> pinboard<00:01:22.100> every

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
opinion would we call pinboard every

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.700 
opinion would we call pinboard every

pain<00:01:30.479> more<00:01:30.630> course<00:01:31.350> he<00:01:31.470> could<00:01:31.619> switch<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.860> like

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
pain more course he could switch it like

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.969 
pain more course he could switch it like
this<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.409> example<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
this and if I go for example to a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.920 
this and if I go for example to a
browser<00:01:35.220> here<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> same<00:01:36.479> thumb

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
browser here you have the same thumb

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.080 
browser here you have the same thumb
navigation<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> left<00:01:38.009> side<00:01:38.369> because

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
actually you use the tablet like this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.520 
actually you use the tablet like this
and<00:01:41.909> open<00:01:42.090> both<00:01:42.450> hands<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:42.990> steer<00:01:43.380> the
