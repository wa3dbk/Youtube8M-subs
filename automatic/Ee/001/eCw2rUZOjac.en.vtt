00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.340
 according to your word grants peace and 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.560
 the unit 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:30.670

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:33.220

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.900
 lives in life then knows there is no 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.239
 census put not shown on the map 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.910

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.160
 put the wow the people who live now 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.440
 Here are the ones that will first occupy the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.970
 departments when they build 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.430
 nor of the construction company in 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.750
 municipality is a social worker does 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.750
 how many years we work here 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.629
 there is a war between them not us 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.670
 we can put more than ten years ago 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.710
 I am illegally occupying a work that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.330
 no government ended if we do not want 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.509
 what happens to us, we have to do 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:12.369
 something since frustration and anger 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.330
 who wants us to support a shot 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.600
 violent with them you do not stay here 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.890
 It's crazy to think, I thought so 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.470
 'if our work the priests and 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.610
 which ones come in you do not really know what 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.860
 I'm talking 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.850
 and I want to know if I am able to stay 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.630
 in front of this parish 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.630
 [Music] 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.659
 we never went there not somewhere else a 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.750
 priest did not negotiate with drug trafficking 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.220
 I did not go to negotiate the fiat and all the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.899
 decisions that we make can harm 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.980
 a task that is much more important 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:54.260
 that all the others together 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.260
 [Music] 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.909
 in a situation like this we can not 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.649
 be only priests 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.540
 or you think that it 's easy for me to come 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.750
 here every day of local visit 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.830
 I did not choose to be here 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.830
 I do not but only 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.980
 the violence of yesterday is not the same as 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.290
 Today's 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.290
 but our love is the same
