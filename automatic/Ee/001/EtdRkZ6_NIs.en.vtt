 transparent cover and see how 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.250
 small already 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.320
 crushed grain instruction coffee grinder 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.300
 reminds us that this device

 grinding only 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.530
 coffee beans to the usual black coffee 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.289
 no questions 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.170
 peppered crushed and how about 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.909

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.719
 popular 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.420
 but green grains are harder than black therefore 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.979
 there is quite a logical question 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.649
 can bosch grinder handle this 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.380
 challenge let's see during 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.109
 grinding the grain hit the bowl sharply and 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.299
 cover so if you fall asleep too 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:34.090
 little coffee for grinding there is a risk of damage 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.389
 the cover is still plastic so 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.030
 immediately fall asleep a little more than half 

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:42.069
 we start to grind and everything turned out yes 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.799
 Grinding green coffee takes a bit 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.619
 more time than black but still 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.159
 coffee grinder coped with it and so 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.950
