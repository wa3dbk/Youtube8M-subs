00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello my name is Nastya and today I 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.150
 I want to tell you about my empty 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.140
 jars about those products that I have 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.540
 have ended 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.820
 I like them or not, as always 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.849
 Of course a little makeup cosmetics 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.460
 more than decorative yet let's 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.130
 start first just want to tell you 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.279
 This shampoo from firm Loreal full 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.990
 split ends restoration 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.720
 I really like the condition of my hair 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.060
 after washing and you shampoo they look 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.390
 healthy and shiny 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.989
 for a long time remain clean and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.690
 fresh but after the first application I 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.790
 noticed that I get dandruff 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 as the skin of my head at all to this 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.100
 not inclined to me it was a surprise and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.649
 I did not immediately believe that it could be 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.480
 from shampoo and so I washed somewhere else 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.870
 2 3 1 and pernikov 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.910
 naturally I did not stop after all 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.910
 I thought that maybe it is really from 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.010
 shampoos and decided to stop 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.170
 use and for a while and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.820
 used another shampoo and i just 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.189
 couldn't believe it because i 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.340
 never faced it 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.430
 and I basically never shampoo 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.350
 caused dandruff i got back to her in 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.689
 the second time so again I washed 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.850
 the hair of this shampoo I have again 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.560
 dandruff started and then I realized that 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 This shampoo and really does not fit 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.729
 but the appearance and condition of my hair after 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.790
 washing this shampoo really 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.040
 cool she does really miracles 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.049
 but unfortunately I can use it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.030
 since she just isn't me 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.490
 Next shampoo that fits 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.759
 I ended up from the firm garnier goodbye 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.799
 split ends of previous video about 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.509
 my hair care told me that 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.119
 I bought the same company 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.729
 ruler serum and me she is very 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.219
 liked she really calm my 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.070
 split ends and she has awesome 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.200
 the smell that remains on the hair on 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.939
 for a long time I thought 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.979
 what can you do 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.899
 shampoo will smell the same as 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.600
 this serum will effect even more 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.209
 but to 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.030
 he has no such company smell 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.709
 what is serum and in principle 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.819
 no special action on my hair 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.730
 she does not produce like regular shampoo 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.190
 hair is polluted in principle already with her 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.530
 as usual on the second day that is nothing 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.540
 there is no such smell 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.970
 I do not think that I will take the same shampoo 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.739
 once again the most ordinary shampoo 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.290
 Kerch 2 products that I have 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.690
 ended all this milk to remove 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.569
 make up in movie garnish and also firm 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.120
 miner ventilation water this is my not 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.519
 first one they are probably already 25 and 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.630
 now since I ended it 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.940
 we had a promotion in the cosmetics shop 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.860
 buy 2 and 3 gift I bought two more 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.630
 birthmarks and one brilliant green or vice versa 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.049
 there is one rose not so much 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.680
 important I like her makeup on shoots 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.650
 well i use it constantly and in 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.459
 In principle, everything I wanted from the micellar 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.850
 water she gives me milk to remove 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.730
 Makeup is a miracle remedy for my 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.880
 combination skin and often prone to 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.470
 dryness this remedy is just wow wow wow 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.900
 very moisturizes 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.870
 for me it's a makeup remover milk 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.390
 it is truly a miracle means which 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.170
 I use every day already on 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.910
 for about two years I used 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.950
 together with mycelial vodichka 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.940
 I put a little agent on wadded 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.920
 tampon 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.530
 and wipe my skin with this tool 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.890
 helps a lot with rashes 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.269
 sometimes I have especially on the forehead and pretty 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.630
 rarely on the wings of the nose 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.430
 there are reddenings or rashes and it 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.489
 means it seems to me really with 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.470
 she really does it 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.570
 soothes the skin and preventing 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.720
 further rashes on my face also i 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.690
 recently learned about the existence of the company 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.519
 Yako this firm Ukrainian production I 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.890
 tried several products of this 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.980
 firms and product which is already me 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.780
 really ended this soap she 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.960
 was such a box was so very 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:23.670
 nicely packed and you even 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:28.560
 kept such such here very very 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:34.260
 darling was like me on manufacturers 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.550
 made from herbs and and from many oils and i 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.010
 I think that this is true because 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.830
 that she looks really even with 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.540
 pieces of habit I do nâ€™t know this 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.270
 strongly prevents rashes and 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.340
 skin redness for people who have 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.090
 combination sensitive skin 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.190
 prone to dryness or dry skin this soap 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.240
 will be a little more dry 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.910
 the skin itself but it leaves no effect 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.270
 tightness and for me it's really 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.300
 very important i think i will buy this soap 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.240
 still as very budget cosmetics 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.550
 very very straight budget and quality 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.790
 It was this product that I liked and 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.260
 makeup and ended my 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.820
 eyeliner from the company l'oreal 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.580
 super liner 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.000
 Sau haute couture I especially do not stay because 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.490
 bought myself another one already 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.110
 I bought this one somewhere around in the winter 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.610
 she served me almost every day 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.150
 use somewhere about 3 months 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:39.720
 in the end she certainly draws yes but already 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.120
 not as clearly as you see it to me 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.430
 I liked it so much that I already bought 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.320
 the second is why so much for me 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.850
 does it mean when I buy a product again 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.370
 also make-up with me 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.780
 ended with sisi cream from lumene and I 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.940
 I think it's good that he ended 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.890
 precisely to the beginning of summer since this 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.210
 the shade does not suit me already started years and 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.940
 I have already managed to burn out 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.730
 and I think I'll take a shade now 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.650
 number two it is much darker and will 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.980
 more suited to tanned skin 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.190
 principle, this cream I use somewhere 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.220
 mid xii 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.280
 we use it daily 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.970
 about served all spring I had it enough 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.550
 he is pleased with him is more matte I 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.790
 I do not know the powder finish this cream 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.340
 need to use and a minimum of departure 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.890
 your cream because very often with 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.990
 it can shine face and then you need 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.780
 use more powder as well in 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.480
 In principle, I am very happy with it and I 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.610
 I think I'll buy the same 2 for everyone 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.680
