final machine Robo rescue review this is

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.980 
final machine Robo rescue review this is
the<00:00:08.220> last<00:00:08.429> figure<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:09.120> my<00:00:09.269> machine<00:00:09.450> Robo

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
the last figure in my machine Robo

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.990 
the last figure in my machine Robo
rescue<00:00:10.380> collection<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:15.800> shuttle<00:00:16.800> Robo

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
rescue collection and it is shuttle Robo

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.689 
rescue collection and it is shuttle Robo
now<00:00:18.990> shuttle<00:00:19.320> Robo<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.830> actually<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
now shuttle Robo is actually the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.650 
now shuttle Robo is actually the
upgraded<00:00:21.449> version<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.960> jet<00:00:22.650> Robo<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:24.449> you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
upgraded version of jet Robo and as you

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.820 
upgraded version of jet Robo and as you
can<00:00:24.779> see<00:00:25.050> he<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.310> shuttle<00:00:27.410> jet<00:00:28.410> Robo<00:00:28.680> got

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
can see he is a shuttle jet Robo got

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.400 
can see he is a shuttle jet Robo got
royally<00:00:29.429> owned<00:00:29.699> by<00:00:30.300> stealth<00:00:30.660> Robo<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.230> one

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
royally owned by stealth Robo at one

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.080 
royally owned by stealth Robo at one
point<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.980> then<00:00:32.700> well<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:34.020> decided<00:00:34.670> okay<00:00:35.670> he

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
point and then well they decided okay he

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.450 
point and then well they decided okay he
needs<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.540> be<00:00:36.690> able<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.989> fly<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.350> space<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:38.219> this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
needs to be able to fly in space so this

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.709 
needs to be able to fly in space so this
was<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.820> answer<00:00:39.210> make<00:00:40.110> him<00:00:40.290> bank<00:00:41.570> ok<00:00:42.570> he's

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
was the answer make him bank ok he's

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.010 
was the answer make him bank ok he's
actually<00:00:42.960> not<00:00:43.320> pink<00:00:43.829> he's<00:00:44.100> really<00:00:45.020> really

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
actually not pink he's really really

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.420 
actually not pink he's really really
really<00:00:46.200> lightish<00:00:47.190> red<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:48.200> I<00:00:49.219> don't<00:00:50.219> know

really lightish red and I don't know

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.529 
really lightish red and I don't know
what<00:00:50.610> color<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.180> would<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.660> maybe<00:00:51.989> saffron

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
what color this would be maybe saffron

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.000 
what color this would be maybe saffron
actually<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.899> him<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.170> transformed<00:00:55.829> he

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
actually I have him this transformed he

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.220 
actually I have him this transformed he
is<00:00:56.070> actually<00:00:56.610> supposed<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:58.850> transformed

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
is actually supposed to be transformed

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.290 
is actually supposed to be transformed
look<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.350> that

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
look at that

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.750 
look at that
knees<00:01:03.300> are<00:01:03.719> supposed<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:07.640> those<00:01:08.640> are

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
knees are supposed to be up those are

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.520 
knees are supposed to be up those are
supposed<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.210> down<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.990> they're<00:01:10.110> supposed

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
supposed to be down and they're supposed

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.960 
supposed to be down and they're supposed
to<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.680> angled<00:01:11.159> there<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.640> go

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
to be angled there we go

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.080 
to be angled there we go
so<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.310> his<00:01:14.640> shuttle

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
so as you can see this is his shuttle

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.230 
so as you can see this is his shuttle
form<00:01:15.450> he<00:01:15.780> takes<00:01:16.200> off<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.030> splits<00:01:18.030> off

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
form he takes off and then splits off

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.800 
form he takes off and then splits off
into<00:01:20.390> shuttle<00:01:21.390> Robo<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:24.240> back<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.420> band

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
into shuttle Robo and it's back up band

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
into shuttle Robo and it's back up band
the<00:01:25.049> shuttle<00:01:25.380> errs<00:01:25.530> well<00:01:26.220> ok<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.850> not

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the shuttle errs well ok really not

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.999 
the shuttle errs well ok really not
really<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> backup<00:01:27.960> band<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.890> my

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
really the backup band but you get my

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.480 
really the backup band but you get my
drift

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
drift

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.060 
drift
now<00:01:29.939> these<00:01:30.119> little<00:01:30.450> guys<00:01:30.540> are<00:01:30.900> exactly<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
now these little guys are exactly the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.170 
now these little guys are exactly the
same<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.930> previous<00:01:34.259> flying<00:01:35.250> robots<00:01:35.790> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
same as the previous flying robots that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
same as the previous flying robots that
jet<00:01:36.509> Robo<00:01:36.840> flew<00:01:37.079> around<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.560> there<00:01:37.770> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
jet Robo flew around with there is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.469 
jet Robo flew around with there is
nothing<00:01:38.310> different<00:01:38.520> other<00:01:38.909> than<00:01:39.150> their<00:01:39.270> paint

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
nothing different other than their paint

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.719 
nothing different other than their paint
scheme<00:01:39.810> they<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.680> however<00:01:41.009> come<00:01:41.430> with<00:01:41.579> these

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
scheme they do however come with these

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.039 
scheme they do however come with these
little<00:01:42.570> attachments<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:47.689> normally<00:01:48.689> put

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
little attachments and you normally put

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.249 
little attachments and you normally put
it<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.259> 4<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.799> 5<00:01:50.420> where<00:01:51.420> two<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.140> are

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
it on 4 and 5 where two of them are

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.469 
it on 4 and 5 where two of them are
carrying<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.340> flying<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> Boosters

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
carrying the or flying with the Boosters

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.240 
carrying the or flying with the Boosters
and<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.840> other<00:01:57.960> two<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:59.159> know

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and the other two are just you know

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.609 
and the other two are just you know
lying<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.909> normal<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:03.060> technically<00:02:03.960> they<00:02:04.590> are

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
lying is normal so technically they are

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.900 
lying is normal so technically they are
supposed<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:06.380> like<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.610 

if<00:02:10.270> I<00:02:10.390> can<00:02:10.570> get<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.750> camera<00:02:10.930> correctly<00:02:11.290> it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
if I can get the camera correctly it

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.130 
if I can get the camera correctly it
would<00:02:11.710> be<00:02:11.860> able<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.190> see<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.930> these<00:02:13.930> guys

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
would be able to see and these guys

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.880 
would be able to see and these guys
transform<00:02:14.680> exactly<00:02:15.040> as<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.580> others<00:02:15.820> do

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
transform exactly as the others do

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.080 
transform exactly as the others do
that's<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.160> right<00:02:18.730> there

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
that's it right there

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.080 
that's it right there
done<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.590> let's<00:02:21.280> go<00:02:21.400> ahead<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.670> take<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.850> look

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
done so let's go ahead and take a look

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.950 
done so let's go ahead and take a look
at<00:02:22.210> shuttle<00:02:22.540> Robo<00:02:22.810> proper<00:02:23.290> now<00:02:24.450> he<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.660> jet

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
at shuttle Robo proper now he is jet

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.380 
at shuttle Robo proper now he is jet
Robo<00:02:26.320> but<00:02:26.860> with<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:28.110> new<00:02:29.110> paint<00:02:29.350> scheme<00:02:29.440> and

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
Robo but with a new paint scheme and

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.070 
Robo but with a new paint scheme and
this<00:02:31.390> weird<00:02:32.730> booster<00:02:33.730> pack<00:02:34.650> alright<00:02:35.650> come<00:02:36.040> on

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
this weird booster pack alright come on

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.950 
this weird booster pack alright come on
so<00:02:38.080> he's<00:02:38.770> got<00:02:38.950> these<00:02:39.130> weird<00:02:39.340> boosters<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.540> guess

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
so he's got these weird boosters I guess

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.280 
so he's got these weird boosters I guess
they're<00:02:41.230> boosters<00:02:41.710> but<00:02:42.360> they<00:02:43.360> they<00:02:44.230> do

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
they're boosters but they they do

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.250 
they're boosters but they they do
transform<00:02:44.980> with<00:02:45.160> him<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:46.450> robot<00:02:46.990> mode<00:02:47.230> and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
transform with him in to robot mode and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.040 
transform with him in to robot mode and
unfortunately<00:02:48.220> they<00:02:48.370> look<00:02:48.520> kind<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.730> silly

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
unfortunately they look kind of silly

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.680 
unfortunately they look kind of silly
but<00:02:50.160> I'll<00:02:51.160> show<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.150> if<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.510> could

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
but I'll show that to you if I could

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.450 
but I'll show that to you if I could
just<00:02:52.870> get<00:02:53.560> things<00:02:53.860> lined<00:02:54.190> up<00:02:54.430> correctly

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
just get things lined up correctly

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.940 
just get things lined up correctly
that's<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.390> big<00:02:55.510> problem<00:02:55.870> with<00:02:55.960> these<00:02:56.080> when<00:02:56.470> you

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
that's a big problem with these when you

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.330 
that's a big problem with these when you
they<00:02:57.340> just<00:02:57.670> don't<00:02:58.090> line<00:02:58.450> up<00:02:58.480> well<00:03:00.960> there<00:03:01.960> we<00:03:02.020> go

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
they just don't line up well there we go

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.580 
they just don't line up well there we go
uh<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.850> actually<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> show<00:03:05.110> whenever<00:03:05.470> he

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
uh and actually in the show whenever he

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.770 
uh and actually in the show whenever he
goes<00:03:05.800> into<00:03:06.070> space<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.670> transforms<00:03:07.330> this<00:03:07.600> is

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
goes into space and transforms this is

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.440 
goes into space and transforms this is
what<00:03:07.930> he<00:03:08.050> looks<00:03:08.290> like

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
what he looks like

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
what he looks like
which<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.630> really<00:03:10.900> goofy<00:03:12.780> plain<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:13.990> simple

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
which is really goofy plain and simple

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.930 
which is really goofy plain and simple
he<00:03:14.740> looks<00:03:15.010> really<00:03:15.340> goofy<00:03:17.220> now<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.640> thing<00:03:18.820> I

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
he looks really goofy now the thing I

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.000 
he looks really goofy now the thing I
find<00:03:19.120> really<00:03:19.420> funny<00:03:19.780> about<00:03:19.870> this<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.530> if<00:03:20.980> you

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
find really funny about this is if you

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.340 
find really funny about this is if you
look<00:03:21.220> at<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> box<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.210> he<00:03:22.660> watched<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.140> show

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
look at the box and he watched the show

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.900 
look at the box and he watched the show
he's<00:03:24.280> actually<00:03:24.610> read<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.780> mean<00:03:26.470> on<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.430> box<00:03:27.640> and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
he's actually read I mean on the box and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.110 
he's actually read I mean on the box and
in<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.270> show<00:03:28.450> he<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:29.050> bright<00:03:29.440> red<00:03:29.770> as<00:03:30.120> opposed

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
in the show he is bright red as opposed

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.110 
in the show he is bright red as opposed
to<00:03:31.240> the<00:03:31.690> dark<00:03:31.990> red<00:03:32.320> that<00:03:32.740> the<00:03:33.040> figure<00:03:33.490> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
to the dark red that the figure the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.150 
to the dark red that the figure the
original<00:03:34.480> toy<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:37.680> don't<00:03:38.680> really<00:03:38.890> don't

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
original toy is I don't really don't

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.620 
original toy is I don't really don't
know<00:03:39.370> why<00:03:39.760> my<00:03:40.420> figure<00:03:40.900> turned<00:03:41.260> out<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.620> be<00:03:41.740> pink

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
know why my figure turned out to be pink

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.390 
know why my figure turned out to be pink
anyway<00:03:43.630> let's<00:03:44.500> go<00:03:44.620> ahead<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:44.890> get<00:03:45.010> him<00:03:45.130> merged

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
anyway let's go ahead and get him merged

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.680 
anyway let's go ahead and get him merged
up<00:03:45.670> into<00:03:46.170> hyper<00:03:47.170> mode<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:47.910> we'll<00:03:48.910> go<00:03:49.090> ahead<00:03:49.390> and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
up into hyper mode so we'll go ahead and

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.440 
up into hyper mode so we'll go ahead and
do<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:51.090> rotate<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.209> forward<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:54.450> rotate

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
do that rotate that forward and rotate

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.580 
do that rotate that forward and rotate
his<00:03:56.010> legs<00:03:57.010> up<00:03:57.690> there<00:03:58.690> we<00:03:58.810> go<00:03:58.930> he's<00:03:59.170> ready<00:03:59.500> for

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
his legs up there we go he's ready for

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:07.199 
his legs up there we go he's ready for
the<00:04:00.520> other<00:04:00.670> robots<00:04:02.100> so<00:04:03.100> take<00:04:03.340> three<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:06.209> turn

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
the other robots so take three and turn

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.480 
the other robots so take three and turn
him<00:04:07.510> into<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.840> fist<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:11.350> we'll<00:04:11.590> take<00:04:11.770> two<00:04:12.070> and

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
him into a fist and we'll take two and

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.830 
him into a fist and we'll take two and
do<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.760> same<00:04:12.940> thing<00:04:14.790> now<00:04:15.790> this<00:04:16.150> is<00:04:16.330> a<00:04:16.359> where<00:04:16.750> it

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
do the same thing now this is a where it

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.090 
do the same thing now this is a where it
gets<00:04:16.989> a<00:04:17.049> little<00:04:17.170> interesting<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.830> take<00:04:18.010> the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
gets a little interesting you take the

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.280 
gets a little interesting you take the
Boosters<00:04:18.520> and<00:04:18.549> you<00:04:18.790> rip<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.060> apart<00:04:19.180> for<00:04:20.169> the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
Boosters and you rip it apart for the

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.270 
Boosters and you rip it apart for the
foot<00:04:20.500> for<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.799> ones<00:04:20.979> that<00:04:21.160> form<00:04:21.669> legs

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
foot for the ones that form legs

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.100 
foot for the ones that form legs
you<00:04:24.280> take<00:04:24.520> them<00:04:24.699> you<00:04:25.240> turn<00:04:25.479> them<00:04:25.660> into<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.930> leg

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
you take them you turn them into a leg

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.770 
you take them you turn them into a leg
and<00:04:26.379> then<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:26.620> take<00:04:26.830> one<00:04:27.009> of<00:04:27.039> these<00:04:27.370> and

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
and then you take one of these and

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.619 
and then you take one of these and
attach<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.990> on<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.199> back<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:31.120> we'll<00:04:31.419> do<00:04:31.509> the

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629 
attach it on the back so we'll do the

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:42.270 
attach it on the back so we'll do the
same<00:04:31.810> thing<00:04:31.919> for<00:04:32.919> five<00:04:33.129> aw<00:04:39.449> jeez<00:04:40.590> no<00:04:41.590> upside

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
same thing for five aw jeez no upside

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.200 
same thing for five aw jeez no upside
down<00:04:42.460> that's<00:04:42.669> why<00:04:42.960> so<00:04:43.960> there<00:04:44.409> we<00:04:44.500> go<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:45.210> then

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
down that's why so there we go and then

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.480 
down that's why so there we go and then
for<00:04:46.509> two<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.289> three<00:04:47.560> you<00:04:47.860> actually<00:04:47.979> attach

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
for two and three you actually attach

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.010 
for two and three you actually attach
these<00:04:49.180> bits<00:04:50.169> to<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.650> Front's<00:04:51.449> at<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.599> tops<00:04:52.840> of

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
these bits to the Front's at the tops of

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.339 
these bits to the Front's at the tops of
or<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.379> just<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.159> tops<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.610> fists<00:04:55.349> so

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
or the just the tops of the fists so

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:02.820 
or the just the tops of the fists so
then<00:04:56.530> we<00:04:56.710> get<00:04:58.380> hyper<00:05:00.870> shuttle<00:05:01.870> Robo<00:05:02.319> here<00:05:02.650> in<00:05:02.770> a

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
then we get hyper shuttle Robo here in a

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:10.950 
then we get hyper shuttle Robo here in a
second<00:05:07.229> and<00:05:08.229> there<00:05:08.680> we<00:05:08.830> go<00:05:08.979> now<00:05:09.599> hyper<00:05:10.599> shuttle

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
second and there we go now hyper shuttle

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.909 
second and there we go now hyper shuttle
Robo<00:05:11.229> is<00:05:11.909> dangerously<00:05:12.909> pink<00:05:13.469> the<00:05:14.469> only<00:05:14.740> real

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
Robo is dangerously pink the only real

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.010 
Robo is dangerously pink the only real
problem<00:05:15.190> in<00:05:15.520> this<00:05:15.610> mode<00:05:15.849> is<00:05:16.120> if<00:05:16.389> you're<00:05:16.659> just

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
problem in this mode is if you're just

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.719 
problem in this mode is if you're just
if<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:17.889> go<00:05:18.009> to<00:05:18.069> turn<00:05:18.310> both<00:05:18.580> arms<00:05:19.000> at<00:05:19.150> once<00:05:19.360> this

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
if you go to turn both arms at once this

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.790 
if you go to turn both arms at once this
extra<00:05:21.729> piece<00:05:22.090> right<00:05:22.419> here<00:05:22.539> the<00:05:22.930> booster<00:05:23.560> part

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
extra piece right here the booster part

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.189 
extra piece right here the booster part
has<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:24.400> tendency<00:05:24.940> to<00:05:25.060> fold<00:05:25.300> back<00:05:25.539> up<00:05:25.810> like<00:05:26.050> that

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
has a tendency to fold back up like that

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.719 
has a tendency to fold back up like that
you<00:05:29.199> can<00:05:29.349> deal<00:05:29.500> with<00:05:29.530> it<00:05:29.800> it's<00:05:30.099> not<00:05:30.340> that<00:05:30.550> big

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
you can deal with it it's not that big

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.600 
you can deal with it it's not that big
an<00:05:30.909> issue<00:05:31.030> it<00:05:31.389> just<00:05:31.449> happens

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
an issue it just happens

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.830 
an issue it just happens
but<00:05:33.610> I<00:05:34.020> really<00:05:35.020> like<00:05:35.259> this<00:05:35.440> figure<00:05:36.150> my<00:05:37.150> only

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
but I really like this figure my only

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.279 
but I really like this figure my only
real<00:05:38.409> complaint<00:05:38.710> I<00:05:39.190> mean<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:40.180> true<00:05:40.630> complaint

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
real complaint I mean the true complaint

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.649 
real complaint I mean the true complaint
about<00:05:41.469> the<00:05:41.770> figure<00:05:42.039> is<00:05:42.219> if<00:05:42.940> you<00:05:43.029> put<00:05:43.210> both<00:05:43.240> this

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
about the figure is if you put both this

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.540 
about the figure is if you put both this
forward<00:05:44.020> he<00:05:44.349> is<00:05:44.500> insanely<00:05:45.400> top-heavy<00:05:46.319> so<00:05:47.550> the

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
forward he is insanely top-heavy so the

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.019 
forward he is insanely top-heavy so the
boost<00:05:48.819> does<00:05:49.090> that<00:05:49.300> do<00:05:49.419> not<00:05:49.599> thing<00:05:50.520> but<00:05:51.520> in<00:05:51.789> a

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
boost does that do not thing but in a

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:53.969 
boost does that do not thing but in a
show<00:05:52.240> you<00:05:52.630> he<00:05:52.960> launches<00:05:53.440> these<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:53.889> these

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
show you he launches these and these

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.730 
show you he launches these and these
become<00:05:54.279> like<00:05:54.460> stabbing<00:05:54.909> weapons<00:05:55.419> I<00:05:55.569> guess<00:05:55.810> but

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
become like stabbing weapons I guess but

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.740 
become like stabbing weapons I guess but
he<00:05:57.009> looks<00:05:57.250> really<00:05:57.580> cool<00:05:57.729> I<00:05:58.029> mean<00:05:58.270> if<00:05:58.479> you<00:05:58.599> like

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
he looks really cool I mean if you like

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.010
