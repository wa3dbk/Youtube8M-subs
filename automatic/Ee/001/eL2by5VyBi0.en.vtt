that<00:03:45.640> stuff<00:03:45.820> in<00:03:46.510> addition<00:03:47.020> as<00:03:47.170> I<00:03:47.380> mentioned

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
that stuff in addition as I mentioned

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.950 
that stuff in addition as I mentioned
earlier<00:03:48.070> his<00:03:48.310> work<00:03:48.520> rates<00:03:48.790> are<00:03:48.970> medium-low<00:03:49.690> so

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
earlier his work rates are medium-low so

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
earlier his work rates are medium-low so
unless<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.380> stick<00:03:50.560> him<00:03:50.680> in<00:03:50.740> some

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
unless you stick him in some

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.920 
unless you stick him in some
instructions<00:03:51.490> on<00:03:51.670> he's<00:03:52.180> gonna<00:03:52.390> drift<00:03:52.690> back<00:03:52.900> a

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
instructions on he's gonna drift back a

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.900 
instructions on he's gonna drift back a
little<00:03:53.500> bit<00:03:53.620> too<00:03:53.860> far<00:03:54.130> for<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.460> striker

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
little bit too far for a striker

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.730 
little bit too far for a striker
so<00:03:55.330> definitely<00:03:55.630> put<00:03:55.900> on<00:03:55.990> those<00:03:56.170> instructions

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
so definitely put on those instructions

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.340 
so definitely put on those instructions
for<00:03:56.920> him<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.220> lastly<00:03:57.880> his<00:03:58.180> pace<00:03:58.480> is<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.780> bit

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
for him and lastly his pace is a bit

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.110 
for him and lastly his pace is a bit
slow<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.830> did<00:03:59.950> decrease<00:04:00.310> over<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.880> course

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
slow it did decrease over the course

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.660 
slow it did decrease over the course
Kermode<00:04:01.510> for<00:04:01.720> me<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.020> he<00:04:02.590> did<00:04:02.770> end<00:04:02.980> with<00:04:03.190> 62

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
acceleration and 65 spread speed but it

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.320 
acceleration and 65 spread speed but it
didn't<00:04:06.070> matter<00:04:06.160> too<00:04:06.340> much<00:04:06.460> because<00:04:06.610> in<00:04:06.940> the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
didn't matter too much because in the
