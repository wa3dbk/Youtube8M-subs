00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
us a few blasts of spray so that's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.110 
us a few blasts of spray so that's
really<00:00:33.420> disappointing<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.760> know<00:00:35.760> that's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
really disappointing but you know that's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.119 
really disappointing but you know that's
what<00:00:36.300> happens<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> I'll<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:38.940> back<00:00:39.090> after<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:40.129> get

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
what happens so I'll be back after I get

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.069 
what happens so I'll be back after I get
some<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.430> material

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.529 

I'm<00:00:46.530> back<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.609> I<00:00:47.909> got<00:00:48.179> me<00:00:48.449> some<00:00:49.129> spray<00:00:50.129> dip<00:00:50.539> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
I'm back and I got me some spray dip and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.319 
I'm back and I got me some spray dip and
I've<00:00:51.750> already<00:00:51.960> shot<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.850> nose<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.510> coat

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
I've already shot the nose with one coat

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.579 
I've already shot the nose with one coat
it's<00:00:57.329> probably<00:00:57.659> gonna<00:00:57.750> take<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.049> three<00:00:58.559> or

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
it's probably gonna take about three or

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.430 
it's probably gonna take about three or
four<00:00:58.859> coats<00:00:59.100> because<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.600> first<00:01:00.839> coat<00:01:01.109> just

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
four coats because the first coat just

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.139 
four coats because the first coat just
sort<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:03.530> soaks<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> paint<00:01:05.369> or<00:01:05.789> the

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
sort of soaks up to the paint or the

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.910 
sort of soaks up to the paint or the
rubber<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.689> whatever<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:08.509> and<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
rubber or whatever is and so the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.029 
rubber or whatever is and so the
successive<00:01:11.460> coats<00:01:11.729> will<00:01:12.030> actually<00:01:13.009> make<00:01:14.009> it

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
successive coats will actually make it

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.620 
successive coats will actually make it
nice<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.340> thick<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.090> it'll<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> nice

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
nice and thick and it'll have a nice

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.969 
nice and thick and it'll have a nice
rubbery<00:01:16.049> Sheen<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.679> it<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.679> little<00:01:19.679> detour

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
rubbery Sheen to it so a little detour

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.960 
rubbery Sheen to it so a little detour
got<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> done<00:01:21.799> so<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:24.360> think<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.759> am<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:27.179> to

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
got it done so I think I am going to

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.460 
got it done so I think I am going to
start<00:01:29.970> cutting<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.330> some<00:01:30.450> fabric<00:01:30.810> pieces<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
start cutting out some fabric pieces and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.949 
start cutting out some fabric pieces and
then<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.729> will<00:01:33.000> start<00:01:33.390> putting<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.780> thing

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
then we will start putting this thing

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:40.190 
then we will start putting this thing
together<00:01:36.709> okay<00:01:37.740> I've<00:01:38.179> I've<00:01:39.179> taken<00:01:39.569> my<00:01:39.929> ear

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
together okay I've I've taken my ear

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.029 
together okay I've I've taken my ear
pattern<00:01:41.119> right<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:43.409> I've<00:01:43.530> traced<00:01:43.830> it

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
pattern right here and I've traced it

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.070 
pattern right here and I've traced it
onto<00:01:44.130> my<00:01:44.610> fabric<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.209> I've<00:01:45.330> already<00:01:45.509> cut<00:01:45.840> one

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
onto my fabric and I've already cut one

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.230 
onto my fabric and I've already cut one
of<00:01:46.200> them<00:01:46.289> out<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.429> very<00:01:47.670> careful

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
of them out you have to be very careful

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.759 
of them out you have to be very careful
when<00:01:48.689> cutting<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.380> fur<00:01:50.390> because<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:52.590> don't

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:52.769 
when cutting this fur because you don't

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:55.070 
when cutting this fur because you don't
want<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.039> cut<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.789> those<00:01:53.940> long<00:01:54.239> beautiful

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
clip taken out of your hair so you have

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.229 
clip taken out of your hair so you have
to<00:02:04.470> cut<00:02:04.679> real<00:02:04.920> carefully<00:02:05.369> around<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> edge

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
to cut real carefully around the edge

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:24.030 
to cut real carefully around the edge
here

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.910 

stay<00:02:24.550> real<00:02:24.909> close<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.690> fabric<00:02:26.319> don't<00:02:26.620> cut

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
stay real close to the fabric don't cut

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.410 
stay real close to the fabric don't cut
up<00:02:27.239> into<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.750> hair<00:02:30.060> because<00:02:31.060> we<00:02:31.180> want<00:02:31.360> to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
up into the hair because we want to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:41.390 
up into the hair because we want to
preserve<00:02:31.629> all<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.170> that

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.000 

when<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.810> want<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.870> trace<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:45.209> left<00:02:46.799> about<00:02:47.799> a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
when I want to trace this I left about a

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.229 
when I want to trace this I left about a
quarter<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.519> an<00:02:48.610> inch<00:02:48.760> around<00:02:49.689> the<00:02:49.959> edge<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
quarter of an inch around the edge to

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.190 
quarter of an inch around the edge to
sew<00:02:52.239> with<00:02:52.360> my<00:02:52.540> sewing<00:02:52.780> machine<00:02:53.400> because<00:02:54.400> I

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
sew with my sewing machine because I

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.869 
sew with my sewing machine because I
prefer<00:02:56.200> using<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.739> sewing<00:02:57.220> machine<00:02:57.579> whenever

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
prefer using the sewing machine whenever

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.559 
prefer using the sewing machine whenever
possible<00:02:58.209> because<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.379> saves<00:02:59.590> time<00:03:00.569> hand

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
possible because it just saves time hand

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.470 
possible because it just saves time hand
sewing<00:03:01.810> can<00:03:02.170> be<00:03:02.379> stronger<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.849> certain<00:03:04.090> places

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
sewing can be stronger in certain places

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.349 
sewing can be stronger in certain places
but<00:03:05.049> I<00:03:06.390> tend<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.450> get<00:03:07.629> impatient<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.379> I<00:03:09.359> like

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
but I tend to get impatient so I like

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.390 
but I tend to get impatient so I like
