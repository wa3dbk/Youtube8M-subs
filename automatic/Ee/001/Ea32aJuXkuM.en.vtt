as<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.650> team<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:54.610> now<00:02:54.850> we<00:02:54.910> didn't<00:02:55.209> know<00:02:55.330> how

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
as a team and now we didn't know how

many<00:02:55.660> camara<00:02:56.110> pies<00:02:56.350> we<00:02:56.530> were<00:02:56.650> going<00:02:56.920> up

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
many camara pies we were going up

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.759 
many camara pies we were going up
against<00:02:57.400> but<00:02:57.550> what<00:02:57.730> we<00:02:57.880> did<00:02:58.120> know<00:02:58.330> was<00:02:58.660> that

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
against but what we did know was that

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.050 
against but what we did know was that
once<00:02:59.769> they<00:02:59.920> see<00:03:00.100> us<00:03:00.250> they're<00:03:00.519> going<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.820> target

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
once they see us they're going to target

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.050 
once they see us they're going to target
me<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.380> part<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.830> our<00:03:03.010> strategy<00:03:03.489> here

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
because what's going to happen when they

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.470 
because what's going to happen when they
target<00:03:06.220> one<00:03:06.489> pilot<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.209> they're<00:03:07.330> going

it's been even more successful for at

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.820 
it's been even more successful for at
the<00:04:53.210> ground<00:04:53.480> actually<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.350> thing<00:04:54.500> about<00:04:54.680> it

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
and spicy and some of the other pilots

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.640 
and spicy and some of the other pilots
guitar<00:04:58.820> it<00:04:58.940> just<00:04:59.180> as<00:04:59.300> much<00:04:59.330> as<00:04:59.480> i<00:04:59.780> do<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.200> the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
guitar it just as much as i do and the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.870 
guitar it just as much as i do and the
same<00:05:00.680> used<00:05:00.950> to<00:05:01.010> go<00:05:01.100> with<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.310> tune<00:05:01.580> as<00:05:01.730> well

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
same used to go with the tune as well

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.730 
same used to go with the tune as well
but<00:05:02.090> since<00:05:02.630> he<00:05:02.750> hasn't<00:05:02.930> been<00:05:03.169> flying<00:05:03.470> all<00:05:03.620> that

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
but since he hasn't been flying all that

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.830 
but since he hasn't been flying all that
much<00:05:03.919> that<00:05:04.220> might<00:05:04.460> actually<00:05:04.730> have<00:05:05.150> changed<00:05:05.690> it

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
much that might actually have changed it

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.900 
much that might actually have changed it
a<00:05:05.870> little<00:05:06.050> bit<00:05:06.290> for<00:05:06.590> how<00:05:07.130> people<00:05:07.190> see<00:05:07.580> him<00:05:07.700> as<00:05:07.850> a

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
a little bit for how people see him as a

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.000 
a little bit for how people see him as a
threat<00:05:08.480> the<00:05:09.169> reason<00:05:09.410> why<00:05:09.500> i<00:05:09.530> haven't<00:05:09.710> covered

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
threat the reason why i haven't covered

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.530 
threat the reason why i haven't covered
this<00:05:10.190> all<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.520> much<00:05:10.669> is<00:05:10.820> because<00:05:11.000> this<00:05:11.360> is<00:05:11.510> a

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
this all that much is because this is a

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.600 
this all that much is because this is a
strategy<00:05:11.990> that<00:05:12.260> isn't<00:05:12.590> viable<00:05:12.830> for<00:05:13.400> all<00:05:13.520> that

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
strategy that isn't viable for all that

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.210 
strategy that isn't viable for all that
