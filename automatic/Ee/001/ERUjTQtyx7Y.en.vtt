people just think bread and pasta when

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.549 
people just think bread and pasta when
they<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:53.789> carbs<00:00:54.239> when<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:55.050> fruits<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
they think carbs when really fruits and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.779 
they think carbs when really fruits and
vegetables<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.340> give<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
vegetables can give you the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.569 
vegetables can give you the
carbohydrates<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.870> need<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.289> well<00:00:58.579> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
carbohydrates that you need as well so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.790 
carbohydrates that you need as well so
when<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.879> eat<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> carbohydrate<00:01:01.020> your<00:01:01.530> body

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
when you eat a carbohydrate your body

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.950 
when you eat a carbohydrate your body
takes<00:01:02.309> them<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.820> breaks<00:01:03.149> them<00:01:03.390> down<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
takes them and breaks them down and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.500 
takes them and breaks them down and
creates<00:01:04.500> glucose<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.119> need<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
creates glucose and you need that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
creates glucose and you need that
glucose<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.290> your<00:01:07.560> blood<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:08.250> order<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
glucose in your blood in order to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270 
glucose in your blood in order to
function<00:01:09.210> well<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.320> also<00:01:10.799> takes<00:01:11.040> these

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
function well it also takes these

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.940 
function well it also takes these
carbohydrates<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.299> stores<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.200> energy

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
carbohydrates and stores in it as energy

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.460 
carbohydrates and stores in it as energy
in<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.460> liver<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.450> muscles<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.350> if

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
in your liver and in your muscles so if

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.770 
in your liver and in your muscles so if
you<00:01:16.619> exercise<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.240> need<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> eat

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you exercise you really do need to eat

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.560 
you exercise you really do need to eat
carbs<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.979> problem<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.240> lot<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
carbs the problem is is that a lot of

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.010 
carbs the problem is is that a lot of
people<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:22.200> eating<00:01:22.380> an<00:01:22.740> overabundance<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
people are eating an overabundance of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
people are eating an overabundance of
carbohydrates<00:01:25.020> especially<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> form<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
carbohydrates especially in the form of

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.880 
carbohydrates especially in the form of
processed<00:01:27.180> foods<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.810> baked<00:01:28.170> goods<00:01:28.619> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
processed foods and baked goods and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.460 
processed foods and baked goods and
different<00:01:29.610> breads<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.840> pasta<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
different breads and a lot of pasta and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.010 
different breads and a lot of pasta and
that's<00:01:31.979> where<00:01:32.220> we're<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.700> wrong<00:01:33.020> another

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that's where we're going wrong another

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.380 
that's where we're going wrong another
thing<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.380> happens<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.220> carbohydrates<00:01:36.180> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
thing that happens with carbohydrates is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
thing that happens with carbohydrates is
they<00:01:36.720> turn<00:01:36.990> into<00:01:37.200> glucose<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.520> body

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
they turn into glucose and if your body

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.940 
they turn into glucose and if your body
doesn't<00:01:38.880> use<00:01:39.420> them<00:01:39.689> then<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> turns<00:01:40.470> them<00:01:40.680> into

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
doesn't use them then it turns them into

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.999 
doesn't use them then it turns them into
fat<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.479> stores<00:01:42.780> them<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.350> your<00:01:43.470> body<00:01:43.710> as

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
fat and it stores them in your body as

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.840 
fat and it stores them in your body as
fat<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.570> okay<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.799> are<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
fat so okay what are you going to do you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.520 
fat so okay what are you going to do you
need<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.240> eat<00:01:48.360> carbs<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.869> energy<00:01:48.930> into

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
need to eat carbs for energy into

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.039 
need to eat carbs for energy into
function<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.180> don't<00:01:51.479> want<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> eat<00:01:51.840> too

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
function but you don't want to eat too

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.530 
function but you don't want to eat too
many<00:01:52.170> carbs<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.040> gain<00:01:53.310> weight<00:01:53.540> will

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
many carbs so that you gain weight will

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.050 
many carbs so that you gain weight will
follow<00:01:54.840> these<00:01:55.170> rules<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:56.909> have

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
follow these rules and you will have

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.850 
follow these rules and you will have
enough<00:01:57.360> energy<00:01:57.570> from<00:01:57.960> your<00:01:58.079> carbohydrates

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
enough energy from your carbohydrates

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.539 
enough energy from your carbohydrates
without<00:01:59.310> gaining<00:01:59.579> weight<00:02:00.320> only<00:02:01.320> eat<00:02:01.560> starchy

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
without gaining weight only eat starchy

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.600 
without gaining weight only eat starchy
carbohydrates<00:02:03.479> after<00:02:04.170> activity<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.130> after

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
carbohydrates after activity and after

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.719
