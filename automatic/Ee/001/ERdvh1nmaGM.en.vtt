00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
this is a filter for my portable light

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.330 
this is a filter for my portable light
well<00:00:04.890> this<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.910> how<00:00:06.029> it<00:00:06.089> works<00:00:10.070> see<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.160> there

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
well this is how it works see in there

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.759 
well this is how it works see in there
that's<00:00:11.759> where<00:00:11.940> all<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> filter<00:00:12.590> this<00:00:13.590> is

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
that's where all the filter this is

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.099 
that's where all the filter this is
where<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> skills<00:00:14.549> go<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.089> cleans<00:00:15.960> out

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
where all the skills go and cleans out

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.490 
where all the skills go and cleans out
the<00:00:16.170> light<00:00:16.470> bait<00:00:16.680> tank<00:00:17.779> see<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:20.660> so<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the light bait tank see that so all the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.849 
the light bait tank see that so all the
scales<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.039> debris<00:00:23.789> go<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.180> here<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.680> it<00:00:25.680> runs

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
scales and debris go in here and it runs

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.830 
scales and debris go in here and it runs
through<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.930> block<00:00:28.170> all<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
through here this will block all of it

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.299 
through here this will block all of it
filter<00:00:30.840> out<00:00:31.669> then<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> cover<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.309> see

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
filter out then I cover it with this see

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.590 
filter out then I cover it with this see
that<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> dirty<00:00:37.020> water<00:00:37.230> goes<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
that so the dirty water goes in here and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.270 
that so the dirty water goes in here and
filtered<00:00:39.600> water<00:00:39.780> comes<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.500> I'm

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
filtered water comes out of here I'm

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.310 
filtered water comes out of here I'm
using<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.730> bilge<00:00:41.910> bilge<00:00:42.629> pump<00:00:43.190> made<00:00:44.190> by<00:00:44.489> rule

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
using a bilge bilge pump made by rule

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.069 
using a bilge bilge pump made by rule
let<00:00:46.320> me<00:00:46.440> show<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> how<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.860> breaks<00:00:47.100> apart<00:00:48.050> okay

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
let me show you how it breaks apart okay

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.330 
let me show you how it breaks apart okay
first<00:00:50.070> part<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.989> bilge<00:00:52.199> pump<00:00:52.260> piece<00:00:52.920> comes

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
first part the bilge pump piece comes

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 
first part the bilge pump piece comes
off<00:00:53.460> right<00:00:53.699> here<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.260> how<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> made

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
off right here and this is how I made

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:05.420 
off right here and this is how I made
this<00:00:55.920> piece<00:00:56.190> right<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.460> okay<00:01:02.870> okay<00:01:04.430> first

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this piece right here okay okay first

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.510 
this piece right here okay okay first
you<00:01:05.850> start<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:07.619> two<00:01:07.860> inch<00:01:08.070> sleeve

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
you start off with the two inch sleeve

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.830 
you start off with the two inch sleeve
this<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> base<00:01:09.600> from<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.049> bilge<00:01:10.380> pump

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
this is the base from that bilge pump

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.440 
this is the base from that bilge pump
and<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.170> want<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> cut<00:01:13.560> an<00:01:13.650> inch<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and you want to cut an inch out so you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.249 
and you want to cut an inch out so you
can<00:01:15.900> put<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.229> base<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.900> fits<00:01:19.110> in

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
can put this base in there so it fits in

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.359 
can put this base in there so it fits in
perfect<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.130> okay

you want to change change it to a

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.419 
you want to change change it to a
stronger<00:01:47.319> gallons<00:01:48.319> per<00:01:48.500> hour<00:01:48.649> there's<00:01:49.219> eight

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
stronger gallons per hour there's eight

use a car battery or motorcycle battery
and<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:01.610> would<00:02:01.729> work<00:02:01.970> pretty<00:02:02.239> much<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.720> whole

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
and it would work pretty much the whole

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.880 
and it would work pretty much the whole
day<00:02:04.239> this<00:02:05.239> is<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.450> body<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.869> your<00:02:06.140> filter<00:02:06.619> and

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
you can have this two-inch pipe longer

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.610 
you can have this two-inch pipe longer
if<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.009> want<00:02:10.250> it's<00:02:10.640> up<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.239> I<00:02:12.140> this<00:02:12.200> is

cloth<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:18.019> there<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:20.420> filtered<00:02:20.840> part<00:02:21.200> so

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
cloth in there and the filtered part so

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.250 
cloth in there and the filtered part so
you'll<00:02:21.799> need<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.099> make<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.280> hole<00:02:22.519> right<00:02:22.549> here<00:02:23.260> to

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
you'll need to make a hole right here to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.440 
you'll need to make a hole right here to
slip<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.709> in<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.310> when<00:02:25.910> you're<00:02:26.000> done<00:02:26.180> it

slip this in and when you're done it

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.500 
slip this in and when you're done it
should<00:02:26.540> look<00:02:26.840> like<00:02:26.900> this

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
should look like this

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.099 
should look like this
okay<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:30.500> end<00:02:30.709> will<00:02:30.889> be<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.010> intake<00:02:32.109> that
