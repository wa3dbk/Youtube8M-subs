first<00:05:06.810> one<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.230> have<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.890> look<00:05:08.040> back<00:05:08.220> we'll<00:05:08.400> have

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
first one I have to look back we'll have

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.030 
first one I have to look back we'll have
to<00:05:08.640> take<00:05:08.820> really<00:05:09.150> really<00:05:09.390> deep<00:05:09.600> if<00:05:10.590> it's<00:05:10.860> not

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
to take really really deep if it's not

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.260 
to take really really deep if it's not
as<00:05:11.190> first<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.610> it's<00:05:11.760> probably<00:05:11.940> just<00:05:12.090> his

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
as first and it's probably just his

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.980 
as first and it's probably just his
second<00:05:12.720> so<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:14.070> finally<00:05:14.520> how<00:05:15.300> does<00:05:15.510> this<00:05:15.660> team

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
second so and finally how does this team

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.050 
second so and finally how does this team
regroup<00:05:16.440> for<00:05:16.650> what's<00:05:16.800> next<00:05:16.980> I<00:05:17.250> guess<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.940> I

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
regroup for what's next I guess and I

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.730 
regroup for what's next I guess and I
guess<00:05:18.240> how<00:05:18.390> does<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:19.050> fact<00:05:19.290> that<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:19.710> know

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
guess how does the fact that you know

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.950 
guess how does the fact that you know
it's<00:05:19.950> been<00:05:20.070> a<00:05:20.100> steady<00:05:20.400> diet<00:05:20.580> of<00:05:20.760> Oregon<00:05:21.180> he<00:05:21.840> on

it's been a steady diet of Oregon he on

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.840 
it's been a steady diet of Oregon he on
North<00:05:22.140> Carolina<00:05:22.260> Arizona<00:05:22.980> and<00:05:23.220> now<00:05:23.370> Kentucky

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
does it kind of set things up perfectly

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.920 
does it kind of set things up perfectly
