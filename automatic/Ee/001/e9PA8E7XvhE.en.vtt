to and we do build bikes from intimate
of<00:00:44.129> course<00:00:44.370> that's<00:00:44.550> why<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.850> hear<00:00:45.170> from

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
of course that's why we hear from

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.600 
of course that's why we hear from
various<00:00:47.010> materials

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
various materials

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.110 
various materials
it's<00:00:47.820> either<00:00:48.030> steel<00:00:49.370> carbon<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.940> see

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it's either steel carbon as you can see

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.150 
it's either steel carbon as you can see
here<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.190> aluminum<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.640> well<00:00:54.559> we<00:00:55.559> specialized

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
here and aluminum as well we specialized

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.959 
here and aluminum as well we specialized

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
sort of in carbon carbon we believe that

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.000 
sort of in carbon carbon we believe that
there<00:00:59.969> should<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.210> more<00:01:00.480> new<00:01:01.379> technology

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
there should be more new technology

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.520 
there should be more new technology
brought<00:01:02.520> into<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.120> industry<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.930> there's<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
brought into this industry and there's a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.420 
brought into this industry and there's a
lot<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> newest<00:01:05.339> technology<00:01:06.030> available<00:01:06.600> in

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
lot of newest technology available in

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.950 
lot of newest technology available in
different<00:01:08.430> fields<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.510> example<00:01:09.600> we

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
different fields so we for example we

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.940 
different fields so we for example we
took<00:01:10.140> these<00:01:10.430> these<00:01:11.430> tubes<00:01:11.880> from<00:01:12.090> formal<00:01:12.689> one

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
took these these tubes from formal one

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.580 
took these these tubes from formal one
formula<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:15.540> designed<00:01:15.930> them<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.380> produce

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
formula we we designed them and produce

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.359 
formula we we designed them and produce
them<00:01:16.920> by<00:01:17.070> ourselves<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.570> consists<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.369> two

life last thing I would say as long

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.870 
life last thing I would say as long

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
puncture-resistant if you if you crash

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.200

then<00:01:53.500> you<00:01:54.009> would<00:01:54.189> for<00:01:54.460> most<00:01:54.670> probably<00:01:55.000> hit<00:01:55.179> the

then you would for most probably hit the

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.340 
then you would for most probably hit the
the<00:01:55.840> outer<00:01:56.110> part<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.310> carbon<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:59.140> would

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
the outer part of the carbon so it would

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.649 
the outer part of the carbon so it would
be<00:01:59.469> very<00:01:59.590> easy<00:01:59.799> to<00:02:00.039> repair<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:00.939> right<00:02:01.240> the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
be very easy to repair and right the

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.120 
be very easy to repair and right the
inner<00:02:01.840> part<00:02:02.140> would<00:02:02.319> not<00:02:02.439> be<00:02:02.560> damaged<00:02:02.890> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
inner part would not be damaged the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.340 
inner part would not be damaged the
inner<00:02:03.310> part<00:02:03.640> will<00:02:03.789> stop<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.299> exactly<00:02:05.170> then<00:02:05.259> you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
inner part will stop it exactly then you

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.070 
inner part will stop it exactly then you
have<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.619> in<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:07.210> honeycomb<00:02:07.479> would<00:02:07.750> stop<00:02:07.960> it

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
have the in the honeycomb would stop it

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.449 
have the in the honeycomb would stop it
basically<00:02:08.470> anyone<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:09.039> won't<00:02:09.190> touch<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
basically anyone it won't touch the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.370 
basically anyone it won't touch the
inner<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.910> inner<00:02:10.119> part<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.660> then<00:02:10.899> with<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
inner the inner part and then with the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.620 
inner the inner part and then with the
hollow<00:02:11.620> like<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.099> a<00:02:12.610> hole<00:02:13.000> like<00:02:13.269> this<00:02:13.299> you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
hollow like this a hole like this you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.089 
hollow like this a hole like this you
would<00:02:13.780> be<00:02:13.870> able<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.170> ride<00:02:14.379> all<00:02:14.560> season<00:02:14.980> long

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
would be able to ride all season long

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.670

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.890 
prepared for it is prepared for a racing
team<00:04:27.020> it's<00:04:27.740> done<00:04:27.920> from<00:04:28.070> these<00:04:28.310> tubes<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:29.510> main

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
team it's done from these tubes the main

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.560 
team it's done from these tubes the main
triangle<00:04:30.260> is<00:04:30.830> built<00:04:31.190> from<00:04:31.790> these<00:04:32.000> tubes

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
triangle is built from these tubes

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.600 
triangle is built from these tubes
what<00:04:32.750> are<00:04:32.840> these<00:04:32.960> put<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.410> is<00:04:33.500> tube<00:04:33.710> small<00:04:33.950> we

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
what are these put it is tube small we

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.700 
what are these put it is tube small we
call<00:04:34.820> them<00:04:35.000> sandwich<00:04:35.600> tubes<00:04:35.870> we<00:04:36.140> didn't<00:04:36.530> have

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
call them sandwich tubes we didn't have

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.510 
call them sandwich tubes we didn't have
time<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.370> give<00:04:37.820> them<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:39.040> marketing<00:04:40.040> name<00:04:40.190> let's

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
time to give them a marketing name let's

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.950 
time to give them a marketing name let's
say<00:04:41.800> we'll<00:04:42.800> see<00:04:43.010> if<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.250> comes<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:44.180> it's<00:04:44.660> it's

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
say we'll see if it comes so it's it's

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.630 
say we'll see if it comes so it's it's
built<00:04:45.530> cube<00:04:45.920> into<00:04:46.330> we<00:04:47.800> formed<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.070> tubes<00:04:49.340> so

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
built cube into we formed the tubes so

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.770 
built cube into we formed the tubes so
it's<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.750> bit<00:04:50.960> flat<00:04:51.290> here<00:04:51.650> yeah

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
it's a bit flat here yeah

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.960 
it's a bit flat here yeah
the<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.380> head<00:04:54.530> tube<00:04:54.770> is<00:04:54.920> flat<00:04:55.190> as<00:04:55.370> well<00:04:55.520> so<00:04:55.790> he

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
the the head tube is flat as well so he

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.750 
the the head tube is flat as well so he
going<00:04:56.330> inside<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:56.930> joined<00:04:57.350> his<00:04:57.560> firm<00:04:57.860> at<00:04:58.640> the

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
going inside and joined his firm at the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.260 
going inside and joined his firm at the
same<00:04:58.970> here<00:04:59.620> and<00:05:00.620> here<00:05:00.710> from<00:05:01.640> from<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.150> rear

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
same here and here from from the rear

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.040 
same here and here from from the rear
it's<00:05:03.110> standard<00:05:03.710> carbon<00:05:04.130> we<00:05:05.000> made<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.330> strong

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
it's standard carbon we made it strong

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.230 
it's standard carbon we made it strong
in<00:05:06.320> this<00:05:06.500> part<00:05:06.800> because<00:05:07.160> we<00:05:07.760> have<00:05:07.910> a<00:05:07.940> feedback

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
in this part because we have a feedback

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.390 
in this part because we have a feedback
from<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.720> racers<00:05:09.170> that<00:05:09.200> they<00:05:09.710> need<00:05:09.920> this<00:05:10.070> part

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
from the racers that they need this part

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.270 
from the racers that they need this part
to<00:05:10.550> be<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:11.150> be<00:05:11.270> strong<00:05:11.690> enough<00:05:11.930> or<00:05:12.170> firm<00:05:12.560> as

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
to be to be strong enough or firm as

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.970 
to be to be strong enough or firm as
well<00:05:13.580> right<00:05:13.970> so<00:05:14.780> that's<00:05:14.960> that's<00:05:15.380> this<00:05:15.560> bike<00:05:15.800> it

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
well right so that's that's this bike it

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.200 
well right so that's that's this bike it
would<00:05:16.160> be<00:05:16.280> weight<00:05:16.580> about<00:05:17.320> honor<00:05:18.320> on<00:05:18.980> the<00:05:19.220> about

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
would be weight about honor on the about

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.190 
would be weight about honor on the about
15<00:05:20.600> to<00:05:20.720> 16<00:05:20.870> pounds<00:05:21.380> which<00:05:22.100> would<00:05:22.310> be<00:05:22.990> just<00:05:23.990> on

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
15 to 16 pounds which would be just on

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.410 
15 to 16 pounds which would be just on
the<00:05:24.350> limit<00:05:24.620> so<00:05:25.040> it<00:05:25.490> can<00:05:25.670> race<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:26.240> don't

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
the limit so it can race and you don't

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.780 
the limit so it can race and you don't
have<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:26.750> put<00:05:27.530> more<00:05:27.800> weight<00:05:28.040> on<00:05:28.100> it<00:05:28.400> right

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
have to put more weight on it right

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.350 
have to put more weight on it right
right<00:05:29.420> and<00:05:30.350> so<00:05:30.410> it's<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:30.650> lively<00:05:30.920> feel

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
right and so it's a lively feel

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.980 
right and so it's a lively feel
extremely<00:05:32.360> durable<00:05:33.760> we<00:05:34.760> can<00:05:34.940> we<00:05:35.420> can<00:05:35.600> define

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
extremely durable we can we can define

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.770 
extremely durable we can we can define
the<00:05:36.290> stiffness<00:05:36.770> of<00:05:36.980> the<00:05:37.370> of<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:38.120> of<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.480> cubes

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
the stiffness of the of the of the cubes

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.150 
the stiffness of the of the of the cubes
by<00:05:39.410> by<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:40.070> angle<00:05:40.730> the<00:05:41.170> fibers<00:05:42.170> are<00:05:42.440> laid<00:05:42.650> if<00:05:43.040> I

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
by by the angle the fibers are laid if I

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.240 
by by the angle the fibers are laid if I
feel<00:05:43.490> they<00:05:43.610> are<00:05:43.730> laid<00:05:43.940> more<00:05:45.040> horizontal<00:05:46.040> then

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
feel they are laid more horizontal then

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.310 
feel they are laid more horizontal then
it<00:05:46.520> would<00:05:46.730> be<00:05:46.820> more<00:05:46.970> stiffer<00:05:47.270> if<00:05:47.540> if<00:05:48.050> they<00:05:48.260> are

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
it would be more stiffer if if they are

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.310 
it would be more stiffer if if they are
laid<00:05:48.760> vertical<00:05:49.760> it<00:05:50.000> would<00:05:50.210> be<00:05:50.360> softer<00:05:51.080> let's

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
laid vertical it would be softer let's

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.290 
laid vertical it would be softer let's
say<00:05:51.560> and<00:05:51.890> it<00:05:52.220> can<00:05:52.370> be<00:05:52.520> defined<00:05:52.670> for<00:05:53.210> each

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
say and it can be defined for each

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.440 
say and it can be defined for each
individual<00:05:53.870> rider
