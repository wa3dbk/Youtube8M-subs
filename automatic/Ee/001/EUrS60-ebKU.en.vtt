eliminate<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.829> need<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.250> go<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.269> stage

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
eliminate the need to go to a stage

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.830 
eliminate the need to go to a stage
three<00:04:09.959> we<00:04:10.680> have<00:04:10.890> no<00:04:11.190> water<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.880> waste<00:04:12.120> the

three we have no water to waste the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.289 
three we have no water to waste the
easiest<00:04:13.290> way<00:04:13.620> for<00:04:13.650> city<00:04:14.160> water<00:04:14.459> customers<00:04:14.760> to

easiest way for city water customers to

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.340 
easiest way for city water customers to
reduce<00:04:15.660> water<00:04:15.959> usage<00:04:16.289> is<00:04:16.709> in<00:04:17.010> their<00:04:17.250> landscape

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
reduce water usage is in their landscape

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.900 
reduce water usage is in their landscape
so<00:04:19.350> Santa<00:04:19.739> Barbara<00:04:19.950> residents<00:04:20.489> have<00:04:20.609> always

so Santa Barbara residents have always

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.610 
so Santa Barbara residents have always
done<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.120> great<00:04:21.419> job<00:04:21.450> at<00:04:21.870> conserving<00:04:22.229> water

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
done a great job at conserving water

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.980 
done a great job at conserving water
because<00:04:23.310> water<00:04:23.340> conservation<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.419> way<00:04:24.630> of

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
because water conservation is a way of

drought we're really looking for

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.850 
drought we're really looking for
extraordinary<00:04:29.789> water<00:04:30.449> conservation<00:04:31.080> where

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
extraordinary water conservation where

because what we need right now is a

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.700 
because what we need right now is a
twenty<00:04:38.729> percent<00:04:39.060> reduction<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.930> water<00:04:40.410> use

twenty percent reduction in water use
citywide<00:04:41.310> but<00:04:41.699> we're<00:04:41.819> asking<00:04:42.210> people<00:04:42.240> that

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
your meter read the meter and then maybe

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.129 
your meter read the meter and then maybe
go<00:05:14.460> away<00:05:14.759> for<00:05:14.970> about<00:05:15.060> an<00:05:15.240> hour<00:05:15.389> don't<00:05:15.690> use<00:05:15.870> any

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
go away for about an hour don't use any

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.559 
go away for about an hour don't use any
water<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.830> come<00:05:17.099> back<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.729> if<00:05:17.849> water<00:05:18.210> has

back<00:05:51.599> on<00:05:51.780> your<00:05:51.840> landscape<00:05:52.349> irrigation<00:05:52.500> as<00:05:53.039> a

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
back on your landscape irrigation as a

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.300 
back on your landscape irrigation as a
community<00:05:54.509> it<00:05:54.810> is<00:05:54.870> crucial<00:05:55.620> for<00:05:55.650> us<00:05:55.919> to<00:05:56.130> come

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
community it is crucial for us to come

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.980 
community it is crucial for us to come
together<00:05:56.490> during<00:05:56.940> this<00:05:57.180> drought<00:05:57.479> and<00:05:57.690> do

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
together during this drought and do

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.430 
together during this drought and do
everything<00:05:58.199> possible<00:05:58.680> to<00:05:59.400> conserve<00:05:59.909> water

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
everything possible to conserve water

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.200 
everything possible to conserve water
here<00:06:01.440> in<00:06:01.590> Santa<00:06:01.889> Barbara<00:06:01.919> about<00:06:02.580> half<00:06:02.880> of<00:06:03.030> the

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
here in Santa Barbara about half of the

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.809 
here in Santa Barbara about half of the
water<00:06:03.440> delivered<00:06:04.440> to<00:06:04.590> the<00:06:04.710> city<00:06:04.979> goes<00:06:05.520> to

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
water delivered to the city goes to

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.809 
water delivered to the city goes to
commercial<00:06:06.419> and<00:06:06.599> residential<00:06:07.130> gardens<00:06:08.130> so

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
commercial and residential gardens so

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.219 
commercial and residential gardens so
that's<00:06:09.000> where<00:06:09.150> a<00:06:09.210> lot<00:06:09.240> of<00:06:09.419> the<00:06:09.630> water<00:06:09.810> is<00:06:10.020> going

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
that's where a lot of the water is going

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.170 
that's where a lot of the water is going
in<00:06:10.500> the<00:06:10.620> city<00:06:10.889> and<00:06:11.400> we<00:06:11.520> estimate<00:06:11.909> that<00:06:11.969> about

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
in the city and we estimate that about

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.240 
in the city and we estimate that about
half<00:06:12.539> of<00:06:12.750> that<00:06:12.810> water<00:06:13.139> is<00:06:13.289> actually<00:06:13.469> wasted

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
half of that water is actually wasted

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.249 
half of that water is actually wasted
it's<00:06:14.430> not<00:06:14.639> going<00:06:15.000> to<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.360> plant<00:06:15.630> and<00:06:15.840> watering

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
it's not going to the plant and watering

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.559 
it's not going to the plant and watering
the<00:06:16.469> plant<00:06:16.770> so<00:06:17.520> it's<00:06:17.669> getting<00:06:17.880> wasted<00:06:18.120> from

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:18.569 
the plant so it's getting wasted from

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.230 
the plant so it's getting wasted from
runoff<00:06:18.840> from<00:06:19.440> overspray<00:06:20.190> from<00:06:20.520> broken<00:06:21.000> things

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
runoff from overspray from broken things

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.779 
runoff from overspray from broken things
from<00:06:21.509> leaks<00:06:21.810> we<00:06:22.590> encourage<00:06:22.949> everyone<00:06:23.400> to<00:06:23.520> take

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
from leaks we encourage everyone to take

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.939 
from leaks we encourage everyone to take

on their property and again we've done

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.909 
on their property and again we've done
it<00:06:29.130> before<00:06:29.159> and<00:06:29.909> that's<00:06:30.659> encouraged<00:06:31.289> the<00:06:31.680> city

conservation<00:06:34.440> effort<00:06:35.070> that<00:06:35.580> we<00:06:35.909> can<00:06:36.089> do<00:06:36.240> it

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
conservation effort that we can do it

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.480 
conservation effort that we can do it
again<00:06:36.479> now<00:06:36.990> obviously

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
again now obviously

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.480 
again now obviously
most<00:06:38.880> of<00:06:39.120> us<00:06:39.389> have<00:06:39.770> implemented<00:06:40.770> a<00:06:41.069> lot<00:06:41.280> of<00:06:41.400> the

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
most of us have implemented a lot of the

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.570 
most of us have implemented a lot of the
indoor<00:06:42.090> water<00:06:42.780> conservation<00:06:43.349> measures<00:06:43.979> that

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
indoor water conservation measures that

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.350 
indoor water conservation measures that
we<00:06:44.970> can<00:06:45.270> but<00:06:45.930> we<00:06:46.380> can<00:06:46.620> all<00:06:46.819> cut<00:06:47.819> back<00:06:48.000> on<00:06:48.240> our

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
we can but we can all cut back on our

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.809 
we can but we can all cut back on our
landscape<00:06:48.810> irrigation<00:06:48.990> and<00:06:49.620> that's<00:06:50.400> the

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
landscape irrigation and that's the

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.150 
landscape irrigation and that's the
community<00:06:51.720> effort<00:06:52.050> that<00:06:52.259> we<00:06:52.410> need<00:06:52.620> to<00:06:52.860> get<00:06:52.979> us

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
community effort that we need to get us

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.300 
community effort that we need to get us
through<00:06:53.460> the<00:06:53.759> next<00:06:53.970> year
