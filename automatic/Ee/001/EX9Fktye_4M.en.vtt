00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.510
 hello to all we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.790
 new video and 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.930
 a video that will show you the 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.000
 critters for those who still have 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.410
 I do not think it's available to 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.070
 from then I have level 19 if I say 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.190
 no nonsense in fact I wanted to do 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.190
 it's been two and three hours and I 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.809
 did not find the map 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.730
 perfect actually I'll explain 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:45.899
 why simply because on 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.089
 this map alfred level 48 what is this 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.370
 that we see on this mark we see a 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.280
 base quite normal but not all to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.030
 done since this person this player has 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.059
 put all his buildings defensive at 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.780
 background and that's where will come into play on 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.140
 will say little critters on one side 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.210
 of a bridge and make diversion 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.360
 but on the other hand when we launch 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.920
 critters on a place where there is no 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.750
 defensive building to destroy them 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.149
 they destroy everything in their path 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.130
 and if we are given a lot back 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.750
 a lot of energy points and that's 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.909
 this way I'm going to try to 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.950
 destroy the base of this knowing player 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.069
 with the statutes I did boost 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.909
 not arrived without this technique of course 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:39.000
 I show you they are there level 1 of 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.050
 combined to 6 so I do not know at all 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.420
 how much energy will I lose 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.789
 not too advanced on the subject but good 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.259
 immediately be worth it just 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.539
 a small precision we still see 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.420
 that a rocket launcher here so I'm going 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.690
 to destroy you before throwing him there 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.710
 mortars there 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.720
 I do not know I tested we will test 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.850
 together I show you and it's a 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.220
 technical so I hope I will 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.030
 learn it I'm going to destroy jalles 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.030
 and launches rockets and mortars 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.530
 so here I launched at the very top 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.530
 it's a lot of time waiting 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.560
 with nerves so if I do not know the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:36.330
 everyone's energy has taken with the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.330
 rest I will try to destroy the state 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.180
 even if there are a lot they have a lot 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.180
 many lives 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.940
 problem is that at the very beginning we have 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:03.270
 that only 6 critters I 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.270
 started destroying al and that one 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.670
 I may have started to advance my 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.670
 troops 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.810
 so here it is already 3 2 the res pub of 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.360
 now I think others are 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.490
 also within reach and after I start to 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.740
 attack but you see that that 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.230
 was already watching it's an eighth of the qg has 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.760
 already been destroyed and that allowed to 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:34.640
 destroy already several buildings 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:36.990
 defensively I start and I will not 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.080
 the electro spear and spear 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.080
 rockets 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.299
 and I'm still going 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.299
 because these two buildings 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.079
 I hope I will succeed 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.670
 I recall that it is an attack that 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:02.829
 I had missed with booster statuses and 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.510
 there I focus the qg a lot of losses 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.170
 but in any case I showed you the 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.170
 principle of this technique 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.170
 ouattara 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.570
 good still a lot of lost holes 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.010
 but overall the technique to 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.890
 pass because actually what I 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.030
 did with before having before having 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.220
 the update because I had attacked 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.249
 before the updates the problem in 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.049
 is that 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.879
 I could never destroy the 

00:04:31.049 --> 00:04:35.159
 three rocket launchers and launch the 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:39.299
 tro bon ben it used a lot 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:41.609
 of energy and there in 106 days days this 

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:45.629
 little corner of the energy from which 

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:47.309
 way the 8 ok so in fact this is 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.829
 profitable we use life point of 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:51.109
 gunboats there will be in harvest more 

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:53.129
 that's 8 so it's largely 

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:55.360
 so here it was a little video that 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.290
 explains you 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.510
 the utility of these critters they can 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:04.190
 also do diversion on the beach of 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.830
 landing and i'll show you by 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.760
 example reliefs on doctor terror 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.100
 new stage I'm not coming 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.990
 besides, you get started like it's worth your 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.700
 critters on the right for example is 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.640
 right after you start your troops on 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.830
 the left after like that look done 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.760
 that and hop you pass on the dot me I 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.510
 am going to address marc issues 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.710
 dutroux we also understood principle 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.900
 it is also useful in operations 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.190
 our task force if you have by 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.490
 example a rocket launcher or launched the 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.380
 trunk hide all deep inside of them 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.080
 of the map you launch critters 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.030
 around and if no other building 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.430
 defensive around you are quiet 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.509
 since the trunk throw and throws him 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.789
 rockets 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.210
 we can not attack the body 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.750
 body in fact so it's the same for 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.870
 markets of the future 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.789
 so that was a good little video 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.199
 well, we're going to say these mercenaries but 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.090
 that explains a little the principle of 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.949
 critters I hope to have helped you 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.690
 giving some tips we 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.530
 found quickly in a new 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.530
 video hi to all
