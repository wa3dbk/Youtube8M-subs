entire show ends up having a new meaning
each<00:00:21.199> time<00:00:21.409> I<00:00:21.529> watch<00:00:21.710> it<00:00:21.739> I<00:00:22.269> didn't<00:00:23.269> think<00:00:23.329> much

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
each time I watch it I didn't think much

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.120 
each time I watch it I didn't think much
of<00:00:23.689> it<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.050> first<00:00:24.259> time<00:00:24.529> I<00:00:24.560> thought<00:00:24.980> it<00:00:25.039> was

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
of it the first time I thought it was

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.040 
of it the first time I thought it was
kind<00:00:25.400> of<00:00:25.489> political<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.179> second<00:00:26.539> time<00:00:26.720> I

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
kind of political the second time I

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.210 
kind of political the second time I
thought<00:00:27.560> that<00:00:27.679> it<00:00:27.769> might<00:00:27.800> be<00:00:27.919> about<00:00:28.099> the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
thought that it might be about the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.189 
thought that it might be about the
cycles<00:00:28.730> of<00:00:28.849> human<00:00:29.149> life<00:00:29.329> the<00:00:29.390> time<00:00:29.749> after<00:00:30.019> that

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
cycles of human life the time after that

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.269 
cycles of human life the time after that
and<00:00:30.470> then<00:00:30.619> I<00:00:30.710> thought<00:00:30.919> it<00:00:31.009> might<00:00:31.159> represent

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
and then I thought it might represent

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.240 
and then I thought it might represent
the<00:00:31.669> five<00:00:31.849> stages<00:00:32.180> of<00:00:32.329> grief<00:00:32.689> after<00:00:33.020> that<00:00:33.250> but

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
the five stages of grief after that but

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.009 
the five stages of grief after that but
finally<00:00:34.609> what<00:00:34.789> I<00:00:34.820> did<00:00:35.059> was<00:00:35.269> I<00:00:35.359> sat<00:00:35.629> down<00:00:35.660> and

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
finally what I did was I sat down and

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:37.599 
finally what I did was I sat down and
reflected<00:00:36.500> on<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.710> show<00:00:36.890> as<00:00:37.070> a<00:00:37.100> whole<00:00:37.219> and

00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:37.609 
reflected on the show as a whole and

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.849 
reflected on the show as a whole and
what<00:00:38.180> I<00:00:38.210> found<00:00:38.449> was<00:00:38.660> that<00:00:38.719> for<00:00:39.199> my<00:00:39.320> money<00:00:39.590> this

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
what I found was that for my money this

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.740 
what I found was that for my money this
was<00:00:40.070> an<00:00:40.190> anime<00:00:40.550> representation<00:00:41.329> of<00:00:41.449> the<00:00:41.570> book

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
was an anime representation of the book

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.869 
was an anime representation of the book
of<00:00:41.899> five<00:00:42.079> rings<00:00:42.109> the<00:00:42.949> sword<00:00:43.190> instruction<00:00:43.730> book

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
of five rings the sword instruction book

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.900 
of five rings the sword instruction book
by<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.090> legendary<00:00:44.510> Miyamoto<00:00:45.199> Musashi<00:00:45.910> my

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
by the legendary Miyamoto Musashi my

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.310 
by the legendary Miyamoto Musashi my
reasoning<00:00:47.359> for<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:47.629> isn't<00:00:47.989> terribly

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
reasoning for this isn't terribly

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.470 
reasoning for this isn't terribly
complex<00:00:48.890> there<00:00:49.190> are<00:00:49.219> five<00:00:49.460> episodes<00:00:49.969> of<00:00:50.179> Afro

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
complex there are five episodes of Afro

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.000 
complex there are five episodes of Afro
Samurai<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:50.960> there<00:00:51.230> are<00:00:51.320> five<00:00:51.530> rings

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
Samurai and there are five rings

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.069 
Samurai and there are five rings
so<00:00:52.609> I<00:00:52.640> theorized<00:00:53.089> that<00:00:53.210> perhaps<00:00:53.660> if<00:00:53.989> the

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
so I theorized that perhaps if the

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.630 
so I theorized that perhaps if the
message<00:00:54.440> of<00:00:54.559> each<00:00:54.679> of<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:54.890> rings<00:00:55.100> fits<00:00:55.399> into

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
message of each of the rings fits into

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.579 
message of each of the rings fits into
each<00:00:55.760> episode<00:00:56.210> I<00:00:56.239> would<00:00:56.420> be<00:00:56.539> correct<00:00:56.839> so<00:00:57.440> this

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
each episode I would be correct so this

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.290 
each episode I would be correct so this
is<00:00:57.739> my<00:00:57.890> side-by-side<00:00:58.489> comparison<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.149> each

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
is my side-by-side comparison of each

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.189 
is my side-by-side comparison of each
episode<00:00:59.480> of<00:00:59.809> Afro<00:01:00.109> Samurai<00:01:00.140> in<00:01:00.620> each<00:01:00.800> ring<00:01:02.199> now

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
episode of Afro Samurai in each ring now

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.079 
episode of Afro Samurai in each ring now
the<00:01:03.260> first<00:01:03.589> episode<00:01:03.980> of<00:01:04.010> Afro<00:01:04.370> Samurai<00:01:04.400> brings

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
the first episode of Afro Samurai brings

which tells us of a world where being

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.390 
which tells us of a world where being
number<00:01:09.050> one<00:01:09.230> is<00:01:09.410> apparently<00:01:09.680> tantamount<00:01:10.370> to

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
number one is apparently tantamount to

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.700

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
being God and be number two means that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.770 
being God and be number two means that
you<00:01:12.770> can<00:01:12.950> challenge<00:01:13.190> number<00:01:13.520> one<00:01:13.820> as<00:01:14.000> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
you can challenge number one as the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.900 
you can challenge number one as the
story<00:01:15.080> goes<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.800> previous<00:01:16.190> number<00:01:16.490> one<00:01:16.670> and

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
story goes the previous number one and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.550 
story goes the previous number one and
number<00:01:17.030> two<00:01:17.150> duel<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.840> death<00:01:17.930> is<00:01:18.260> number

one son watches number one seems to have
the<00:01:21.110> advantage<00:01:21.620> but<00:01:21.770> then<00:01:21.950> suddenly<00:01:23.770> now
