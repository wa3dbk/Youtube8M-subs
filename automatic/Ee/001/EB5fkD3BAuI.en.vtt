pre-order camera that was available last
year<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.560> unlocked<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.070> aid<00:01:59.219> specific<00:01:59.790> camo

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
year that unlocked to aid specific camo

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
for black ops 2 as we were leaving up to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.670 
for black ops 2 as we were leaving up to
ghost<00:02:02.520> launch<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.930> only<00:02:04.079> think<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.409> was

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
ghost launch and I only think that was

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.289 
ghost launch and I only think that was
better<00:02:04.890> than<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> camo<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.640> got<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.060> year

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
better than the camo we got this year

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.940 
better than the camo we got this year
