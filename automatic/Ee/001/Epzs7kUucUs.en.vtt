00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
don't know maybe apart

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.620 
don't know maybe apart
and<00:01:09.140> then<00:01:09.350> you're<00:01:09.530> gonna<00:01:09.619> wanna<00:01:10.299> barely<00:01:11.299> speak

jump and try and get as much powder and

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.859 
jump and try and get as much powder and
stuff<00:01:17.060> as<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:17.330> can<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:20.539> then<00:01:20.659> make<00:01:20.840> sure

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
it's nice and soft so that you don't

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.649

your head but don't try if you have too
much<00:01:36.020> powder<00:01:36.319> that<00:01:36.679> it's<00:01:36.890> hard<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.159> land<00:01:37.340> in

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
much powder that it's hard to land in

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:48.460 
much powder that it's hard to land in
because<00:01:37.940> you<00:01:38.720> don't<00:01:38.750> have<00:01:38.959> enough<00:01:39.200> air<00:01:39.319> time
