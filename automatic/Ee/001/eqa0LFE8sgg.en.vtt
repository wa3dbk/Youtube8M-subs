let's actually talk about the story and
I'm<00:02:08.720> going<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:08.929> be<00:02:09.050> honest<00:02:09.380> here<00:02:09.619> for<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.190> long

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
I'm going to be honest here for a long

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.180 
I'm going to be honest here for a long
time<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:11.060> was<00:02:11.390> not<00:02:11.540> very<00:02:11.780> impressed<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.470> felt

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
time I was not very impressed I felt

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.590 
time I was not very impressed I felt
like<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.430> were<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:13.700> focused<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.240> setting<00:02:14.420> up

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
like you were so focused on setting up

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.120 
like you were so focused on setting up
the<00:02:14.690> story<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.260> forgot<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.650> set<00:02:15.980> up<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
the story you forgot to set up the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.250 
the story you forgot to set up the
characters<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.910> feel<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:17.570> you<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.810> basic

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
characters I feel like you have a basic

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.290 
characters I feel like you have a basic
grasp<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.040> main<00:02:19.190> 7<00:02:19.610> but<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.030> was<00:02:20.150> never

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
grasp of the main 7 but I was never

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.540 
grasp of the main 7 but I was never
given<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.720> reason<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.080> care<00:02:21.500> couple<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.430> with

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
given a reason to care couple that with

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.640 
given a reason to care couple that with
a<00:02:22.580> consistently<00:02:23.180> bad<00:02:23.390> grammar<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.560> was

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
a consistently bad grammar and it was

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.640 
a consistently bad grammar and it was
hard<00:02:24.920> for<00:02:25.100> me<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.280> get<00:02:25.430> immersed<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.030> story

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
hard for me to get immersed in the story

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.350 
hard for me to get immersed in the story

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
however as I read there were some

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.630 
however as I read there were some
improvements<00:02:29.989> one<00:02:30.560> chapter<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:30.950> liked<00:02:31.160> was<00:02:31.430> a

here's<00:04:10.780> my<00:04:10.989> advice<00:04:11.290> you<00:04:11.890> should<00:04:12.040> have<00:04:12.220> an<00:04:12.340> idea

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
here's my advice you should have an idea

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.309 
here's my advice you should have an idea
of<00:04:12.700> which<00:04:13.150> characters<00:04:13.690> you're<00:04:13.870> gonna<00:04:14.019> focus

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
of which characters you're gonna focus

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.590 
of which characters you're gonna focus
on<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:15.220> problem<00:04:15.580> with<00:04:15.700> having<00:04:15.819> a<00:04:16.030> large<00:04:16.269> cast

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
on the problem with having a large cast

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.659 
on the problem with having a large cast
is<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.139> if<00:04:17.290> you<00:04:17.380> try<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.590> focus<00:04:17.829> on<00:04:18.130> everyone

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
is that if you try to focus on everyone

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.580 
is that if you try to focus on everyone
the<00:04:19.209> whole<00:04:19.239> thing<00:04:19.720> will<00:04:19.900> turn<00:04:20.139> into<00:04:20.380> an

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
the whole thing will turn into an

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.340 
the whole thing will turn into an
unfocused<00:04:21.070> mess<00:04:21.579> right<00:04:22.419> now<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.930> seems<00:04:23.229> that

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
unfocused mess right now it seems that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.439 
unfocused mess right now it seems that
you<00:04:23.590> want<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.889> focus<00:04:24.040> on<00:04:24.310> Twilight<00:04:24.580> Optimus

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.570 
moments I enjoyed but a lot of attention
is<00:05:28.840> needed<00:05:29.110> in<00:05:29.380> terms<00:05:29.590> of<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:29.889> mechanics<00:05:30.039> and

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
is needed in terms of the mechanics and

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.060 
is needed in terms of the mechanics and
the<00:05:30.880> characters<00:05:31.419> I<00:05:31.690> may<00:05:32.200> be<00:05:32.260> wrong<00:05:32.590> but<00:05:32.889> I'm

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
the characters I may be wrong but I'm

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.469 
the characters I may be wrong but I'm
going<00:05:33.310> to<00:05:33.370> assume<00:05:33.700> that<00:05:33.880> this<00:05:34.030> is<00:05:34.210> one<00:05:34.330> of<00:05:34.389> your

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
going to assume that this is one of your

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.260 
going to assume that this is one of your
first<00:05:34.690> stories<00:05:35.289> if<00:05:35.590> that's<00:05:36.160> true<00:05:36.460> I<00:05:36.700> think<00:05:36.789> a

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
first stories if that's true I think a

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.150 
first stories if that's true I think a
lot<00:05:37.479> of<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.630> probs<00:05:37.930> here<00:05:38.349> have<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.860> do<00:05:39.010> with

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
lot of the probs here have to do with

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.640 
lot of the probs here have to do with
your<00:05:39.310> inexperience<00:05:39.599> which<00:05:40.599> is<00:05:40.750> fine<00:05:41.050> we'll

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
your inexperience which is fine we'll

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.690 
your inexperience which is fine we'll
have<00:05:41.830> to<00:05:41.950> start<00:05:42.130> somewhere

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
have to start somewhere

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.850 
have to start somewhere
the<00:05:43.060> best<00:05:43.300> way<00:05:43.570> to<00:05:43.599> improve<00:05:44.050> is<00:05:44.260> to<00:05:44.289> continue

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
the best way to improve is to continue

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.129 
the best way to improve is to continue
writing<00:05:45.099> and<00:05:45.400> ask<00:05:45.760> for<00:05:46.060> help<00:05:46.210> there<00:05:46.870> is<00:05:46.900> no

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
writing and ask for help there is no

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.500 
writing and ask for help there is no
shame<00:05:47.470> in<00:05:47.650> asking<00:05:47.860> for<00:05:48.340> assistance<00:05:48.580> as<00:05:49.030> any

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
shame in asking for assistance as any

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.510 
shame in asking for assistance as any
artist<00:05:49.840> will<00:05:50.020> tell<00:05:50.169> you<00:05:50.320> I<00:05:50.530> feel<00:05:51.160> like<00:05:51.370> you

have<00:05:51.700> potential<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:52.450> I<00:05:52.690> think<00:05:52.720> that<00:05:53.050> if<00:05:53.169> you

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
have potential and I think that if you

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.230 
have potential and I think that if you
brought<00:05:53.530> in<00:05:53.680> an<00:05:53.740> editor<00:05:54.039> and<00:05:54.070> seek<00:05:54.849> advice

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
brought in an editor and seek advice

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.620 
brought in an editor and seek advice
from<00:05:55.690> more<00:05:55.930> experienced<00:05:56.889> writers<00:05:57.360> you<00:05:58.360> may

from more experienced writers you may

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.560 
from more experienced writers you may
discover<00:05:59.080> it<00:05:59.349> this<00:06:00.130> is<00:06:00.310> changeling<00:06:00.820> number<00:06:01.090> 32

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
discover it this is changeling number 32

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.340
