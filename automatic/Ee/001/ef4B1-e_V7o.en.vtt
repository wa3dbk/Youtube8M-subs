tree<00:00:39.540> looks<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.410> don't<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.890> use<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
tree looks like you don't have to use a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:52.390 
tree looks like you don't have to use a
lot<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.520> detail<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:41.969> these<00:00:42.120> things

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
I like using imperial violet for the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.360 
I like using imperial violet for the
background<00:00:56.510> colors<00:00:56.930> for<00:00:57.200> to<00:00:57.860> create<00:00:58.220> the

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
background colors for to create the

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.900 
background colors for to create the
illusion<00:00:58.580> of<00:00:58.790> distance<00:00:59.300> and<00:01:00.250> it's<00:01:01.250> nice<00:01:01.550> it

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
illusion of distance and it's nice it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.120 
illusion of distance and it's nice it
brings<00:01:02.150> out<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.600> colors<00:01:02.900> of<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.170> sunset<00:01:06.130> just

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
brings out the colors of the sunset just

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.100 
brings out the colors of the sunset just
put<00:01:07.630> variation<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.690> sizes<00:01:09.200> back<00:01:09.380> there<00:01:11.110> above

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
put variation of sizes back there above

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.850 
put variation of sizes back there above
where<00:01:12.620> the<00:01:12.650> roof<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:13.280> cabin<00:01:13.670> will<00:01:13.790> be<00:01:14.860> you

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
where the roof of the cabin will be you

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.100 
where the roof of the cabin will be you
