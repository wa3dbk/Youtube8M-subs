game this game play was actually linked
to<00:00:15.240> me<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.570> think<00:00:16.049> four<00:00:16.260> hours<00:00:16.619> after<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
to me I think four hours after the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.340 
to me I think four hours after the
service<00:00:17.430> went<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.119> definitely<00:00:18.930> expect

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
service went up so definitely expect

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.810 
service went up so definitely expect
some<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.830> great<00:00:20.010> game<00:00:20.220> plays<00:00:20.460> from<00:00:20.670> this

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
some really great game plays from this

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.519 
some really great game plays from this
player<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.150> believe<00:00:21.480> his<00:00:21.600> name<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.779> Eve<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.380> II

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
player I believe his name is Eve is II

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.590 
player I believe his name is Eve is II

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
even more in some situations to get game

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.940 
even more in some situations to get game
early<00:00:36.870> they're<00:00:37.110> obviously<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
early they're obviously going to be a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
early they're obviously going to be a
little<00:00:38.190> bit<00:00:38.280> more<00:00:38.520> than<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> casual<00:00:39.180> player<00:00:39.450> or

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
little bit more than a casual player or

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.200 
little bit more than a casual player or
a<00:00:39.750> noob<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.100> stand<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.910> because

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
a noob and I can stand for that because

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.060 
a noob and I can stand for that because
I've<00:00:42.750> been<00:00:42.930> playing<00:00:43.110> against<00:00:43.350> these<00:00:43.530> guys<00:00:43.710> all

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
I've been playing against these guys all

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.049 
I've been playing against these guys all
the<00:00:44.219> people<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.579> I've<00:00:44.670> been<00:00:44.820> playing

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the people that I've been playing

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.389 
the people that I've been playing
against<00:00:45.510> when<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.230> game<00:00:46.559> was<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.980> early<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
against when the game was out early and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.700 
against when the game was out early and
everything<00:00:47.789> had<00:00:48.239> been<00:00:48.270> trihard<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.289> i<00:00:49.320> can

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
everything had been trihard so i can

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.439 
everything had been trihard so i can
definitely<00:00:49.860> say<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.250> these<00:00:51.000> guys<00:00:51.180> they

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
definitely say that these guys they

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.750 
definitely say that these guys they
weren't<00:00:51.660> noobs<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.489> definitely<00:00:53.489> did<00:00:53.610> take<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
weren't noobs and definitely did take a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.920 
weren't noobs and definitely did take a
little<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> skill<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.719> gameplay

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
little bit of skill to get this gameplay

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
little bit of skill to get this gameplay
although<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.129> Nuketown<00:00:56.610> which<00:00:56.879> does

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
although it was on Nuketown which does

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.340 
although it was on Nuketown which does
make<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.539> bit<00:00:57.870> easier<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
make it a little bit easier to get a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.689 
make it a little bit easier to get a
hundred<00:00:58.469> plus<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.859> guess<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.190> say<00:00:59.370> because

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
hundred plus I guess you can say because

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.939 
hundred plus I guess you can say because
it's<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.510> fast<00:01:01.020> paced<00:01:01.320> close<00:01:01.559> quarters

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
it's really fast paced close quarters

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
it's really fast paced close quarters
really<00:01:02.460> action-packed<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.300> what<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.480> like

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
really action-packed that's what I like

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
really action-packed that's what I like
about<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.899> map<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.460> only

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
about this map and it's really the only

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.800 
about this map and it's really the only
map<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.000> I've<00:01:06.060> been<00:01:06.150> playing<00:01:06.420> lately<00:01:06.570> I'm

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
actually being uploaded a little bit

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.560 
actually being uploaded a little bit
early<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> game<00:01:14.790> isn't<00:01:15.000> supposed<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.390> come

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
early the game isn't supposed to come

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.840 
early the game isn't supposed to come
out<00:01:15.659> until<00:01:15.930> midnight<00:01:16.530> tonight<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.430> obviously

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
out until midnight tonight but obviously

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.490 
out until midnight tonight but obviously
he<00:01:18.060> got<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.240> game<00:01:18.479> early<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.869> well<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.290> did

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
he got the game early as well as I did

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.740 
he got the game early as well as I did
and<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.130> believe<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.970> some<00:01:21.240> people<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.600> like

and I believe that some people in like

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.200 
and I believe that some people in like
Australia<00:01:22.409> already<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> game<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
Australia already have the game so the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
Australia already have the game so the

actually does help a lot for the
submachine<00:01:51.930> guns<00:01:52.259> i<00:01:52.350> wouldn't<00:01:52.590> recommend<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
submachine guns i wouldn't recommend it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.889 
submachine guns i wouldn't recommend it
for<00:01:53.159> anything<00:01:53.460> else<00:01:53.790> maybe<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.450> sniper<00:01:54.780> rifle

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899

if<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.350> want<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> try<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.860> some<00:01:56.100> crazy<00:01:56.640> no

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
if you want to try to get some crazy no

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.069

scopes<00:01:57.210> or<00:01:57.329> something<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.780> i<00:01:57.960> think

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
scopes or something like that i think

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
scopes or something like that i think
that<00:01:58.350> would<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.500> kind<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.710> cool<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.399> maybe<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that would be kind of cool or maybe the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.670 
that would be kind of cool or maybe the
shotguns<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.960> might<00:02:01.110> help<00:02:01.229> out<00:02:01.409> but

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
shotguns because that might help out but

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.350 
shotguns because that might help out but
they're<00:02:02.009> most<00:02:02.250> effective<00:02:02.820> when<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.210> using

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
they're most effective when you're using

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.450 
they're most effective when you're using
it<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> submachine<00:02:04.200> gun<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.920> does<00:02:05.219> help

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
it on a submachine gun it just does help

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.639 
it on a submachine gun it just does help
out<00:02:05.640> your<00:02:05.850> hipfire<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.360> lot<00:02:06.689> obviously<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.560> all

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
out your hipfire a lot obviously you all

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.960 
out your hipfire a lot obviously you all
you<00:02:07.740> gotta<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.129> put<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.489> laser<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you gotta do is put the laser on the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.210 
you gotta do is put the laser on the
enemy<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.360> shoot<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.619> can't<00:02:10.890> help<00:02:11.039> out<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
enemy and shoot so it can't help out a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.190 
enemy and shoot so it can't help out a
lot<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.580> want<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> mention<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.150> real<00:02:12.330> quick

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
lot it's want to mention that real quick

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.570 
lot it's want to mention that real quick
and<00:02:13.260> one<00:02:13.410> thing<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.830> think<00:02:14.160> he<00:02:14.310> should

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
and one thing that I think he should

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.010 
and one thing that I think he should
have<00:02:14.670> been<00:02:14.700> using<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.239> game<00:02:15.450> play<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.900> a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
have been using in this game play is a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.830 
have been using in this game play is a
silencer<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.220> obviously<00:02:17.940> he<00:02:18.120> was<00:02:18.300> not<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:18.810> I

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
silencer and obviously he was not so I

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.240 
silencer and obviously he was not so I
think<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.290> actually<00:02:19.709> makes<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.010> gameplay

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
think that actually makes this gameplay

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.250 
think that actually makes this gameplay
even<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.730> little<00:02:20.940> bit<00:02:21.030> more<00:02:21.269> impressive<00:02:21.780> just

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
even a little bit more impressive just

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.809 
even a little bit more impressive just
because<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.590> fact<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.980> he<00:02:23.250> wasn't<00:02:23.640> on

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
because of the fact that he wasn't on

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.850 
because of the fact that he wasn't on
not<00:02:24.390> showing<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:24.780> on<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:24.959> UAV<00:02:25.349> because<00:02:25.650> didn't

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
not showing up on the UAV because didn't

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.979 
not showing up on the UAV because didn't
have<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.010> silencer<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:27.480> case<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.900> guys

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
have a silencer and in case you guys

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.690 
have a silencer and in case you guys
didn't<00:02:28.260> know<00:02:28.379> and<00:02:28.650> black<00:02:28.830> ops<00:02:29.069> 1<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.340> lot<00:02:29.610> of

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
didn't know and black ops 1 a lot of

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.490 
didn't know and black ops 1 a lot of
people<00:02:29.940> prefer<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.660> unsilenced<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.410> use

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
people prefer to go unsilenced and use

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.050 
people prefer to go unsilenced and use
something<00:02:31.800> like<00:02:31.830> dual<00:02:32.130> mags<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.849> seems

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
something like dual mags but it seems

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.580 
something like dual mags but it seems

ghosts perks and the reason why I say
ghost<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.550> know<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.940> bullshit<00:02:39.480> kill<00:02:39.720> streak

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019

ghost I know it's a bullshit kill streak
and<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.830> really<00:02:41.069> annoying<00:02:41.250> when<00:02:41.489> people

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
and it's really annoying when people

and it's really annoying when people
running<00:02:42.120> everything<00:02:42.360> but<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.530> gotta<00:02:44.099> be

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.680 
running everything but it's gotta be
necessary<00:02:44.760> i<00:02:44.879> think<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.180> my<00:02:45.299> opinion<00:02:45.330> because

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
necessary i think in my opinion because

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.780 
necessary i think in my opinion because
the<00:02:45.959> UAV<00:02:46.319> spam<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:46.950> bad<00:02:47.190> at<00:02:47.370> least<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
the UAV spam it's so bad at least the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.000 
the UAV spam it's so bad at least the
has<00:02:47.940> been<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.450> far<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> game<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.319> as<00:02:49.950> you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
has been so far in the game and as you

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.380 
has been so far in the game and as you
guys<00:02:50.069> can<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:50.370> i'm<00:02:50.580> actually<00:02:50.730> speeding<00:02:51.239> up

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
guys can see i'm actually speeding up

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.330 
guys can see i'm actually speeding up
these<00:02:51.510> kill<00:02:51.780> streaks<00:02:52.049> but<00:02:52.290> he<00:02:52.890> actually<00:02:53.069> got

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
these kill streaks but he actually got

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.920 
these kill streaks but he actually got
the<00:02:53.519> Warthog<00:02:53.940> at<00:02:54.120> first<00:02:54.360> i<00:02:54.510> think<00:02:54.720> i<00:02:54.780> had<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
the Warthog at first i think i had a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.569 
the Warthog at first i think i had a
really<00:02:55.290> great<00:02:55.500> killstreak<00:02:56.010> set<00:02:56.190> up<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.430> get<00:02:56.549> a

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
really great killstreak set up to get a

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.370 
really great killstreak set up to get a
hundred-plus<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.269> game<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:58.019> Warthog

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
hundred-plus in this game the Warthog

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.930 
hundred-plus in this game the Warthog
basically<00:02:58.950> it's<00:02:59.160> almost<00:02:59.370> like<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.579> rolling

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
basically it's almost like a rolling

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.819 
basically it's almost like a rolling
thunder<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.630> it's<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.989> little<00:03:01.260> bit<00:03:01.349> more<00:03:01.470> beefy

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
thunder but it's a little bit more beefy

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.470 
thunder but it's a little bit more beefy
it<00:03:01.950> goes<00:03:02.099> around<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> map<00:03:02.579> three<00:03:02.940> times<00:03:02.970> and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
it goes around the map three times and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.270 
it goes around the map three times and
then<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.260> second<00:03:04.680> kill<00:03:04.829> streak<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.160> he's

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
then this second kill streak that he's

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.410 
then this second kill streak that he's
in<00:03:05.400> right<00:03:05.579> now<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:05.730> actually<00:03:06.030> called<00:03:06.329> a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
in right now is actually called a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.300 
in right now is actually called a
lodestar<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.260> that's<00:03:07.799> pretty<00:03:07.920> much<00:03:08.040> like<00:03:08.280> a

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
lodestar and that's pretty much like a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.460 
lodestar and that's pretty much like a
beefed-up<00:03:08.610> reefer<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.540> then<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:09.989> is<00:03:10.170> almost

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
beefed-up reefer and then this is almost

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.309 
beefed-up reefer and then this is almost
like<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:11.269> akimbo<00:03:12.269> chopper<00:03:12.810> gunner<00:03:12.989> man<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
like a akimbo chopper gunner man the

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.110 
like a akimbo chopper gunner man the
killstreaks<00:03:13.799> do<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.010> lot<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.489> work<00:03:14.730> as<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:14.970> guys

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
killstreaks do a lot of work as you guys

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.490 
killstreaks do a lot of work as you guys
can<00:03:15.269> see<00:03:15.329> I'm<00:03:15.599> speeding<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.079> up<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.260> little<00:03:16.380> bit

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
can see I'm speeding it up a little bit

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.740 
can see I'm speeding it up a little bit
because<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:17.190> think<00:03:17.579> that<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.329> would<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:18.569> make

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
because I think that it would just make

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.539 
because I think that it would just make
the<00:03:18.900> game<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.079> little<00:03:19.260> more<00:03:19.410> fast-paced<00:03:19.859> but

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
the game a little more fast-paced but

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.920 
the game a little more fast-paced but
yeah<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.000> killstreaks<00:03:21.450> if<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.810> get

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
yeah the killstreaks if you can get

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.449 
yeah the killstreaks if you can get
those<00:03:22.049> higher<00:03:22.260> streaks<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.920> definitely<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.430> a

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
those higher streaks it definitely is a

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.250 
those higher streaks it definitely is a
little<00:03:23.579> bit<00:03:23.880> higher<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:25.049> definitely

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
little bit higher but it is definitely

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.199 
little bit higher but it is definitely
worth<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.829> mi<00:03:26.069> opinion<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.549> think<00:03:26.579> he<00:03:26.850> gets<00:03:27.030> two

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
worth the mi opinion I think he gets two

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.720 
worth the mi opinion I think he gets two
sets<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.569> those<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.350> only<00:03:28.590> two<00:03:28.709> sets<00:03:29.190> got<00:03:29.489> him

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
sets of those so only two sets got him

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.099 
sets of those so only two sets got him
the<00:03:29.880> 100-plus<00:03:30.359> kill<00:03:30.630> game<00:03:30.840> which<00:03:31.079> is

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
the 100-plus kill game which is

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.559 
the 100-plus kill game which is
definitely<00:03:31.950> not<00:03:32.250> too<00:03:32.549> difficult<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.090> do<00:03:33.239> it

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
definitely not too difficult to do it

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.000 
definitely not too difficult to do it
definitely<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.079> little<00:03:34.200> bit<00:03:34.470> harder<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.769> get

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
definitely is a little bit harder to get

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.710 
definitely is a little bit harder to get
these<00:03:35.190> higher<00:03:35.730> kill<00:03:36.030> streaks<00:03:36.299> in<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:36.569> game

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
these higher kill streaks in this game

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.789 
these higher kill streaks in this game
especially<00:03:36.959> if<00:03:37.230> you're<00:03:37.350> playing<00:03:37.530> something

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
especially if you're playing something

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.199 
especially if you're playing something
like<00:03:38.010> team<00:03:38.220> deathmatch<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:38.790> think<00:03:39.000> for<00:03:39.180> the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
like team deathmatch I think for the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.330 
like team deathmatch I think for the
akimbo<00:03:40.139> chopper<00:03:40.620> gunner<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.040> just<00:03:41.190> had

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
akimbo chopper gunner that you just had

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.580 
akimbo chopper gunner that you just had
its<00:03:41.519> like<00:03:41.639> a<00:03:41.730> 19<00:03:42.180> gunstreak<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:43.109> go<00:03:43.260> on<00:03:43.440> to

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
its like a 19 gunstreak to go on to

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.319 
its like a 19 gunstreak to go on to
actually<00:03:43.889> get<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.190> after<00:03:44.370> playing<00:03:44.579> TDM<00:03:45.030> so

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
actually get that after playing TDM so

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.610 
actually get that after playing TDM so
suddenly<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.139> a<00:03:46.200> little<00:03:46.380> bit<00:03:46.470> more

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
suddenly is a little bit more

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.740 
suddenly is a little bit more
challenging<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.370> honestly<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.060> think<00:03:48.299> if<00:03:48.630> I

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
challenging and honestly I think if I

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.780 
challenging and honestly I think if I
were<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> game<00:03:49.109> developers<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.889> would<00:03:50.489> either

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
were the game developers I would either

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.400 
were the game developers I would either
make<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.299> so<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.569> get<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.780> little<00:03:52.079> bit<00:03:52.170> more

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
make it so you get a little bit more

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.520 
make it so you get a little bit more
score<00:03:52.950> points<00:03:53.160> in<00:03:53.459> TDM<00:03:54.120> or<00:03:54.329> that<00:03:55.200> the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
score points in TDM or that the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.620 
score points in TDM or that the
killstreaks<00:03:56.519> are<00:03:56.700> actually<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> little<00:03:57.450> bit

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
killstreaks are actually a little bit

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.539 
killstreaks are actually a little bit
lower<00:03:57.780> i<00:03:57.900> should<00:03:58.230> say<00:03:58.440> scorestreaks<00:03:59.250> because

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
lower i should say scorestreaks because

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.309 
lower i should say scorestreaks because
it<00:03:59.639> goes<00:03:59.760> off<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> score<00:04:00.450> not<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.079> kills

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
it goes off the score not the kills

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.530 
it goes off the score not the kills
anymore<00:04:01.739> but<00:04:02.310> CIA<00:04:02.609> guys<00:04:02.790> that's<00:04:03.060> pretty<00:04:03.450> much

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
anymore but CIA guys that's pretty much

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.849 
anymore but CIA guys that's pretty much
it<00:04:03.660> for<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:03.870> gameplay<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.290> wanted<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.650> try<00:04:04.799> to

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
it for this gameplay I wanted to try to

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.830 
it for this gameplay I wanted to try to
talk<00:04:05.130> about<00:04:05.340> how<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.760> play<00:04:06.000> nuketown<00:04:06.480> because

much almost specifically played doing

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.860 
much almost specifically played doing
black<00:04:11.040> ops<00:04:11.250> one<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.760> one<00:04:12.419> thing<00:04:12.599> I<00:04:12.660> want<00:04:12.840> to

which<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:17.880> something<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.269> think<00:04:18.539> they<00:04:18.630> should

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
which is something I think they should

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.390 
which is something I think they should
have<00:04:18.900> done<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.079> long<00:04:19.200> time<00:04:19.440> ago<00:04:19.709> i'm<00:04:20.010> really

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
have done a long time ago i'm really

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.890 
have done a long time ago i'm really
happy<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.789> they<00:04:20.880> did<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.209> because<00:04:21.570> it's

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
happy that they did this because it's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.240 
happy that they did this because it's
everyone's<00:04:22.470> favorite<00:04:22.620> map<00:04:22.919> this<00:04:23.099> is

ops<00:04:24.900> 2<00:04:25.169> along

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
ops 2 along

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.420 
ops 2 along
with<00:04:26.080> I<00:04:26.199> think<00:04:26.380> it's<00:04:26.470> called<00:04:26.620> raid<00:04:26.949> which<00:04:27.280> is

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
with I think it's called raid which is

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.980 
with I think it's called raid which is
another<00:04:27.880> really<00:04:28.090> good<00:04:28.240> map<00:04:28.479> I<00:04:28.599> think<00:04:28.840> there's

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
another really good map I think there's

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.450 
another really good map I think there's
been<00:04:29.199> a<00:04:29.229> couple<00:04:29.500> hundred<00:04:29.680> plusses<00:04:30.099> on<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.310> map

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
been a couple hundred plusses on the map

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.330 
been a couple hundred plusses on the map
as<00:04:30.669> well<00:04:30.880> but<00:04:31.630> yeah<00:04:32.319> like<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:32.620> said<00:04:32.650> for<00:04:32.889> a<00:04:33.160> new

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
as well but yeah like I said for a new

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.279 
as well but yeah like I said for a new
town<00:04:33.610> what<00:04:33.819> you<00:04:33.910> want<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.120> do<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.599> just<00:04:34.630> stay

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
town what you want to do is just stay

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.900 
town what you want to do is just stay
away<00:04:35.710> from<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:36.039> middle<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.370> map<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.759> want

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
away from the middle of the map you want

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.370 
away from the middle of the map you want
to<00:04:36.970> try<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.180> flank<00:04:37.539> around<00:04:37.690> as<00:04:38.020> much<00:04:38.199> as

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
to try to flank around as much as

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.529 
to try to flank around as much as
possible<00:04:38.560> because<00:04:39.490> when<00:04:39.940> you<00:04:40.000> go<00:04:40.150> straight<00:04:40.360> to

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
possible because when you go straight to

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:41.760 
possible because when you go straight to
the<00:04:40.569> middle<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.960> map<00:04:41.169> you<00:04:41.199> can<00:04:41.470> either<00:04:41.590> get

the uid obviously you don't want the

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.700 
the uid obviously you don't want the

your straight-up crazy rushing all over
the<00:05:31.690> place<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:32.440> that<00:05:32.740> way<00:05:32.889> it<00:05:32.979> won't<00:05:33.070> even

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
the place so that way it won't even

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.129 
the place so that way it won't even
matter<00:05:33.370> but<00:05:33.969> I<00:05:34.210> also<00:05:34.599> like<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:34.900> use

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
matter but I also like to use

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.330 
matter but I also like to use
lightweight<00:05:35.469> just<00:05:35.919> because<00:05:36.130> of<00:05:36.219> the<00:05:36.250> fact

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
lightweight just because of the fact

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.459 
lightweight just because of the fact
that<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:36.820> move<00:05:36.969> a<00:05:37.000> lot<00:05:37.210> faster<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.690> generally

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
that you move a lot faster I generally

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.529 
that you move a lot faster I generally
use<00:05:38.500> that<00:05:39.039> on<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.400> assault<00:05:39.669> rifles<00:05:40.120> or<00:05:40.330> light

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
use that on the assault rifles or light

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.990 
use that on the assault rifles or light
machine<00:05:40.840> guns<00:05:41.050> because<00:05:41.650> with<00:05:42.219> the<00:05:42.340> SMGs<00:05:42.849> I

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
machine guns because with the SMGs I

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.370 
machine guns because with the SMGs I
find<00:05:43.240> that<00:05:43.300> you<00:05:43.389> already<00:05:43.539> moved<00:05:43.810> fast<00:05:44.050> enough

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
find that you already moved fast enough

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.770 
find that you already moved fast enough
for<00:05:44.590> my<00:05:44.860> liking<00:05:44.889> and<00:05:45.430> then<00:05:45.969> I<00:05:46.270> also<00:05:46.449> like<00:05:46.750> to

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
for my liking and then I also like to

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.379 
for my liking and then I also like to
use<00:05:47.050> flak<00:05:47.409> jacket<00:05:47.919> especially<00:05:48.460> on<00:05:48.669> the<00:05:49.060> map

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
use flak jacket especially on the map

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:50.939 
use flak jacket especially on the map
nuketown<00:05:49.870> because<00:05:50.229> there's<00:05:50.710> a<00:05:50.770> lot<00:05:50.800> of

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
nuketown because there's a lot of

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.499 
nuketown because there's a lot of
explosive<00:05:51.580> that<00:05:51.699> can<00:05:51.849> go<00:05:51.940> off<00:05:52.120> and<00:05:52.150> just

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
explosive that can go off and just

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.870 
explosive that can go off and just
randomly<00:05:52.870> kill<00:05:53.110> you<00:05:53.289> then<00:05:53.830> for<00:05:54.159> the<00:05:54.370> perp<00:05:54.699> two

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
randomly kill you then for the perp two

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.550 
randomly kill you then for the perp two
slots<00:05:55.240> there's<00:05:55.509> just<00:05:55.659> one<00:05:55.810> called<00:05:56.050> toughness

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
slots there's just one called toughness

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.740 
slots there's just one called toughness
which<00:05:56.680> I<00:05:57.099> find<00:05:57.580> to<00:05:57.699> be<00:05:57.759> quite<00:05:58.240> good<00:05:58.509> on<00:05:58.539> the

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
which I find to be quite good on the

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.809 
which I find to be quite good on the
assault<00:05:59.020> rifles<00:05:59.500> or<00:05:59.770> sniper<00:06:00.099> rifles<00:06:00.580> and

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819 
assault rifles or sniper rifles and

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.370 
assault rifles or sniper rifles and
basically<00:06:01.509> what<00:06:01.719> it<00:06:01.750> does<00:06:01.840> it's<00:06:02.169> like

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
basically what it does it's like

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.740 
basically what it does it's like
hardened<00:06:02.770> pro<00:06:03.069> and<00:06:03.310> black<00:06:03.580> ops<00:06:03.819> 1<00:06:03.909> you<00:06:04.479> just

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
hardened pro and black ops 1 you just

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.899 
hardened pro and black ops 1 you just
flinch<00:06:05.050> less<00:06:05.319> when<00:06:05.620> you<00:06:05.740> get<00:06:05.860> shot<00:06:06.099> and<00:06:06.460> then

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
flinch less when you get shot and then

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.969 
flinch less when you get shot and then
another<00:06:07.330> one<00:06:07.599> that<00:06:07.750> is<00:06:07.780> almost<00:06:08.319> a<00:06:08.440> neccessity

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
another one that is almost a neccessity

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.999 
another one that is almost a neccessity
is<00:06:09.690> scavenger<00:06:10.690> because<00:06:11.080> obviously<00:06:11.530> you<00:06:11.889> don't

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009 
is scavenger because obviously you don't

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:13.469 
is scavenger because obviously you don't
want<00:06:12.039> to<00:06:12.190> be<00:06:12.250> running<00:06:12.430> out<00:06:12.550> of<00:06:12.580> ammo<00:06:12.940> so<00:06:13.150> I<00:06:13.180> find

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
want to be running out of ammo so I find

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:14.730 
want to be running out of ammo so I find
that<00:06:13.569> that<00:06:13.690> works<00:06:13.900> out<00:06:14.050> pretty<00:06:14.169> well<00:06:14.319> and<00:06:14.650> then

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
that that works out pretty well and then

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.920 
that that works out pretty well and then
for<00:06:15.639> perk<00:06:15.880> 3<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:16.240> one<00:06:16.360> thing<00:06:16.509> I<00:06:16.599> should<00:06:16.780> say

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
for perk 3 and one thing I should say

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.899 
for perk 3 and one thing I should say
about<00:06:17.050> scavenger<00:06:17.680> is<00:06:17.919> that<00:06:18.520> it<00:06:18.610> replenishes

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
about scavenger is that it replenishes

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.779 
about scavenger is that it replenishes
claymores<00:06:19.690> grenades<00:06:19.870> and<00:06:20.520> bouncing<00:06:21.520> Betties

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
claymores grenades and bouncing Betties

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.459 
claymores grenades and bouncing Betties
all<00:06:21.969> those<00:06:22.120> equipment<00:06:22.659> sort<00:06:22.840> of<00:06:22.930> things<00:06:23.169> and

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:23.469 
all those equipment sort of things and

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.920 
all those equipment sort of things and
then<00:06:24.069> for<00:06:24.400> the<00:06:24.550> perk<00:06:24.819> threes<00:06:25.150> a<00:06:25.389> where<00:06:25.719> pneus

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
then for the perk threes a where pneus

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.469 
then for the perk threes a where pneus
is<00:06:26.340> basically<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:27.520> sound<00:06:27.849> whoring<00:06:28.120> pork<00:06:28.330> it's

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
kind of like sitrep pro I find that that

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.339 
kind of like sitrep pro I find that that
helps<00:06:30.669> a<00:06:30.969> little<00:06:31.240> bit<00:06:31.389> I<00:06:31.449> only<00:06:31.630> really<00:06:32.050> like<00:06:32.199> to

helps a little bit I only really like to

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:34.769 
helps a little bit I only really like to
use<00:06:32.380> that<00:06:32.800> in<00:06:33.039> game<00:06:33.460> modes<00:06:33.669> like<00:06:33.819> free-for-all

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779
