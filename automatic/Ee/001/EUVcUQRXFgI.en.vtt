00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.269
 let's start the memory biceps anyone 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.879
 I do n’t know any more left vova 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:18.040
 straining right Lesha straining left 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:22.150
 biceps well that's elbow to elbow turn 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:28.810
 elbow elbow to elbow that's all 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:31.509
 understand what is happening here at all about what 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.170
 this we have vidos break dance like in 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:59.800
 rocking chair 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:01:05.740
 and here is our main character first part 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.930
 hello answers to such questions 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.700
 exercises like squats and barbells 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.030
 deadlift allows you to lift 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.550
 large weights and thus contributes 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.380
 a large increase in muscle mass affect 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:23.620
 Do these stretching exercises flexibility 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.970
 on the speed of movement if you will 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.300
 squat 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.020
 I will be bad shit chrysoprase to 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.659
 breeding will soon fall cup can 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.749
 to support 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.079
 Well, yes, of course, such a thing 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:42.869
 do if you crouch 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.560
 you can stretch after a workout 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.619
 then maybe everything will be fine as 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.479
 would you really swing that is how 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.969
 would be straight bodybuilding you raise everything 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.670
 their body weight due to excess fat and 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.969
 so on then for sure the speed will fall 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.130
 stretching will fall to nothing good it 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.399
 will not lead if squat 1 2 weeks 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:16.140
 For example, a repetition of 20, then I think that 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.140
 will be okay say more specific 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.060
 but the king and come on he wants to crouch 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:28.020
 what with the barbell suppose to games 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:32.380
 reps do 20 doctor not 8 for example 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.570
 20 will work for quality as 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.830
 as much as possible 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:42.160
 repetition will work for quality 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:46.050
 minimum mass on the total amount 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.050
 shorter keep the following questions answered 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.420
 big question I would like to know from you 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.370
 response to a row in relatively 1 row 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.070
 Questions regarding this topic 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.150
 1 does weight affect performance 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.959
 break elements 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:06.190
 the harder it is the harder it is unequivocal 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.860
 damn but there is one nuance guys if mass 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:14.320
 well developed layer 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.510
 fat is minimal then fly easier here 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.390
 Lesha can answer this question 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.250
 when drying bodybuilding championship 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.049
 it was also easy to do yes that is when u 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.400
 you there body fat is minimal you 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.030
 cool fly understood so if mass 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.650
 worked up a little fat 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.049
 really all if stretching is all 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.590
 really look at the equilibrist in 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.120
 circus they are really pitching 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.450
 gymnasts pitching well legs they really don’t 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.880
 very but my hands are huge in my 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:50.010
 the next question is what exercises in 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.010
 rocker help breaks 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.930
 none 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.010
 but there is one nuance damn shorter when you 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.380
 You will begin to train the twist and and 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.180
 I don’t personally download elements for twists 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.620
 I know how I would watch there tutorials too 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.299
 nothing no one nothing sensible 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.610
 I say I really have not seen such 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.250
 themes for fly matchbook if you will 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.700
 make matches for fly fly you will 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.780
 otvis so download so we have no such 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.880
 but there we assume that you know 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.190
 work working on lead 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.990
 I think that the main muscles that 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.340
 worked to take this shoulder 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.790
 the delta is visible your 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.620
 as in the simulator training 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:41.830
 deltoid muscle i.e. shoulder muscles up 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.090
 help you in I think help for 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.699
 tourists i mean i at least 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.860
 I bother when I realized that right 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.110
 no shoulders began to train them in 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.949
 simulator and it seems to me that for twists 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.290
 this magician 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.210
 and for all the other elements there for 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.370
 fly and above for all other items 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.120
 simulator which seems to me only in minus 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.610
 in short the next question is if i like 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.150
 do both what and how best 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:11.290
 I spend my time and workouts 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:17.290
 you feel damn i was doing this only 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:22.150
 wouldn't you have dreamed more specifically 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:25.210
 workouts three days before till 5 first 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.539
 break then rocking rocking since then 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:35.229
 every day and so every nothing like 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:39.160
 say what do you say began to grow like a pancake 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.979
 then there was a choir there was no heaviness on the hall 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:46.630
 I live a man of your type like him 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.889
 to distribute his time like this what's better 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.070
 what do you think is better 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:53.380
 training apparatus after break or training apparatus in 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.169
 separate day from break or treadmill 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:02.530
 before the drake despite a bunch of you wants 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:04.419
 breaks rocking but poison i think 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.270
 guess what the guy wants 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:10.510
 break but with this he is drishch and wants both 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:14.229
 to yes in parallel to gain weight your 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:20.849
 opinion three day breaks example and double 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:20.849
 rocking in days no team no kick ok 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:27.180
 how to develop breathing for rocking and break 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.180
 increase stamina for combination 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.180
 for example 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.660
 in short, I know a tough fighter 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.490
 very cool because of him i started 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.080
 engage in buyami when first in life 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.530
 saw him scatter peter 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:46.430
 on the street without pancakes cheek it either there 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:49.670
 in short the waters started being framed yes in short 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.790
 cool dude i cant tell him 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.500
 words about endurance that is 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.170
 man engaged in all his life fighting and he 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.510
 really like something in this he understands 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.780
 said that endurance is gained 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:05.780
 jogging running every day 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.660
 jogging two hours of running in his diet each 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.490
 days she was always present i remember i 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.430
 he rode there with him on america 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.830
 I ran tired of great ride she kept 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.050
 This type is so fast and so dead 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.050
 that guys running running cat simulator for 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.840
 communication is not redistribution if you will be on 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.610
 there are treadmills trying 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.320
 turn out endurance then I think neither 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.570
 what good does not lead. 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.430
 yes only fresh air only fresh 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:36.280
 the air I also heard what the runners 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:37.640
 advised to run not bat to the sounds of nature 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.560
 like 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.830
 very good effect on the central 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.060
 nervous system during beria and much 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.060
 jogging will be more productive
