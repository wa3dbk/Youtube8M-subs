note that the metal in the above

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.380 
note that the metal in the above
reaction<00:00:55.489> displaces<00:00:56.489> hydrogen<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
reaction displaces hydrogen from the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.740 
reaction displaces hydrogen from the
acid<00:00:58.670> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.730> seen<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> form<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
acid this is seen in the form of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.340 
acid this is seen in the form of
hydrogen<00:01:01.260> gas<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:03.329> metal<00:01:03.629> combines<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
hydrogen gas the metal combines with the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
hydrogen gas the metal combines with the
reaming<00:01:04.799> part<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> acid<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.700> forms<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
reaming part of the acid and forms a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.800 
reaming part of the acid and forms a
compound<00:01:06.600> called<00:01:06.869> salt

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
compound called salt

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
compound called salt
thus<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.260> reaction<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> metal<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
thus the reaction of the metal with the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.230 
thus the reaction of the metal with the
acid<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.390> acid<00:01:13.020> plus<00:01:13.409> metal<00:01:14.040> equals<00:01:14.520> salt<00:01:14.850> plus

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
acid is acid plus metal equals salt plus

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.000 
acid is acid plus metal equals salt plus
hydrogen<00:01:15.840> gas

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
hydrogen gas

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.899 
hydrogen gas

are not possible with all metals thus

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.310 
are not possible with all metals thus
