basic technique for spraying is you're
going<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.040> keep<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.250> far<00:02:22.520> back<00:02:22.790> not<00:02:23.360> way<00:02:23.570> up

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
going to keep it far back not way up

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.900 
going to keep it far back not way up
close<00:02:23.870> like<00:02:24.110> far<00:02:24.410> back<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.459> you're<00:02:25.610> not<00:02:25.700> just

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
close like far back and you're not just

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.030 
close like far back and you're not just
going<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.150> want<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.300> go<00:02:26.450> burst<00:02:26.870> burst<00:02:27.080> burst<00:02:27.500> on
