00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
anchor so we kind of upgraded to the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.020 
anchor so we kind of upgraded to the
rolls-royce<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.560> speak<00:03:12.890> popped<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.819> in<00:03:13.940> the

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
rolls-royce so to speak popped it in the

rolls-royce so to speak popped it in the
lake

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
lake

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.990 
lake
we're<00:03:15.380> down<00:03:15.530> we<00:03:15.799> parked<00:03:16.160> away<00:03:16.310> kind<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.819> round

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
we're down we parked away kind of round

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.640 
we're down we parked away kind of round
just<00:03:17.269> around<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.599> corners<00:03:17.900> not<00:03:17.989> very<00:03:18.230> far<00:03:18.470> but

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
just around the corners not very far but

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.170 
just around the corners not very far but
we're<00:03:19.190> down<00:03:19.310> at<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.459> other<00:03:19.670> end<00:03:19.880> of<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.030> lake

over there that's what's up we're on the
far<00:03:58.970> end<00:03:59.120> of<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.269> lake<00:03:59.299> parking<00:03:59.900> spots<00:04:00.109> over

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
far end of the lake parking spots over

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.170 
far end of the lake parking spots over
there<00:04:00.590> but<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.829> wind<00:04:01.010> change<00:04:01.340> soon<00:04:01.790> as<00:04:01.910> we<00:04:02.000> all

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
there but the wind change soon as we all

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.059 
there but the wind change soon as we all
the<00:04:02.359> way<00:04:02.420> down<00:04:02.660> here<00:04:02.900> that's<00:04:03.109> ridiculous<00:04:03.859> but

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
the way down here that's ridiculous but

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.340 
the way down here that's ridiculous but
that's<00:04:04.700> what<00:04:04.850> happens<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.239> guess<00:04:05.480> so<00:04:06.049> hopefully

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
that's what happens I guess so hopefully

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.629

we<00:04:06.410> catch<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.709> few<00:04:06.859> big<00:04:07.010> ones<00:04:07.190> down<00:04:07.310> here<00:04:07.370> this

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
we catch a few big ones down here this

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.979 
we catch a few big ones down here this

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
end of the lake is some pretty decent

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.960 
end of the lake is some pretty decent
fishing<00:04:09.350> it's<00:04:10.040> really<00:04:10.310> deep<00:04:10.519> just<00:04:10.730> kind<00:04:10.910> of

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
fishing it's really deep just kind of

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.970 
fishing it's really deep just kind of
right<00:04:11.150> out<00:04:11.180> here<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.720> then<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.900> gets<00:04:12.079> kind<00:04:12.889> of

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
right out here and then it gets kind of

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.650 
right out here and then it gets kind of
comes<00:04:13.160> up<00:04:13.280> pretty<00:04:13.459> quick<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.060> shallow<00:04:14.299> area

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
comes up pretty quick to a shallow area
