00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.450
 hi how are you today antoni montalbÃ¡n el 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.299
 today I'm going to show you an exercise 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.980
 for vicens which is one of the most 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.020
 popular to wear but that 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.590
 unfortunately it is one of the worst 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.750
 made I mean the preacher with 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.140
 this exercise we obviously need the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.279
 preacher and wash in this case let's 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.470
 to use the bar z ok and something very 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.430
 important that we have to emphasize is 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.039
 that the back should be straight and the 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.110
 armpit towards the top of your 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.360
 arm has to be stuck to the bench 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.260
 that should always be stuck to the bank 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.960
 the whole movement now something very very 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.600
 important to emphasize in this exercise 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.879
 and in all the exercises in general it's 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.149
 that what matters is the tension that 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.900
 causes in the exercise that is in this 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.750
 case for example 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.920
 you are sitting and doing the action on 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.160
 exercise that happens when you pass the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.220
 vertical or in this part of the 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.960
 movement here in reality there is no longer 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.660
 tension in the encores 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.740
 jose is an unnecessary movement and that 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:25.280
 does not bring any extra benefit more 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.410
 well you get tired more negotiated prevents you 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.280
 continue doing more repetitions is 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.840
 an unnecessary movement because you have 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.020
 to think the point of view of the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.380
 gravity or gravity as it is is 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.560
 vertical and then once you go through 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.330
 flat there is nothing that finds you towards 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.820
 down ok 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.000
 and here in tension or is all this 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.960
 part until just before reaching the 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.410
 perpendicular is the vertical there there is 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.530
 the movement we do not have to leave until 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.470
 here many times when the coach 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.650
 sells a lot of weight are doing and 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.750
 they go backwards so it's no contribution 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.240
 no benefit as I told tupi 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.600
 center or better to do it correctly 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.240
 this exercise willing to lower and 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.280
 only up there just before the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.270
 vertical what there is 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.270
 yesterday the army 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.700
 there 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.560
 you must be with the words always not 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.800
 you must prove what 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.420
 there 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.420
 bottom up 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.500
 this is the movement 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.390
 there is only 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.690
 another very important thing 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:01.600
 to work the fish the position of 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:04.860
 the arms are like that, not like that, not like that, 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.690
 there is work optimally tell us 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.990
 so what do you mean by that and 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.080
 many times in this exercise 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:18.790
 will raise if people are doing 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.200
 and get up like this, realize how it is not 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.300
 it's like this 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.849
 his arms are like that there is not 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.680
 working correctly the encores there 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.569
 is working properly the encores 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.170
 ok so 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.170
 Let's see 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.800
 that is when all the bars must 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.810
 make sure you say you are pointing 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.810
 to the sky ok 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.190
 a whole controlled movement does not 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.910
 you do 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.450
 that is fast you are not training 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.380
 with pesos you are not this 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.860
 you are not running 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.860
 there 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.350
 another very important thing is that your 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.130
 shoulders 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.930
 it has to be down doing 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:39.370
 ok tensions to subtract low shoulders 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.830
 the encores pointing to the sky and not 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.419
 will arrive here so you do not 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.979
 many times from zero finance until here 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.910
 it's just up there just there 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.440
 attention gravity get here 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.410
 you went down that's pushing gravity 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.470
 here is not pushing you so that 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.560
 pay attention they say up there for 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.560
 what 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.790
 another way to help you have a 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.580
 correct execution in this exercise is 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.289
 that to avoid the common error of raising 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:23.979
 the elbows with you doing is 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:29.139
 intentionally tighten your elbows in the 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:34.530
 bank that when dying intentionally must 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.530
 always be close to 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.480
 to the pad 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.650
 well now you know how to perform 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.509
 correctly this exercise use it 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.490
 just like I just showed you and you're going to 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:02.039
 get excellent results in two 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.110
 bises if you want me to personally 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.419
 advise in your training routines 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.189
 how you should feed among other things 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.710
 so that man is the body that 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:15.139
