00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 graduate of the Moscow locomotive will be 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.310
 play for the team volume in our club 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.560
 crossed georgy norors rent 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.700
 agreement concluded before the end of the season in 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.570
 Tomsk Nurov moved from 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.490
 Ekaterinburg 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.530
 where he failed to gain a foothold in the composition 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.450
 local Urals George from here to position 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.760
 attacking midfielder he is 23 years old 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.529
 besides uralov track record football player 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.180
 clubs like an eye ruby motif 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.519
 Petrochemist and Kaliningrad Baltic 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.619
 however really vividly manifest itself 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.519
 he has nowhere succeeded 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.320
 To study in Tomsk, I am the prospect of George 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.880
 growths and readiness of teams 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.500
 start on Saturday championship 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.450
 talk to the guest of our program 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.920
 today it is the head coach Valery Tamiya 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.020
 not remembering valerik anichkin good 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.600
 good day than you george temper 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.969
 We liked last spring 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.670
 look for him was taken to the collection well then 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.809
 failed to agree 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.430
 I'll tell you brand name so I would 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.590
 wanted our team is still 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.690
 such a creative game mid field and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.379
 here he is a midfielder who is good 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.010
 equipped technically 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:11.159
 great interaction with partners 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.880
 may slightly residue yet 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.240
 so does not like fight its final 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.770
 suggests this if george learn 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.979
 fight as it should be in our 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.360
 your team I think he will play 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.430
 the championship is starting the day after tomorrow 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.650
 And in the application Tomi on the site funnel today 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.329
 only six people hurt the essence too what 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.009
 We will declare playing coaches 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.700
 Klimov and Lego 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.560
 What is the reason for the delay ? 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.689
 more optimistic picture to draw 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.400
 I have you in stock 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.229
 today at this hour 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.770
 13 field players and 2 goalkeepers 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.360
 not much bluntly say more 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.830
 force majeure in my practice 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.900
 two days later we had a match and 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.890
 track down the application even you were silent when 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.230
 we do not recruit the situation is 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.480
 understandable return in that sex axis but he 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.330
 the same reason that just playing anyone 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.490
 or or you personally wanted to see it because 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.410
 that the fans took it differently 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.720
 that he went back to go to the views 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.780
 returned counts as an unstable goalkeeper 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.670
 for you but it is clear generally stable 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.370
 goalkeepers in nature does not always exist 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.240
 any goalkeeper you happen incidents and 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.460
 Do I miss the prominent gates 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.580
 quite satisfied with Alexey 's play 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:34.780
 Last season I hope that this season 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.570
 he will add but his return in general 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.930
 passed the initiative happened choose then 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.100
 that his official agent moved to 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.650
 arsenal work there step up 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.940
 desire to answer ours on ours 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.240
 wish your answer to the leadership 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.860
 the club puts our team again the task 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.450
 exit in the premier league but again here 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.540
 based on the situation about which you 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.709
 now speak which is taking shape 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.410
 many believe that the club is not ready 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.959
 return to the elite if the truth is 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.810
 in such a position in such an opinion or 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.750
 We will make up during the season 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:18.600
 I didnâ€™t want to divide the club up to 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.370
 whole whole here you know there is 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.290
 objective reasons and there are amazing 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.250
 Of course, it was easier for me now to go to 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.440
 such a way that we lost time on 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.720
 the beginning of the transfer campaign 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.060
 but it was due to such 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.890
 serious reasons time is 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.480
 temporary powerlessness was observed 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.140
 when nobody knew who would take 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.989
 which solutions is the second reason which here 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.060
 worth it too as we have been looking for 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.060
 the possibility of financing this 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.019
 beer because well there is football 2 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.080
 unwritten rules and 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.570
 you can not save on fees can not 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.519
 save on transfers we have this from 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.799
 year in a year this situation happens 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.480
 when we lose players that we had 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.580
 we are in the lease for example or run out 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.460
 contracts and take their place 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.490
 new 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:11.630
 in order to complete us too 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.460
 had u on 12 players before the financial club 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.790
 this was not ready and that's just 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.340
 by diligence 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.380
 let's say the deputy governor of kataev from 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.800
 legends about what did this hand 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.020
 very much needed need of opportunity and 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.550
 now here with some late and 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.250
 we begin to actively conduct this work 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.110
 understandable double Moscow Spartak with 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.850
 which us to play yes to the nearest 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.720
 saturday if by composition look at 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.150
 such a double 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.620
 there are many famous players who 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.600
 tried already sitting in the Premier League 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.930
 especially in the line of attack will have to 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.380
 trained to a very well equipped 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.300
 the teams I put their last two games 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.940
 the playing team is playing 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.910
 football does not apply to those who do not 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.600
 plays and gives others this command which 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.610
 quite healthy prepared and i'm so for 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.020
 I would take myself any of those players that 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.440
 not today in the composition with pleasure 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.420
 draw your team clear thanks for 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.310
 Our guest conversation was the head coach 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.870
 team secrets Valery nepomnyaschiy with not
