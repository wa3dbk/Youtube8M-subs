Stravinsky<00:00:45.289> this<00:00:46.289> book<00:00:46.499> is<00:00:46.620> really<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.949> key<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
Stravinsky this book is really a key to

Stravinsky this book is really a key to
understanding<00:00:47.999> that<00:00:48.179> but<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.690> would<00:00:49.019> say<00:00:49.230> it's

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
understanding that but I would say it's

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.189 
understanding that but I would say it's
a<00:00:49.530> very<00:00:49.739> very<00:00:50.039> weird<00:00:50.399> book<00:00:52.550> you<00:00:53.550> know<00:00:53.640> he<00:00:53.760> talks

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
a very very weird book you know he talks

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.219 
a very very weird book you know he talks
it's<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:56.010> has<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.640> much<00:00:56.940> less<00:00:57.329> information<00:00:58.079> in

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
it's it has so much less information in

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.630 
it's it has so much less information in
it<00:00:58.379> than<00:00:58.589> these<00:00:58.800> other<00:00:59.010> books<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.519> it's

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
it than these other books and it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.389 
it than these other books and it's
really<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.499> it<00:01:01.499> talks<00:01:01.769> about<00:01:01.859> blending

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
really kind of it talks about blending

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.680 
really kind of it talks about blending
instruments<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:02.969> than<00:01:03.120> anything<00:01:03.329> else<00:01:03.539> if

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
instruments more than anything else if

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.880 
instruments more than anything else if
you<00:01:03.780> want<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.050> know<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:04.620> what<00:01:04.800> does

a<00:01:06.390> clarinet<00:01:06.750> together<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.200> does<00:01:07.290> sound<00:01:07.500> like

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
a clarinet together what does sound like

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.230 
a clarinet together what does sound like
when<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.040> when<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.219> bassoon<00:01:08.579> plays<00:01:08.880> along

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
with each other section what does it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.190 
with each other section what does it
sound<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.610> when<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.880> bassoon<00:01:12.270> plays<00:01:12.840> along

with that now this goes back to my whole
thing<00:01:19.140> about<00:01:19.320> texture<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.890> balance<00:01:20.250> he<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
thing about texture and balance he is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
obsessed with texture and balance but it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.170 
obsessed with texture and balance but it
doesn't<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.460> tell<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.060> much

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
doesn't really tell you it all that much

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.170 
doesn't really tell you it all that much
about<00:01:24.390> function<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.310> but<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.820> there

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
about function so but but you know there

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.139 
about function so but but you know there
is<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:27.539> in<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:29.789> but<00:01:30.030> there

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
is some in here and there but there

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.959 
is some in here and there but there
isn't<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.450> any<00:01:31.079> overall<00:01:31.590> vision<00:01:32.009> about<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
isn't really any overall vision about it

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.130 
isn't really any overall vision about it
and<00:01:33.090> there<00:01:33.180> isn't<00:01:33.420> any<00:01:33.539> practical

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
and there isn't any practical

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.950 
and there isn't any practical
information<00:01:34.890> about<00:01:35.219> what<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.149> instruments

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
information about what the instruments

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.580 
information about what the instruments
can<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.380> can't<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:38.810> for<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> most<00:01:40.079> part<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
can and can't do for the most part and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.899 
can and can't do for the most part and
and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.250> other<00:01:41.369> thing<00:01:41.609> too<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:43.909> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and the other thing too is that it's the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.910 
and the other thing too is that it's the
information<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:45.960> old<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:46.859> are

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
information and is so old that there are

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.010 
information and is so old that there are
many<00:01:47.130> instruments<00:01:47.429> now<00:01:47.789> that<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.899> know

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
many instruments now that that you know

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.539 
many instruments now that that you know
can<00:01:49.200> do<00:01:49.320> way<00:01:49.500> more<00:01:49.530> than<00:01:49.950> he<00:01:50.039> says<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.429> they

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
can do way more than he says that they

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.940 
can do way more than he says that they
can<00:01:50.789> go<00:01:51.570> higher<00:01:51.810> or<00:01:51.840> lower<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.920> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
can go higher or lower or have a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.789 
can go higher or lower or have a
different<00:01:53.340> sound<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.820> different<00:01:54.119> tuning

with you guys in detail so anyways
that's<00:05:50.870> my<00:05:51.110> little<00:05:51.610> section<00:05:52.610> on

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
that's my little section on

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.320 
that's my little section on
orchestration<00:05:53.840> manuals<00:05:54.229> I<00:05:54.440> can<00:05:55.220> actually<00:05:55.610> do

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
orchestration manuals I can actually do

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.870 
orchestration manuals I can actually do
an<00:05:56.539> entire<00:05:56.810> segment<00:05:57.050> on<00:05:57.380> each<00:05:57.560> book<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:58.100> go

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
an entire segment on each book and go

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.010 
an entire segment on each book and go
through<00:05:59.120> the<00:05:59.210> different<00:05:59.479> samples<00:05:59.810> but<00:05:59.930> I

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
through the different samples but I

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.170 
through the different samples but I
think<00:06:00.169> you<00:06:00.260> guys<00:06:00.410> get<00:06:00.590> the<00:06:00.650> idea<00:06:01.180> I've

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
think you guys get the idea I've

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.500 
think you guys get the idea I've
probably<00:06:02.360> talked<00:06:02.690> enough<00:06:03.020> but<00:06:03.440> once<00:06:04.280> again

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
probably talked enough but once again

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.300 
probably talked enough but once again
read<00:06:05.510> the<00:06:05.630> orchestration<00:06:06.080> manuals<00:06:06.650> I<00:06:06.919> think

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
read the orchestration manuals I think

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.840 
read the orchestration manuals I think
that<00:06:07.630> most<00:06:08.630> modern<00:06:09.140> orchestrators<00:06:09.919> need<00:06:10.729> to

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
that most modern orchestrators need to

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.370 
that most modern orchestrators need to
have<00:06:10.970> the<00:06:11.090> Adler<00:06:11.390> okay<00:06:12.310> and<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:15.080> Walther

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
have the Adler okay and the Walther

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.560 
have the Adler okay and the Walther

the<00:06:52.470> only<00:06:52.740> one<00:06:52.949> I<00:06:53.250> could<00:06:53.580> think<00:06:53.610> of<00:06:53.910> that

hasn't been outdated really there's a

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
few drills that you might say that

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:00.500 
few drills that you might say that
aren't<00:06:58.650> possible<00:06:59.130> nowadays<00:06:59.910> that<00:07:00.300> are<00:07:00.389> now

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
thinking is sort of stuck in the 50s but

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.260 
thinking is sort of stuck in the 50s but
the<00:07:05.250> 50s<00:07:05.580> was<00:07:05.729> a<00:07:05.760> great<00:07:06.000> time<00:07:06.210> for

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
the 50s was a great time for

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.480 
the 50s was a great time for
orchestration<00:07:07.020> okay<00:07:07.710> you<00:07:08.010> know<00:07:08.130> let's<00:07:08.160> not

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490
