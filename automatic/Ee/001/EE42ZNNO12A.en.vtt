Church<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.960> was<00:00:18.960> having<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> discussion<00:00:19.380> with

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
Church I was having a discussion with

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.529 
Church I was having a discussion with
one<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.520> viewers<00:00:20.789> about<00:00:20.939> religious

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
one of the viewers about religious

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.870 
one of the viewers about religious
structures<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.320> about<00:00:23.039> Lego<00:00:23.460> not<00:00:23.670> really

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
structures and about Lego not really

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.450 
structures and about Lego not really
producing<00:00:24.060> many<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:25.230> these<00:00:25.350> structures<00:00:25.800> I

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
producing many of these structures I

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.089 
producing many of these structures I
think<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.960> only<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.380> found<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.949> their

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
think the only one that I found in their

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.880 
think the only one that I found in their
history<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.640> back<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.230> 1957<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.320> very<00:00:31.500> small

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
history was back in 1957 a very small

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.299 
history was back in 1957 a very small
set<00:00:32.219> simply<00:00:32.610> called<00:00:33.000> Church<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.920> it<00:00:34.920> was<00:00:35.070> very

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
set simply called Church and it was very

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.190 
set simply called Church and it was very
small<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:36.270> too<00:00:36.420> many<00:00:36.540> figures<00:00:36.870> scale

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
small it was not too many figures scale

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.959 
small it was not too many figures scale
like<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.890> these<00:00:38.190> days<00:00:38.460> obviously

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
like we have these days obviously

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.510 
like we have these days obviously
because<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> was<00:00:39.719> long<00:00:40.320> before<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.309> these

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
because it was long before we have these

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.110 
because it was long before we have these
1<00:00:42.090> inch<00:00:42.410> minifigures<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:44.910> we're<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
1 inch minifigures so so then we're a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.819 
1 inch minifigures so so then we're a
leaves<00:00:45.750> us<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> our<00:00:46.200> own<00:00:46.320> devices<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
leaves us up to our own devices to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.740 
leaves us up to our own devices to
create<00:00:47.370> religious<00:00:48.030> structures<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.570> you'd

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
create religious structures if you'd

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.160 
create religious structures if you'd
like

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
like

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.330 
like
and<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:50.960> churches<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.410> very<00:00:52.800> common<00:00:53.250> in

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and I think churches are very common in

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.369 
and I think churches are very common in
any<00:00:53.550> neighborhood<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> decided<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.050> put<00:00:55.350> one

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
any neighborhood so I decided to put one

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.020 
any neighborhood so I decided to put one
in<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:55.680> neighborhood<00:00:55.860> right<00:00:56.670> across<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
in my neighborhood right across the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.599 
in my neighborhood right across the
street<00:00:57.149> from<00:00:57.270> my<00:00:57.600> school<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.460> this

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
street from my school and I like this

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
street from my school and I like this
location<00:00:59.789> right<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> had<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.260> move<00:01:01.410> one

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
location right here so I had to move one

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.349 
location right here so I had to move one
of<00:01:01.770> my<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:02.190> beach<00:01:02.340> houses<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.910> yellow<00:01:03.090> one

of my little beach houses my yellow one

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
of my little beach houses my yellow one

that's actually over there now

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.410 
that's actually over there now
there's<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> little<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.850> space<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.330> it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
there's a little bit of space for it

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.140 
there's a little bit of space for it
luckily<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.110> fit<00:01:07.439> running<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> space<00:01:08.820> here

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
luckily it fit running out of space here

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.810 
luckily it fit running out of space here
and<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.260> built<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.590> Community<00:01:10.979> Church<00:01:11.189> out<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
and I built my Community Church out of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
and I built my Community Church out of
bulk<00:01:12.270> Legos<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> had<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.049> my<00:01:13.140> own

good<00:01:24.659> decorative<00:01:25.320> look<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> some<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
good decorative look for it some of the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.539 
good decorative look for it some of the

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
liked that fit that so I just kept it as

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:42.229

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
nice and open okay and that's it okay I

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.850

also<00:02:42.480> wanted<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.900> show<00:02:43.049> how<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.230> did<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> roof

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
also wanted to show how I did the roof

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.039 
also wanted to show how I did the roof
because<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.099> was<00:02:44.310> kind<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.580> fun<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.879> do<00:02:45.049> it

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
because it was kind of fun to do it

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.410 
because it was kind of fun to do it
turned<00:02:46.319> out<00:02:46.410> really<00:02:46.680> well<00:02:46.799> I<00:02:46.980> think<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.819> all

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
turned out really well I think so all

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.400 
turned out really well I think so all
I've<00:02:48.510> done<00:02:48.540> there's<00:02:48.810> there's<00:02:48.989> two<00:02:49.200> main

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
I've done there's there's two main

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.319 
I've done there's there's two main
supports<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.190> they<00:02:50.280> they<00:02:50.849> support<00:02:51.209> these

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
supports and they they support these

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.130 
supports and they they support these
beams<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.319> go<00:02:52.349> across<00:02:52.530> either<00:02:53.160> way<00:02:53.310> and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
beams that go across either way and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.920 
beams that go across either way and
everything<00:02:55.140> else<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.709> connected<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.930> so

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
everything else is connected to that so

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.890 
everything else is connected to that so
there's<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:59.329> first<00:03:00.329> section<00:03:00.599> right<00:03:00.870> here

these hinges they go all the way up and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.680 
these hinges they go all the way up and
down<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.980> they<00:03:26.549> kind<00:03:26.819> of<00:03:26.850> overlap<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.389> little

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
down and they kind of overlap a little

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.229 
down and they kind of overlap a little
bit<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.880> go<00:03:30.030> inside<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.780> little<00:03:32.239> crevice

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
bit to go inside of this little crevice

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.699 
bit to go inside of this little crevice
there<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.970> when<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.180> goes<00:03:36.359> back<00:03:36.569> on<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:37.410> hides

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
there so when this goes back on it hides

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.220 
there so when this goes back on it hides
it<00:03:37.920> gives<00:03:38.579> it<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.700> nice<00:03:38.940> clean<00:03:39.420> roof<00:03:39.930> look
