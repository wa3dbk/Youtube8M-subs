00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.270
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.430
 of trail running review dotcom today 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.080
 let's analyze the merrell do 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.140
 flowers 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.110
 here you have them as you see following the 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.259
 American house always following more or 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.230
 less very usually your line 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:30.250
 minimalist as you see and these make road 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.710
 They are one more example, although as 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.800
 we will see with some difference a 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.620
 pretty light shoe to be a 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.110
 minimalist is not excessively light 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.780
 but if we compare it with shoes 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.519
 more classic models logically 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.739
 we are talking about a super shoe 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.570
 light let's see let's start with 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.269
 the flexibility as you see 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.510
 Flexas super easy as any other 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:59.010
 minimalist slipper look how can I 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.559
 twist the easy enough 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.530
 notice that it is a shoe that has 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.080
 some cushioning so I 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.000
 It costs a little more than other shoes 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.399
 minimalist in terms of the sole is a 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.549
 outsole as you can see from the sparse vibe 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.460
 an Italian house of vibram gums and that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.369
 the feeling is just touching it 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.770
 we always say that many 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.750
 times simply made to touch it 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.659
 usually knows a little about the quality of 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.920
 rubber in this case it looks like it's a rubber 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.030
 that has very good grip all this 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.000
 logically we will have to contrast 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.100
 then on the ground as you see in 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.979
 lines of reflection in one's own 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.869
 sneaker with the heel part a little 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.390
 against the grain especially to this part of 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.980
 here to hook more on the descents 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.460
 while the final part also 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.260
 against peeling also to hook on 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.560
 the rises 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.630
 the most central part tacos little 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.630
 prominent as you can see more or less 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.350
 very uniform little prominent and 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.650
 quite neutral as I said slipper 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.170
 a bit atypical in terms of minimalism 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.880
 because it incorporates 6 millimeters of 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.610
 cushioning is therefore a 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.370
 shoe that could be very good for 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.770
 people who want to start entering the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.810
 Minimalist minimalist world 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.140
 Sneaker incorporates that protection 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.490
 also incorporates into the sole what 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.600
 calling me the trail trail protect you 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.400
 It is a plate that protects the foot of 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.490
 the impacts since 6 millimeters of 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.890
 cushioning is not much and although 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.260
 it seems that no but the drop of this 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.780
 sneaker the back fall forward is 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.070
 of 0 millimeters for example therefore 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.750
 forgiveness is a is a flat sneaker 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.050
 totally in this sense 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.990
 as for the bitch fixes 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.820
 Superprotection front with rubber is 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.920
 It looks a lot like a cat's foot 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.530
 with a protection for the big toe and 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.270
 the rest a very fine month a month that is 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.270
 anti-odor antibacterial and therefore 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.480
 It is a shoe very fit calmly 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.860
 to run without sock in fact 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.620
 even look many times what is 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.500
 advising you look inside you know what 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.989
 I teach the month very breathable all the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.570
 part is here super breathable very 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.270
 flexible and the areas are here with 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.730
 a thermos sealed plastic a little more 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.480
 consistent for 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.080
 by tying the laces we embrace everything 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.230
 the foot fix the tongue very wide but 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.430
 quite fine also in the area of 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.430
 heel without almost practically without 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.910
 padded lens a lined form of 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.849
 another fabric set how I can fold it 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.370
 without any problems without a doubt 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.880
 a typical construction to be able to 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.850
 be able to run barefoot and a sneaker 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.250
 that has no template that goes 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.830
 directly already tied to the rubber like 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.880
 you can see can teach us nothing more 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.630
 because I can not take anything for 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.560
 friends 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.660
 if you are thinking about seeing what this is 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.690
 of minimalism to try and do not want 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.600
 try something else you do not want to mess with 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.030
 a sneaker that probably what 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.320
 you destroy your foot lick the 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:51.410
 ascend balloon is your sneaker 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.390
 friends as always analyzed by bring 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.900

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.900
