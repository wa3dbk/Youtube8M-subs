freshly squeezed lemon juice and that's
going<00:01:23.480> to<00:01:23.540> even<00:01:23.840> out<00:01:23.990> all<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.170> sweetness<00:01:24.650> that

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
going to even out all the sweetness that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.980 
going to even out all the sweetness that
we<00:01:24.950> get<00:01:25.100> from<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.430> shrub<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:26.480> needs<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:26.840> good

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
we get from the shrub this needs a good

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:41.720 
we get from the shrub this needs a good
old<00:01:27.140> shake

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.010 

now<00:01:42.730> it's<00:01:42.970> great<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.360> start<00:01:43.540> thinking<00:01:43.930> about

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
now it's great to start thinking about

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.870 
now it's great to start thinking about
making<00:01:44.320> shrubs<00:01:44.830> in<00:01:45.070> spring<00:01:45.460> or<00:01:45.580> summer

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
making shrubs in spring or summer

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.370 
making shrubs in spring or summer
because<00:01:46.300> that's<00:01:46.480> when<00:01:46.660> we<00:01:46.750> have<00:01:46.930> all<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.260> our

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
because that's when we have all of our

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.380 
because that's when we have all of our
fruit<00:01:48.160> back<00:01:48.400> in<00:01:48.550> season<00:01:50.910> now<00:01:51.910> I'm<00:01:52.030> just<00:01:52.210> gonna

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
fruit back in season now I'm just gonna

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.180 
fruit back in season now I'm just gonna
strain<00:01:52.720> this<00:01:52.930> over<00:01:53.290> I've<00:01:53.410> got<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.620> nice<00:01:53.830> big

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
strain this over I've got a nice big

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.140 
strain this over I've got a nice big
block<00:01:54.430> of<00:01:54.490> ice

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
block of ice

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.770 
block of ice
keep<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.870> drink<00:01:56.110> nice<00:01:56.230> and<00:01:56.470> cold<00:01:57.720> I'm<00:01:58.720> just
