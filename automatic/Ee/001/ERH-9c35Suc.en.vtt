00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.500
 such statements continue to local multiplayer 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.450
 84 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.829
 Zack word comes morning my pre-orders are very serious 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:11.909
 to push the music night Pistor Post gets morning 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.229
 I believe many pre-orders 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:17.740
 Sven he all 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.610
 on site 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.560
 This really was sent so Freiberg 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.579
 I am happy as a little girl 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.119
 16 belonging 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.399
 that has to wait so long can keep on playing 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.579
 Emperor 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.930
 we already have in the right corner 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.590
 to start with the men's team org 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.760
 and in Berlin 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.520
 the platform in position my friend me too already 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.960
 eat 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.980
 Big Brother but scored under legal norms scores 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.850
 Nevertheless, we did not occupy anything special 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.760
 Today is currently one point 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.940
 until the end have changed 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.350
 the Chapman Obama 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.460
 in Tabasco native language 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.860
 what does the user pre-order free of charge as each player's USD 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.230
 Most pre-orders make sure you have the most to play 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 that's how Schulz himself is supposed to do so much 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.550
 what is coming to us so soon 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.350
 move to the city and twentieth top single place on 27 7 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.510
 Joined now 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.950
 the concrete element aesthetics Ina stand 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.390
 the worst 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.250
 first contracts with high-percentage rose, although always busy 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.670
 give similar problems 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.350
 surely even Jessica StarCraft comes into the light 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.960
 MGV Thorsten Storm also no nude scanner tip look 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.580
 to explain 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.550
 15 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.550
 Mixed very nice 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.130
 while learning track lured to hang high 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.940
 public circulation 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.940
 Kriftel himself has Norbert countries 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 Opera Schaumann is still there 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.320
 as the corps 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.579
 Order 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.579
 and there you in the pool 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.369
 and led shortly before his death is still up to the spö 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.469
 operated 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.469
 that in purple-prompt 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.529
 Scott finally has project today 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:32.789
 Fisherman in front 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.079
 what they drums 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.639
 dapd of course 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.299
 already the network believes 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.299
 Dollar I have to apologize "I did not feel so good today 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.229
 I did not sleep much but 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.659
 yesterday Kramer was 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.149
 against the sandhasen 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:52.599
 that means they have to go to the schools 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.139
 minister 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.139
 and I wait until the lax handling of the whole story 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:00.319
 Charm is our turn 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.739
 OTCBB producing squad counts 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.759
 made 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.209
 Helge Janssen 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.609
 Interesting 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.229
 It's not a fad from the Leyens 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.329
 These lancet therefore became her most understandable 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:18.169
 Schöntal 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.169
 Family does not come to meaning 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.340
 a rock party and hiding there 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.189
 Alessi witch 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.189
 The animal will not have to recall this depression 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.479
 we have too 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:38.859
 get the AXA to work 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.859
 she stopped 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.529
 what makes us drunk, he says APA tested and mouse does not 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.289
 Fixed 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.289
 Maybe it's good that the Saxon has been seen 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.849
 the blade 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.849
 and 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.549
 I have to go with him 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.539
 wants to overthrow unanimous opinion 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:15.989
 because finally is 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.989
 not so Metternich nothing went more balanced 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:24.309
 International match does not make maintenance countries mandatory 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.099
 Borghorst and children caught 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.479
 he negotiates splendid obstacles, he thinks differently 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.580
 and it's exactly the same 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.580
 what to do with nothing is lost in the last game 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.210
 and industries a nice life 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.110
 this means 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.969
 the last active honored 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.240
 Jaszka is a technical can 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.240
 this looks stupid 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:59.990
 Berlin polar bears 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.990
 which ones can lose 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.430
 good coffee spot 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.430
 we wanted the power 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.809
 they want to do 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:18.809
 in Paris was called 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.930
 made possible Rinteln degree 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.539
 Brian Oxman AXA 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.819
 Würzburg in the body and next door waiting next door 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:39.059
 and we already have four 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:42.419
 Poverty to Lists in Action 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.089
 but they are capable of dancing 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:48.089
 were 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.969
 and they break up useful tips 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:52.949
 that's right 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.949
 Of course, it does not make much profit 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.400
 actually comes 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.400
 Companies 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.860
 and that's already suspected he should 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.389
 It shows in it 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.589
 Everyone came to them sometime 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.710
 12 more clicks interested to deliver 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:44.629
 so he believes 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.930
 it does not turn out well 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.930
 Superman comics passed on the child 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:56.969
 nicely done 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.969
 that the place is valid 

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:06.069
 the press arrived 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.069
 Food admitted biggest recall comes 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:18.439
 - FC Getafe was there but otherwise Michel Mixa with mixed 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.689
 Puma should grow one 14 percent 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:27.080
 Packages need 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.080
 what you do is Eric Dobias dpa 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:33.999
 if it's pretty much today 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:37.339
 so scarcely to invalidate Rott's Codex any more serious 

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:42.809
 that shows very ill have spread to the chancellor's majority 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.979
 not around us 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:50.210
 the costume but a lot of noise to rush 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.389
 they remember 

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.389
 wait tenth flight or too 

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:58.249
 our flight is very dangerous
