00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.180
 if i have a video every day again 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.680
 would do and have some said something 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.310
 I thought of myself every day 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.080
 my new month begins in october 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.400

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.290
 beautiful day for this series to 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.019
 I 've been thinking for a long time 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.360
 Honestly because it's a lot of work 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.739

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:54.920
 and that's why we have today again 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:56.330

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.790
 honest I do not mind yet 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.170
 be more but it can always be something 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.970
 it will not be like this 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.290
 little things like that on youtube 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.489
 the videos are not published again 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.380
 it may be that I get sick 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.120
 is very unlikely but can 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.070
 his and that's why i take it myself 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.450
