00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.519
 at the very least what they have become 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.559
 we meet paul &amp; wake and news 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.910
 today I'm going to talk to you about an art 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.710
 unfortunately it's a concept but 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.650
 often it happens that sometimes we do 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.990
 we will find concepts that will 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.420
 can be developed and where through a 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.920
 little so it depends if the person has any 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.109
 money not me often it's through 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.900
 donations of people here that will finally 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 simply he will propose if the concept 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.869
 can walk anyway and so little 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.210
 market he can ask for some money 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 and everything to reunite and to try well 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.899
 in any case to create the product 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.309
 today I was talking to you then and that 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.739
 is called it's a tablet and like 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.090
 it's a concept is not really not 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.320
 there is no price and everything so here is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.200
 it's just to show you I find 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.480
 pretty interesting is the x gamer who 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.000
 is simply a tablet for 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.070
 use them as he names them the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.039
 nomadic users of games 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.469
 amateur video is not very nice for 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.270
 that but good anyway users 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.770
 nomadic it is to wood to be able to move 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.629
 to all with most people who 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.729
 are now getting that we have 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.010
 smartphones I saw recently 7 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.630
 inch 1 but we're not here 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.189
 in 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.810
 in any case it's true that good when we 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.990
 has a tablet itou often most 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.759
 time we will play games and is 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.770
 in fact there this person there all 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.259
 just there is good sir 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.520
 finally it's the handsome industrial designer 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.799
 raid who has who created this concept there and 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.049
 he really had a specialty that's 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.329
 there that the screen is curved circus it is 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.069
 slightly a little put forward as 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.149
 not in that there is a lg with a screen 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.369
 curved I do not know if you 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.470
 know I'm talking about a smartphone by 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.119
 against there nothing to see is not very 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.369
 far but but here and in any case and there 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.780
 are good actually he slightly curved 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.369
 there is actually on the side as you 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.220
 see on the screen with images 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.509
 via joystick and all with its appearance 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.979
 is good for the video game 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.899
 somehow but he's still 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.880
 keep some applications finally 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.349
 that is to say that good for 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.610
 the moment it remains a concept but 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.439
 maybe in the sights and where he will be 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.450
 remember well as I think under 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.890
 android and that we will find of course 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.360
 that the application finally all the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.729
 applications that can be found in 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.959
 a pretty enough tablet 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.720
 so here we find a little everywhere 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.519
 so somewhere here I think that 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.540
 I think I think it's 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.890
 a valley of games just give you 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.030
 the characteristics even if not that 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.950
 not used to much in any case who has 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.280
 been given it's a touch screen of 10 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.530
 inches with a resolution of 1080p this 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.459
 who is really now 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.989
 unfortunately can say that it is a 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.670
 little base what is ben ben 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.680
 it's not very beautiful and it would have been 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.989
 better to see it above by 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.549
 against all the content you're going 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.410
 have since your tablet you will have 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.430
 a bit of a 180 degree view because 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.410
 necessarily we thought them slightly 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.230
 curved it's really a big plus 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.540
 offers you well this tablet there and 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.280
 then it's a bit close 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.489
 after that I hope the games will only have to 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.989
 not be adapted a little to the screen 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.239
 curved in any case since that a view to 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.709
 180 degrees I hope to pass if not after 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.049
 not until the bikes either 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.310
 adapted all good we stay in the same 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.799
 atmosphere as I say them some 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.180
 conceptual thing but in any case I 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.250
 think it's a very good idea 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.269
 after frankly defense making think 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.420
 all that we are tired of comments 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.069
 I think that putting a 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.730
 to curve everything is super pretty by 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.450
 against it I find it a little pity 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.560
 to have incrusted a joystick and where 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.150
 I hope maybe they will remove 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.129
 that it is possible to remove it 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.239
 directly on the tablet because 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.609
 was walking with a tablet and a 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.530
 joystick h24 end me here it would not be 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.599
 really my style what I then 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.950
 attached to the head justin ghetto ago 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.819
 still frankly I like playing 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.500
 with the tactile messac this idea without 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.049
 limit we have the impression of finding ourselves 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.019
 is a mini TV with curved screen 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.269
 it's not anything good 1080p resolution 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.310
 is not super beautiful mother but here I am 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.439
 know what it is to be epu 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.370
 then that's about all but I 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.319
 also thought of another thing not 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.229
 just to put it in a bag or 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.489
 stuff like that 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.690
 finally I think it can be mean 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.970
 frankly not what it can be 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.489
 quite fragile buxin curve and finally voila 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.810
 it is slightly folded and if we put 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.370
 pretty heavy stuff in a school bag 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.829
 shows like that I do not know how 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.180
 it will react your table no it's 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.620
 good things especially this curved screen 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.720
 brew a little specialist 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.069
 a specialty of this concept and 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.099
 fortunately that also interests 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.299
 otherwise it would have been useless but 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.889
 that's really different concept 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.209
 is tired of comments thank you to put 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.709
 a little jet ma'am two that's great 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.389
 pleasure do not worry I'm going 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.099
 still good although I did 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.260
 operate a week ago then I will you 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.979
 say next time yes we do not come 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.169
 to zap me 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.090
 I like a lot of hitting debut at 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.570
 two videos then your next studio 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.570
 pixar
