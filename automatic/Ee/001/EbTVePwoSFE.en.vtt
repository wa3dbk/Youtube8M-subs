00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
like it's the best thing they're going

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.100 
like it's the best thing they're going
to<00:02:18.580> I'm<00:02:18.970> not<00:02:19.090> sure<00:02:19.150> what<00:02:19.510> he's<00:02:19.690> going<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.990> go

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
to I'm not sure what he's going to go

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.170 
to I'm not sure what he's going to go
into<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.430> looks<00:02:21.580> like<00:02:21.760> he's<00:02:22.000> actually

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
into and it looks like he's actually

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.690 
into and it looks like he's actually
going<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.690> go<00:02:22.900> into<00:02:23.560> his<00:02:23.710> my<00:02:23.860> net<00:02:24.010> trick<00:02:24.220> again

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
going to go into his my net trick again

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.570 
going to go into his my net trick again
and<00:02:25.000> that's<00:02:25.450> honestly<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.620> thought<00:02:27.250> at<00:02:27.550> first

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
and that's honestly I thought at first

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.550 
and that's honestly I thought at first
it<00:02:28.090> was<00:02:28.120> fine<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.450> then<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.050> didn't<00:02:29.290> realize

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
it was fine and then I didn't realize

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.500 
it was fine and then I didn't realize
miss<00:02:29.800> Richter<00:02:29.980> ruined<00:02:30.400> all<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:31.210> I<00:02:31.240> go<00:02:31.390> for

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
miss Richter ruined all that so I go for

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.940 
miss Richter ruined all that so I go for
rocks<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.990> now<00:02:32.110> I'm<00:02:32.200> locked<00:02:32.380> in<00:02:32.620> because<00:02:32.830> I

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
rocks and now I'm locked in because I

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.200 
rocks and now I'm locked in because I
had<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.160> troit<00:02:33.430> specs<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.000> really

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
had this troit specs and it's really

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.030 
had this troit specs and it's really
nothing<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.540> can<00:02:34.600> do<00:02:34.810> about<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.380> what<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:35.890> have

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
nothing I can do about it so what I have

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.190 
nothing I can do about it so what I have
to<00:02:36.160> do<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.700> I'm<00:02:37.090> going<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.540> have<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.750> switch<00:02:37.990> out

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
to do is I'm going to have to switch out

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.360 
to do is I'm going to have to switch out
and<00:02:38.380> I'm<00:02:38.470> gonna<00:02:38.560> have<00:02:38.710> to<00:02:38.770> go<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> my<00:02:39.070> needle

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
and I'm gonna have to go to my needle

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.030 
and I'm gonna have to go to my needle
keen<00:02:39.580> but<00:02:40.030> what<00:02:40.210> he<00:02:40.480> actually<00:02:40.750> does<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.560> didn't

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
keen but what he actually does I didn't

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.590 
keen but what he actually does I didn't
realize<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.550> until<00:02:42.730> later<00:02:43.060> because<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.450> guess

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
realize this until later because I guess

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.240 
realize this until later because I guess
it<00:02:43.720> wasn't<00:02:43.840> paying<00:02:44.110> attention<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:45.130> he

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
it wasn't paying attention is that he

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.650 
it wasn't paying attention is that he
actually<00:02:45.460> knows<00:02:45.820> wouldn't<00:02:46.150> switch<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.510> rule

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
actually knows wouldn't switch a rule

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.450 
actually knows wouldn't switch a rule
again<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.350> lose<00:02:47.590> my<00:02:47.770> choice<00:02:48.040> scarf<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.400> I

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
again and I lose my choice scarf and I

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.780 
again and I lose my choice scarf and I
get<00:02:48.610> leftovers<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:50.320> just<00:02:51.190> keep<00:02:51.520> that<00:02:51.550> in<00:02:51.730> mind

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
get leftovers so just keep that in mind

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.830 
get leftovers so just keep that in mind
for<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.060> little<00:02:52.150> bit<00:02:52.330> because<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.690> actually

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
for a little bit because I actually

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.570 
for a little bit because I actually
comes<00:02:53.230> into<00:02:53.470> play<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.709> little<00:02:54.010> bit<00:02:54.160> later<00:02:54.340> on

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
comes into play a little bit later on

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.790 
comes into play a little bit later on
so<00:02:54.760> I'm<00:02:54.820> gonna<00:02:54.970> go<00:02:55.090> from<00:02:55.270> her<00:02:55.420> car<00:02:55.660> here<00:02:55.900> he's

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:51.469 
so anyways with that my only chance of

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.469 
so anyways with that my only chance of
winning<00:06:51.889> right<00:06:52.039> now<00:06:52.219> is<00:06:52.490> to<00:06:52.639> bring<00:06:52.879> mine<00:06:53.179> shout

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:55.279 
and hopefully somehow stone edge is able

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:59.079 
and hopefully somehow stone edge is able
to<00:06:55.339> knock<00:06:55.519> him<00:06:55.699> out<00:06:56.050> and<00:06:57.050> I'm<00:06:57.199> assuming<00:06:58.029> now<00:06:59.029> we

00:06:59.079 --> 00:06:59.089 
to knock him out and I'm assuming now we

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:00.969 
to knock him out and I'm assuming now we
did<00:06:59.419> a<00:06:59.449> calque<00:06:59.779> on<00:06:59.959> this<00:07:00.169> later<00:07:00.469> it<00:07:00.709> looked

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
did a calque on this later it looked

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.919 
did a calque on this later it looked
like<00:07:01.159> at<00:07:01.309> that<00:07:01.369> point<00:07:01.550> he<00:07:02.389> had<00:07:02.539> maybe<00:07:02.809> about

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:02.929 
like at that point he had maybe about

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:07.059 
like at that point he had maybe about
like<00:07:03.319> 80%<00:07:03.679> herself<00:07:04.539> the<00:07:05.539> calc<00:07:05.809> said<00:07:06.169> it<00:07:06.439> does

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:07.069 
like 80% herself the calc said it does

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:11.109 
like 80% herself the calc said it does
about<00:07:07.339> 53<00:07:08.179> to<00:07:08.449> 63<00:07:09.079> percent<00:07:09.159> so<00:07:10.159> even<00:07:10.490> if<00:07:10.579> I<00:07:10.759> did

00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:11.119 
about 53 to 63 percent so even if I did

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:11.439 
about 53 to 63 percent so even if I did
you<00:07:11.300> know

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:11.449

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
hit that stone edge it wouldn't have

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:13.809 
hit that stone edge it wouldn't have
mattered<00:07:13.099> it<00:07:13.399> would<00:07:13.519> have<00:07:13.610> been<00:07:13.699> extremely

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:13.819 
mattered it would have been extremely

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:16.190 
mattered it would have been extremely
close<00:07:14.649> but<00:07:15.649> it<00:07:15.740> wouldn't

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.200 
close but it wouldn't

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.130 
close but it wouldn't
matter<00:07:16.470> so<00:07:17.180> anyways<00:07:18.180> that<00:07:18.300> was<00:07:18.330> a<00:07:18.450> fantastic
