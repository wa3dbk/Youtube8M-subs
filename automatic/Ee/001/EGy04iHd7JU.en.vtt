luckily Lego has solved this by
providing<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:07.200> smart<00:00:07.560> car<00:00:07.799> set<00:00:08.099> now<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.730> is

providing a smart car set now this is

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.959 
providing a smart car set now this is
the<00:00:09.059> standard<00:00:09.240> set<00:00:09.719> which<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.559> could<00:00:10.740> find

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
the standard set which you could find

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.110 
the standard set which you could find
pretty<00:00:11.969> much<00:00:12.059> at<00:00:12.269> any<00:00:12.420> any<00:00:13.380> store<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.130> then

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
pretty much at any any store and then

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.840 
pretty much at any any store and then
this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> slightly<00:00:16.080> modified<00:00:16.350> version<00:00:16.850> that

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this is a slightly modified version that

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.390 
this is a slightly modified version that
we<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.180> come<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.250> changes<00:00:20.250> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
we have come up with that changes the

we have come up with that changes the
look<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> car<00:00:20.910> quite<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> bit<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.619> if

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
look of the car quite a bit so that if

look of the car quite a bit so that if
you<00:00:22.800> buy<00:00:23.390> more<00:00:24.390> than<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:24.900> eye<00:00:25.220> you<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.550> have

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the smart car apart first change is a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.100 
the smart car apart first change is a
pretty<00:00:40.770> easy<00:00:40.860> win<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> spot<00:00:41.750> simply<00:00:42.750> replace

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
pretty easy win a spot simply replace

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.160 
pretty easy win a spot simply replace
the<00:00:43.410> lower<00:00:44.340> grille<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.059> side<00:00:45.329> it's

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the look of the car quite a bit now you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.040 
the look of the car quite a bit now you
do<00:00:53.430> need<00:00:53.579> extra<00:00:53.789> parts<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.660> some<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
do need extra parts to do some of the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.459 
do need extra parts to do some of the
other<00:00:55.170> changes<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:57.000> most<00:00:57.180> notable<00:00:57.539> are<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
other changes the most notable are the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.040 
other changes the most notable are the
windshield<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.579> look<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.719> windshield

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
windshield if you look this windshield

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.880 
windshield if you look this windshield
has<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> thicker<00:01:02.879> top<00:01:03.320> for<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> same<00:01:04.619> length

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
has a thicker top for the same length

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.789 
has a thicker top for the same length
bottom<00:01:05.630> whereas<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.930> much<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
bottom whereas this is a much more of a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.690 
bottom whereas this is a much more of a
sloped<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.970> shield<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:09.750> thin<00:01:10.049> top

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
sloped and shield with a very thin top

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.859 
sloped and shield with a very thin top
that<00:01:11.700> gives<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.090> little<00:01:12.150> bit<00:01:12.360> stubbier<00:01:12.810> look

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
that gives it a little bit stubbier look

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.469 
that gives it a little bit stubbier look
on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> cars<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> back<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.970> back<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
on the cars on the back the back is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.399 
on the cars on the back the back is
completely<00:01:18.600> different

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
completely different

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.280 
completely different
below<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> roofline<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.900> change<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
below the roofline and we change the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.020 
below the roofline and we change the
color<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.340> more<00:01:23.610> easily

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
color just so you can see more easily

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.630 
color just so you can see more easily
what<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.049> did<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
what it is that we did so I'm going to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.380 
what it is that we did so I'm going to
show<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.470> real<00:01:28.470> quickly<00:01:29.000> how<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.030> back

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
show you real quickly how this back

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.960 
show you real quickly how this back
section<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.930> built<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:32.250> front<00:01:32.490> section<00:01:32.850> is

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
section is built the front section is

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
section is built the front section is
just<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.360> different<00:01:33.689> windshield<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
just that different windshield and the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.310 
just that different windshield and the
only<00:01:34.890> thing<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.220> did<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:36.030> give<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.360> hood<00:01:36.540> was

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
only thing we did to give it a hood was

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.420 
only thing we did to give it a hood was
to<00:01:37.470> add<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> piece<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.600> otherwise<00:01:40.189> those<00:01:41.189> two

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to add a piece here otherwise those two

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.850 
to add a piece here otherwise those two
pieces<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> only

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
pieces here and here are the only

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
pieces here and here are the only
difference<00:01:44.280> between<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> stock<00:01:45.299> car

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
difference between it in the stock car

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.620 
difference between it in the stock car
okay<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.470> I've<00:01:46.890> removed<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.369> roof<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.329> set<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
okay so I've removed the roof and set it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.899 
okay so I've removed the roof and set it
aside<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> standard<00:01:50.189> roof<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.790> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
aside it's just the standard roof in a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.969 
aside it's just the standard roof in a
different<00:01:51.210> color<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.720> an<00:01:51.840> antenna<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
different color with an antenna and a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.179 
different color with an antenna and a
little<00:01:53.399> 1<00:01:53.700> by<00:01:53.880> 2<00:01:53.939> piece<00:01:54.390> set<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:55.049> underneath<00:01:55.350> we

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
little 1 by 2 piece set up underneath we

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.160 
little 1 by 2 piece set up underneath we
actually<00:01:56.520> added<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> regular<00:01:57.869> smart

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
actually added one to the regular smart

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.499 
actually added one to the regular smart
car<00:01:58.380> anyway<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.549> look<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> third<00:02:00.180> brake

you<00:02:35.110> would<00:02:35.200> have<00:02:35.319> another<00:02:35.530> 2x2<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:36.190> go<00:02:36.310> here<00:02:36.580> we

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
you would have another 2x2 to go here we

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
you would have another 2x2 to go here we
didn't<00:02:36.910> have<00:02:37.060> one<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:37.330> we<00:02:37.420> just<00:02:37.450> put<00:02:37.720> some

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
didn't have one so we just put some

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.720 
didn't have one so we just put some
filler<00:02:38.110> pieces<00:02:38.440> in<00:02:38.590> doesn't<00:02:39.310> matter

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.860 
that's your fender bit and it goes on
there<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.569> would<00:02:46.630> be<00:02:46.750> two<00:02:46.930> two<00:02:47.140> by<00:02:47.290> twos

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
straight down this is a smoked so that

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.460 
straight down this is a smoked so that

the side is built just like the other
and<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.820> it<00:03:34.150> that's<00:03:34.450> all<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.870> takes<00:03:35.370> to

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
and that is it that's all it takes to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.599 
and that is it that's all it takes to
transform<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.180> standard<00:03:37.750> smart<00:03:38.049> car<00:03:38.609> until

more<00:03:50.980> quick<00:03:51.160> modification<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.870> then<00:03:53.590> that'll

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
more quick modification and then that'll

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.559 
more quick modification and then that'll
be<00:03:53.889> it<00:03:53.980> for<00:03:54.190> this<00:03:54.280> week<00:03:54.489> so<00:03:55.000> again<00:03:55.180> here's<00:03:55.420> our

standard stubby variation of the
original<00:03:58.870> smart<00:03:59.470> car<00:03:59.680> by<00:04:00.130> lego<00:04:00.959> let<00:04:01.959> me<00:04:02.049> call

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
original smart car by lego let me call

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.590 
original smart car by lego let me call
it<00:04:02.319> a<00:04:02.380> smart<00:04:02.620> car<00:04:02.799> because<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.130> looks<00:04:03.250> like<00:04:03.370> one

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
it a smart car because it looks like one

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.449 
it a smart car because it looks like one
and<00:04:04.600> then<00:04:05.079> here's<00:04:05.350> another<00:04:05.440> variation<00:04:06.040> that

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
and then here's another variation that

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.750 
and then here's another variation that
we've<00:04:06.639> done<00:04:07.350> this<00:04:08.350> one<00:04:08.560> again<00:04:09.190> very<00:04:09.489> simple

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
we've done this one again very simple

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.990 
we've done this one again very simple
it's<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.870> same<00:04:11.170> front<00:04:11.799> end<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.670> only<00:04:12.819> thing

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
it's the same front end the only thing

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.710 
it's the same front end the only thing
that<00:04:13.359> has<00:04:13.480> changed<00:04:13.510> is<00:04:14.200> instead<00:04:15.069> of<00:04:15.720> this

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
that has changed is instead of this

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.710 
that has changed is instead of this
piece<00:04:16.989> on<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.290> front<00:04:17.790> with<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.820> grill<00:04:19.180> that

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
piece on the front with the grill that

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.000 
piece on the front with the grill that
sits<00:04:19.989> on<00:04:20.109> top<00:04:20.169> of<00:04:20.500> it

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
sits on top of it

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.190 
sits on top of it
we've<00:04:21.400> simply<00:04:21.610> replaced<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:22.450> with<00:04:22.690> these

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
we've simply replaced that with these

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.250 
we've simply replaced that with these
vertical<00:04:23.860> grilles<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:25.510> I<00:04:25.720> think<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:26.020> kind<00:04:26.200> of

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
vertical grilles and I think it kind of

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.230 
vertical grilles and I think it kind of
has<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.440> kind<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.190> French<00:04:27.490> look<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.120> this

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
has a kind of a French look to it this

I think but stuck on the front of the
car<00:04:42.250> they<00:04:43.060> give<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.420> decidedly<00:04:45.480> different

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
car they give it a decidedly different

character and that's it for our smart
card<00:04:50.350> variations<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:53.080> I<00:04:53.350> think<00:04:54.390> he<00:04:55.390> wants<00:04:55.570> his
