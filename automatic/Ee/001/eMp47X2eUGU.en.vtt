Corrado I my first impression is the

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.390 
Corrado I my first impression is the
minute<00:03:40.599> you<00:03:41.200> hold<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.560> reeling<00:03:41.890> hand<00:03:42.190> you

minute you hold the reeling hand you

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.589 
minute you hold the reeling hand you
could<00:03:42.550> hear<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.940> could<00:03:43.120> see<00:03:43.300> a<00:03:43.330> big

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
could hear you could see a big

cranking the handle you could really

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.000 
cranking the handle you could really
feel<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:06.880> X<00:04:07.239> chip<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:08.380> gears<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.920> how

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
feel that X chip and the gears and how

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.500 
feel that X chip and the gears and how
it's<00:04:09.220> smooth<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.700> is<00:04:09.819> I<00:04:11.940> did<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:12.970> little<00:04:13.209> bit<00:04:13.390> of

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
it's smooth it is I did a little bit of

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.690 
it's smooth it is I did a little bit of
research<00:04:13.870> about<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.349> real<00:04:14.500> not<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.190> lot<00:04:15.459> though

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
research about the real not a lot though

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.219

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
so I'm not really familiar and how to
