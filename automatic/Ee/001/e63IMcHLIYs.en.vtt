the<00:04:03.930> Billboard<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.549> these<00:04:05.549> three<00:04:05.760> guys<00:04:05.910> are

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
the Billboard and these three guys are

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.920 
the Billboard and these three guys are
going<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.209> come<00:04:06.299> out<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.569> what<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.750> want<00:04:06.900> to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
going to come out and what you want to

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.479 
going to come out and what you want to
do<00:04:07.049> is<00:04:07.200> start<00:04:07.410> firing<00:04:07.739> on<00:04:08.010> them<00:04:08.099> so<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.310> they

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
do is start firing on them so that they

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.960 
do is start firing on them so that they
don't<00:04:08.580> have<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.819> chance<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.239> split<00:04:09.450> up

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.360 

I<00:04:13.030> think<00:04:13.960> that's<00:04:14.140> all<00:04:14.320> of<00:04:14.350> them<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.800> once

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
I think that's all of them and once

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.100 
I think that's all of them and once
that's<00:04:15.550> done<00:04:15.850> don't<00:04:16.150> reload<00:04:16.480> just<00:04:16.870> jump<00:04:17.049> to

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
that's done don't reload just jump to

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.509 
that's done don't reload just jump to
the<00:04:17.290> side<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.590> press<00:04:17.709> circle<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.190> jump<00:04:18.400> down

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
the side and press circle to jump down

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.490 
the side and press circle to jump down
and<00:04:18.700> come<00:04:18.880> over<00:04:19.030> here<00:04:19.269> so<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:19.870> have<00:04:19.900> cover<00:04:20.260> for

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
and come over here so you have cover for

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.060 
and come over here so you have cover for
the<00:04:20.590> next<00:04:20.829> section

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070
