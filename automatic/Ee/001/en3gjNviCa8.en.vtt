00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
front you got USB firewire so that's our

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.450 
front you got USB firewire so that's our
you<00:00:56.280> got<00:00:56.460> instructions<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.270> huh<00:00:58.109> cool<00:00:58.530> man<00:00:58.739> you

you so I more or less likely will be

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.560 
you so I more or less likely will be
using<00:01:07.250> firewire<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.790> will<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> find

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
using firewire but I will have to find

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.149 
using firewire but I will have to find
out<00:01:09.689> what<00:01:09.840> fire<00:01:10.560> y<00:01:10.740> por<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.890> should
