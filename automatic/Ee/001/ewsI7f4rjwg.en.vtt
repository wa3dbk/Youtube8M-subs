00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.720
 chess game on this occasion os 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.910
 I present a game is a trap that 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.580
 is given in the Budapest gambit in the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.620
 variant Sakharov and voucher and in which they have 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.289
 fallen a lot of players worth 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.090
 you just have to know it to not 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.539
 to fall into it the white ones start from 4 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.480
 horse 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:32.850
 EFE 6 045 raising the aforementioned 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:37.730
 Gambit of poor 5 horse of 4 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.400
 all typical plays of this line to 3 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.700
 of 6 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.700
 and by 6 at the end of 6 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.210
 and here starts back to plot the 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.660
 trap is the trap and whether the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.930
 Blacks play f3 horse which is a 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.270
 natural play of development as g3 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.350
 also to try to develop the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.300
 bishop % ok this trap is produced and it is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.310
 very easy to fall into it because we see that 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.070
 the king fairy because he is not yet 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.550
 developed and here the theory then 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.270
 advises three but it is true that 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.700
 watching the racing wing develop 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.380
 the black one that are already developed and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.030
 ready to castle have two 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.280
 minor pieces in play well it is 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.710
 true that any player then what 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.049
 first thing that comes to mind is horse f3 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.569
 to develop the horse and it seems that 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.420
 nothing happens but this is where the 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:39.270
 white have fallen into the trap and lose 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.179
 Full game because 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.570
 Black sacrifices her horse now 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.450
 they are giving a double to lady and tower and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.429
 if they do not do something then white 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.920
 they lose the tower minimum if the lady 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.860
 remove from here to eat not the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.740
 horse and yes instead they decide 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.469
 eat with the king because although they have fallen 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.610
 they have eaten this horse that 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:11.440
 is super poisoned and just like 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.560
 3 , and finally now the king can not 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.770
 come here I would have to take 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.380
 or come here that would be a gel and if they take 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.260
 well simply the range now we see that 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.810
 the bishop came out with an uncovered 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.640
 Lama giving a check and the lady left 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.290
 without defense with which the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.290
 Black has eaten the lady 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.440
 and wins the good game if you liked 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.110
 This trap is given in the gambit 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.700
 budapest then do I like that I 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.140
 it helps a lot to put it in favorites 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.000
 compare us with your friends 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.040
