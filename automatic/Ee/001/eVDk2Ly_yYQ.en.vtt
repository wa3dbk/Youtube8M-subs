00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.169
 hello hello hello everyone 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.690
 spectacular 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.320
 today, teaching the best trap of 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.320
 sand 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.870
 strauss when I play 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.980
 then the brains use it to catch 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.220
 monster east 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.510
 that is to catch them and not as it seems 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.789
 be medium 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.279
 this trap consists of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.629
 ordinary sand sand from which 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.120
 located next to the water 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.629
 tnt dynamite and we need plates to 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.629
 Pressure 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.860
 what you have to do is 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.210
 I am creative and extra-flat and 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.840
 I think the dreams are a bit 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.840
 strong and 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.680
 when our good 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.570
 if I take you to the base stone then 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.310
 it's easier but if you play 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.020
 if you play in another time in the world 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.950
 obviously you have to make a hole 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.490
 deep and there you will see the size 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.970
 I was the hole in the floor to load 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.970
 the motorcycles 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.650
 all right 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.119
 as I told you this trap is very very 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.119
 good very good 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.299
 and the floor to fall to the void 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.730
 that 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.330
 this trap is great small if then 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.000
 you like it a lot because it works 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.720
 and pay excellent as as after 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.150
 carlos a lot 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.140
 with dynamite 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.140
 you have to put it 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.569
 a picture below him in the second 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.569
 picture 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.810
 place and cover 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.910
 in this trap 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.739
 of the dynamite obviously because it has 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.990
 to be of the dynamite that there is to 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.650
 that the trap works because if I leave 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.050
 If I leave the sand alone, it will fall 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.580
 then now 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.180
 with sand, I 'm going to do this too 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.689
 with serious 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.689
 What is it 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.670
 gravel 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.510
 and exactly the same 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.650
 If the sand I leave here, this is going to 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.569
 fall then it works the same with gravel 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.420
 with sand will work the same 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.730
 we are not with sand like that 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.730
 to the surface with sand 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.440
 running all the dynamite 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.000
 here comes the difficult 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.200
 you have to be careful because you take it 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:13.400
 to press you place 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.400
 pests at pressures 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.140
 the sand 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.030
 for this 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.680
 with plagues aggressions 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.540
 and this is really simple 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.180
 so it does not get dark 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.130
 so super simple you have the 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.230
 In my opinion, my opinion is the best 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:51.400
 trap on the floor for 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.400
 with how it works 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.290
 let's put a villager I do not know 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.130
 First 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.509
 this works like this 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:13.210
 just step on the pressure plate they are going to 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.210
 fall to infinity or at the end of the world 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.050
 because if I leave a villager there 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.550
 he is not going to step on the plate and the plate 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.660
 pressure will activate the dynamite of the 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.660
 dynamite active 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.919
 it does not get together with anything 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.239
 activates the dynamite and is going to fall together 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.610
 with the sand is great this is great 

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:41.730
 It fascinates me is me 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.580
 imagine letting her out of her castle 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.480
 because they are wines to make no no 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.480
 I'm going to approach 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.280
 excellent is also 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.470
 I love this 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.590
 this trap good and that's it 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.390

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.030

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:18.070
 and as always until another video cunt 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.070
 Sooo like your upbringing
