00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
easier to finish this game and it wasn't

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.320 
easier to finish this game and it wasn't
for<00:04:52.120> all<00:04:53.400> but<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.640> definitely<00:04:54.820> something<00:04:55.270> to

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
for all but I definitely something to

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.060 
for all but I definitely something to
look<00:04:55.360> out<00:04:55.510> for<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:56.290> roles<00:04:56.530> are<00:04:56.650> always<00:04:56.890> set

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
look out for the roles are always set

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.410 
look out for the roles are always set
distances<00:04:57.550> so<00:04:57.670> once<00:04:57.850> you<00:04:57.940> realize<00:04:58.210> your

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
distances so once you realize your

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.400 
distances so once you realize your
opponent<00:04:58.780> is<00:04:58.840> rolling<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.110> little<00:04:59.290> bit

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
opponent is rolling a little bit

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.580 
opponent is rolling a little bit
predicting<00:05:00.400> it<00:05:00.930> usually<00:05:01.930> by<00:05:02.050> panicking<00:05:02.440> they

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
predicting it usually by panicking they

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.900 
predicting it usually by panicking they
can't<00:05:02.800> they<00:05:02.950> don't<00:05:03.130> catch<00:05:03.430> up<00:05:03.580> on<00:05:03.670> the<00:05:03.730> fact

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
can't they don't catch up on the fact

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.250 
can't they don't catch up on the fact
that<00:05:04.000> they're<00:05:04.180> prettier<00:05:04.600> predicted<00:05:05.080> they're

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
that they're prettier predicted they're

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.170 
that they're prettier predicted they're
picking<00:05:05.560> you<00:05:05.710> so<00:05:06.370> kind<00:05:06.580> of<00:05:06.640> just<00:05:06.790> feeds<00:05:07.000> into

for a minute how to make your approach
there's<00:05:28.180> certain<00:05:28.390> characters<00:05:28.690> who<00:05:28.780> rushed

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
there's certain characters who rushed

you down like no cheek where we have to

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.940 
you down like no cheek where we have to
think<00:05:30.880> on<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.090> fly<00:05:31.200> but<00:05:32.200> it's<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.770> little

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
think on the fly but it's a little

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.800 
think on the fly but it's a little
that's<00:05:33.550> very<00:05:33.750> straightforward<00:05:34.750> approach

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
that's very straightforward approach

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.750 
that's very straightforward approach
book<00:05:35.230> characters<00:05:35.560> like<00:05:35.680> link<00:05:35.920> there's<00:05:36.550> so

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
book characters like link there's so

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.130 
book characters like link there's so
many<00:05:36.850> different<00:05:37.060> options<00:05:37.270> moving<00:05:37.540> range<00:05:37.990> you

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
many different options moving range you

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.840 
many different options moving range you
can<00:05:38.200> do<00:05:38.350> a<00:05:38.380> bunch<00:05:38.800> of<00:05:38.950> things<00:05:39.160> you<00:05:39.280> compared<00:05:39.760> to

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
can do a bunch of things you compared to

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.940 
can do a bunch of things you compared to
each<00:05:40.000> one<00:05:40.390> as<00:05:40.930> opposed<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.350> just<00:05:41.380> shoot<00:05:41.680> kind

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
each one as opposed to just shoot kind

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.680 
each one as opposed to just shoot kind
of<00:05:42.010> going<00:05:42.190> in<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:42.490> you<00:05:42.730> can<00:05:42.850> break<00:05:43.420> down<00:05:43.450> a

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
of going in and you can break down a

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.990 
of going in and you can break down a
simple<00:05:44.350> character<00:05:44.560> like<00:05:44.770> sheep<00:05:44.980> a<00:05:45.640> little
