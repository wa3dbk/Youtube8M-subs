particularly keen on this shape here but

you're<00:00:30.720> gonna<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> get<00:00:31.199> used<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.590> it

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you're gonna have to get used to it

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.920 
you're gonna have to get used to it
because<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.890> might<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.579> future<00:00:33.390> BMWs

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
because you might see it on future BMWs

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.200 
because you might see it on future BMWs
because<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.399> help<00:00:35.520> airflow

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
because it's actually to help airflow

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.790 
because it's actually to help airflow
through<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.930> front<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> car<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.710> you've

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
through the front of the car so you've

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.830 
through the front of the car so you've
got<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> vent<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.730> air<00:00:38.850> comes<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.300> over

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
got a vent there the air comes in over

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.020 
got a vent there the air comes in over
the<00:00:39.930> wheel<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.440> down<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> sides<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the wheel and down the sides and that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.330 
the wheel and down the sides and that
will<00:00:42.090> help<00:00:42.420> reduce<00:00:42.989> emissions<00:00:43.770> by<00:00:43.829> making<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
will help reduce emissions by making the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
will help reduce emissions by making the
car<00:00:44.550> more<00:00:44.910> slippery<00:00:45.260> also<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:48.200> this

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
car more slippery also at the back this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.670 
car more slippery also at the back this
car<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:50.160> an<00:00:50.399> electronic<00:00:50.910> pop<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.510> spoiler<00:00:52.199> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
car as an electronic pop up spoiler to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.979 
car as an electronic pop up spoiler to
also<00:00:53.010> improve<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> aerodynamics<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:54.570> speed

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
also improve the aerodynamics at speed

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.160 
also improve the aerodynamics at speed
once<00:00:55.500> again<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.070> improve<00:00:56.489> efficiency<00:00:57.170> big

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
once again to improve efficiency big

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.720 
once again to improve efficiency big
thing<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.559> car<00:00:58.770> though<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.129> its<00:00:59.489> size

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
thing about this car though is its size

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.119 
thing about this car though is its size
because<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.600> bigger<00:01:00.989> than<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.680> 3-series

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
because it's bigger than a 3-series

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.170 
because it's bigger than a 3-series
touring<00:01:02.280> inside<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.149> let's<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.690> check<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.989> out

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.850 

now<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.280> come<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.860> you'll

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
now if you just come in here you'll

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.200 
now if you just come in here you'll
probably<00:01:11.010> notice<00:01:11.310> I've<00:01:11.760> got<00:01:12.060> absolutely

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
probably notice I've got absolutely

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.380 
probably notice I've got absolutely
loads<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.290> legroom<00:01:14.190> now<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.850> car<00:01:15.120> you<00:01:15.210> see

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
loads of legroom now this car you see

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.600 
loads of legroom now this car you see
it's<00:01:15.660> about<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.440> much<00:01:16.620> longer<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it's about that much longer in the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.220 
it's about that much longer in the
wheelbase<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.450> you've<00:01:18.660> just<00:01:18.690> got<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.140> much

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
wheelbase and so you've just got so much

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.070 
wheelbase and so you've just got so much
more<00:01:19.290> space<00:01:19.650> back<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.160> and<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.750> roof<00:01:21.930> is

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
more space back here and the roof is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.680 
more space back here and the roof is
pretty<00:01:22.260> high<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:23.490> does<00:01:23.820> feel<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.120> room<00:01:24.510> in

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
pretty high so it does feel more room in

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.060 
pretty high so it does feel more room in
fact<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.140> more<00:01:25.260> room<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:25.680> back<00:01:25.710> here

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
fact it's more room in the back here

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.580 
fact it's more room in the back here
than<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.760> a<00:01:26.880> 5<00:01:27.150> Series<00:01:27.480> they<00:01:28.050> try<00:01:28.230> to<00:01:28.290> make<00:01:28.440> it

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
than in a 5 Series they try to make it

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770 
than in a 5 Series they try to make it
more<00:01:28.710> posh<00:01:29.160> than<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.910> normal<00:01:30.180> 3<00:01:30.390> Series

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
more posh than the normal 3 Series

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.200 
more posh than the normal 3 Series
though<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.170> if<00:01:31.230> you'll<00:01:31.320> notice<00:01:31.530> here<00:01:32.250> we've

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
though and if you'll notice here we've

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.200 
though and if you'll notice here we've
got<00:01:33.360> some<00:01:33.570> frameless<00:01:34.140> doors<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.030> backs

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
got some frameless doors to the backs

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.980 
got some frameless doors to the backs
good<00:01:36.510> let's<00:01:37.290> go<00:01:37.470> check<00:01:37.620> out<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> boot

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.319 

now<00:01:42.990> all<00:01:43.140> grunt<00:01:43.409> or<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.619> mows<00:01:43.850> get<00:01:44.850> electric

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
now all grunt or is mows get electric

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.510 
now all grunt or is mows get electric
tailgates<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.009> good<00:01:47.189> if<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.340> don't

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
tailgates it's not good if you don't

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.219 
tailgates it's not good if you don't
like<00:01:47.670> them<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.569> one<00:01:48.719> actually<00:01:48.810> opens

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
like them but this one actually opens

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
like them but this one actually opens
pretty<00:01:49.439> quickly<00:01:49.679> another<00:01:50.399> feature<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.909> really

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
pretty quickly another feature I really

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.520 
pretty quickly another feature I really
like<00:01:51.359> I<00:01:51.509> was<00:01:51.600> looking<00:01:51.869> about<00:01:52.049> early<00:01:52.380> game

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
like I was looking about early game

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.240 
like I was looking about early game
howdy<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.130> lo<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.520> seats<00:01:53.789> you<00:01:54.090> look<00:01:54.840> here

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
howdy and lo in the seats you look here

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.649 
howdy and lo in the seats you look here
there's<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.340> catch<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:57.319> pop<00:01:58.319> goes<00:01:59.039> down

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
there's your catch there pop goes down
