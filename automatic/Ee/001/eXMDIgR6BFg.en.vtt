the this is a liquid liner but it's not

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.700 
the this is a liquid liner but it's not

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
cheek to stabilize the hand because a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.220 
cheek to stabilize the hand because a
lot<00:00:32.029> of<00:00:32.120> times<00:00:32.330> when<00:00:32.510> you're<00:00:32.630> holding<00:00:32.930> like

making tiny little dashes like little
dash<00:00:45.830> lines<00:00:46.160> and<00:00:46.460> then<00:00:47.059> connecting<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.780> lines

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
dash lines and then connecting the lines

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.759 
dash lines and then connecting the lines
together<00:00:52.480> they<00:00:53.480> love<00:00:53.780> watching<00:00:54.379> anything

together they love watching anything
that's<00:00:55.040> easy<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.670> do<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.449> if<00:00:56.510> I'm<00:00:56.629> creating<00:00:56.989> a

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
that's easy to do so if I'm creating a

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.509 
that's easy to do so if I'm creating a
look<00:00:57.290> that's<00:00:57.409> really<00:00:57.559> difficult<00:00:57.980> or<00:00:58.339> hard

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
look that's really difficult or hard

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.860 
look that's really difficult or hard
they<00:00:58.699> like<00:00:58.850> watching<00:00:59.059> it<00:00:59.420> but<00:00:59.600> they're<00:00:59.720> not

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
they like watching it but they're not

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.329 
they like watching it but they're not
going<00:01:00.050> to<00:01:00.080> do<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.409> but<00:01:00.559> if<00:01:00.739> I'm<00:01:00.860> creating<00:01:01.100> a

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
going to do it but if I'm creating a

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.520 
going to do it but if I'm creating a
look<00:01:01.550> that's<00:01:01.730> really<00:01:01.820> easy<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.720> do<00:01:02.900> whether

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
look that's really easy to do whether

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.070 
look that's really easy to do whether
it's<00:01:03.830> a<00:01:03.949> nail<00:01:04.190> look<00:01:04.430> or<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.670> face<00:01:05.239> look<00:01:05.480> but<00:01:05.900> has

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
it's a nail look or a face look but has

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.960 
it's a nail look or a face look but has
the<00:01:06.290> most<00:01:06.530> impact<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.340> I<00:01:07.370> can't<00:01:07.640> look<00:01:07.790> too

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
the most impact so I can't look too

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.940 
the most impact so I can't look too
simple<00:01:08.300> it<00:01:08.420> has<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.690> have<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.930> most<00:01:09.110> impact<00:01:09.320> it

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
simple it has to have the most impact it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.190

has<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:10.250> look<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.370> most<00:01:10.570> extravagant<00:01:11.570> but<00:01:12.080> in

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
has to look the most extravagant but in

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.710 
has to look the most extravagant but in
a<00:01:12.290> really<00:01:12.560> simple<00:01:12.800> way<00:01:13.250> that<00:01:13.520> gets<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.600> most

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
to diagnose yourself first you have to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.419 
to diagnose yourself first you have to
diagnose<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.049> patient<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.679> figure<00:01:59.310> out

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
diagnose the patient and figure out

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.370 
diagnose the patient and figure out
where<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.819> acne<00:02:00.179> is<00:02:00.390> coming<00:02:00.780> from<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.200> once

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
where the acne is coming from and once

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.169 
where the acne is coming from and once
you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> figure<00:02:01.920> out<00:02:02.039> then<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.000> give<00:02:03.149> a

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
you can figure out then you can give a

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.240 
you can figure out then you can give a
