00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
and one thing I had to try and lower the
short<00:01:36.450> power<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.229> kept<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.650> over

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
short power because it kept going over

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
short power because it kept going over
so<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.240> learn<00:01:39.960> how<00:01:40.020> much<00:01:40.380> sharper

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
so you have to learn how much sharper

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.109 
so you have to learn how much sharper

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
you're gonna put into Schneider shots

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.480 
you're gonna put into Schneider shots

three-star skills guys but one thing's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.889 
three-star skills guys but one thing's
for<00:01:55.890> sure<00:01:56.040> i<00:01:56.520> thought<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> crossing<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.750> this

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
for sure i thought the crossing for this

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.899 
for sure i thought the crossing for this
one<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.560> lot<00:01:58.799> better<00:01:59.009> i<00:01:59.219> mean<00:01:59.490> every

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
one is just a lot better i mean every

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.209 
one is just a lot better i mean every
cross<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.570> was<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> go<00:02:01.140> basically<00:02:02.070> any

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
cross was that was a go basically any

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.190 
cross was that was a go basically any
fuel<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> cross<00:02:02.909> abuse<00:02:03.240> Schneider<00:02:03.899> might

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
fuel up to cross abuse Schneider might

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.510 
fuel up to cross abuse Schneider might
be<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> person<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.130> because<00:02:05.399> his

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
be the person for you because his

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.609 
be the person for you because his
passing<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.000> amazing<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.659> that's<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.560> only

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
passing is amazing and that's the only

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.800 
passing is amazing and that's the only
difference<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.489> fall<00:02:08.700> between<00:02:09.030> him<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
difference I fall between him and the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.449 
difference I fall between him and the
international<00:02:10.349> match<00:02:10.500> was<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.009> there's

international match was and there's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.339 
international match was and there's
another<00:02:11.550> huge<00:02:12.239> difference<00:02:12.720> for<00:02:12.810> everyone

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
another huge difference for everyone

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.700 
another huge difference for everyone
that<00:02:13.500> pay

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
that pay

Ultimate Team guys the International man
the<00:02:16.230> match<00:02:16.350> actually<00:02:16.620> goes<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.250> lot<00:02:17.310> more

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
the match actually goes for a lot more

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.930 
the match actually goes for a lot more
than<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.870> ATM<00:02:19.770> forum<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.340> keep<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.610> in<00:02:20.850> mind

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
than the ATM forum so keep that in mind

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.900 
than the ATM forum so keep that in mind
just<00:02:21.420> because<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.900> color<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.410> orange

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
just because the color is orange

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.130 
just because the color is orange
netherlands<00:02:23.910> wear<00:02:24.210> orange<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.020> is

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
netherlands wear orange so that is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.040 
netherlands wear orange so that is
probably<00:02:25.380> why<00:02:25.740> schneider<00:02:26.600> 87<00:02:27.600> overall

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
probably why schneider 87 overall

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.540 
probably why schneider 87 overall
international<00:02:28.650> man<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.920> match<00:02:29.010> goes<00:02:29.340> for

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
international man of the match goes for

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.150 
international man of the match goes for
a<00:02:29.580> lot<00:02:29.640> more<00:02:30.000> than<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.720> 88<00:02:31.320> inform<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:31.980> keep

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
a lot more than the 88 inform so keep

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.370 
a lot more than the 88 inform so keep
that<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.370> mind<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.820> also<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.420> 88<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:33.960> forum<00:02:34.200> is

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
that in mind and also the 88 in forum is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.920 
that in mind and also the 88 in forum is
still<00:02:34.620> impacts<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.700> third<00:02:36.420> them<00:02:36.600> function

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
still impacts so third them function

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.960 
still impacts so third them function
either<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.200> cheaper<00:02:37.650> better<00:02:38.160> crossing<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
either is cheaper better crossing and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.150 
either is cheaper better crossing and
has<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.540> exact<00:02:39.840> same<00:02:39.930> attributes<00:02:40.620> or<00:02:40.860> just

bet attributes but feels exactly the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.690 
bet attributes but feels exactly the
