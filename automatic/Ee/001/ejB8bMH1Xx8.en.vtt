00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.870 
be windows 8 they now its windows 8 kind
of<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:16.590> it'll<00:00:16.740> be<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.310> kind<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.609> stuff

it's<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.789> kind<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.090> new<00:00:21.240> platform<00:00:21.590> it's

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
it's a kind of a new platform it's

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.769 
it's a kind of a new platform it's
really<00:00:23.130> designed<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.490> tablets<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:24.119> touch<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
really designed for tablets in touch and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.960 
really designed for tablets in touch and
it's<00:00:24.990> kind<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> skin<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.550> top<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.789> it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
it's kind of like the skin on top of it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.580 
it's kind of like the skin on top of it
and<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.570> might<00:00:27.750> remember<00:00:27.869> them<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> past

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and you might remember them in the past

and you might remember them in the past
Microsoft's<00:00:29.160> try<00:00:29.310> doing<00:00:29.460> skins<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.060> this

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
Microsoft's try doing skins like this

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.910 
Microsoft's try doing skins like this
and<00:00:30.330> they<00:00:30.390> kind<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.570> failed<00:00:30.869> at<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
and they kind of failed at it from the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.250 
and they kind of failed at it from the
looks<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.399> new<00:00:32.669> skin<00:00:33.090> sort<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.570> design

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
looks with this new skin sort of design

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.380 
looks with this new skin sort of design
stuff<00:00:34.530> looks<00:00:34.770> pretty<00:00:35.040> good<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.610> kind<00:00:36.360> of

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
stuff looks pretty good it's kind of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.810 
stuff looks pretty good it's kind of
like<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.660> windows<00:00:37.050> phone<00:00:37.079> 7<00:00:37.590> Metro<00:00:38.040> UI<00:00:38.219> kind<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
like a windows phone 7 Metro UI kind of

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.060 
like a windows phone 7 Metro UI kind of
thing<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:39.870> tiles<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> slide<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
thing it's like tiles like it slide and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.709 
thing it's like tiles like it slide and
give<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.460> information<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.300> based<00:00:42.570> on

platform<00:00:50.309> windows<00:00:50.789> 8<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.539> least<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> like

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
platform windows 8 at least for the like

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.979 
platform windows 8 at least for the like
the<00:00:52.260> touch<00:00:52.440> interface<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.539> nice<00:00:54.539> all

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the touch interface it's very nice all

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.840 
the touch interface it's very nice all
optimized<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.530> full<00:00:55.860> screen<00:00:56.039> applications

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
optimized for full screen applications

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.700 
optimized for full screen applications
and<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> stuff<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.989> haven't

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
and all that kind of stuff they haven't

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.860 
and all that kind of stuff they haven't
really<00:00:58.859> been<00:00:58.949> pushing<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.550> that<00:01:00.270> much<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
really been pushing like that much of a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
really been pushing like that much of a
like<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.770> window<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.250> seven<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
like the window is seven in the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.000 
like the window is seven in the
background<00:01:03.300> sort<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.570> stuff<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.680> looks<00:01:04.949> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
background sort of stuff but it looks to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.859 
background sort of stuff but it looks to
be<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.159> basically<00:01:05.850> windows<00:01:06.240> 7<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
be just basically windows 7 with this

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.080 
be just basically windows 7 with this
new<00:01:07.080> sort<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.439> layer<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.799> top<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
new sort of layer on top of it and it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.760 
new sort of layer on top of it and it
probably<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.540> again<00:01:09.930> optimized<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.439> this

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
probably is again optimized for this

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460 
probably is again optimized for this
touch<00:01:11.040> interface<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.990> arm

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
touch interface and it's like like arm

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
touch interface and it's like like arm
CPUs<00:01:13.979> instead<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.400> Intel<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.909> AMD<00:01:14.970> cpus

CPUs instead of like Intel and AMD cpus
which<00:01:15.720> intel<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.650> AMD<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.979> have

which intel and AMD you have

new windows 8 platforms can actually

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.730 
new windows 8 platforms can actually

going to be different it's going to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130 
going to be different it's going to
support<00:01:26.159> arm<00:01:26.490> chips<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> be

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
support arm chips and that's going to be

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.560 
support arm chips and that's going to be

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
taylor to chip could be able to run

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.480 
taylor to chip could be able to run
windows<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.650> new<00:01:37.829> windows<00:01:38.130> 8<00:01:38.250> platform

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
windows on this new windows 8 platform

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.580 
windows on this new windows 8 platform
so<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.600> gonna<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.810> interesting<00:01:39.900> day<00:01:40.409> life

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
so this is gonna be interesting day life

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.469 
so this is gonna be interesting day life
she<00:01:40.740> had<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> done<00:01:41.729> which<00:01:41.970> other<00:01:42.150> companies

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
she had a done which other companies

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.700 
she had a done which other companies
actually<00:01:42.570> had<00:01:42.810> machines<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.439> kind<00:01:43.680> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
actually had machines that are kind of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.080 
actually had machines that are kind of
demoing<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.399> something<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.729> showed<00:01:44.939> off

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
demoing and something that showed off

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
demoing and something that showed off
how<00:01:45.899> Windows<00:01:46.259> 8<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.799> how<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> interface

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
how Windows 8 is and how the interface

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.889 
how Windows 8 is and how the interface
is<00:01:47.340> never<00:01:47.790> looks<00:01:48.149> pretty<00:01:48.540> nice<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.720> an

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
is never looks pretty nice of an

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.539 
is never looks pretty nice of an
interface<00:01:49.290> although<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.040> don't<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.340> like

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
interface although I don't really like

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.130 
interface although I don't really like
how<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.729> multi-tasking<00:01:51.509> works<00:01:51.750> listed<00:01:52.079> in

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
how the multi-tasking works listed in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.810 
how the multi-tasking works listed in
the<00:01:52.229> interface<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:53.189> way<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.640> it's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the interface the way it is it's

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.760 
the interface the way it is it's
basically<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.329> two<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.320> things<00:01:55.470> side<00:01:55.740> by

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
basically like two little things side by

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.560 
basically like two little things side by
side<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.850> they're<00:01:56.969> kind<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> weird

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
side but they're kind of like a weird

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.539 
side but they're kind of like a weird
like<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> menu<00:01:58.439> pane<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.829> an<00:01:58.920> Outlook<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
like a menu pane like an Outlook the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.060 
like a menu pane like an Outlook the
like<00:02:00.149> folders<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.930> view<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:01.920> on

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
like folders here to view and then on

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.380 
like folders here to view and then on
the<00:02:02.130> other<00:02:02.159> side<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> mail<00:02:02.939> that's<00:02:03.240> kind

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the other side like the mail that's kind

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.030 
the other side like the mail that's kind
of<00:02:03.450> how<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.140> set<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.409> place<00:02:04.860> for

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
of how this is set up place for

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.190 
of how this is set up place for
multitasking<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.360> course<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.960> just

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
multitasking but of course you can just

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.680 
multitasking but of course you can just
like<00:02:07.320> minimize<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.160> sort<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.729> tablet<00:02:09.420> touch

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
like minimize this sort of tablet touch

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.750 
like minimize this sort of tablet touch
interface<00:02:10.110> or<00:02:10.319> thing<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.250> leaves<00:02:11.610> me

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
interface or thing and that leaves me

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.020 
interface or thing and that leaves me
I'm<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> Windows<00:02:12.450> 7

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
I'm like a Windows 7

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.270 
I'm like a Windows 7
like<00:02:13.360> an<00:02:13.480> exact<00:02:13.840> copy<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.230> windows7<00:02:14.560> behind<00:02:15.130> it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
like an exact copy of windows7 behind it

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.040 
like an exact copy of windows7 behind it
so<00:02:15.490> it's<00:02:16.209> probably<00:02:16.360> isn't<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.720> big<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.900> an

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
so it's probably isn't that big of an

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.449 
so it's probably isn't that big of an
update<00:02:17.319> for<00:02:17.470> those<00:02:17.650> who<00:02:17.920> are<00:02:18.130> just<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:18.370> their

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
update for those who are just on their

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.860 
update for those who are just on their
desktop<00:02:18.850> computer<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.300> don't<00:02:19.510> really<00:02:19.660> want

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
desktop computer and don't really want

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.120 
desktop computer and don't really want
to<00:02:19.959> like<00:02:20.110> touch<00:02:20.290> me<00:02:20.470> in<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.709> kind<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.920> stuff

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
to like touch me in that kind of stuff

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.100 
to like touch me in that kind of stuff
so<00:02:21.340> I'm<00:02:21.790> not<00:02:21.910> personally<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.420> all<00:02:22.600> excited

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
so I'm not personally like all excited

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.570 
so I'm not personally like all excited
about<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.560> it's<00:02:23.800> kind<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.100> new<00:02:24.310> little

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
about this it's kind of a new little

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.160 
about this it's kind of a new little
thing<00:02:24.819> I'm<00:02:24.970> kind<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.180> looking<00:02:25.360> forward<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:26.050> it

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
thing I'm kind of looking forward to it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.720 
thing I'm kind of looking forward to it
and<00:02:26.230> see<00:02:26.380> how<00:02:26.410> well<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.740> does<00:02:27.010> although<00:02:27.670> i

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
and see how well it does although i

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.180 
and see how well it does although i
think<00:02:27.760> android<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> much<00:02:29.290> better<00:02:29.319> or<00:02:29.800> Iowa

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
think android is a much better or Iowa

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.370 
think android is a much better or Iowa
is<00:02:30.310> much<00:02:30.489> better<00:02:30.730> for<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.690> sort<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.930> tablet

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
is much better for this sort of tablet

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.960 
is much better for this sort of tablet
sort<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.590> stuff<00:02:32.830> since<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:33.250> more<00:02:33.430> optimized

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
sort of stuff since it's more optimized

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.150 
sort of stuff since it's more optimized
since<00:02:34.330> window<00:02:34.660> still<00:02:34.989> is<00:02:35.200> kind<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.010> like<00:02:36.100> a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
since window still is kind of like a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.610 
since window still is kind of like a
resource<00:02:36.550> hog<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.150> still<00:02:37.420> will<00:02:37.720> be<00:02:38.500> using

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
resource hog and it still will be using

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.710 
resource hog and it still will be using
a<00:02:38.709> lot<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.890> resources<00:02:39.190> up<00:02:39.580> as<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.940> runs<00:02:40.120> it

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
a lot of resources up as it runs it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.790 
a lot of resources up as it runs it
probably<00:02:40.989> won't<00:02:41.110> have<00:02:41.200> as<00:02:41.290> good<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.620> battery

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
probably won't have as good of a battery

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.680 
probably won't have as good of a battery
life<00:02:42.160> as<00:02:42.400> like<00:02:42.640> an<00:02:42.730> Android<00:02:43.150> tablet<00:02:43.180> would<00:02:43.630> err

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
life as like an Android tablet would err

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.050 
life as like an Android tablet would err
in<00:02:43.870> iOS<00:02:44.230> how<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.620> would<00:02:44.770> at<00:02:45.489> least<00:02:45.580> compared<00:02:45.940> to

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
in iOS how it would at least compared to

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.460 
in iOS how it would at least compared to
what<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.750> can<00:02:46.810> probably<00:02:46.989> knows<00:02:47.320> it's

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
what you can probably knows it's

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.770 
what you can probably knows it's
probably<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.980> like<00:02:48.330> but<00:02:49.330> would<00:02:49.450> only<00:02:49.630> know

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
probably be like but would only know

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.210 
probably be like but would only know
much<00:02:49.959> more<00:02:49.989> about<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.709> September

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
much more about this in September

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.460 
much more about this in September
