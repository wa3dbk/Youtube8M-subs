00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.680
 Next, I would like to explain the movement of the wrist and elbow. 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.080
 I will go here with a set. 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.070
 The elbow and wrist are a set. 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.280
 Let's stroke the code. 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.659
 For example, the left hand holds the Am (A minor) cord and plays it with a snap. 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.449
 Let's make it Em (E minor). Em (E minor). 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.280
 Bart all strings 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.590
 I will play. 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.380
 It would be like this if you don't have a wrist. 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.149
 Gagagagatsu from the elbow. 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.120
 But I used my wrist well ... just like I said 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.439
 I think I want to produce the maximum swing of the pick with a small movement. 

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:44.489
 I think I understand if you look at it, but 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.500
 Don't you think your pick swing is so big? 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.839
 The pick is big, big and big enough to be above the body of the guitar and below the legs. 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.059
 Is it like this? 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.739
 If the tempo goes up, it will inevitably narrow, but 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.179
 If it is this tempo, it will shake about this. 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:14.970
 ... And, it is an image that I am doing. 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.780
 Just put a mirror in front of you ... put a mirror on your side here ... 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.910
 I would like to play while checking my form, 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.480
 At that time, whether the wrist can be used firmly 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.630
 I think that you would do it while checking. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.530
 The movement of the wrist is very important, and it is like this with quick play 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.710
 Some people will cover with the movement of the wrist, and in cutting something 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.940
 I think that if the wrist doesn't move I don't think a crisp sound will come out, so 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.850
 I think this is where you want to practice the most. 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.460
 Although it is not necessary to be able to play fast, only this wrist movement is 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.560
 It depends on what you want to learn well. 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.180
 It's just a matter of raising and lowering the arms, so 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.159
 I think that there is nothing so difficult. 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.159
 When you hold down the Em (E minor) code 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.560
 Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang and 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.510
 Steep all the strings firmly 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.930
 Please practice to make a loud sound. 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.780
 Like this. 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.370
 Isn't it just like playing strings with power, but an image like playing strings at this speed? 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.480
 If this is strong 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.950
 Because it sounds like a little squeaky sound or the strings are cut out 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.580
 I do not want to do much, but 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.370
 Is it an image that looks like this? 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.170
 If you can pick it by holding it lightly and speeding it up 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.140
 It depends on how good it is. 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.720
 Could you?
