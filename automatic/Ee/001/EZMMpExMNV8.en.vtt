okay<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.319> sting<00:00:01.709> looks<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.129> lot<00:00:02.460> deeper<00:00:02.700> than

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay this sting looks a lot deeper than

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.230 
okay this sting looks a lot deeper than
a<00:00:03.030> quarter-inch<00:00:03.710> so<00:00:04.710> we'll<00:00:05.069> use<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.759> solar<00:00:06.029> as

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
a quarter-inch so we'll use the solar as

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.140 
a quarter-inch so we'll use the solar as
micro<00:00:06.629> white<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.080> add<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> few<00:00:08.429> drops<00:00:08.670> of

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
micro white and add a few drops of

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.089 
micro white and add a few drops of
catalyst<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.990> we'll<00:00:10.349> cover<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> thin

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
catalyst and we'll cover with a thin

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.079 
catalyst and we'll cover with a thin
layer<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.030> solar<00:00:12.330> as<00:00:12.599> fiber-filled<00:00:13.440> putty

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
layer of the solar as fiber-filled putty

layer of the solar as fiber-filled putty
okay<00:00:15.089> well<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> first<00:00:15.420> thing<00:00:15.809> we're<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.170> to

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
okay well the first thing we're going to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.320 
okay well the first thing we're going to
need<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.570> to<00:00:19.010> get<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.330> damaged

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
need to do is to get this damaged

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.630 
need to do is to get this damaged
fiberglass<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.699> hole<00:00:28.640> it's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
fiberglass out of the hole it's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.040 
fiberglass out of the hole it's
important<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> remove<00:00:30.359> all<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.720> damaged

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
important to remove all the damaged

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.659 
important to remove all the damaged
fiberglass<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.040> get<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> good<00:00:32.460> bond

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
fiberglass so you can get a good bond

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:42.530 
fiberglass so you can get a good bond
between<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.239> board<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> rest<00:00:41.239> I'm<00:00:42.239> going

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
between the board and the rest I'm going

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.950 
between the board and the rest I'm going
to<00:00:42.840> stand<00:00:43.590> around<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:45.180> perimeter<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.670 
to stand around the perimeter of the
damaged<00:00:46.440> area<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.430> when<00:00:47.610> your<00:00:47.789> excess

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
damaged area so that when your excess

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.310 
damaged area so that when your excess
will<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.980> something<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.550> stick<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.750 

imagine<00:00:55.320> how<00:00:55.530> much<00:00:55.710> volume<00:00:56.039> you've<00:00:56.399> got<00:00:56.579> in

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
imagine how much volume you've got in

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.189 
imagine how much volume you've got in
the<00:00:56.850> ding<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.300> that's<00:00:57.480> how<00:00:57.629> much<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.899> want<00:00:58.109> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the ding and that's how much you want to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.319 
the ding and that's how much you want to
use<00:00:58.230> save<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> rest<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.250> later<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> top

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
use save the rest for later at the top

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
use save the rest for later at the top
back<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:01.399> um<00:01:03.049> just<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.260> bit<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.739> catalyst

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
back on um just a little bit of catalyst

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.840 
back on um just a little bit of catalyst
and<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:06.210> stir<00:01:06.600> stick<00:01:06.990> she<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.100> take<00:01:08.280> too<00:01:08.610> much

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and a stir stick she can take too much

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.870 
and a stir stick she can take too much
all<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:10.170> need<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.439> add<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.310> few<00:01:11.610> drops

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
all you need to add is just a few drops

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.380 
all you need to add is just a few drops
to<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.630> Samaritan<00:01:13.790> because<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> Sun<00:01:15.210> will

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
to the Samaritan because the Sun will

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.929 
to the Samaritan because the Sun will
still<00:01:15.659> activate<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.830> catalyst<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.640> just

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
still activate this the catalyst is just

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570 
still activate this the catalyst is just
an<00:01:18.090> accelerant<00:01:18.860> anything<00:01:19.860> deeper<00:01:20.220> than<00:01:20.369> about

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
an accelerant anything deeper than about

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.310 
an accelerant anything deeper than about
a<00:01:20.640> quarter<00:01:21.119> inch<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.479> either<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
a quarter inch you either have to do it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.190 
a quarter inch you either have to do it
in<00:01:22.439> layers<00:01:22.680> or<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.270> mix<00:01:24.450> callous<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.080> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
in layers or you can mix callous with it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.160 
in layers or you can mix callous with it
and<00:01:25.380> repair<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:26.700> once<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:28.020> go

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and repair it all at once you can go

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
and repair it all at once you can go
right<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> edge<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.100> where<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.400> cut<00:01:29.670> with

right to the edge of where you cut with

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.510 
right to the edge of where you cut with
the<00:01:29.970> razor<00:01:30.210> blade<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.130> you're<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the razor blade you know you're going to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
the razor blade you know you're going to
take<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.820> out<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> Sun<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.990> sand<00:01:34.500> off<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
take this out in the Sun and sand off a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.960 
take this out in the Sun and sand off a
little<00:01:35.310> bit<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.610> excess<00:01:37.220> now<00:01:38.220> we'll<00:01:38.490> put<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.880> in

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
little bit of excess now we'll put it in

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.510 
little bit of excess now we'll put it in
the<00:01:39.119> Sun<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.750> about<00:01:39.799> three<00:01:40.799> minutes<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.310> so

the Sun for about three minutes or so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.630 
the Sun for about three minutes or so
and<00:01:41.820> that'll<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> trick

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.870 

okay<00:01:48.300> there<00:01:49.050> it<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.290> three<00:01:50.190> minutes<00:01:50.400> in<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
okay there it is three minutes in the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.960 
okay there it is three minutes in the
Sun<00:01:51.380> now<00:01:52.380> I'll<00:01:52.620> stand<00:01:52.920> this

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
Sun now I'll stand this

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.450 
Sun now I'll stand this
ding<00:01:54.390> flat<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.500> apply<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.830> thin<00:01:56.190> coat

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
ding flat and then apply the thin coat

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:08.960 
ding flat and then apply the thin coat
of<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.000> Solarize<00:01:57.480> fiberfill<00:02:07.550> you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.729> use<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
of the Solarize fiberfill you can use a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.660 
of the Solarize fiberfill you can use a
fine<00:02:09.690> sandpaper<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.500> remove<00:02:10.530> any<00:02:11.130> excess

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
fine sandpaper to remove any excess

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.020 
fine sandpaper to remove any excess
resin<00:02:12.150> now<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.960> is<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> bubble<00:02:13.530> free<00:02:14.010> resin<00:02:14.490> it

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
resin now this is a bubble free resin it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.500
