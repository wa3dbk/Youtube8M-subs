steel<00:00:20.880> structure<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.630> identical<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
steel structure is identical what is

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.080 
steel structure is identical what is
different<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.189> some<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.520> venues<00:00:23.880> the

offerings for our guests the decor will

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.950 
offerings for our guests the decor will
change<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.910> she'll<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.270> different<00:00:27.630> ship<00:00:27.810> in

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
change so she'll be a different ship in

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.020 
change so she'll be a different ship in
that<00:00:28.080> regard<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.860> feel<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.250> five

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
that regard it's not feel like five

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.640 
that regard it's not feel like five
millimeters<00:00:30.210> longer<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.790> heard<00:00:32.790> about<00:00:32.879> this<00:00:33.180> I

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
millimeters longer I heard about this I

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.979 
millimeters longer I heard about this I
heard<00:00:34.650> about<00:00:34.830> him<00:00:35.100> saying<00:00:35.460> no<00:00:35.750> allure<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.780> the

that but I think I got some guys working
on<00:00:43.500> making<00:00:43.860> oasis<00:00:44.340> about<00:00:44.610> two<00:00:45.180> meters<00:00:45.510> long

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
on making oasis about two meters long

on making oasis about two meters long
it<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.110> five<00:00:46.350> millimeters<00:00:46.530> longer<00:00:46.949> and<00:00:47.190> that's

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
it is five millimeters longer and that's

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.079 
it is five millimeters longer and that's
enough<00:00:47.580> for<00:00:47.729> me<00:00:47.790> at<00:00:47.970> this<00:00:48.030> time<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.940> would

door right to the bridge we spent time
on<00:01:19.219> board<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:19.610> that's<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.000> best<00:01:20.179> way<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:20.329> learn

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
on board is that's the best way to learn

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.149 
on board is that's the best way to learn
it<00:01:20.810> also<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.200> also<00:01:21.289> I've<00:01:21.500> been<00:01:21.530> three<00:01:21.979> weeks

it also and also I've been three weeks
we've<00:01:22.369> been<00:01:22.640> given<00:01:23.630> in<00:01:23.719> angular<00:01:24.020> flea<00:01:24.200> races

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
we've been given in angular flea races

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.889 
we've been given in angular flea races
and<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.850> gave<00:01:26.060> me<00:01:26.179> a<00:01:26.210> lot<00:01:26.299> of<00:01:26.329> insight<00:01:26.689> of<00:01:26.840> the

and that gave me a lot of insight of the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.779 
and that gave me a lot of insight of the
Sheep<00:01:27.140> absolutely<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:27.920> it's<00:01:28.039> our<00:01:28.220> goal<00:01:28.460> that

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
Sheep absolutely and it's our goal that

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.999 
Sheep absolutely and it's our goal that
the<00:01:29.509> lure<00:01:29.750> disease<00:01:30.079> will<00:01:30.319> have<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.500> head<00:01:30.979> start

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
the lure disease will have a head start

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.380 
the lure disease will have a head start
and<00:01:31.399> what<00:01:31.520> we<00:01:31.610> had<00:01:31.729> on<00:01:31.819> the<00:01:31.909> ways<00:01:32.030> of

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
and what we had on the ways of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.760 
and what we had on the ways of
benefiting<00:01:33.049> from<00:01:33.170> all<00:01:33.319> the<00:01:33.500> learning

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
benefiting from all the learning

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.620 
benefiting from all the learning
experience<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:35.000> we've<00:01:35.090> had<00:01:35.119> now<00:01:35.450> with

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
experience that we've had now with

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.389 
experience that we've had now with
almost<00:01:36.079> a<00:01:36.229> year<00:01:36.439> in<00:01:36.469> operation<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.219> elation

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
almost a year in operation the elation

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.370 
almost a year in operation the elation
to<00:01:37.610> disease<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.600> all<00:01:38.719> that<00:01:38.929> knowledge<00:01:39.140> has

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
to disease so all that knowledge has

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.809 
to disease so all that knowledge has
been<00:01:39.530> transferred<00:01:40.039> over<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:40.429> that's<00:01:40.579> going

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
been transferred over and that's going

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.580 
been transferred over and that's going
to<00:01:41.030> give<00:01:41.149> them<00:01:41.329> a<00:01:41.360> nice<00:01:41.659> head<00:01:41.899> start<00:01:42.200> over<00:01:42.350> what

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
to give them a nice head start over what

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.499 
to give them a nice head start over what
we<00:01:42.710> have<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.219> so<00:01:43.789> with<00:01:43.970> that's<00:01:44.149> just<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.390> way

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
we have so so with that's just the way

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.490 
we have so so with that's just the way
it<00:01:44.569> should<00:01:44.630> be<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.020> we<00:01:45.080> think<00:01:45.259> it's<00:01:45.349> a<00:01:45.409> good

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
it should be and we think it's a good

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.199 
it should be and we think it's a good
good<00:01:45.770> process<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:46.549> this<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.729> going<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.060> be

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
good process and this is going to be

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.380 
good process and this is going to be
unfortunately<00:01:47.720> my<00:01:48.259> last<00:01:48.679> Captain's<00:01:49.369> Log<00:01:49.459> it

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
all started a little bit under a year

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.359 
all started a little bit under a year
ago<00:01:53.509> when<00:01:53.780> we<00:01:53.959> did<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.349> captain's<00:01:54.709> logs<00:01:54.950> every

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
ago when we did the captain's logs every

the entire transit support Everglades
and<00:01:58.819> it<00:01:59.750> seems<00:01:59.959> hard<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.259> imagine<00:02:00.649> that<00:02:00.979> so

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
and it seems hard to imagine that so

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.729

much<00:02:01.250> time<00:02:01.459> has<00:02:01.640> gone<00:02:01.670> by<00:02:01.849> so<00:02:02.840> quickly<00:02:03.049> but
