00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello that such a greeting to all the people 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.339
 from youtube my name is omar castaÃ±eda and 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.670
 today I bring you a video 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.090
 exclusive I want to start doing it 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.670
 a question of chance you have felt 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.460
 your internet slower after having 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.529
 updated to windows 10 if the answer 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.779
 yes I want to mention you're going to 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.130
 stay with your mouth open with what you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.340
 I have to say today 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.560
 did you know that microsoft is using your 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.890
 bandwidth in a few words you 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.890
 internet to bring updates to 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 other people in your area so good if 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.800
 you want to know what it is about 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:46.730
 then I present it to you well then 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.870
 this is called windows update delivery 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.570
 optimization this is a new option 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.090
 that Microsoft has placed on windows 10 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.520
 which works very similar to those 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.379
 programs known as opening but 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.109
 are those programs where we downloaded 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.300
 music you down the song and then 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.610
 you send that song to another person 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.659
 who requested it and so on 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.149
 makes a chain 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.640
 the world sharing is so good of 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.179
 that is what this option is your computer 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.939
 is part of that network where if you 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.890
 you update something this update is the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.170
 I could share someone else 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.240
 I still have not received it from that 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.280
 way this person would receive the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.859
 faster update without waiting for 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.590
 that microsoft will send it to you 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.270
 now this may sound fantastic but 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.700
 unfortunately, it hurts us 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.349
 because when using the bandwidth of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.599
 our computer then basically 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:42.329
 our internet would be made completely 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:44.189
 slow imagine if you already had 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.929
 there by chance your slow internet 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.959
 now with this option on it is going to 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.479
 feel worse now the best of everything and the 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.629
 good news is that you can get out 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.060
 of this program or maybe turn this 

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:59.129
 option so that obviously everything comes back 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.349
 to normality in what way we're going to 

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:04.409
 do well then if we come to 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:07.109
 start and from this side we enter the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.030
 adjustments or settings here in the 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.519
 bottom part let's find the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.890
 icon of updates and also of 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.110
 security when we enter 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.480
 to this section within windows update 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.670
 let's find this button that says 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.580
 advanced options if we 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.950
 we enter this section it is possible that 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.170
 everything we see perfectly well more 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.690
 however , we do not take for granted 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.030
 many times here is this 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.130
 option that we can modify if 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.690
 you read what he says here has to do 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.330
 with the option that I'm talking to you 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.910
 we give a click we enter this next 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.400
 section and from this side we're going to 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.500
 find that that functionality in 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.690
 this moment is on 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.670
 when we have it on that 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.340
 is what is happening with this 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.989
 option selected so good that of 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.000
 the updates as I told you 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.570
 from the beginning it 's being 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.750
 shared to computers in my network but 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.750
 also to computers on the internet this 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.820
 basically it would be the consequence of 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.250
 because your internet is slow and 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.100
 basically with this option off 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.560
 You could solve it immediately 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.660
 now you can decide to leave this 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.370
 option on but my recommendation 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.040
 it would be that maybe only 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.810
 this will work with computers that 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.730
 were connected within your network 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.739
 in your house so that in this way 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.750
 obviously everyone would get the 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.390
 faster updates sharing 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.879
 to each other but with your family 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.760
 or with those computers that are 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.470
 only within your network if you leave 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.670
 this option on, well, you already 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.260
 I mentioned that they are also going to 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.390
 share other people and that's 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.220
 exactly what we do not want then 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.500
 my recommendation is that if you leave it 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.780
 turned on that this works nothing more 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.959
 for computers within your signal of 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.060
 Internet at home or in your local network and 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.400
 basically that would be all if you so 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.260
 otherwise you pay for it, well, you avoid 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.910
 also the sharing to computers of 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.340
 local way in your house and in that way 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.530
 Well, your internet would feel much better 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.840
 and well basically with this 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.129
 we would have solved the problem 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.569
 principal 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.480
 but I want to follow so 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.000
 optional also share you another way 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.239
 to speed up the internet by means of 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.070
 use the google public dns not 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.340
 I want to go into detail with this from 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.740
 dns because it would be a pretty broad topic 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.440
 I only want 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.660
 that some internet companies 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.789
 suddenly they prohibit you from entering certain 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.800
 pages and in the same way your internet is 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.870
 It may feel slower when you 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.389
 you use google public dns 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.470
 practically you are not blocked by 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.319
 no one 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.479
 you have the signal open to 100% and for 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:49.990
 consequence your internet and your navigation 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.970
 is going to feel 100% better at how 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.280
 you had now as we can 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.470
 change this information here 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.449
 find the numbers we need 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.639
 place in the configurations of 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.650
 our internet signal is very easy 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.690
 if you come to your taskbar and 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.150
 this side where you see that computer 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.830
 Little girl that tells you that you are 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.979
 connected to the internet you give button 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.530
 right and you enter what is the center 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.240
 to share and the network is going to 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.099
 open a window like this I want to 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.810
 to mention that here you do not see it in my 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.539
 computer because what are you seeing 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.310
 on screen is a secondary monitor that 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.599
 I have and this option down here 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.520
 well I have it in the primary 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.139
 when you open this window that 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.870
 same way you can get by means of 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.160
 control panel network and internet and 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.350
 also being in center 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.300
 the network you will find your connection to 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.070
 internet where are you at this moment 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.290
 connected can be a signal 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.880
 wireless and so on the point is that 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.800
 locate is the signal where you are 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.990
 connected and you click on this 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.390
 link here opens this next 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.860
 window you enter the properties and from 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.460
 this side you will search online 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.410
 protocol number 4 we give you a click 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.380
 we come to the properties and here is 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.660
 where are you going to place the public dns of 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.670
 google writes them exactly like the 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.250
 I have here on screen make sure 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.440
 have this option selected that says 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.450
 only use the dns that you 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.880
 are you putting on this list and once 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.580
 that you make the changes you can give him ok and 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.880
 automatically that change would have already 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.650
 taken effect in some cases perhaps 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.690
 it is convenient to restart your 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.490
 computer but as soon as you 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.320
 you will learn and you will start to navigate 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.450
 obviously the internet and you will feel 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.400
 a big difference then as 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.530
 conclusion turning off the first option 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.980
 what did I mention about windows 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.680
 update delivery optimization and placing 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.660
 the google public dns you go to 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.610
 notice 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.950
 the difference is but it really is 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.410
 information has been very useful let him 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.940
 I like this video and share it in 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.880
 social networks with your friends 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.560
 and also leave me your comment 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.750
 answering yes when update to 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.150
 windows 10 you felt the internet more 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.110
 slow I would like to know that I say goodbye 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.360
 today my name is omar 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.360
 castaÃ±eda and see you in the next
