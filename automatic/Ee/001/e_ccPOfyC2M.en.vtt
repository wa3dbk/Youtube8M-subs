00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
something but I normally just write

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.470 
something but I normally just write
everything<00:01:54.470> down<00:01:54.620> so<00:01:54.830> that's<00:01:55.610> how<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:55.820> study<00:01:56.240> oh

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.300 
everything down so that's how I study oh
yeah<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.440> book<00:01:57.650> it's<00:01:57.920> kind<00:01:58.160> of<00:01:58.190> a

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
yeah this is the book it's kind of a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.850 
yeah this is the book it's kind of a
scary<00:01:58.550> cover<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.060> be<00:01:59.180> honest<00:01:59.480> but<00:01:59.750> it<00:02:00.740> was

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
scary cover to be honest but it was

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.620 
scary cover to be honest but it was
really<00:02:01.070> really<00:02:01.400> inexpensive<00:02:01.700> because<00:02:02.480> it's

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
really really inexpensive because it's

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.110 
really really inexpensive because it's
girls<00:02:02.900> sold<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.410> me<00:02:03.530> it<00:02:03.650> was<00:02:03.740> $20<00:02:04.400> but

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
girls sold it to me it was $20 but

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.670 
girls sold it to me it was $20 but
college<00:02:05.450> workers<00:02:05.750> could<00:02:05.960> be<00:02:05.990> very<00:02:06.470> very

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
college workers could be very very

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.190 
college workers could be very very
expensive<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.640> what<00:02:07.850> what<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.300> normally<00:02:08.450> do<00:02:08.960> is

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
expensive so what what I normally do is

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.590 
expensive so what what I normally do is
I<00:02:09.350> read<00:02:09.590> them<00:02:09.800> I'll<00:02:10.009> wait<00:02:10.280> down<00:02:10.490> on<00:02:10.759> like<00:02:11.360> the
