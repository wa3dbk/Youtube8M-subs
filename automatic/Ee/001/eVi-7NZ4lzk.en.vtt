00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.480
 the fd to the government agency of the usa 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.879
 responsible for the regulation of 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.830
 food finally admits that the meat 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.380
 of chicken contains arsenic that causes 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.269
 cancer in the usa after years of 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.940
 hide the problem and wait 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.710
 nobody would notice the fd has admitted 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.070
 finally that the chicken meat that is 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.410
 sells in the usa contains arsenic a 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.779
 toxic chemical that causes cancer and that is 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.460
 deadly in high doses but the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.439
 true story wherever it is 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.509
 arsenic comes is added to the 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.270
 feeding the hens on purpose 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.340
 even worse the sda says that his own 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.410
 research shows that arsenic 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.120
 added to the feeding of the chickens 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.579
 ends in the chicken meat that 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.829
 consumed by humans so 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.960
 during the last 60 years the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.550
 American consumers who eat 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.100
 conventional chicken have been 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.559
 consuming arsenic a chemical acquaintance 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.899
 carcinogenic until this new study 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.850
 both the poultry industry and the sda 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.730
 denied that the arsenic they gave to 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.469
 chickens will end up in their meat the excuse 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.990
 is that we have all been fed 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.310
 for 60 years and that arsenic is 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.500
 excreta in the stool 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.450
 there is no scientific basis to do such 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.610
 affirmation is simply what the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.189
 poultry industry wanted everyone to believe 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.630
 now the evidence is so undeniable that 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.490
 the product manufacturer of 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.500
 chicken feed known as 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.420
 rockstar zone has decided to withdraw the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.700
 product shelves 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.890
 curiously the manufacturer that has been 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.990
 putting arsenic in the feed of 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.820
 the chickens of all these years is fisher 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.829
 the same company that makes the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.159
 vaccines that contain adjuvants 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.689
 chemicals that are injected into children 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.670
 technically the society that performs the 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.009
 feeding the rockstar chickens are 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.069
 is a fisher subsidiary called the 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.289
 parma llc although the parma has agreed 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.899
 take out this toxic dosing of the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.299
 shelves in the usa that says it's not 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.580
 it will necessarily eliminate it from products 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.349
 of food in other countries unless 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.560
 that is required by the regulators 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.599
 to do it according to informs scott brown 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.429
 from the division of medicine development 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.140
 veterinary research and 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.239
 pfizer animal health said that the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.759
 company also sells the ingredient of 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.560
 a dozen other countries said that 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.790
 pfizer is trying to reach the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.890
 regulated authorities 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.260
 hours in those countries and decide if 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.359
 they sell individually but still 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.760
 When your product contains arsenic it 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:25.189
 pull the shelves the sda ​​continues its 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.290
 Denial campaign alleging arsenic 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.150
 in chickens is at a level 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.060
 so low that it's still safe to eat 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.280
 this is still as the arsenic effect says 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.980
 It is a carcinogen which means that 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.840
 cancer risk increases the council 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.760
 National Chicken agrees with 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.530
 the fp in a statement issued in 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.359
 response to the news that rockstar

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.920
 food pointed the chicken is safe 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.930
 to eat even when he admitted the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.000
 Arsenic is used in many batches 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.329
 bred and sold as chicken meat 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.819
 in the usa the amazing thing about all this is 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.709
 that the fd informs consumers of 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.989
 which is safe to eat carcinogen 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.689
 arsenic but it is dangerous to drink juice 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.970
 the fence of elderberry the fd has made 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.129
 recently an armed incursion into a 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.349
