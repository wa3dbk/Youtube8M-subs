00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
oh it's like the first one is for a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:14.460

moment

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.140 

apparently<00:02:15.470> there<00:02:15.710> are<00:02:15.740> few<00:02:16.070> types<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.670> boxes

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
apparently there are few types of boxes

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.180 
apparently there are few types of boxes
which<00:02:17.180> behave<00:02:17.810> differently<00:02:18.410> when<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.770> push

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
which behave differently when I push

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.030 
which behave differently when I push
them<00:02:19.430> by<00:02:20.180> Prussia<00:02:20.570> box<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.350> changes<00:02:21.800> its

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
them by Prussia box and it changes its

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.360 
them by Prussia box and it changes its
position<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.820> say<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.540> box<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:24.050> movable<00:02:24.620> it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
position I say the box is movable it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.760 
position I say the box is movable it
remains<00:02:25.760> at<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.150> same<00:02:26.390> location<00:02:26.720> as<00:02:27.320> I<00:02:27.470> try<00:02:27.740> to

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
remains at the same location as I try to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.270 
remains at the same location as I try to
push<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.670> say<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.360> box<00:02:29.570> is<00:02:29.870> not<00:02:30.050> movable<00:02:30.530> and

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
push it I say the box is not movable and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.310 
push it I say the box is not movable and
far<00:02:31.640> that's<00:02:31.940> all<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.240> could<00:02:32.450> learn<00:02:32.840> about<00:02:33.080> these

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
far that's all I could learn about these

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.580 
far that's all I could learn about these
boxes<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.180> cannot<00:02:35.180> say<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.660> which<00:02:35.870> tie<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.200> box

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
boxes I cannot say of which tie the box

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.330 
boxes I cannot say of which tie the box
is<00:02:36.890> unless<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.520> tried<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:38.060> brush<00:02:38.270> it
