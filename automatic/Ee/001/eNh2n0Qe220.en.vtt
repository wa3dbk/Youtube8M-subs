like what was removed what was added

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
like what was removed what was added
even<00:01:20.580> though<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.790> knew<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.659> something<00:01:21.869> was

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
even though I knew that something was

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.969

good job with that now as I said this
movie<00:03:27.639> is<00:03:27.729> not<00:03:27.849> perfect<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.329> does<00:03:28.479> have<00:03:28.659> flaws

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
movie is not perfect it does have flaws

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.270 
movie is not perfect it does have flaws
there<00:03:29.229> are<00:03:29.349> certain<00:03:29.650> things<00:03:29.680> in<00:03:29.949> this<00:03:30.040> movie

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
there are certain things in this movie

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.349 
there are certain things in this movie
that<00:03:30.400> definitely<00:03:30.669> could<00:03:30.790> have<00:03:30.819> been<00:03:30.909> cut<00:03:31.150> out

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
that definitely could have been cut out

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.849 
that definitely could have been cut out
it<00:03:31.599> feels<00:03:31.840> like<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.199> movie<00:03:32.379> is<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.500> little<00:03:32.769> too

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
it feels like the movie is a little too

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.469 
it feels like the movie is a little too
long<00:03:33.129> and<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.459> don't<00:03:33.519> mean<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:33.970> got<00:03:34.120> boring

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:34.479 
long and I don't mean that it got boring

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.330 
long and I don't mean that it got boring
I<00:03:34.720> just<00:03:34.870> feel<00:03:35.019> like<00:03:35.109> there<00:03:35.290> was<00:03:35.379> just<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:36.010> lot<00:03:36.310> of

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
I just feel like there was just a lot of

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.309 
I just feel like there was just a lot of
stuff<00:03:36.729> in<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.090> know<00:03:37.329> it<00:03:37.599> seems<00:03:38.109> like<00:03:38.139> it

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
stuff in it you know it seems like it

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.659 
stuff in it you know it seems like it
could<00:03:38.409> have<00:03:38.500> been<00:03:38.590> cut<00:03:38.889> down<00:03:38.919> a<00:03:39.069> little<00:03:39.340> bit<00:03:39.549> to

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
could have been cut down a little bit to

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.969 
could have been cut down a little bit to
condense<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.359> overall<00:03:40.750> product<00:03:41.229> into<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> more

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:41.979 
condense the overall product into a more

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.849 
condense the overall product into a more
fluid<00:03:42.849> picture<00:03:43.269> tonally<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.260> movie<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.829> a

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
fluid picture tonally the movie is a

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.979 
fluid picture tonally the movie is a
little<00:03:45.400> inconsistent<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.299> think<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.690> might

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
little inconsistent I think that might

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.420 
little inconsistent I think that might
be<00:03:47.019> my<00:03:47.260> biggest<00:03:47.470> problem<00:03:47.889> with<00:03:47.949> this<00:03:48.099> movie

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
be my biggest problem with this movie

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.000 
be my biggest problem with this movie
certain<00:03:48.909> scenes<00:03:49.180> are<00:03:49.449> so<00:03:49.870> intense<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.859> you're

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
certain scenes are so intense and you're

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.399 
certain scenes are so intense and you're
like<00:03:51.190> wow<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.909> was<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.209> fantastic<00:03:52.659> and

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
like wow that was just fantastic and

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.390 
like wow that was just fantastic and
then<00:03:53.500> all<00:03:53.560> of<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.650> sudden<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.949> has<00:03:54.040> this<00:03:54.190> really

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
then all of a sudden it has this really

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.610 
then all of a sudden it has this really
light<00:03:54.699> comedy<00:03:55.239> aura<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.109> as<00:03:56.229> well<00:03:56.379> I<00:03:56.409> think

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
light comedy aura to it as well I think

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.050 
light comedy aura to it as well I think
a<00:03:56.829> lot<00:03:56.949> of<00:03:56.979> that<00:03:57.099> comes<00:03:57.340> from<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.609> director

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
a lot of that comes from the director

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.210 
a lot of that comes from the director
having<00:03:58.569> made<00:03:58.870> two<00:03:59.139> comedies<00:03:59.859> in<00:03:59.949> the<00:04:00.010> past

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
having made two comedies in the past

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.469 
having made two comedies in the past
even<00:04:00.430> though<00:04:00.549> Zombieland<00:04:01.060> definitely<00:04:01.359> had<00:04:01.449> a

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
even though Zombieland definitely had a

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.270 
even though Zombieland definitely had a
lot<00:04:01.599> of<00:04:01.659> action<00:04:01.900> as<00:04:02.319> well<00:04:02.590> some<00:04:03.010> people<00:04:03.129> have

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
lot of action as well some people have

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.460 
lot of action as well some people have
said<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.639> movie<00:04:03.849> is<00:04:03.970> preposterous<00:04:04.510> but<00:04:05.169> I

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
said the movie is preposterous but I

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.500 
said the movie is preposterous but I
would<00:04:05.889> agree<00:04:06.159> with<00:04:06.400> them<00:04:06.579> if<00:04:06.790> this<00:04:07.060> movie<00:04:07.389> was

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
would agree with them if this movie was

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.449 
would agree with them if this movie was
trying<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:08.019> be<00:04:08.139> 100<00:04:08.530> percent<00:04:08.560> serious<00:04:09.189> but<00:04:09.400> I

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
trying to be 100 percent serious but I

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.550 
trying to be 100 percent serious but I
can<00:04:09.639> tell<00:04:09.819> it's<00:04:10.030> not<00:04:10.299> overly<00:04:10.870> glamorized

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
can tell it's not overly glamorized

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.379 
can tell it's not overly glamorized
Hollywood<00:04:12.129> where<00:04:12.340> everything<00:04:12.699> just<00:04:12.849> happens

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
Hollywood where everything just happens

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.210 
Hollywood where everything just happens
this<00:04:13.569> way<00:04:13.750> there's<00:04:13.989> big<00:04:14.169> shootouts<00:04:14.680> big

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
this way there's big shootouts big

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.129 
this way there's big shootouts big
fights<00:04:15.639> and<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.030> know<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.180> lot<00:04:16.419> of<00:04:16.479> his<00:04:16.599> cliched

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
fights and you know a lot of his cliched

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.779 
fights and you know a lot of his cliched
but<00:04:17.409> the<00:04:17.560> movie<00:04:17.769> definitely<00:04:18.130> has<00:04:18.280> problems

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
but the movie definitely has problems

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.149 
but the movie definitely has problems
but<00:04:19.030> overall<00:04:19.539> it's<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.930> well<00:04:20.169> acted<00:04:20.799> fun

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
but overall it's a well acted fun

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.850 
but overall it's a well acted fun

in the film for sure I just wish that

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.850 
in the film for sure I just wish that
the<00:04:26.020> tone<00:04:26.260> is<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.469> little<00:04:26.650> more

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
the tone is a little more

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.409 
the tone is a little more
consistent<00:04:27.400> but<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.550> still<00:04:27.849> really<00:04:28.090> enjoyed
