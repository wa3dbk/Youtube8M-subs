00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.500
 wheel 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.019
 they are also sorry to throw away the more expensive plants every spring 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.079
 did not survive the winter 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.529
 He just does not like their potted plants safe and easy too 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.720
 overwinter 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.679
 the Fiorino is the patented solution 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.979
 so the overwintering of their valuable potted plants to 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:31.829
 child's play 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.289
 We now want to show him how to put their potted plants out with little effort 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:37.510
 can overwinter 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.740
 they save themselves a lot of work with the Florino Bergeron effort 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.110
 First, look for the spot where Florino stands over the winter 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.280
 should it be then still a socket in the vicinity around the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.370
 To supply frost guard with electricity 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.549
 after they have unpacked the Florine 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.119
 Check best whether equal also all items are present 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.960
 That's what they see twelve of the same is so taught aluminum rods a star 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.360
 avoided it with the piece 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.380
 then there are six feet to shoot the aluminum bars 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.770
 24 lock screws 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.470
 with wings nut and so stable attachment 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.930
 is a double layer and therefore is the Florine top 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 is there still there 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.420
 a black floor mat and matching insulated elements 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.400
 To build, connect the first six poles with the help of the show 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.030
 screw 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.250
 with the middle piece 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.840
 They do not need tools for this because the wing nuts can make them comfortable 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.030
 tighten by hand 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.640
 in the next step they connect with the lap screws the next six 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.270
 rods 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.330
 with the previously bolted stand 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.160
 if they turn the screwed-up biggest one upside down this is what it's all about 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.170
 very easily 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.280
 the Eglofser greeted me for the Florino and that's it 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.670
 Now unfold the top of the Florino docked location 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.880
 It is best to open one of the two choirs to encode ice cream 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.950
 the Turin top greets the project 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.950
 the best and fastest is when they are with each other 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.860
 where the shell 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.899
 has a black centered pin made of plastic in the middle 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.299
 when they go the intended opening of the middle class 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.949
 stuck in the last August, the top is exactly centered 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.379
 Now fix the Florino top 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.789
 stood with the Velcro straps on the 6 scaffolding 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.359
 in Falkensee the ground part 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.090
 and if they put it that way on the ground 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.090
 that the slit with the velcro and is visible 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.650
 open the velcro straps and the isolated demente into the bottom part 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.289
 lay 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.429
 you can see the arrangement here 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.069
 take the Florino Berthaler 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.960
 with the biggest 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.699
 and place it appropriately over the floor mat 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:45.670
 Be sure to 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.410
 that set the entrances of the Florino over the split zippers 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.549
 become 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.669
 Put the gus-states in their feet and hook them on the latches 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.259
 Floor mat on the feet 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:59.480
 just close the bottom zips 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.389
 and the Fiorino is finished 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.089
 by opening and closing the zippers of the two accesses 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.279
 The Florino makes it easy to regulate the ventilation 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:11.430
 when the Flori nuns is set up 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.449
 You can start to turn off the plants 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.999
 They can do this with heavy herbivores a sack truck 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:19.009
 use 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.439
 The plants can be so slightly closer than in the touch 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.139
 summer 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.139
 Leave space for the frost guard, if possible in the middle 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.629
 Any plant parts should not be more than 20 centimeters to the frost 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.209
 Computer are located 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.260
 disturbing branches 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.049
 if only they could 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:37.870
 at the end 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.830
 Place the Frost Richter in the middle and guide the cable to the ground 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.239
 Begin along between zipper and zipper end 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.789
 out of the Florino 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:50.669
 set the thermostat the fist right that way 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.589
 best to the lowest Heitz level 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:57.819
 Last but not least, plug the frost guard into the mains plug 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.230
 and everything is done 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.499
 until spring 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.869
 when the sun shines during the daytime 15 degrees Celsius 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.629
 maybe they should open one of the two doors 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:09.540
 otherwise 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.610
 It is quite sufficient if they take the plants every two to three weeks 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.929
 to water 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:16.650
 as long as it's colder than zero degrees Celsius outside 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.680
 best do not open it in front of him 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.550
 then this is not necessary because as long as they experience the flourish I 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.349
 no moisture can be lost 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.349
 he planted are now well protected the winter can come 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.499
 in spring when it is warm enough at night 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:34.340
 they can mine the Florino again 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.530
 and save space until next fall 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.939
 By the way, Florino can also be used as an early picture or greenhouse 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.099
 use 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.619
 They let him set up stowing only the isolated messengers and using them 

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:51.509
 the shell as a greenhouse for example for her tomatoes or other 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:52.379
 vegetables 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.290
 You can find more information about the Florino on the website www 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.290
 for Renault - Online Points 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.940
 nevertheless overcome their anzengruber
