 and the rest of the rest of the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.159
 You keep mozzarella because we're going 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.799

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.780
 milk carton this recipe 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.689
 works great with sour cream 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.729
 without serum but I did with serum because the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.220
 home folks may have difficulty and 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.650
 Carol, how do you do it in serum so I decided 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.450
 do this way to make it easier and 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.850
 It's super good, we'll use it. 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.450

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.189
 to use without pity you can play in that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.189
 girls recipe 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.259
 after you've placed all the content 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.689
 of curd you will also add 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.479
 in the blender the entire contents of the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.820
 green maize but before the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.680
 The person you're going to see is still going 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.899
 to quarrel with her she had green corn to 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.820
 the extension 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.119
 I'm showing some green now to 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.330
 open look only despair 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.330
 look that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.530
 finally people get you put all 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.230
 the content of green maize in the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:27.440
 blender and add half a cup of 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.020
 filtered water because the water will 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.090
 break the thick texture that 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.220
 This our mix will stay and the people 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.720
 still need to be put to the fire so it 's 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.120
 I need to cook 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.430
 This mix of mine I can not let 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.890
 there is our thick consistency for those who 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.940
 do not get sticky in the pan 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.860
 done that leads to the 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.590
 blender and leaves for 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.530
 four minutes you can add salt 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.080
 but I preferred to put a pinch of 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.090
 grated cheese to stay even longer 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.239
 tasty but that's optional you can 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.700
 put salt is at your discretion 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.000
 I'm going to hit our 45 minute mix 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.450
 and take to the fire hopes to win a 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.630
 consistency put that bit of 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.680
 That's the mozzarella left to give. 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.560
 a creaminess that good thing of the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:26.650
 cheese melting know how to add 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:30.610
 now the olives sliced in seed 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.610
 and I'll let it cook 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.730
 then I give a stir so that 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.070
 do not stick our mixture in the bottom of the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.459
 and you have to be very attentive to 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.489
 Because you cook very fast. 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:51.340
 now I'm going to add our breast to 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:54.170
 cooked and seasoned shredded chicken 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.290
 after adding all the contents of the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.680
 chicken shredded fan you keep stirring 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.730
 to avoid that all our mixture sticks 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.730
 in the bottom of the pan 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.220
 then in a refractory that can 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.239
 you will put all of our 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.459
 calm mixture that the fat arm will leave 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.320
 the front of the person with no sense I 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.109
 was believing that it was drowning out that 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.959
 I was filming just putting a 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.880
 refractory 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.440
 but when I saw taboo arm fat in the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:31.740
 front you will add without misery 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.130
 all our shredded mozzarella 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.500
 I'll also put sweet oil because 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.740
 I think it gives a very good taste in the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.349
 our food and I will also put a 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.030
 of fine herbs that from that air 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:49.530
 super nice besides giving a light 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.759
 spiced in our food 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.680
 the LAAC loves potato sticks at all 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.860
 pancake noodles then no 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.660
 being also can not be left out 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.060
 without misery again the whim in the 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.930
 Potato straw bakes for 20 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.410
 minutes and ready so our plate made 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.150
