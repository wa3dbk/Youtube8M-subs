00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 so here we are so on the software the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.890
 photoshop 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 so we're obviously going to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.210
 start open our photo has changed 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.210
 so by pressing either keyboard keys 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.269
 commando or just duplicate 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.490
 clicking on your bottom we see if the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.150
 two examples of which I will make you the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.550
 demonstration 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.740
 I will take care of the first one for 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.750
 start I select it and I press 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.490
 open 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.619
 here is my picture that opened and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.679
 immediately I go to the side of them 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.829
 but layer so they are here always 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.329
 his two small diamonds a lighter and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.430
 as usual if you can not find 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.300
 they are simply in window and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.010
 you tick a few hiccups so I 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.329
 start with double click on my 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.180
 background to be able to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.160
 unlock so I doubleclick and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:56.879
 I will take the opportunity to rename it 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:00.300
 so I call it basic photos and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.579
 I press enter I go now 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.189
 expand my work area so 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.530
 to increase the size of my photo so 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.320
 I select lucci crop that they 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.020
 here and I'm just going to take 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.850
 wrists to extend the area of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.630
 job 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.000
 so here I am going to take something 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.470
 wide enough and I press enter 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.720
 so in order to see the difference I'm going 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.640
 to first duplicate my picture so I 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.770
 select my calq and I support either 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.619
 key commands j so simply 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.970
 to duplicate it 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.380
 otherwise you can also do a 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.970
 right click and you have duplicate the cac 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.790
 I double click on the new layer and 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.640
 I name it taÃ¯l 2 and I press on 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.829
 entrance so the first step is going to be from 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.329
 determining a protection zone which 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.060
 simply an area on which 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.920
 we do not want deformation so 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.829
 there in this example it will be fine 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.740
 obviously our character I'm going 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.540
 select the tool the polygonal assault 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.420
 who is here and I'm going very quickly 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.910
 to make a fairly general outline of my 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.160
 area to be protected 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.330
 you see it's a very age-old 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.250
 fast and I close my form I 'm going 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.520
 now right click in my 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.100
 selection and I'm going to click on the menu 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.050
 memorize the selection I will be able to 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:34.500
 give him a name I'm going to call 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.910
 characters and I press ok I can 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.230
 press maintenance or and touch as 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.880
 in 2d for selected mazzone then 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.880
 I'm going now forms and so 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.860
 to enlarge in my composition so 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.390
 just a little example by pressing 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.970
 the tea order keys so do not 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.620
 do not do it if I just pulled my 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.830
 photo my character would have been 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.260
 obviously distorted so much jeanne him 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.180
 that and I'm going to go and shoot my 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.850
 picture with another tool so everything 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.340
 simply in editing and there you have 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.770
 the content-based scale option 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.740
 so you click on it so there you 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.810
 see that your selected photo 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.540
 at the very top here you have a small menu 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.600
 with marc is protected I'm going all 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.860
 simply select character so 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.040
 this is the selection we have 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.530
 memorized and now when I'm going 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.830
 shoot I can see that my fund is going 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.690
 expand and my character is not going 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.650
 move 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.840
 so you can notice by the way 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.760
 that in fact it extends by little hack or 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.670
 more simply because the software 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.770
 photoshop calculating the places where he can 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.830
 to afford to stretch and that's not the 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.410
 globality that he will expand so I'm going 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.910
 there pull a little bit like these so 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.580
 do not go too much 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.970
 strong there are always limits 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.620
 So I pulled them so far and I 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.510
 will take care of my second area which 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.040
 did not extend too much so I would 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.380
 that it extends a little bit so 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.940
 I press enter and I will 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.900
 now determine a second area 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.900
 to protect 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.400
 so I resume my tool the assault I 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.040
 select all this part that I do not 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.380
 want more touch right click 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.109
 memorize the selection and I call it 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.469
 part 2 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.080
 I press ok then as in 2d for 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:27.449
 selected I'm going now 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.180
 redo the same manipulation I'm going 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.969
 go in edition is the one based on 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.270
 the content is there to change I'm going 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:39.090
 select part 2 is now 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:46.520
 more simply this is my second part 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:49.110
 which will expand and I press entry 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.680
 I take the eye off my calq to see the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.319
 difference 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.819
 and that's what it gives us so 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.020
 photoshop reacted so 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.270
 smart 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.710
 he calculated all the places for 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.500
 which they could afford 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.300
 to stretch the picture and he at the same time 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.029
 protect the areas we have him 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.800
 indicated so of course this manipulation 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:11.360
 works a lot for everything 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.680
 landscape so nature the sky the water 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.240
 but it can also apply on 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.490
 photos a little more complex 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.740
 with fewer repetitive elements like 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.270
 the trees for example so we're going 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.199
 see that in our second 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.199
 example
