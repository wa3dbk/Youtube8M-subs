I've been in the protractor business for

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.720 
I've been in the protractor business for
a<00:00:30.960> very<00:00:30.990> long<00:00:31.320> time<00:00:31.349> I've<00:00:32.160> seen<00:00:32.400> plenty<00:00:32.580> of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
a very long time I've seen plenty of
booms<00:00:33.090> like<00:00:33.900> this<00:00:34.080> in<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> past<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.650> I've

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
booms like this in the past and I've

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650 
booms like this in the past and I've
seen<00:00:34.890> them<00:00:35.070> all<00:00:35.190> leave<00:00:35.489> us<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.390> quickly

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
seen them all leave us just as quickly

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.970 
seen them all leave us just as quickly
just<00:00:38.450> don't<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.809> clearly<00:00:40.440> people<00:00:40.680> love

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

our product 9,000 percent sales increase
um<00:00:43.739> yeah<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:44.940> they<00:00:45.570> might<00:00:45.780> why<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.199> they

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
um yeah I think they might why do they

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.150 
um yeah I think they might why do they
stop<00:00:46.590> buying<00:00:46.879> how<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.540> we<00:00:48.660> keep<00:00:48.870> them<00:00:49.160> every

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
stop buying how do we keep them every

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
stop buying how do we keep them every

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
and on and on there's clearly some kind

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.450 
and on and on there's clearly some kind
of<00:00:54.600> fad<00:00:55.110> element<00:00:55.710> we're<00:00:55.830> missing<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of fad element we're missing right a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.540 
of fad element we're missing right a
demand<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.149> there<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.780> mean<00:00:58.110> people<00:00:58.800> need<00:00:59.219> to

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
measure with accuracy the angle of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.850 
measure with accuracy the angle of
things<00:01:02.160> are<00:01:02.460> people<00:01:02.840> using<00:01:03.840> protractors<00:01:04.379> for

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
things are people using protractors for

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.609 
things are people using protractors for
any<00:01:04.979> other<00:01:05.129> purpose<00:01:06.140> are<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.229> getting<00:01:07.410> high

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
any other purpose are they getting high

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.430 
any other purpose are they getting high
on<00:01:07.649> no<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.330> about<00:01:09.509> that<00:01:09.840> maybe

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
on no I would know about that maybe

on no I would know about that maybe
we're<00:01:10.710> making<00:01:10.800> them<00:01:11.039> too<00:01:11.190> tough<00:01:11.460> maybe<00:01:12.240> we

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
we're making them too tough maybe we

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.290 
we're making them too tough maybe we
need<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> little<00:01:13.259> bit<00:01:13.440> of<00:01:13.500> planned<00:01:14.300> protractor

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
need a little bit of planned protractor

you want that is there an angle
measuring<00:01:20.250> iPad<00:01:20.880> app<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.869> could

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
measuring iPad app because I could

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.440 
measuring iPad app because I could
really<00:01:22.320> overlap<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.950> our<00:01:23.070> key<00:01:23.190> demographic

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
really overlap with our key demographic

really overlap with our key demographic
the<00:01:24.450> protractor<00:01:25.080> demographic<00:01:25.710> okay<00:01:26.280> forget

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
the protractor demographic okay forget

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.940 
the protractor demographic okay forget

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the reason we need to come up with a way

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.800 
the reason we need to come up with a way
to<00:01:30.990> sustain<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.740> rate<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.729> growth<00:01:33.150> you'll

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
to sustain this rate of growth you'll

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.660 
to sustain this rate of growth you'll
need<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.170> chance<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.890> submit<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.369> brand

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you've noted we've had that chance every

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.910 
you've noted we've had that chance every
year<00:01:39.750> since<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.079> year<00:01:40.229> were<00:01:40.350> established

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
year since the year were established

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.969 
year since the year were established
yeah<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.939> blew<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.360> every<00:01:42.840> time<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.710> now

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
yeah and we blew it every time so now

the middle it could be a fail or we go

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.330 
the middle it could be a fail or we go
back<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.899> basics<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:01.619> simply<00:02:01.799> point<00:02:02.130> out<00:02:02.220> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
back to basics we simply point out the
