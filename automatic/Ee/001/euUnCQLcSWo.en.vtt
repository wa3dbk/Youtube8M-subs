episode with dr. brew and today we're
going<00:00:29.080> to<00:00:29.200> look<00:00:30.040> a<00:00:30.190> little<00:00:30.369> bit<00:00:30.580> at<00:00:30.610> questions

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
going to look a little bit at questions

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.780 
going to look a little bit at questions
that<00:00:31.570> come<00:00:31.779> from<00:00:31.930> consumers<00:00:32.529> saying<00:00:32.800> what<00:00:33.670> is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
that come from consumers saying what is

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.340 
that come from consumers saying what is
the<00:00:33.910> difference<00:00:33.940> in<00:00:34.330> rose<00:00:34.510> color<00:00:34.809> from<00:00:35.110> white

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
the difference in rose color from white

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.070 
the difference in rose color from white
medium<00:00:36.250> dark<00:00:36.670> roast<00:00:37.059> and<00:00:37.300> how<00:00:37.840> does<00:00:37.900> that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
medium dark roast and how does that

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.810 
medium dark roast and how does that
affect<00:00:38.350> flavor<00:00:38.830> profile

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.820 

Coffee<00:00:44.210> is<00:00:44.540> very<00:00:44.600> similar<00:00:45.110> to<00:00:45.260> how<00:00:45.500> you<00:00:45.560> may

Coffee is very similar to how you may

Coffee is very similar to how you may

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
like your steaks whether it's

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.900 
like your steaks whether it's
medium-rare<00:00:47.690> where<00:00:48.680> it's<00:00:48.890> lightly<00:00:49.190> roasted

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.280

on the exterior roast development of
coffee<00:00:57.560> in<00:00:57.890> general<00:00:58.430> when<00:00:59.090> we<00:00:59.240> talk<00:00:59.270> about<00:00:59.870> the

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
coffee in general when we talk about the

lighter roast more of a mild flavor

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.540 
lighter roast more of a mild flavor
where<00:01:03.110> we<00:01:03.230> get<00:01:03.440> into<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.710> medium<00:01:04.130> roast<00:01:04.339> a

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
where we get into a medium roast a

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.370 
where we get into a medium roast a
little<00:01:04.790> more<00:01:04.910> carmelization<00:01:05.570> of<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.990> sugars

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
little more carmelization of the sugars

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.680 
little more carmelization of the sugars
that<00:01:06.410> are<00:01:06.680> in<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.950> coffee<00:01:07.450> bringing<00:01:08.450> up<00:01:08.570> a

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
that are in the coffee bringing up a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.050 
that are in the coffee bringing up a
little<00:01:08.870> flavor<00:01:09.170> intensity<00:01:09.770> all<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.640> way<00:01:10.760> over

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
little flavor intensity all the way over

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.660 
little flavor intensity all the way over
to<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.240> dark<00:01:11.660> roast<00:01:11.930> where<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:12.470> may<00:01:12.650> have<00:01:12.680> not

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
to a dark roast where you may have not

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.550 
to a dark roast where you may have not
only<00:01:13.910> a<00:01:14.060> deeper<00:01:14.450> carmelization<00:01:15.080> of<00:01:15.410> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
only a deeper carmelization of the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.590 
only a deeper carmelization of the
sugars<00:01:16.009> but<00:01:16.310> also<00:01:16.490> possibly<00:01:16.910> a<00:01:17.210> little<00:01:17.300> bit<00:01:17.420> of

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
sugars but also possibly a little bit of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.380 
sugars but also possibly a little bit of
a<00:01:17.690> smoky<00:01:18.140> flavor<00:01:18.550> enhancing<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.759> experience

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
a smoky flavor enhancing the experience

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.249 
a smoky flavor enhancing the experience
of<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:20.600> coffee

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
of that coffee

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.620 
of that coffee
so<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.950> roast<00:01:22.160> development<00:01:22.850> does<00:01:23.210> several

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
so the roast development does several

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.230 
so the roast development does several
things<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:24.259> can<00:01:24.830> roast<00:01:25.070> flavors<00:01:25.580> in<00:01:25.850> to

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
things it can roast flavors in to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.600 
things it can roast flavors in to
caramelize<00:01:26.750> more<00:01:27.320> sugars<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:28.070> can<00:01:28.400> roast

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
caramelize more sugars it can roast

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.850 
caramelize more sugars it can roast
flavors<00:01:29.119> out<00:01:29.330> so<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.930> roast<00:01:30.140> master<00:01:30.410> has<00:01:30.830> a

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
flavors out so the roast master has a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.570 
flavors out so the roast master has a
way<00:01:31.160> of<00:01:31.430> using<00:01:32.180> beans<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:33.410> create<00:01:34.310> different

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
way of using beans to create different

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.660 
way of using beans to create different
flavor<00:01:35.000> profiles

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.780 

also<00:01:40.659> affecting<00:01:41.110> flavor<00:01:41.350> profile<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.400> the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
also affecting flavor profile is is the

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.960 
also affecting flavor profile is is the
area<00:01:43.180> from<00:01:43.420> which<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.780> came<00:01:44.159> what<00:01:45.159> area<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:45.760> the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
area from which it came what area of the
