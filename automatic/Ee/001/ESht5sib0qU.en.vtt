so<00:00:10.730> again<00:00:10.970> since<00:00:11.299> it's<00:00:11.480> a<00:00:11.570> little<00:00:11.780> bit<00:00:11.870> in<00:00:11.990> the

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
so again since it's a little bit in the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.839 
so again since it's a little bit in the
distance<00:00:12.559> I'll<00:00:12.769> work<00:00:12.950> with<00:00:13.160> the<00:00:13.339> cobalt<00:00:13.730> blue

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
distance I'll work with the cobalt blue

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.390 
distance I'll work with the cobalt blue
and<00:00:14.419> a<00:00:14.629> little<00:00:14.900> bit<00:00:14.990> of<00:00:15.110> Quinn<00:00:15.440> gold<00:00:15.860> on<00:00:16.160> the

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
and a little bit of Quinn gold on the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.359 
and a little bit of Quinn gold on the
brush<00:00:16.640> and<00:00:16.970> just<00:00:17.330> start<00:00:17.870> working<00:00:18.440> in<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:19.070> tree

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
brush and just start working in the tree

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.970 
brush and just start working in the tree
line<00:00:19.580> here<00:00:20.000> especially<00:00:20.810> we<00:00:21.260> really<00:00:21.710> want<00:00:21.890> to

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
line here especially we really want to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.009 
line here especially we really want to
profile<00:00:22.460> those<00:00:22.670> trees<00:00:22.939> along<00:00:23.269> that<00:00:23.449> top<00:00:23.720> edge

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
profile those trees along that top edge

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.679 
profile those trees along that top edge
of<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:24.380> cliff<00:00:24.740> here<00:00:28.210> in<00:00:29.210> just<00:00:29.390> quick

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
of the cliff here in just quick

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.240 
of the cliff here in just quick
brushstrokes<00:00:30.320> almost<00:00:30.769> like<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:30.949> visual

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
brushstrokes almost like a visual

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.490 
brushstrokes almost like a visual
sentence<00:00:31.880> it's<00:00:32.210> part<00:00:32.509> of<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.689> linkage<00:00:33.200> there

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
sentence it's part of the linkage there

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.350 
sentence it's part of the linkage there
the<00:00:33.680> visual<00:00:34.130> passage<00:00:34.610> I'm<00:00:34.790> not<00:00:34.940> trying<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.240> be

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
the visual passage I'm not trying to be

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.210 
the visual passage I'm not trying to be
too<00:00:35.570> careful<00:00:35.870> with<00:00:36.200> each<00:00:36.410> tree<00:00:36.680> especially<00:00:37.130> at

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
too careful with each tree especially at

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.830 
too careful with each tree especially at
that<00:00:37.400> distance<00:00:37.700> we<00:00:38.060> just<00:00:38.270> want<00:00:38.450> to<00:00:38.570> give<00:00:38.720> the

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
that distance we just want to give the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.960 
that distance we just want to give the
sense<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.560> trees<00:00:39.860> being<00:00:40.250> on<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:40.610> slope

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
sense of the trees being on that slope

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.060 
sense of the trees being on that slope
not<00:00:41.780> only<00:00:42.020> do<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.260> trees<00:00:42.530> live<00:00:42.800> along<00:00:43.040> the

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
not only do the trees live along the

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.190 
not only do the trees live along the
ridgeline<00:00:43.400> but<00:00:43.910> they<00:00:44.060> live<00:00:44.270> down<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.720> slope<00:00:45.050> a

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
ridgeline but they live down the slope a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.780 
ridgeline but they live down the slope a
little<00:00:45.230> bit<00:00:45.560> so<00:00:45.710> we'll<00:00:45.830> develop<00:00:46.130> that<00:00:46.400> just<00:00:46.670> a

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
little bit so we'll develop that just a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.820 
little bit so we'll develop that just a
little<00:00:46.940> bit<00:00:47.090> there<00:00:47.480> too<00:00:47.720> so<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.410> same<00:00:48.650> thing

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
little bit there too so the same thing

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.820 
little bit there too so the same thing
will<00:00:49.010> take<00:00:49.190> place<00:00:49.580> on<00:00:49.940> this<00:00:50.240> top<00:00:50.690> edge<00:00:50.990> here<00:00:51.020> so

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
will take place on this top edge here so

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.410 
will take place on this top edge here so
we'll<00:00:52.040> add<00:00:52.310> those<00:00:52.670> in<00:00:52.970> pretty<00:00:53.360> much

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
we'll add those in pretty much

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.480 
we'll add those in pretty much
predominantly<00:00:54.110> cobalt<00:00:54.620> blue<00:00:54.830> again<00:00:55.160> for

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
predominantly cobalt blue again for

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.250 
predominantly cobalt blue again for
distance<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.420> farther<00:00:56.720> away<00:00:56.840> we<00:00:57.080> are<00:00:57.200> the

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
distance the farther away we are the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.050 
distance the farther away we are the
more<00:00:57.530> there's<00:00:57.830> a<00:00:57.920> tendency<00:00:58.370> for<00:00:58.490> things<00:00:58.880> to

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
more there's a tendency for things to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.400 
more there's a tendency for things to
have<00:00:59.270> blue<00:00:59.600> in<00:00:59.810> them<00:01:01.690> pushing<00:01:02.690> upward<00:01:03.230> with

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
have blue in them pushing upward with

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.620 
have blue in them pushing upward with
the<00:01:03.440> brush<00:01:03.800> that<00:01:04.339> gives<00:01:04.519> me<00:01:04.640> an<00:01:04.760> irregular

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
the brush that gives me an irregular

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.050 
the brush that gives me an irregular
stroke<00:01:06.049> if<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.350> push<00:01:06.619> into<00:01:06.890> it<00:01:07.070> like<00:01:07.310> this<00:01:07.490> have

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
stroke if I push into it like this have

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.849 
stroke if I push into it like this have
the<00:01:08.210> same<00:01:08.420> tendency<00:01:08.899> to<00:01:09.020> make<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.409> same<00:01:09.619> kind

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
the same tendency to make the same kind

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.999 
the same tendency to make the same kind
of<00:01:09.890> pointed<00:01:10.340> tree<00:01:10.609> all<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.850> way<00:01:11.060> along<00:01:11.359> there

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
of pointed tree all the way along there

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.340 
of pointed tree all the way along there
and<00:01:13.009> again<00:01:14.000> down<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.509> slope<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:15.020> little<00:01:15.049> bit

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
and again down the slope a little bit

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.499 
and again down the slope a little bit
low<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.950> ridge<00:01:16.130> line<00:01:16.429> we<00:01:16.759> don't<00:01:16.880> want<00:01:17.119> just<00:01:17.299> a

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
low the ridge line we don't want just a

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.569 
low the ridge line we don't want just a
trail<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:17.990> trees<00:01:18.320> along<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.740> main<00:01:19.070> ridge<00:01:19.310> line

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
trail of trees along the main ridge line

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.249 
trail of trees along the main ridge line
there<00:01:19.820> but<00:01:19.999> we<00:01:20.119> want<00:01:20.329> them<00:01:20.509> in<00:01:20.749> other<00:01:20.899> places

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
there but we want them in other places

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.700 
there but we want them in other places
as<00:01:21.619> well<00:01:21.939> so<00:01:22.939> you<00:01:23.030> can<00:01:23.119> see<00:01:23.329> with<00:01:23.719> this<00:01:23.960> stage

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
as well so you can see with this stage

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.770 
as well so you can see with this stage
again<00:01:24.950> one<00:01:25.340> two<00:01:25.670> three<00:01:26.090> now<00:01:26.329> we're<00:01:26.600> going

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
again one two three now we're going

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.109 
again one two three now we're going
forth<00:01:27.200> it's<00:01:27.499> a<00:01:27.649> fourth<00:01:28.039> level<00:01:28.189> of<00:01:28.460> detail<00:01:28.909> and

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
forth it's a fourth level of detail and

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.539 
forth it's a fourth level of detail and
specificity<00:01:29.329> I'll<00:01:30.320> develop<00:01:30.649> my<00:01:30.950> third<00:01:31.189> level

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
specificity I'll develop my third level

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.940 
specificity I'll develop my third level
of<00:01:31.729> value<00:01:32.060> on<00:01:32.569> the<00:01:32.810> shadows<00:01:33.229> here<00:01:33.530> at<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.740> same

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
of value on the shadows here at the same

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.889 
of value on the shadows here at the same
time<00:01:34.219> so<00:01:34.850> with<00:01:34.999> French<00:01:35.390> ultramarine<00:01:35.569> which

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
time so with French ultramarine which

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.870 
time so with French ultramarine which
gives<00:01:36.259> me<00:01:36.409> a<00:01:36.439> little<00:01:36.590> more<00:01:36.710> covering<00:01:37.280> power<00:01:37.520> I

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
gives me a little more covering power I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.749 
gives me a little more covering power I
come<00:01:38.240> in<00:01:38.390> with<00:01:38.569> specific<00:01:39.439> shadow<00:01:40.009> lines<00:01:40.369> and

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
come in with specific shadow lines and

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.429 
come in with specific shadow lines and
fractures<00:01:41.179> in<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.479> stone<00:01:41.749> and<00:01:41.990> detail<00:01:44.439> I'm

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
fractures in the stone and detail I'm

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.349 
fractures in the stone and detail I'm
going<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.649> go<00:01:45.829> up<00:01:45.979> to<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.159> larger<00:01:46.670> brush<00:01:46.850> and

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
going to go up to a larger brush and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.359 
going to go up to a larger brush and
wash<00:01:47.899> in<00:01:48.109> a<00:01:48.200> bigger<00:01:48.409> shape<00:01:48.770> then<00:01:49.130> with<00:01:49.340> a

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
wash in a bigger shape then with a

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:57.340 
wash in a bigger shape then with a
number<00:01:49.880> six<00:01:50.240> here<00:01:53.649> and<00:01:55.420> charge<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.600> with<00:01:56.780> Quinn

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
number six here and charge it with Quinn

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.120 
number six here and charge it with Quinn
burnt-orange

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
burnt-orange

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.639 
burnt-orange
so<00:01:58.999> we<00:01:59.209> get<00:01:59.329> a<00:01:59.359> little<00:01:59.479> bit<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.780> warm<00:02:00.020> reflected

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
so we get a little bit of warm reflected

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.980 
so we get a little bit of warm reflected
light<00:02:00.889> into<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.490> shadows<00:02:01.939> that<00:02:02.149> way<00:02:02.359> notice

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
light into the shadows that way notice

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.109 
light into the shadows that way notice
how<00:02:03.139> I<00:02:03.170> just<00:02:03.380> let<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.740> softly<00:02:04.189> change<00:02:04.670> back<00:02:04.909> to

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
how I just let it softly change back to

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.969 
how I just let it softly change back to
the<00:02:05.270> cooler<00:02:05.630> blue<00:02:05.869> up<00:02:06.079> along<00:02:06.319> the<00:02:06.499> ridge<00:02:06.709> line

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
the cooler blue up along the ridge line

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.850 
the cooler blue up along the ridge line
there<00:02:07.539> second<00:02:08.539> layer<00:02:08.899> on<00:02:09.140> some<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:09.590> area

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
there second layer on some of this area

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.420 
there second layer on some of this area
darkening<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.729> little<00:02:10.910> bit<00:02:12.160> with<00:02:13.160> these

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
darkening it a little bit with these

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.120 
darkening it a little bit with these
values<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.240> colors<00:02:14.690> I'm<00:02:14.990> using<00:02:15.470> mostly<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
values and colors I'm using mostly the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.809 
values and colors I'm using mostly the
French<00:02:16.370> alter

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
French alter

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.280 
French alter
because<00:02:17.299> it<00:02:17.450> has<00:02:17.629> a<00:02:17.659> little<00:02:17.989> bit<00:02:18.230> more

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
because it has a little bit more

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.500 
because it has a little bit more
covering<00:02:18.829> power<00:02:19.010> as<00:02:19.159> a<00:02:19.249> sedimentary<00:02:19.790> color<00:02:20.120> so

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
covering power as a sedimentary color so

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.050 
covering power as a sedimentary color so
it's<00:02:20.659> more<00:02:21.379> apt<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.709> give<00:02:21.980> me<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.489> darks<00:02:22.849> that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
it's more apt to give me the darks that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.679 
it's more apt to give me the darks that
I'm<00:02:23.239> after<00:02:24.730> cobalt<00:02:25.730> blue<00:02:25.879> is<00:02:25.999> a<00:02:26.030> difficult<00:02:26.599> one

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
I'm after cobalt blue is a difficult one

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.770 
I'm after cobalt blue is a difficult one
to<00:02:26.870> get<00:02:27.019> real<00:02:27.349> dark<00:02:27.650> darks<00:02:28.159> with<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:28.849> use<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
to get real dark darks with so use the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.509 
to get real dark darks with so use the
French<00:02:30.170> ultramarine<00:02:30.379> more<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:31.159> the<00:02:31.310> latter

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
French ultramarine more in the latter

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.000 
French ultramarine more in the latter
stages<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:32.209> building<00:02:32.810> up<00:02:32.930> values<00:02:33.349> rather<00:02:33.709> than

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
stages of building up values rather than

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.520 
stages of building up values rather than
earlier<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.849> there's<00:02:35.629> a<00:02:35.719> tendency<00:02:36.079> if<00:02:36.349> you

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
earlier and there's a tendency if you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.649 
earlier and there's a tendency if you
overuse<00:02:37.159> the<00:02:37.459> French<00:02:37.730> ultramarine<00:02:37.909> for<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.510> to

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
overuse the French ultramarine for it to

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.899 
overuse the French ultramarine for it to
become<00:02:38.840> shiny<00:02:39.409> on<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.920> surface<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:40.579> that's

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
become shiny on the surface so that's

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.729 
become shiny on the surface so that's
why<00:02:41.060> I'm<00:02:41.150> careful<00:02:41.510> not<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.780> layer<00:02:42.019> too<00:02:42.349> thickly

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
why I'm careful not to layer too thickly

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.159 
why I'm careful not to layer too thickly
with<00:02:43.159> French<00:02:43.819> ultramarine<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.569> it<00:02:44.659> can<00:02:44.959> make

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:45.169 
with French ultramarine and it can make

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:46.839 
with French ultramarine and it can make
your<00:02:45.349> painting<00:02:45.680> look<00:02:45.799> a<00:02:45.919> little<00:02:46.129> bit<00:02:46.219> black<00:02:46.549> if

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
your painting look a little bit black if

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.440 
your painting look a little bit black if
you<00:02:46.969> use<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.329> so<00:02:47.629> heavily<00:02:49.239> some<00:02:50.239> of<00:02:50.359> these

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
you use it so heavily some of these

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.569 
you use it so heavily some of these
areas<00:02:50.840> are<00:02:50.989> very<00:02:51.019> dry<00:02:51.409> and<00:02:51.650> some<00:02:51.919> are<00:02:52.069> very<00:02:52.250> wet

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
areas are very dry and some are very wet

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.149 
areas are very dry and some are very wet
so<00:02:52.849> I'm<00:02:52.909> working<00:02:53.120> with<00:02:53.480> soft<00:02:54.409> edges<00:02:54.949> and

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
so I'm working with soft edges and

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.280 
so I'm working with soft edges and
harder<00:02:56.060> edges<00:02:56.299> in<00:02:56.719> these<00:02:56.870> areas<00:02:59.079> so<00:03:00.079> if<00:03:00.199> you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
harder edges in these areas so if you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.470 
harder edges in these areas so if you
notice<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.799> rim<00:03:01.099> of<00:03:01.280> light<00:03:01.310> here<00:03:02.030> how<00:03:02.329> it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
notice this rim of light here how it

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.750 
notice this rim of light here how it
links<00:03:02.900> visually<00:03:03.409> to<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.829> little<00:03:04.400> bit<00:03:04.579> of

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
links visually to this little bit of

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.759 
links visually to this little bit of
light<00:03:04.969> here<00:03:05.389> and<00:03:05.540> connects<00:03:06.049> with<00:03:06.230> this<00:03:06.439> line

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
light here and connects with this line

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.920 
light here and connects with this line
here<00:03:07.219> and<00:03:07.400> points<00:03:08.030> down<00:03:08.239> toward<00:03:08.599> this<00:03:08.870> a

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
here and points down toward this a

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.990 
here and points down toward this a
little<00:03:09.199> bit<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.379> a<00:03:09.500> visual<00:03:09.829> cradle<00:03:10.430> here<00:03:10.730> so

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
little bit of a visual cradle here so

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.369 
little bit of a visual cradle here so
those<00:03:11.209> are<00:03:11.359> things<00:03:11.629> that<00:03:11.719> are<00:03:11.989> somewhat

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
those are things that are somewhat

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.409 
those are things that are somewhat
pre-planned<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:13.370> sometimes<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.030> just<00:03:14.269> from

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
pre-planned but sometimes it's just from

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.330 
pre-planned but sometimes it's just from
experience<00:03:15.049> of<00:03:15.230> linking<00:03:15.650> things<00:03:15.889> so<00:03:16.159> many

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
experience of linking things so many

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.360 
experience of linking things so many
times<00:03:16.699> that<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.629> becomes<00:03:18.079> sort<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.829> second

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
times that it becomes sort of second

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.289 
times that it becomes sort of second
nature<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:19.760> guess<00:03:19.909> you<00:03:20.209> would<00:03:20.329> say<00:03:22.299> really

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
nature I guess you would say really

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.749 
nature I guess you would say really

dark line into the thinner wash is

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.869 
dark line into the thinner wash is
already<00:03:33.349> laid<00:03:33.590> in<00:03:33.739> that<00:03:34.099> gives<00:03:34.549> me<00:03:34.699> the

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
already laid in that gives me the

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.550 
already laid in that gives me the
feeling<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.389> the<00:03:35.509> detail<00:03:35.930> again<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.500> the

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
feeling of the detail again and the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.349 
feeling of the detail again and the
weathering<00:03:36.979> of<00:03:37.159> the<00:03:37.310> granite<00:03:40.209> sometimes<00:03:41.209> I

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
weathering of the granite sometimes I

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.030 
weathering of the granite sometimes I
have<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.659> go<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.169> detail<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.590> little<00:03:42.919> bit

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
have to go to the detail a little bit

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.679 
have to go to the detail a little bit
while<00:03:43.189> these<00:03:43.370> areas<00:03:43.790> are<00:03:43.970> wet<00:03:44.209> that's<00:03:44.509> why<00:03:44.659> I

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
while these areas are wet that's why I

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.780 
while these areas are wet that's why I
jump<00:03:45.049> to<00:03:45.169> the<00:03:45.259> smaller<00:03:45.650> brush<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.370> little

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
jump to the smaller brush a little

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.580 
jump to the smaller brush a little
quicker<00:03:47.120> than<00:03:47.389> I<00:03:47.479> might<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.109> I<00:03:48.139> can<00:03:48.379> pick

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
quicker than I might so that I can pick

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.429 
quicker than I might so that I can pick
up<00:03:48.709> this<00:03:48.919> wet<00:03:49.310> area<00:03:50.239> and<00:03:50.449> work<00:03:50.659> in<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.989> wet<00:03:51.229> area

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 
up this wet area and work in a wet area

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.800 
up this wet area and work in a wet area
to<00:03:51.709> get<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:51.859> softer<00:03:52.489> line<00:03:52.729> before<00:03:53.389> I<00:03:53.419> get<00:03:53.599> too

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
to get a softer line before I get too

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.749 
to get a softer line before I get too
involved<00:03:54.079> in<00:03:54.349> detail<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:54.769> want<00:03:54.979> to<00:03:55.040> carry<00:03:55.220> on<00:03:55.400> to

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:55.759 
involved in detail I want to carry on to

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.309 
involved in detail I want to carry on to
another<00:03:56.030> part<00:03:56.329> of<00:03:56.449> the<00:03:56.509> painting<00:03:56.959> so<00:03:57.199> I'll

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
another part of the painting so I'll

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.110 
another part of the painting so I'll
just<00:03:57.500> continue<00:03:57.769> this<00:03:58.129> development<00:03:58.819> through

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
just continue this development through

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.659 
just continue this development through
the<00:03:59.150> painting<00:03:59.719> here<00:04:00.280> interchanging<00:04:01.280> brushes

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
the painting here interchanging brushes

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.849 
the painting here interchanging brushes
here<00:04:01.849> when<00:04:01.969> I<00:04:02.000> need<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.239> larger<00:04:02.870> shape<00:04:03.079> I<00:04:03.349> use<00:04:03.530> my

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
here when I need a larger shape I use my

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.949 
here when I need a larger shape I use my
three<00:04:04.430> inch<00:04:04.579> brush<00:04:04.939> when<00:04:05.299> I<00:04:05.329> need<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.569> smaller

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
three inch brush when I need a smaller

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.379 
three inch brush when I need a smaller
shape<00:04:06.229> I<00:04:06.439> jump<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.769> my<00:04:06.889> number<00:04:07.040> six<00:04:07.400> round<00:04:07.790> so

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
shape I jump to my number six round so

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.330 
shape I jump to my number six round so
at<00:04:08.509> this<00:04:08.659> stage<00:04:08.870> I'm<00:04:09.109> keeping<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.769> brushes<00:04:10.189> in

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
at this stage I'm keeping the brushes in

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.770 
at this stage I'm keeping the brushes in
my<00:04:10.370> hand<00:04:10.699> so<00:04:10.909> they'll<00:04:11.090> be<00:04:11.209> readily<00:04:11.659> available

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
to me what I'm doing is coming back in

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.330 
to me what I'm doing is coming back in
and<00:04:14.449> charging<00:04:14.810> those<00:04:15.109> with<00:04:15.349> little<00:04:15.590> areas<00:04:16.159> of

and charging those with little areas of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.949 
and charging those with little areas of
color<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:17.060> that<00:04:17.150> gives<00:04:17.329> me<00:04:17.389> a<00:04:17.479> little<00:04:17.690> more

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
color and that gives me a little more

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.770 
color and that gives me a little more
intensity<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:19.400> more<00:04:19.699> variation<00:04:20.419> in<00:04:20.599> my

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780
