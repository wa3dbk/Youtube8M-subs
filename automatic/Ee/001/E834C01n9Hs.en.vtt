00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 midnight and twenty minutes on Monday 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.400
 March 21st, this is when it falls this year 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.200
 the spring equinox 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.420
 and that's when in the common imagination 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.309
 the real spring begins 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.380
 but let's try to understand exactly what it is 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.080
 this spring equinox 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.710
 we know that the earth revolves around 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.060
 in the sun 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.800
 however, the rotation axis is not 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.560
 perpendicular to the plane of rotation 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.900
 there are around the sun but inclined 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.340
 only two moments of the year in which 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
 the position of the earth with respect to 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.060
 sun is such that the sun's rays 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.590
 they hit the equator so 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.590
 perpendicular are the equinox 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.600
 in autumn it is spring in the two 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.309
 equinoxes also the circle of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 lighting that is the line that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.700
 delimits the boundary between the part of the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
 lighted earth and the dark one passes 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.960
 exactly for the poles in the day 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.899
 therefore all the points of the equinox 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.000
 of the earth said 12 hours of light and 12 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.500
 in short, the duration of the day is 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.239
 equal to that of the night 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.949
 but let's get right here born of 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.960
 spring in our hemisphere that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.730
 northern the northern one well starting from 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 that moment we record a gradual 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.049
 increased light hours what 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.549
 will continue for the next three months until 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.549
 at the summer solstice this year 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.409
 falls on June 21st at 5:17 pm but it is not 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.090
 all in our latitudes in the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 next three months also the height of the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.869
 sun on the horizon increases its rays 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.400
 therefore getting closer and closer to the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.710
 condition of perpendicularity 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.780
 they will warm up more and more just because 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.420
 they must cross a smaller portion 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.310
 of atmosphere is also curious to note how 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.110
 the day of the equinox at noon 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.840
 a person who is at the equator 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.060
 it does not shade because the sun is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.520
 in its vertical form, in short, it is really 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.619
 above his head but if at the equator yes 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.869
 verifies this singular phenomenon ai 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.579
 another pollen happens in the day 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.159
 of the spring equinox always 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.899
 remaining in our hemisphere at the pole 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.210
 north finish the long polar night 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.299
 the polar day starts from that moment 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.729
 therefore for six months at the north pole we will have 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.890
 more light than is naturally dark at the pole 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.600
 the opposite is true in the south 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.640
 well for today it's everything I wait for you 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.360
 always here on meteo.it for all 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.360
