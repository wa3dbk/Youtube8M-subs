00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.730
 as well as before completing the assembly 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 I 'm going to try and have a break here 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.020
 here is quick to speak as is the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.270
 operating a carton box 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.640
 here specifically a box 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.650
 three in three jeep marches willys 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.990
 first gear is the first 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.239
 synchronized 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.250
 is basically the following in the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.680
 position here 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.350
 first let's talk about the components 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:48.329
 here is the pilot shaft that goes in the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.750
 of the flywheel of the clutch motor and such 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.770
 the engine I think he'll watch here 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.699
 grab handle on the clutch disc debut 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.650
 of the duck la la that makes the law to 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.420
 whether or not to trigger the connection 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 of the engine 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:16.610
 the box here in here we have a 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:24.570
 set of gears and has a shaft 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:26.700
 primary does not have a reel that is there 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.700
 I do not know if you can see 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:37.079
 here the gear from below the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.140
 reel and that gear wherever 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.270
 The moon is beating harder now 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.790
 gear it goes along with the ex 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:52.259
 pilot gear and the third 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:55.649
 here is the second is that this greater 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.590
 the first is inversely on the reel 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.689
 we have the opposite relation 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.009
 you may notice that the gear of the 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.119
 third 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:09.470
 it is smaller in the spool the gear of the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.610
 The third that should happen is the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.880
 tent second that is a little 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.820
 a smaller one than that of the third 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.000
 first is that little one out there to 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.530
 people or analogy with entering a 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.140
 high rotation 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.560
 If you play direct you will have the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.600
 the same engine speed 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.080
 that the axis here is the axis 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.670
 in the case is that in the case of 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.240
 two is what if this one does not understand 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.840
 that 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.230
 he connects here under that glove 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.980
 in it the roller shaft 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.070
 fitting the secondary input shaft or the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.100
 primary through one of a number of 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.130
 roller career 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:01.959
 Ok, let's go then 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.850
 in the case here it is in the first position 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:13.590
 Let's move to neutral here. 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:21.489
 people will understand a little better what 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:31.030
 happens because of the weight of the 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:33.250
 synchronism repair a gear 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.080
 Let's start, let's call the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.870
 first 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.170
 the first gear will do it here 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.030
 has a car purchased in the box lid 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.030
 he makes these changes so 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.810
 passed the first gear, ie you 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.549
 linked secondary axis in primary 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.440
 through a reel you got a 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:04.440
 gear 500 spool has connected in this 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.330
 gear here to be able to 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.410
 transmitting a higher rotation of the 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.230
 a smaller gear or 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.180
 the highest engine speed of a 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.810
 smaller gear with a larger image 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.900
 with that and has speed 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.169
 mission and stronger more force missing 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.990
 Now we'll do the second one that is 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:34.930
 here the bottle would go back to 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:36.940
 first and now let's not go on the sleeve 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.000
 the second and third that the case here 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.570
 by the second, if I go back a little 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.570
 heavy 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.760
 here I had to use both hands and 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.290
 It broke my profile, but I moved. 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.810
 the glove that was apparently on the 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.400
 central position between the two gears 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.430
 to the left 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.530
 with that I did pass from neutral 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.680
 in the second but it happens in a 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:41.100
 quick when you turn lawan shifts 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:46.650
 this glove of the first that this one here 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:48.270
 to the left and dislocates the second 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.580
 than in the case for the second 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.510
 so you get an average rotation of the 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.570
 motor thrown on primary spindle reel 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.160
 animal game reel 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.090
 through the axis of the former pilot play and 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.100
 secondary you will have a vote here 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.610
 medium to engine speed 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.590
 Now we're going to do the third time. 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.270
 You can do it with one hand. 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:26.660
 but here the glove will not realize that 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:26.660
 had a bed again his third 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:34.919
 here in the third or the third it 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.970
 is direct with the engine then you turn it 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.130
 the axis 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:44.009
 You see I think you're going to have the 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:46.020
 same spin out a former pilot in there 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:49.259
 in case of a third party here 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:53.400
 I have the same rotation that comes here or 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:55.470
 be the same one that comes in here comes out here and 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.360
 now the reverse march we want to come back soon 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.310
 here pointed out that now managed to return 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.470
 with the hand 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.750
 the gait is this sleeve that any 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.729
 person with caution otherwise sync 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.720
 will leave the position I will have to do 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:08.720
 with both hands again 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:26.789
 The key is the reverse gear has a has a 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:28.409
 zinho gear and that's what happens 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:30.270
 it reverses the movement when 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:31.889
 you put a gear between two 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.259
 were investe movements these two 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:37.039
 sluices you have been a third 

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:39.360
 between these two in the sense of movement 

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:42.240
 is inverted 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.819
 so now who is with the network put 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.620
 this glove here in this fight that makes the 

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:48.780
 first dead center for the network 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.539
 and the one that has returned to the 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.810
 that land stronger than this fight in the 

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:53.810
 medium 

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.860
 I hope the image should not be too 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.289
 cool 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.750
 the cause has options as well but gave 

00:08:01.289 --> 00:08:06.840
 have a notion of basically a vehicle 

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:10.949
 out about this but with 

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:13.400
 some modernizations and such but not more 

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:13.400
 it is
