sounds fun
earlier<00:00:51.940> on<00:00:52.089> today<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.660> thought<00:00:53.289> I'd<00:00:53.410> just

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
earlier on today I thought I'd just

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.459 
earlier on today I thought I'd just
record<00:00:53.949> some<00:00:54.010> of<00:00:54.280> my<00:00:54.460> thoughts<00:00:54.760> as<00:00:55.030> well<00:00:55.469> this

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
record some of my thoughts as well this

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:57.779 
record some of my thoughts as well this
is<00:00:56.589> it<00:00:56.739> from<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.039> front<00:00:57.219> so<00:00:57.370> you<00:00:57.460> can<00:00:57.609> get<00:00:57.760> a

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
is it from the front so you can get a

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.689 
is it from the front so you can get a
better<00:00:58.480> idea

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
better idea

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.270 
better idea
firstly<00:01:00.699> in<00:01:01.359> terms<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:01.870> packaging<00:01:02.739> it<00:01:03.010> does

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
firstly in terms of packaging it does

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.040 
firstly in terms of packaging it does
come<00:01:03.609> in<00:01:03.730> quite<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:03.909> big<00:01:04.210> box<00:01:04.420> but<00:01:04.690> it's<00:01:04.839> very

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
come in quite a big box but it's very

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.649 
come in quite a big box but it's very
attractively<00:01:05.650> packaged<00:01:06.100> lots<00:01:06.370> of<00:01:06.659> pictures

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
attractively packaged lots of pictures

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.260 
attractively packaged lots of pictures
and<00:01:07.810> illustrations<00:01:08.050> and<00:01:08.860> information<00:01:09.820> so<00:01:10.120> it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
and illustrations and information so it

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.940 
and illustrations and information so it
does<00:01:10.390> make<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.600> really<00:01:10.720> lovely<00:01:11.170> present<00:01:11.710> I

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
does make a really lovely present I

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.429 
does make a really lovely present I
would<00:01:12.909> say<00:01:13.360> I<00:01:13.540> did<00:01:13.780> find<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.079> a<00:01:14.170> little<00:01:14.229> bit

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
would say I did find it a little bit

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.889 
would say I did find it a little bit
hard<00:01:14.649> to<00:01:14.740> get<00:01:14.920> out<00:01:15.130> of<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.520> packaging<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.509> took

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
hard to get out of the packaging it took

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.410 
hard to get out of the packaging it took
me<00:01:17.049> a<00:01:17.079> little<00:01:17.200> while<00:01:17.350> as<00:01:17.799> them<00:01:18.420> children's

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
me a little while as them children's

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.200 
me a little while as them children's
toys<00:01:19.630> often<00:01:20.049> do<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:21.369> there<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:21.670> go<00:01:21.700> once<00:01:22.030> we

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
toys often do but there you go once we

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.060 
toys often do but there you go once we
got<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.540> out<00:01:22.659> it<00:01:23.350> was<00:01:23.500> lovely

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
got it out it was lovely

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.740 
got it out it was lovely
so<00:01:24.399> if<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.579> turn<00:01:24.790> this<00:01:24.909> around<00:01:25.060> now<00:01:25.299> you<00:01:25.329> can<00:01:25.570> see

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
so if I turn this around now you can see

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.039 
so if I turn this around now you can see
the<00:01:25.869> only<00:01:26.049> bit<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.200> construction<00:01:26.920> I<00:01:27.040> had<00:01:27.219> to<00:01:27.369> do

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the only bit of construction I had to do

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.480 
the only bit of construction I had to do
around<00:01:29.049> here

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
around here

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.760 
around here
basically<00:01:31.360> this<00:01:31.659> bit<00:01:31.869> here<00:01:32.049> with<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.439> screws

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
basically this bit here with the screws

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.209 
basically this bit here with the screws
and<00:01:33.430> this<00:01:33.640> ladder<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:35.259> had<00:01:35.439> to<00:01:35.560> attach<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:36.040> on

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
and this ladder we had to attach that on

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.980 
and this ladder we had to attach that on
the<00:01:36.310> back<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.820> fits<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.240> into<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.570> bottom<00:01:37.869> and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
the back it fits it into the bottom and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.749 
the back it fits it into the bottom and
then<00:01:38.170> just<00:01:38.380> tighten<00:01:38.590> up<00:01:38.799> these<00:01:38.950> two<00:01:39.280> screws<00:01:39.610> on

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
then just tighten up these two screws on

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.109 
then just tighten up these two screws on
either<00:01:39.909> side<00:01:40.299> so<00:01:40.979> nothing<00:01:41.979> too<00:01:42.219> stressful

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
either side so nothing too stressful

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.880 
either side so nothing too stressful
there<00:01:43.570> even<00:01:43.930> I<00:01:44.020> managed<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.350> do<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.619> without

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
there even I managed to do that without

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.120 
there even I managed to do that without
too<00:01:45.219> much<00:01:45.399> of<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.700> problem<00:01:46.770> turn<00:01:47.770> it<00:01:47.920> back

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
too much of a problem turn it back

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.880 
too much of a problem turn it back
around<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:49.299> that's<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.810> farm<00:01:50.289> from<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.619> front

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
around so that's the farm from the front

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.130 
around so that's the farm from the front
as<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.159> can<00:01:51.310> see<00:01:51.640> it's<00:01:51.850> got<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.329> little

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
paddock that you can attach on the side

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
thing I particularly like about it is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.030 
thing I particularly like about it is
that<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:16.630> know<00:02:16.720> unlike<00:02:17.050> some<00:02:17.350> kids<00:02:17.770> games

that you know unlike some kids games
this<00:02:18.280> doesn't<00:02:18.580> really<00:02:18.730> give<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.060> any

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
this doesn't really give you any

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.940 
this doesn't really give you any
direction<00:02:19.780> as<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.020> how<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.350> should<00:02:20.650> be
