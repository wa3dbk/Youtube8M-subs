the<00:01:43.170> gas<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> price<00:01:45.110> all<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> gas

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the gas is one of the price all the gas

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.139 
the gas is one of the price all the gas
log<00:01:46.680> splitters<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> smallest<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
log splitters the smallest one so that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.300 
log splitters the smallest one so that
we're<00:01:48.329> finding<00:01:48.630> were<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.930> five<00:01:49.710> six<00:01:49.979> seven

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
we're finding were like five six seven

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.830 
we're finding were like five six seven
hundred<00:01:50.399> dollars<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.570> spend

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
hundred dollars and then you can spend

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.460 
hundred dollars and then you can spend
as<00:01:51.990> much<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.320> want<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.860> gas<00:01:53.729> log<00:01:54.030> splitters

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
as much as you want on gas log splitters

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.780 
as much as you want on gas log splitters
you<00:01:55.470> know<00:01:55.590> once<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.979> start<00:01:56.009> those<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:56.579> run

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you know once you start those they run

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.630 
you know once you start those they run
all<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> time<00:01:57.329> they're<00:01:57.750> noisy<00:01:58.490> but<00:01:59.490> this

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
all the time they're noisy but this

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.069 
all the time they're noisy but this
isn't<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.119> only<00:02:00.240> makes<00:02:00.540> no<00:02:00.689> engine<00:02:00.930> when<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
isn't it only makes no engine when you

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.990 
isn't it only makes no engine when you
turn<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.680> split<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> wood<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.490> mean<00:02:02.670> it's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
turn it on to split the wood I mean it's

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.940 
turn it on to split the wood I mean it's
really<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.479> much<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.680> when<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.920> show

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
really not that much and now when I show

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.359 
really not that much and now when I show
you<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.369> my<00:02:05.490> video<00:02:05.820> we're<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> little<00:02:06.420> bit<00:02:06.570> my

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
you on my video we're in a little bit my

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.529 
you on my video we're in a little bit my
iPhone's<00:02:08.369> gonna<00:02:08.640> pick<00:02:08.819> up<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.030> lot<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.270> noise

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
iPhone's gonna pick up a lot of noise

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.210 
iPhone's gonna pick up a lot of noise
from<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:09.989> because<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.649> mic<00:02:10.860> can't

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
from it just because it's a mic can't

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.920 
from it just because it's a mic can't
picks<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.550> everything<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.569> really<00:02:12.810> not

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
picks up everything but just really not

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.210 
picks up everything but just really not
loud<00:02:13.140> at<00:02:13.290> all

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
loud at all

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.030 
loud at all
like<00:02:16.060> said<00:02:16.269> I<00:02:16.540> did<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:16.989> lot<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.260> research<00:02:17.500> on

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
like said I did a lot of research on

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.309 
like said I did a lot of research on
this<00:02:18.340> log<00:02:18.579> splitter<00:02:18.790> itself<00:02:19.299> I<00:02:19.780> probably<00:02:20.140> read

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
this log splitter itself I probably read

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.929 
this log splitter itself I probably read
over<00:02:20.530> 300<00:02:21.010> reviews<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.610> they<00:02:21.670> were<00:02:21.760> all

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
over 300 reviews and they were all

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.880 
over 300 reviews and they were all
really<00:02:22.209> really<00:02:22.329> good<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:23.230> only<00:02:23.439> thing<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.709> lot

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
bad thing to say about it

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.929 
bad thing to say about it
I<00:03:10.659> mean<00:03:10.950> maybe<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.189> it<00:03:12.310> came<00:03:12.459> from<00:03:12.489> Harbor

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
I mean maybe that it came from Harbor

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.369 
I mean maybe that it came from Harbor
Freight<00:03:13.120> but<00:03:13.389> Harbor<00:03:13.689> Freight<00:03:13.870> usually<00:03:14.290> has

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
Freight but Harbor Freight usually has

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.649 
Freight but Harbor Freight usually has
some<00:03:14.530> pretty<00:03:14.680> good<00:03:14.859> stuff<00:03:15.129> so<00:03:15.549> check<00:03:16.389> it<00:03:16.510> out

you see what it does now there is one

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.830 
you see what it does now there is one
function<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.729> this<00:03:57.909> log<00:03:58.120> splitter<00:03:58.389> that<00:03:58.569> they

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
function of this log splitter that they

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.569 
function of this log splitter that they
don't<00:03:59.019> tell<00:03:59.229> you<00:03:59.379> in<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> operators<00:04:00.010> manual<00:04:00.340> I

don't tell you in the operators manual I

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.619 
don't tell you in the operators manual I
believe<00:04:00.849> is<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:02.799> actually<00:04:03.190> does<00:04:03.639> have<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> dual

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
believe is it actually does have a dual

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.839 
believe is it actually does have a dual

speed function now what you have to do

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.409 
speed function now what you have to do
is<00:04:07.120> hit<00:04:07.959> your<00:04:08.260> power<00:04:08.590> button<00:04:08.979> and<00:04:09.239> pull<00:04:10.239> down

your handle about that far and then
you'll<00:04:12.459> see<00:04:12.639> it<00:04:12.729> it<00:04:12.819> up<00:04:12.940> shoot<00:04:13.180> at<00:04:13.299> forward<00:04:13.659> if

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
you'll see it it up shoot at forward if

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.839 
you'll see it it up shoot at forward if
you<00:04:14.590> pull<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:14.829> down<00:04:14.979> all<00:04:15.129> the<00:04:15.220> way<00:04:15.310> from<00:04:15.579> slow

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
you pull it down all the way from slow

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.789 
you pull it down all the way from slow
up<00:04:15.970> show<00:04:16.180> you
