content<00:01:42.600> start<00:01:43.140> let's<00:01:43.560> say<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.369> know

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
content start let's say I don't know

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.700 
content start let's say I don't know
give<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> date<00:01:45.270> let's<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.960> pretend<00:01:46.259> it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
give it a date let's just pretend it's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.490 
give it a date let's just pretend it's
going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.600> 23rd<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.380> going

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
going to be the 23rd and then it's going

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.219 
going to be the 23rd and then it's going
to<00:01:49.560> end<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.549> 6th<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.360> January<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.020> what

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
to end on the 6th of January that's what

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.870 
to end on the 6th of January that's what
it<00:01:52.290> would<00:01:52.380> say<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> an<00:01:53.820> example

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it would say there so that is an example

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.580 
it would say there so that is an example
of<00:01:54.270> what<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.540> shows<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.439> have

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
of what it shows there and then we have

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.399 
of what it shows there and then we have
also<00:01:55.829> snow<00:01:56.340> texture<00:01:56.820> threshold<00:01:57.390> value<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
also snow texture threshold value and

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.200 
also snow texture threshold value and
then<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.009> value<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
then we have that value so you have a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.880 
then we have that value so you have a
texture<00:02:00.659> threshold<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.170> how<00:02:01.320> many<00:02:01.590> how<00:02:01.770> much

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
texture threshold of how many how much

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.670 
texture threshold of how many how much
snow<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.299> guess<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> air<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
snow can be I guess in the air on the

ground now in addition to that coding we

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.350 
ground now in addition to that coding we
also<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.710> another<00:02:08.489> piece<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:09.000> coding<00:02:09.300> that

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
also have another piece of coding that

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900 
also have another piece of coding that

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.060 
I'm going to break this down for you
guys<00:02:28.240> because<00:02:28.420> apparently<00:02:29.050> we<00:02:29.740> have<00:02:29.770> always

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
guys because apparently we have always

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.920 
guys because apparently we have always
thought<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.520> cops<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.360> crooks<00:02:31.540> was<00:02:31.780> going

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
thought that cops and crooks was going

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.660 
thought that cops and crooks was going
to<00:02:31.990> be<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.200> name<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.740> DLC<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.370> then

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
to be the name of the DLC and then

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.490 
to be the name of the DLC and then
heists<00:02:34.120> would<00:02:34.510> be<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.780> addition<00:02:34.990> would<00:02:35.290> be<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
heists would be in addition would be a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.550 
heists would be in addition would be a

it<00:02:38.860> seems<00:02:39.250> as<00:02:39.400> if<00:02:39.520> cops<00:02:39.910> crooks<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.660> going<00:02:41.140> to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
it seems as if cops crooks is going to

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.040 
it seems as if cops crooks is going to
be<00:02:41.350> its<00:02:41.530> own<00:02:41.680> separate<00:02:42.430> type<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.940> DLC<00:02:43.480> that
