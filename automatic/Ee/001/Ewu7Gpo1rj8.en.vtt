00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
that people or using or pretty much

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.759

abusing in order to make profit so

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.560 
abusing in order to make profit so
personally<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.310> don't<00:00:23.369> think<00:00:23.640> those<00:00:24.000> methods

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
personally I don't think those methods

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.310 
personally I don't think those methods
should<00:00:24.930> exist<00:00:25.410> um<00:00:26.029> but<00:00:27.029> they<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.289> think

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
should exist um but they do and I think

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.529 
should exist um but they do and I think
everyone<00:00:29.160> should<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.519> aware<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.119> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
go to the wilderness it can not pretty

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.999 
go to the wilderness it can not pretty

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
level 4 they get the 25 resource which

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.240 
level 4 they get the 25 resource which
is<00:01:26.009> very<00:01:26.610> easy<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> come<00:01:29.040> back

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
is very easy and one can do it come back

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.800 
is very easy and one can do it come back
and<00:01:29.520> then<00:01:29.880> sell<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.659> 1.5<00:01:31.140> million<00:01:31.590> GP<00:01:32.040> each<00:01:32.189> um

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
and then sell for 1.5 million GP each um

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.569 
and then sell for 1.5 million GP each um
so<00:01:33.810> that's<00:01:33.990> already<00:01:34.259> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> overpowered<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
so that's already kind of overpowered it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.580 
so that's already kind of overpowered it
takes<00:01:35.759> approximately<00:01:35.939> 5<00:01:36.780> minute<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
takes approximately 5 minute to do it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.859 
takes approximately 5 minute to do it
you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.220> 3<00:01:38.579> times<00:01:38.610> per<00:01:39.119> day<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
you can do it 3 times per day but the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.550 
you can do it 3 times per day but the
over<00:01:40.259> power<00:01:40.880> thing<00:01:41.880> even<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.630> top<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.350> is

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
over power thing even on top of that is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130 
over power thing even on top of that is
that<00:01:44.159> people<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.880> making<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.450> only<00:01:45.509> one

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that people are making not only one

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.889 
that people are making not only one
alternative<00:01:46.500> account<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:48.030> multiple<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.750> them

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
alternative account but multiple of them

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.160

ninety-one<00:02:14.200> runecrafting<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.890> probably<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
ninety-one runecrafting is probably the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.060 
ninety-one runecrafting is probably the
most<00:02:15.580> common<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.080> they<00:02:17.230> make<00:02:17.440> double<00:02:17.830> mats

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
most common one so they make double mats

I've made into Josi
by<00:02:23.230> transferring<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.920> gold<00:02:24.310> it's<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.510> legit

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
by transferring the gold it's a legit

way<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.140> make<00:02:26.320> profit<00:02:27.010> IX<00:02:27.430> I've<00:02:27.670> said<00:02:28.270> that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
way to make profit IX I've said that

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.650 
way to make profit IX I've said that
it's<00:02:28.750> allowed<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.580> morally<00:02:31.120> allowed<00:02:31.420> then

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
it's allowed is it morally allowed then

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.840 
it's allowed is it morally allowed then
that's<00:02:32.260> another<00:02:32.560> story<00:02:32.890> but<00:02:33.160> people<00:02:33.670> are

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
that's another story but people are

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.130 
that's another story but people are
making<00:02:34.330> easily<00:02:34.930> 10<00:02:35.260> million<00:02:35.740> GP<00:02:36.130> per<00:02:36.880> hour<00:02:37.150> by

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
making easily 10 million GP per hour by

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.350 
making easily 10 million GP per hour by
crafting<00:02:38.620> double<00:02:38.950> major<00:02:39.220> wounds<00:02:39.550> um<00:02:39.760> now<00:02:40.300> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
crafting double major wounds um now the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.540 
crafting double major wounds um now the
price<00:02:40.750> may<00:02:41.170> have<00:02:41.320> varied<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:42.010> little<00:02:42.280> bit

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
price may have varied a little bit

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.970 
price may have varied a little bit
because<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.420> Lagasse<00:02:43.870> mode<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.830> can

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
because of the Lagasse mode but you can

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.850 
because of the Lagasse mode but you can
still<00:02:45.280> make<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.760> big<00:02:46.180> chunk<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.720> money<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.380> on

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
still make a big chunk of money and on

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.490 
still make a big chunk of money and on
top<00:02:48.160> of<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.340> wall<00:02:49.030> playing<00:02:49.330> seven<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.140> can

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
top of that wall playing seven you can

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.670 
top of that wall playing seven you can
play<00:02:50.920> Josi<00:02:51.820> at<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.030> same<00:02:52.330> time<00:02:52.600> for<00:02:52.930> even<00:02:53.410> more

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
play Josi at the same time for even more

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.240 
play Josi at the same time for even more
profit<00:02:53.740> and<00:02:55.380> finally<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.530> third<00:02:56.800> method<00:02:56.980> is

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
profit and finally the third method is

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.550 
profit and finally the third method is
bypassing<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.180> G<00:02:58.360> limit<00:02:58.810> with<00:02:59.020> multiple

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
bypassing the G limit with multiple

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.350 
bypassing the G limit with multiple
accounts<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.250> once<00:03:00.430> again<00:03:00.580> it's<00:03:00.820> not<00:03:00.910> really<00:03:01.090> a

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
accounts so once again it's not really a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.150 
accounts so once again it's not really a
method<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:01.840> really<00:03:02.140> like<00:03:02.380> about<00:03:02.410> prints<00:03:02.950> cape

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
method I really like about prints cape

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.190 
method I really like about prints cape
but<00:03:03.520> so<00:03:03.730> many<00:03:03.820> people<00:03:04.270> are<00:03:04.390> using<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.990> right

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
but so many people are using it right

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.930 
but so many people are using it right
now<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.830> long<00:03:05.980> story<00:03:06.220> short<00:03:06.580> they<00:03:06.730> make

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
now so long story short they make

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.300 
now so long story short they make
secondary<00:03:07.810> account<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.380> they<00:03:08.470> put<00:03:08.680> offer<00:03:08.890> on

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
secondary account and they put offer on

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.190 
secondary account and they put offer on

that their price is very low because of

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.430 
that their price is very low because of
the<00:03:19.150> limit<00:03:19.510> but<00:03:19.630> if<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.900> have<00:03:20.020> multiple

mentioned now with the bounds you can
simply<00:04:04.239> make<00:04:04.420> their<00:04:04.690> alternative<00:04:05.440> account

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
make profit on it and then buy a bound

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
make profit on it and then buy a bound
and<00:04:09.660> it's<00:04:10.660> basically<00:04:11.050> pure<00:04:11.610> runescape<00:04:12.610> profit

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
and it's basically pure runescape profit

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.640 
and it's basically pure runescape profit
it<00:04:13.209> doesn't<00:04:13.510> cost<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.900> anything<00:04:14.230> in<00:04:14.500> real
