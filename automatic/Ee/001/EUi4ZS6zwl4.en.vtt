legs I've noticed the knees bend a

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.649 
legs I've noticed the knees bend a
little<00:02:30.159> bit<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:30.790> due<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.090> way<00:02:31.269> this<00:02:31.480> is

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
little bit but due to the way this is

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.369 
little bit but due to the way this is
designed<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:32.319> really<00:02:32.769> is<00:02:33.150> limited<00:02:34.379> knees

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
designed it really is limited knees

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.630 
designed it really is limited knees
rotate<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.549> that<00:02:38.040> foot<00:02:39.040> goes<00:02:39.190> up<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.549> down

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
rotate like that foot goes up and down

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.190 
rotate like that foot goes up and down
don't<00:02:40.000> think<00:02:40.180> everyone<00:02:40.540> want<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.780> use<00:02:40.930> that
