00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.390
 two 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.809
 The jigsaw is a tool 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.880
 electrical that is used to perform 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.880
 straight and curved cuts on wood 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.300
 plastic fiberglass and even 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.300
 metals 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.240
 It is composed of a switch 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.250
 a button that leaves the operation fixed 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.660
 a hilt 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.530
 a speed control 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:42.700
 a protective housing for the needle 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.250
 a tilting base has angles 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.780
 a guide to make parallel cuts 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.579
 a dust traction port 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.469
 a led light guide 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.769
 and the cable to connect to the 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.769
 electricity 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.910
 the blades for the jig saw are 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.769
 differ by the amount of teeth to 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.560
 Higher number of teeth per inch more 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.840
 fine and precise will be the cut and between 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.689
 less teeth faster and worn 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.200
 will be the cut for example a sheet of 21 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.240
 19 or eighteen teeth is ideal for 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.530
 contour closed curves in wood or 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.530
 low thickness agglomerates 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.560
 these sheets are also used for metals 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.719
 and plastics the 21 teeth plus 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.550
 short aluminum and stainless steel 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:34.670
 up to 3 millimeters thick 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.110
 and the 18 and 19 mm can cut 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.110
 plastic and fiberglass 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.010
 instead a sheet with fewer teeth per 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.840
 inch for example once six eight o 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.880
 ten teeth allows one more draft 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.610
 wide and a fast movement of the leaf 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.970
 ideal for hard coarse woods or with 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.970
 knots 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.650
 before you start cutting the wood there 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.290
 to put on a mask for dust 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.940
 hearing aids to protect the ears 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.130
 and gloves 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.170
 to use the jigsaw it must be 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.240
 think the material to work and trace 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.910
 on wood the cutting line to 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.040
 follow if it's a curved cut is not 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.960
 you need a guide but if you are going to make a 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.220
 Straight cut is recommended to use the 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.220
 parallel cutting guide 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.190
 then with the tool unplugged 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.780
 you have to adjust the sheet this is done 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.090
 pushing up the mechanism of 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.100
 replacement of the sheet and inserting the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.220
 new with the teeth facing towards the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.220
 front 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.510
 If you want to be a cut at an angle there 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.850
 to tilt the base of the square to 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.680
 regulate it if you use the hexagonal wrench 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.450
 loosening the screws of the bracket and 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.420
 placing them in the angle you want 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.420
 Cutting can be from 0 to 45 degrees 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.280
 you can also regulate the movement of 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.500
 Cutting the blade by adjusting the handle 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.160
 from 0 to 3 depending on the wood that 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.740
 it is working 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.810
 In the case of agglomerates , a 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.310
 cut from top to bottom leaving the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.680
 yellow to zero position 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.650
 When the wood is hard you can choose 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.690
 between position 1 to 3 so you have 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.370
 a pendular movement this so that the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.370
 leaf moving in development way 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.190
 the right position to work with the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.560
 saw jigsaw is standing with the cable 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.360
 electric back leaning over 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.450
 the machine without exerting pressure and 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.340
 maintaining a constant speed the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.890
 saw must move slowly 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.150
 progressing regularly according to 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.060
 sound 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.120
 of the motor because the blade locks in the 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.010
 wood and you have to slow down with 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.019
 the opposite if the sounds are kept 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.379
 evenly you can increase the strength of 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.379
 push 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.540
 When you finish cutting, do not let go 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.500
 the saw until the blade has 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.500
 stopped completely
