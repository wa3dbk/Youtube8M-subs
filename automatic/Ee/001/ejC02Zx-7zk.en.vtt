 this is a nice and nice ball if 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.280
 he wants to learn how to make this ball 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.100
 want to know this video to start 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.580
 we will need a ball of 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.760
 medium or large rubber a big close 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.820
 thread and needle the thread of preference of 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.160
 same color of the scissors close and a little 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.590
 of sweets since we have all of our 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.770
 materials now what we 're going to do is 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.020
 take our little ball and we're going to 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.810
 deflate the and with the help of our 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.630
 scissors let's cut it but girls 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.539
 be careful how they go to 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.130
 start trimming good if your ball 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.009
 has some design or something like a 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.870
 face the closure can be perfect as 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.640
 in the form of a smile 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.710
 but mine for example I'm going to 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.530
 cut and I'm going to put this closure 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.530
 now we must proceed to deflate the 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.100
 and here we have unemployed our 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.850
 ball now what we are going to do is 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.960
 grab our closure and you have good 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.760
 that put it in the middle of where is the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.370
 hole where the lid of the 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.380
 ball the stopper we are going to place it 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.720
 we check more or less how we want it 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.550
 how we want it to be and we are going to 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.430
 mark it with the help of our 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.280
 permanent marker be very careful 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.780
 and where they are going to mark will be the place where 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.730
 your closing will be 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.160
 you can not go wrong 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.550
 If they want guys, they can ask for help. 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.530
 for example is what I'm going to do since 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.000
 they have finished marking their ball 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.790
 now what they have to do 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.070
 just cut it out just have 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.710
 careful not to go over the brand of 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.220
 where they had already established and we started 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.220
 to cut 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.810
 since we finished trimming 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.810
 we can realize that here 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.799
 this space is left 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.290
 he has this leftover ball where 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:52.090
 we can just cut it 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.819
 ready and it was our ball now if 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.730
 The only thing left for us to do is take 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.849
 our closure with what to do with 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.530
 Help needle and thread girls are not 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.319
 forget to do this with much much 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.750
 careful because you can get to cum 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.060
 still a little more than what you 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.840
 they cut if they want to stop a little 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.549
 you can put some other kim in the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.760
 corners so that they do not reach 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:22.379
 run and be very father your ball now 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.379
 yes you have to start sewing 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.609
 ready girl that we have here our 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:39.439
 close the ball is already that also the 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.959
 thread the color of the thread because it looks more 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.510
 father in blue you check what color 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.930
 his ball looks best on your to well 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.799
 remains 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.799
 you open it 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.280
 and you can close it, be very careful 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.540
 girl that is not going to be ugly 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.430
 Now all that's left is to place the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.430
 sweets inside we grab our sweets 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.659
 and let's get into our beanbag 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.659
 the greens of our balls 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.890
 it's up to you how many sweets 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.010
 want to put your little ball how 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.780
 they want to have it and of course the 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.400
 candy that that person likes 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.400
 you think giving him his ball 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.310
 it gets 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.720
 the normal needle 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.720
 and these girls 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.810
 we have this nice candy store where they can 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.810
 open it 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.889
 and take out a sweet here we have a little 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.180
 more of sweets 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.180
 to put 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.680
 now the only thing that remains is its 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.259
 creativity 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.419
 they need if you have markers 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:08.240
 permanents of different colors better 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:12.009
 but I have this one that is black 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.009
 and here is 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.550
 record on your ball 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.680
 simply 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.940
 write something nice draw on something 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.750
 beautiful 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.960
 and let's see how it is not to improvise a 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.960
 little bit 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.199
 and that's how small my little ball is 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.199
 you can if you like this 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:02.740
 decoration only need a down 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.259
 permanent black and a little ribbon that 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.530
 it understands a meter that's enough for them and 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.530

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.420
