spin<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.679> works<00:00:31.890> very<00:00:32.279> similar<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.700> blackout

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
spin it works very similar to blackout

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.380 
spin it works very similar to blackout
in<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:35.070> doesn't<00:00:35.340> keep<00:00:35.520> spinning<00:00:36.120> when

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
in that it doesn't keep spinning when

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.490 
in that it doesn't keep spinning when
you<00:00:36.480> let<00:00:36.660> go<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:38.540> now<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.750> work<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
you let go of it now they do work in the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.170 
you let go of it now they do work in the
forward<00:00:40.860> position<00:00:41.040> other<00:00:41.670> work<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.059> any

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
forward position other work in any

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.740 
forward position other work in any
position<00:00:43.100> which<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.250> nice<00:00:44.750> there's

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
position which is nice there's

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.479 
position which is nice there's
transformation<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.559> pretty<00:00:46.800> straightforward

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
transformation is pretty straightforward

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:56.290 
transformation is pretty straightforward
and<00:00:48.120> most<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.079> its<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> legs<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:52.260> start

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.630 

let's<00:00:57.300> start<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.809> take<00:00:58.020> either<00:00:58.590> side<00:00:58.949> sorry

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
let's start just take either side sorry

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.210 
let's start just take either side sorry
it<00:00:59.969> does<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.480> London<00:01:00.840> gay<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.320> fold<00:01:01.770> better

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.710 

so<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> start<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.820> take<00:01:05.970> either<00:01:06.150> side<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> the

so to start just take either side of the
bottom<00:01:07.409> half<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> plane<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.820> split<00:01:09.540> that

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
bottom half of the plane and split that

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.359 
bottom half of the plane and split that
extend<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.450> out<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.500> become<00:01:13.680> his

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
extend it out on what will become his

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.450 
extend it out on what will become his
thighs<00:01:17.720> legs<00:01:18.720> back<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.619> look<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.979> gray

thighs legs back here this look a gray
piece<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.270> flips<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.009> over<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
piece here just flips up and over the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.499 
piece here just flips up and over the
back<00:01:24.960> piece<00:01:25.200> comes<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
back piece comes out and as you do so it

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.410 
back piece comes out and as you do so it
will<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.250> flush<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.390> the

lowers<00:01:35.220> down<00:01:35.250> slightly<00:01:35.960> just<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> get<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
lowers down slightly just to get a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.340 
lowers down slightly just to get a
clearance<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.310> locks<00:01:38.579> into<00:01:38.820> place<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:40.110> just

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
clearance that locks into place and just

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.030 
clearance that locks into place and just
take<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> nose<00:01:40.860> cone<00:01:41.100> here<00:01:41.369> push<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.000> out<00:01:43.040> do

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
take the nose cone here push that out do

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.880 
take the nose cone here push that out do
the<00:01:44.159> same<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.700> side<00:01:45.409> trophies<00:01:46.409> goes<00:01:46.619> over

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the same on this side trophies goes over

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.899 
the same on this side trophies goes over
this<00:01:47.549> comes<00:01:47.820> out

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.340 

fudge<00:01:56.259> and<00:01:57.259> then<00:01:57.530> at<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.979> thigh<00:01:59.200> rotate<00:02:00.200> that

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
fudge and then at the thigh rotate that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.020 
fudge and then at the thigh rotate that
down<00:02:01.750> straighten<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.840> legs<00:02:03.110> out<00:02:03.759> same<00:02:04.759> again

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
down straighten the legs out same again

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:14.350 
down straighten the legs out same again
here<00:02:10.030> then<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.390> wings<00:02:11.599> and<00:02:12.819> see<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:14.150> gray

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
here then on the wings and see the gray

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.979 
here then on the wings and see the gray
so<00:02:15.349> this<00:02:15.620> sort<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.310> medium<00:02:16.790> gray<00:02:17.030> color<00:02:17.330> going

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
so this sort of medium gray color going

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.740 
so this sort of medium gray color going
into<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.319> light<00:02:18.500> gray<00:02:18.799> just<00:02:19.790> taps<00:02:20.330> apart

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
into the light gray just taps apart

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.449 
into the light gray just taps apart
they're<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:25.280> pull<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.579> whole<00:02:25.760> thing<00:02:25.790> out

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
they're just pull the whole thing out

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.900 
they're just pull the whole thing out
turn<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.959> bring<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:29.989> down<00:02:30.110> slightly<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
turn it and bring it down slightly the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.780 
turn it and bring it down slightly the
rotor<00:02:32.120> section<00:02:32.630> just<00:02:33.280> slots<00:02:34.280> into<00:02:34.519> their

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
rotor section just slots into their

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.940 
rotor section just slots into their
making<00:02:35.720> his<00:02:35.870> own<00:02:36.579> sim<00:02:37.579> again<00:02:37.819> over<00:02:38.060> here<00:02:41.950> and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
making his own sim again over here and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.339 
making his own sim again over here and
then<00:02:43.250> finally<00:02:43.849> for<00:02:44.230> pipe<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:46.900> bring<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:47.930> down
