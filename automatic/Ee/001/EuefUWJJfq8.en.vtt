00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.170 
away with it the answer lies in a legal
concept<00:04:13.940> known<00:04:14.750> as<00:04:14.980> standard<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.100> care<00:04:16.400> the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
concept known as standard of care the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.120 
concept known as standard of care the
standard<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.630> care<00:04:17.810> is<00:04:17.989> based<00:04:18.260> on<00:04:18.500> what<00:04:18.739> do

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
standard of care is based on what do

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.000 
standard of care is based on what do
other<00:04:19.340> doctors<00:04:19.910> do<00:04:20.180> what<00:04:20.540> would<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.690> reasonable

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
other doctors do what would a reasonable

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.900 
other doctors do what would a reasonable
physician<00:04:22.010> do<00:04:22.190> in<00:04:22.370> this<00:04:22.490> situation<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:23.540> and

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
physician do in this situation and and

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.880 
physician do in this situation and and
the<00:04:25.910> reality<00:04:26.210> is<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.570> what<00:04:27.020> most<00:04:27.530> physicians

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
the reality is that what most physicians

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.450 
the reality is that what most physicians
do<00:04:28.460> is<00:04:28.760> prescribe<00:04:29.740> medications<00:04:30.740> as<00:04:31.100> long<00:04:31.310> as

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
do is prescribe medications as long as

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.890 
do is prescribe medications as long as
they've<00:04:31.640> done<00:04:31.850> their<00:04:32.000> paperwork<00:04:32.330> properly

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
they've done their paperwork properly

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.710 
they've done their paperwork properly
and<00:04:33.020> documented<00:04:33.590> that<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:34.669> this<00:04:35.120> child<00:04:35.419> had

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
and documented that that this child had

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.390 
and documented that that this child had
the<00:04:36.140> symptoms<00:04:36.590> that<00:04:36.800> led<00:04:37.010> them<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.220> this

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
the symptoms that led them to this

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.370 
the symptoms that led them to this
conclusion<00:04:37.640> they<00:04:38.150> appear<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.660> be<00:04:38.780> completely

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
conclusion they appear to be completely

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.620 
conclusion they appear to be completely
protected<00:04:39.890> from<00:04:40.100> any<00:04:40.310> kind<00:04:40.790> of<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.030> lawsuit<00:04:41.240> as

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
protected from any kind of a lawsuit as

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.730 
protected from any kind of a lawsuit as
a<00:04:42.080> result<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:43.040> standard<00:04:43.520> of<00:04:43.669> care<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.740> what

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
a result the standard of care is what

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.870 
a result the standard of care is what
allows<00:04:46.130> doctors<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:47.800> seriously<00:04:48.800> injure<00:04:49.100> or

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
allows doctors to seriously injure or

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.560 
allows doctors to seriously injure or
even<00:04:50.810> kill<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.470> patient<00:04:51.940> with<00:04:52.940> total<00:04:53.360> impunity

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
even kill a patient with total impunity

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.830 
even kill a patient with total impunity
so<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.650> standard<00:04:55.100> of<00:04:55.220> care<00:04:55.280> now<00:04:55.790> has<00:04:56.419> been

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
so the standard of care now has been

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.770 
so the standard of care now has been
implemented<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:58.370> where<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:59.300> can<00:04:59.540> get<00:04:59.660> away
