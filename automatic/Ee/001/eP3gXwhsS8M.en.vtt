thought it'd make a perfect dupe for
this<00:01:13.609> little<00:01:13.909> brush<00:01:14.090> if<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.990> don't<00:01:15.679> want<00:01:15.890> so

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
this little brush if you don't want so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.270 
this little brush if you don't want so
actually<00:01:16.549> buy<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.479> whole<00:01:17.899> set<00:01:18.259> just<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.100> get

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
actually buy the whole set just to get

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.310 
actually buy the whole set just to get
this<00:01:19.429> little<00:01:19.820> brush<00:01:20.030> or<00:01:20.539> you<00:01:20.810> don't<00:01:20.960> want<00:01:21.200> a

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
this little brush or you don't want a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.249 
this little brush or you don't want a
mini<00:01:21.789> brush<00:01:22.789> you'd<00:01:23.060> sooner<00:01:23.359> have<00:01:23.509> a<00:01:23.539> full-size

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
they've always washed well I had no

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:46.719 
they've always washed well I had no
shedding<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.069> they've<00:01:46.219> always<00:01:46.369> gone<00:01:46.609> back

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
shedding and they've always gone back

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.270 
shedding and they've always gone back
into<00:01:46.939> shape<00:01:47.380> but<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.469> can't<00:01:48.710> recommend<00:01:49.009> these

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
into shape but I can't recommend these

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.249 
into shape but I can't recommend these
look<00:01:49.999> at<00:01:50.149> this<00:01:50.299> little<00:01:50.509> brush<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.109> this

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
look at this little brush and this

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.099 
look at this little brush and this
enough<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:53.020> really<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.469> flat<00:01:55.869> type<00:01:56.869> of

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
enough I really like the flat type of

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.620 
enough I really like the flat type of
brushes<00:01:57.499> for<00:01:57.740> blending<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.549> because<00:01:59.479> these

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
brushes for blending and because these

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.279 
brushes for blending and because these
are<00:01:59.869> quite<00:02:00.200> dense<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.889> feels<00:02:01.459> like<00:02:02.049> you<00:02:03.049> really

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
are quite dense it feels like you really

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.349 
are quite dense it feels like you really
are<00:02:03.469> blending<00:02:04.100> them<00:02:04.249> for<00:02:04.520> me<00:02:04.639> the<00:02:04.819> product<00:02:05.029> out

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
are blending them for me the product out

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.249 
are blending them for me the product out
rather<00:02:06.319> than<00:02:06.590> an<00:02:06.709> angle<00:02:07.009> brush<00:02:07.479> but<00:02:08.479> yeah<00:02:08.929> they

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
rather than an angle brush but yeah they

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.820 
rather than an angle brush but yeah they
are<00:02:09.380> slightly<00:02:09.619> different<00:02:11.440> just<00:02:12.440> show<00:02:12.770> you

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
are slightly different just show you

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.510

they<00:02:13.010> are<00:02:13.040> quite<00:02:13.730> different<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:16.250> is

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
they are quite different and this is

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.020

quite<00:02:16.819> flat<00:02:17.739> whereas<00:02:18.739> this<00:02:18.890> has<00:02:19.280> kind<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.909> a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
quite flat whereas this has kind of a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.540 
quite flat whereas this has kind of a
little<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:21.200> know<00:02:21.319> it's<00:02:21.530> flat<00:02:21.860> but<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.159> has<00:02:22.280> got

little you know it's flat but it has got
a little<00:02:22.850> bit<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.440> top<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.800> but<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.070> is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
a little bit of a top to it but it is

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.930 
a little bit of a top to it but it is
well<00:02:26.450> here<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.770> quite<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.190> flat<00:02:28.550> brush<00:02:28.880> and

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
well here it is quite a flat brush and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.850 
well here it is quite a flat brush and
this<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.420> probably<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.840> little<00:02:29.960> bit<00:02:30.230> wider<00:02:30.470> and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
this is probably a little bit wider and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.800 
this is probably a little bit wider and
this<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.160> more<00:02:31.370> straighter<00:02:31.760> but<00:02:32.450> they<00:02:32.600> work

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
this is more straighter but they work

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.380 
this is more straighter but they work
equally<00:02:33.530> as<00:02:33.620> well<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.370> think<00:02:34.910> this<00:02:35.090> is<00:02:35.240> just

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
equally as well and I think this is just

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.800 
equally as well and I think this is just
a<00:02:35.660> really<00:02:36.140> nice<00:02:36.410> dupe<00:02:37.090> for<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.240> brush<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:38.780> you
