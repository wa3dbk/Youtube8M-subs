00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.399 
this base a lot before I attacked it and
I<00:01:35.670> noticed<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.119> top<00:01:36.390> side<00:01:36.659> was<00:01:37.049> very

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
I noticed that this top side was very

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.410 
I noticed that this top side was very
vulnerable<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.369> minions<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:38.970> he<00:01:39.119> had<00:01:39.240> two

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
vulnerable to minions because he had two

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.850 
vulnerable to minions because he had two
cannons<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.110> who<00:01:40.290> can't<00:01:40.590> target

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
cannons right there who can't target

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.010 
cannons right there who can't target
minions<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.369> all<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.970> he<00:01:42.000> has<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> low<00:01:42.689> range

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
minions at all and he has a low range

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.319 
minions at all and he has a low range
wizard<00:01:43.409> tower<00:01:43.590> which<00:01:44.340> either<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.090> place

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
wizard tower which either way if I place

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.840 
wizard tower which either way if I place
a<00:01:45.570> Archer<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.979> wouldn't<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.610> range

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
a Archer there it wouldn't be in range

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.600 
a Archer there it wouldn't be in range
so<00:01:48.299> yeah<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> pretty<00:01:49.649> much<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.130> set

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so yeah that was a pretty much a set

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
so yeah that was a pretty much a set
probably<00:01:51.360> ten<00:01:51.750> percent<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:52.500> or<00:01:52.740> maybe

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
probably ten percent up there or maybe

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.490 
probably ten percent up there or maybe
even<00:01:53.399> less<00:01:54.090> than<00:01:54.329> ten<00:01:54.509> percent<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.470> I

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
even less than ten percent but then I

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.050 
even less than ten percent but then I
worked<00:01:55.770> my<00:01:55.920> way<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.100> put<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> minion<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
worked my way I put the minion on the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.179 
worked my way I put the minion on the
spell<00:01:57.270> factory<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.990> i<00:01:58.469> luckily<00:01:58.799> had<00:01:58.979> an

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
spell factory and i luckily had an

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
spell factory and i luckily had an
archer<00:01:59.729> out<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.119> range<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.540> arch<00:02:00.719> tower

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
archer out of range of that arch tower

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.319 
archer out of range of that arch tower
on<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.409> gold<00:02:02.130> mount<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.460> far<00:02:02.790> left<00:02:03.090> now

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
on the gold mount on the far left now

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.359 
on the gold mount on the far left now
i'm<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.780> speed<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
i'm just going to speed this up and I

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.520 
i'm just going to speed this up and I
clutched<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.299> now<00:02:06.450> both<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.840> these<00:02:06.930> raids<00:02:07.259> I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
clutched it now both of these raids I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.529 
clutched it now both of these raids I
need<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.009> two<00:02:08.250> stars<00:02:08.550> because<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.479> were

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
need to get two stars because they were

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.449 
need to get two stars because they were
previously<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.349> star<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.979> that's<00:02:11.160> what<00:02:11.280> i<00:02:11.310> get

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
previously one star so that's what i get

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.830 
previously one star so that's what i get
for<00:02:11.520> attacking<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.270> late<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> war<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
for attacking so late in the war I

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.530 
for attacking so late in the war I
probably

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
probably

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.119 
probably
act<00:02:13.659> I<00:02:13.870> think<00:02:14.049> I<00:02:14.140> attacked<00:02:14.409> with<00:02:14.680> like<00:02:14.799> five

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
act I think I attacked with like five

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.459 
act I think I attacked with like five
hours<00:02:15.159> left<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.909> war<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:17.049> I<00:02:17.079> had<00:02:17.319> to

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
hours left in the war and so I had to

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.890 
hours left in the war and so I had to
get<00:02:17.650> these<00:02:17.829> extra<00:02:18.189> stars<00:02:18.459> for<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.060> clan<00:02:19.569> now<00:02:19.870> i

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
get these extra stars for the clan now i

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.869 
get these extra stars for the clan now i
got<00:02:20.140> fifty<00:02:20.290> percent<00:02:20.709> right<00:02:20.950> there<00:02:21.219> it<00:02:21.700> was<00:02:21.819> a

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
got fifty percent right there it was a

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.369 
got fifty percent right there it was a
pretty<00:02:22.120> close<00:02:22.390> war<00:02:22.780> but<00:02:22.959> now<00:02:23.049> we're<00:02:23.170> heading

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
pretty close war but now we're heading

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.140 
pretty close war but now we're heading
on<00:02:23.469> to<00:02:23.500> our<00:02:23.709> second<00:02:24.040> attack<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.849> i'm<00:02:24.969> going<00:02:25.090> to

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
on to our second attack and i'm going to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.000 
on to our second attack and i'm going to
be<00:02:25.239> using<00:02:25.269> go<00:02:25.719> wee-wee<00:02:26.109> against<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.590> same<00:02:26.829> guy

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
be using go wee-wee against the same guy

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.190 
be using go wee-wee against the same guy
who<00:02:27.069> attacked<00:02:27.549> me<00:02:27.849> from<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.450> replay<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:29.019> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
who attacked me from the replay of the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.020 
who attacked me from the replay of the
other<00:02:29.349> day<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.250> reason<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.579> attacked<00:02:30.879> the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
other day so the reason I attacked the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.119 
other day so the reason I attacked the
space<00:02:31.269> using<00:02:31.629> a<00:02:31.810> go<00:02:32.170> wee-wee<00:02:32.560> instead<00:02:32.859> of<00:02:32.980> go

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
space using a go wee-wee instead of go

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.759 
space using a go wee-wee instead of go
wipe<00:02:33.340> was<00:02:33.700> because<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.599> saw<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.319> lot<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.620> my

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
wipe was because I saw a lot of my

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.589 
wipe was because I saw a lot of my
clanmates<00:02:36.250> they<00:02:36.400> use<00:02:36.609> go<00:02:36.819> wipe<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.299> their

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
clanmates they use go wipe and their

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.270 
clanmates they use go wipe and their
peckers<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.079> went<00:02:38.260> all<00:02:38.409> around<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:39.010> ring

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
peckers just went all around this ring

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.160 
peckers just went all around this ring
because<00:02:39.549> there's<00:02:40.389> a<00:02:40.480> lot<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.750> buildings

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
because there's a lot of buildings

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.080 
because there's a lot of buildings
inside<00:02:41.590> each<00:02:41.829> of<00:02:41.980> these<00:02:42.069> rings<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.909> just

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
inside each of these rings and that just

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.940 
inside each of these rings and that just
kind<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.359> forces<00:02:43.810> your<00:02:43.930> pekka's<00:02:44.290> if<00:02:44.500> you

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
kind of forces your pekka's if you

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.770 
kind of forces your pekka's if you
cannot<00:02:45.250> funnel<00:02:45.670> them<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.939> right<00:02:46.120> way<00:02:46.150> to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
cannot funnel them the right way to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.300 
cannot funnel them the right way to
continue<00:02:47.200> attacking<00:02:47.439> the<00:02:47.709> closest<00:02:48.129> building

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
continue attacking the closest building

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.679 
continue attacking the closest building
next<00:02:48.639> to<00:02:48.760> them<00:02:48.909> and<00:02:49.120> they'll<00:02:49.209> just<00:02:49.239> force<00:02:49.629> them

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
next to them and they'll just force them

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.539 
next to them and they'll just force them
all<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.079> way<00:02:50.170> around<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.739> ring<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.159> not<00:02:51.370> get

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
all the way around the ring and not get

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.339 
all the way around the ring and not get
you<00:02:51.669> that<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.000> star<00:02:52.299> so<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.750> kind<00:02:53.169> of<00:02:53.200> had<00:02:53.319> a

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
you that to star so I kind of had a

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.869 
you that to star so I kind of had a
breakthrough<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:54.099> core<00:02:54.400> with<00:02:54.609> brute<00:02:54.849> force

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
breakthrough this core with brute force

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.319 
breakthrough this core with brute force
using<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.720> ton<00:02:56.049> of<00:02:56.079> wall<00:02:56.620> breakers<00:02:57.069> and<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:58.030> carry

using a ton of wall breakers and I carry
two<00:02:58.540> free<00:02:58.810> spells<00:02:59.169> in<00:02:59.409> order<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.739> freeze<00:03:00.040> both

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
got two stars this war because I

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.890 
got two stars this war because I
attacked<00:04:05.739> late<00:04:06.069> as<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.729> said<00:04:06.790> previously<00:04:06.939> so

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
attacked late as I said previously so

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.869 
attacked late as I said previously so
all<00:04:08.229> the<00:04:08.650> other<00:04:08.799> bases<00:04:09.189> were<00:04:09.280> already<00:04:09.489> starred

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
all the other bases were already starred

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.460 
all the other bases were already starred
so<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.150> just<00:04:10.419> had<00:04:10.509> to<00:04:10.540> improve<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:11.019> base<00:04:11.199> and

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
so I just had to improve a base and

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.409 
so I just had to improve a base and
these<00:04:12.220> were<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.459> two<00:04:12.609> bases<00:04:12.879> that<00:04:13.030> improved

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
these were the two bases that improved

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.289 
these were the two bases that improved
by<00:04:13.689> one<00:04:13.930> star<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:14.590> it<00:04:14.799> was<00:04:15.159> kind<00:04:15.340> of<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.519> low<00:04:15.819> star

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
by one star so it was kind of a low star

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.719 
by one star so it was kind of a low star
