don't forget turn the light off and on a
sunny<00:00:56.789> day<00:00:56.910> why<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.629> open<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> curtains<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
sunny day why not open the curtains and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.720 
sunny day why not open the curtains and
just<00:00:59.399> use<00:00:59.670> natural<00:00:59.969> light<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.780> simple<00:01:01.730> take

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
just use natural light it's simple take

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.000 
just use natural light it's simple take
out<00:01:02.940> incandescent<00:01:03.449> lightbulbs<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.589> switch

out incandescent lightbulbs and switch

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.789 
out incandescent lightbulbs and switch
them<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> compact<00:01:05.909> fluorescent<00:01:06.810> bulbs<00:01:07.200> these

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
them to compact fluorescent bulbs these

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.359 
them to compact fluorescent bulbs these
use<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> lot<00:01:08.580> less<00:01:08.939> energy<00:01:09.619> just<00:01:10.619> turn<00:01:11.010> off<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
use a lot less energy just turn off the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.910 
use a lot less energy just turn off the
TV<00:01:11.820> when<00:01:12.030> you're<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.540> watching<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> turn<00:01:13.890> the

TV when you're not watching it turn the
heating<00:01:14.340> down<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.479> cold<00:01:15.810> wear<00:01:16.229> more

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
heating down if it's cold wear more

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.160 
heating down if it's cold wear more
clothes<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.880> hot<00:01:17.939> try<00:01:18.659> using<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
clothes and when it's hot try using a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.950 
clothes and when it's hot try using a
fan<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:20.040> you're<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.369> using<00:01:20.729> them<00:01:21.119> why<00:01:21.689> not

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
fan when you're not using them why not

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.280 
fan when you're not using them why not
unplug<00:01:22.500> some<00:01:22.799> machines<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.909> computers<00:01:24.290> TVs
