00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
not been far enough back I would have

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.959 
not been far enough back I would have
froze<00:06:41.819> the<00:06:42.539> whole<00:06:42.569> raid<00:06:43.380> wipe<00:06:44.280> the<00:06:44.550> whole<00:06:44.669> raid

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:44.969 
froze the whole raid wipe the whole raid

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.879 
froze the whole raid wipe the whole raid
with<00:06:45.240> less<00:06:45.479> than<00:06:45.690> one<00:06:45.840> percent<00:06:46.289> so<00:06:46.560> it<00:06:46.680> just

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:46.889 
with less than one percent so it just

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.950 
with less than one percent so it just
makes<00:06:47.130> more<00:06:47.340> sense<00:06:47.639> care<00:06:48.330> yourself<00:06:48.419> they're

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
makes more sense care yourself they're

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.250 
makes more sense care yourself they're
gonna<00:06:49.080> kill<00:06:49.169> it<00:06:49.409> is<00:06:49.710> Gigi
