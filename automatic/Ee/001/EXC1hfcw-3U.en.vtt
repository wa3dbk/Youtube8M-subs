00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
extremely tight fit I was a little bit

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.890 
extremely tight fit I was a little bit
of<00:03:09.280> work<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.430> get<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.880> here<00:03:10.120> but<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.720> does

it in there and you can compress it a
