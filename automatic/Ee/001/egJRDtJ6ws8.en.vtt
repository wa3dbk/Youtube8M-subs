00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
like that what happened is I tore it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.970 
like that what happened is I tore it
apart<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:28.070> this<00:00:29.070> little<00:00:29.369> wire<00:00:30.500> right<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
apart and this little wire right here is

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.860 
apart and this little wire right here is
rubbing<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> nut<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:36.620> right<00:00:37.620> there

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
rubbing on the nut and right there

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.350 
rubbing on the nut and right there
there's<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.050> short<00:00:40.460> not<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> short<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> bare

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
there's a short not a short but a bare

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.970 
there's a short not a short but a bare
wire<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:42.960> getting<00:00:43.230> grounded<00:00:43.590> out<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
wire that's getting grounded out and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:55.400 
wire that's getting grounded out and
causing<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:46.550> flicker<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:54.020> how<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.289> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
causing it to flicker so how you do is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.670 
causing it to flicker so how you do is
take<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.739> panel<00:00:56.129> off<00:00:57.199> just<00:00:58.199> slide<00:00:58.469> behind

take this panel off just slide behind

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.990 
take this panel off just slide behind
the<00:00:59.780> cracks<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:04.430> right<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.729> there's

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the cracks of it and right here there's

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.730 
the cracks of it and right here there's
a<00:01:06.090> couple<00:01:06.210> screws<00:01:07.729> covered<00:01:08.729> by<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.000> little

I travel a lot and laptop gets a little

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.120 
I travel a lot and laptop gets a little
bit<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.650> abuse<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.280> bag

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
bit of abuse in the bag

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.110 
bit of abuse in the bag
pretty<00:02:16.130> much<00:02:16.220> all<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.580> do<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.790> just<00:02:16.910> push

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
pretty much all you to do is just push

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.320 
pretty much all you to do is just push
that<00:02:17.270> back<00:02:17.480> up<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.840> there

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330

that back up in there
let's<00:02:20.330> still<00:02:20.510> work<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.020> think<00:02:21.560> what<00:02:21.680> I'm<00:02:21.740> going

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.590 
let's still work I think what I'm going
to<00:02:21.890> do<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.130> put<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> dab<00:02:22.490> of<00:02:22.520> superglue<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.390> so

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
to do is put a dab of superglue on it so

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.150 
to do is put a dab of superglue on it so
that<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:24.230> doesn't<00:02:24.440> come<00:02:24.650> out<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:27.130> there's<00:02:28.130> a

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
that it doesn't come out but there's a

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.060 
that it doesn't come out but there's a
couple<00:02:28.340> little<00:02:28.490> tricks<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.150> stevie<00:02:29.540> seven
