the box someone's purchased it and some

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.549 
the box someone's purchased it and some
reason<00:00:30.450> they<00:00:30.599> can't<00:00:30.809> understand<00:00:31.290> why<00:00:31.500> it

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
reason they can't understand why it

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.610 
reason they can't understand why it
doesn't<00:00:31.890> work<00:00:32.570> out<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.780> Bend<00:00:34.050> which<00:00:34.470> of<00:00:34.590> course

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
doesn't work out of Bend which of course

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.290 
doesn't work out of Bend which of course
is<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:35.010> supposed<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.520> at<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> moment<00:00:36.180> we're

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is not supposed to at the moment we're

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.490 
is not supposed to at the moment we're
on<00:00:36.420> twenty<00:00:37.260> eight<00:00:37.790> point<00:00:38.790> zero<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.329> zero<00:00:39.500> as

on twenty eight point zero one zero as

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.959 
on twenty eight point zero one zero as
you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.860> see<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.309> pick<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> microphone

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
you can see if I pick up the microphone

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.840 
you can see if I pick up the microphone
and<00:00:42.450> transmit<00:00:43.460> we<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> TX<00:00:45.390> light<00:00:46.850> we

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and transmit we do have a TX light we

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.360 
and transmit we do have a TX light we
have<00:00:48.030> power<00:00:48.380> but<00:00:49.380> as<00:00:49.470> soon<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:50.070> down<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
have power but as soon as I go down the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.890 
have power but as soon as I go down the
frequency<00:00:51.170> like<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.670> let's<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:53.790> down<00:00:53.970> onto<00:00:54.270> 27

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
frequency like so let's get down onto 27

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.340 
frequency like so let's get down onto 27
as<00:00:55.079> soon<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.380> IKEA<00:00:55.940> we<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.120> off<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.170> no

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
as soon as IKEA we have off there is no

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.000 
as soon as IKEA we have off there is no
transmit<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.520> not<00:00:59.640> function<00:00:59.940> out<00:01:00.360> of<00:01:00.420> Bend

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
transmit will not function out of Bend

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.200 
transmit will not function out of Bend
so<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.130> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.340> do<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.520> take<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.000> DX<00:01:03.840> sr8<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
so I'm going to do is take this DX sr8 I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.280 
so I'm going to do is take this DX sr8 I
take<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> cover<00:01:06.479> off<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.140> can

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
take the cover off and see if we can

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.120 
take the cover off and see if we can
wipe<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:52.170
