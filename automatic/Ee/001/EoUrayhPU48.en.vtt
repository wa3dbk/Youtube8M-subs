packages<00:03:40.770> ran<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:42.570> randomness<00:03:42.930> factor<00:03:43.410> right

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
packages ran the randomness factor right

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.930 
packages ran the randomness factor right
and<00:03:43.800> i<00:03:43.860> think<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.280> makes<00:03:44.459> sense<00:03:44.640> it's<00:03:44.790> like

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
and i think that makes sense it's like

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.930 
and i think that makes sense it's like
people<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.420> want<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.690> play<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:47.670> know<00:03:47.730> there

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
people that want to play you know there

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.220 
people that want to play you know there

are other games that are like that like

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.720 
are other games that are like that like
you<00:03:49.650> know<00:03:49.770> not<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.070> I'm<00:03:50.220> saying<00:03:50.370> these<00:03:50.520> games

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
are at all similar but i'm saying when

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.330 
are at all similar but i'm saying when
i've<00:03:52.050> seen<00:03:52.230> people<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.650> play<00:03:52.830> competitive
