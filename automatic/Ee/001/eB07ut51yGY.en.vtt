00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
little bit so I think this is like the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.650 
little bit so I think this is like the
remake<00:03:29.079> of<00:03:29.549> isn't<00:03:30.549> this<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.669> remake<00:03:31.060> of<00:03:31.239> that

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
remake of isn't this the remake of that

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.119 
remake of isn't this the remake of that
one<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:34.299> I<00:03:34.810> can't<00:03:35.079> remember<00:03:35.199> the<00:03:35.379> halo<00:03:35.620> 3<00:03:35.859> map

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
one the I can't remember the halo 3 map

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.720 
one the I can't remember the halo 3 map
the<00:03:36.790> one<00:03:37.000> where<00:03:37.540> they<00:03:37.930> had<00:03:38.199> the<00:03:38.319> beach<00:03:38.730> that

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
the one where they had the beach that

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.399 
the one where they had the beach that
seems<00:03:40.000> kind<00:03:40.180> of<00:03:40.209> like<00:03:40.359> this<00:03:40.569> one<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:41.049> seems<00:03:41.319> to

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
seems kind of like this one it seems to

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.720 
seems kind of like this one it seems to
me<00:03:41.500> like<00:03:41.530> they<00:03:41.739> just<00:03:41.919> redid<00:03:42.159> a<00:03:42.310> bunch<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.549> old
