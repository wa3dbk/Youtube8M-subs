in fact I think this fabric is even see
through<00:01:59.280> enough<00:01:59.579> yeah<00:02:00.329> or<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.049> could<00:02:01.670> race

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
through enough yeah or you could race

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.990 
through enough yeah or you could race
off<00:02:02.939> parts<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.689> want<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.729> tend<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.820> like

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.509 
so now the the original collar kind of
works<00:04:03.959> like<00:04:04.079> interfacing<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:04.889> there<00:04:05.069> which<00:04:05.400> i

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
works like interfacing in there which i

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.490 
works like interfacing in there which i
thought<00:04:05.639> was<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:05.819> great<00:04:05.970> how<00:04:06.479> cool<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:06.959> that

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
thought was so great how cool is that

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.869 
thought was so great how cool is that
yeah<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.919> then<00:04:08.069> look<00:04:08.220> at<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.400> little<00:04:08.549> tiny

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879
