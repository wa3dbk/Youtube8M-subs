there's a moral to do the fifth fret on
deed<00:01:34.360> immaculate<00:01:35.360> Moroni

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.330 

let<00:01:39.050> me<00:01:39.140> land<00:01:39.320> on<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.530> seventh<00:01:39.830> fret<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:39.980> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.490 

and<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.360> rest<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> bit<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.439> like

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and we rest on that for a bit it's like

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.490 
and we rest on that for a bit it's like
that

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
that

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.380 
that
let<00:01:48.920> me<00:01:49.010> jump<00:01:49.190> into<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.520> riff<00:01:49.670> again<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:50.270> this

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
let me jump into the riff again but this

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.090 
let me jump into the riff again but this
time<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:50.810> only<00:01:50.840> play<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:51.320> twice<00:01:51.470> here<00:01:51.830> so<00:01:52.040> it

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
time we only play it twice here so it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.130 
time we only play it twice here so it
sounds<00:01:52.370> like<00:01:52.460> this

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.320 

so<00:01:57.710> that's<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.160> only<00:01:58.460> change<00:01:58.640> there<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.030> when

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
so that's the only change there is when

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:08.690 
so that's the only change there is when
we<00:01:59.420> play<00:01:59.600> this<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.780> second<00:02:00.170> time<00:02:00.290> around

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.880 

so<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.810> intro<00:02:10.080> riff<00:02:10.200> gets<00:02:10.440> played<00:02:10.649> four

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so this intro riff gets played four

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.820 
so this intro riff gets played four
times

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.530 

actually<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> third<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.270> fourth<00:02:19.480> time

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
actually on the third and fourth time

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.940 
actually on the third and fourth time
the<00:02:19.870> harmony<00:02:20.200> comes<00:02:20.350> in<00:02:20.590> which<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:20.860> could

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
the harmony comes in which you could

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.800 
the harmony comes in which you could
play<00:02:21.130> if<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.340> want<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:22.210> starts<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
play if you want that starts at the

fifth fret on the d-string we go five

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.720 

and<00:02:34.989> then<00:02:35.140> we<00:02:35.200> do<00:02:35.349> fourth<00:02:35.859> fret<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.159> 2nd<00:02:36.670> fret

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.790 

so<00:03:26.600> there's<00:03:26.720> about<00:03:26.840> six<00:03:27.110> gallops<00:03:27.470> in<00:03:27.620> there

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
so there's about six gallops in there

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:36.130 
so there's about six gallops in there
and<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.070> first<00:03:28.100> one<00:03:28.490> we<00:03:28.580> wait<00:03:28.760> for<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:28.970> second

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.450 

yeah

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.190 

then<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:42.000> go<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.330> third<00:03:42.600> fret<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.110> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
then we go to the third fret on the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.140 
then we go to the third fret on the
a-string<00:03:43.590> NEX<00:03:44.130> T<00:03:44.400> power<00:03:44.610> cord

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:04:06.740 

5th<00:03:49.140> frets<00:03:49.349> here<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:50.580> 7th<00:03:51.180> fret

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.420 

over<00:04:07.410> top<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.770> now<00:04:07.890> we're<00:04:08.070> playing<00:04:08.250> the

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
over top and now we're playing the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.040 
over top and now we're playing the
melody<00:04:08.580> riff<00:04:08.970> which<00:04:09.570> sounds<00:04:09.930> like<00:04:10.080> this

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.539 

so<00:04:15.050> we're<00:04:15.350> starting<00:04:15.500> on<00:04:15.740> the<00:04:15.830> eighth<00:04:15.980> fret<00:04:16.280> on

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
so we're starting on the eighth fret on

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.539 
so we're starting on the eighth fret on
the<00:04:16.640> B<00:04:17.180> string<00:04:17.330> picking<00:04:18.140> that<00:04:18.290> ones<00:04:18.549> then

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
the B string picking that ones then

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:20.949 
the B string picking that ones then
we're<00:04:19.730> doing<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.000> trill<00:04:20.239> between<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:20.660> seventh

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
we're doing a trill between the seventh

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.630 
we're doing a trill between the seventh
and<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.140> eighth<00:04:21.260> fret

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.830 

then<00:04:27.640> we'll<00:04:27.760> play<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.180> seventh<00:04:28.540> fret<00:04:28.660> on<00:04:28.720> the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
then we'll play the seventh fret on the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:40.119 
then we'll play the seventh fret on the
e-string<00:04:31.110> so<00:04:32.110> it's<00:04:33.570> another<00:04:34.570> trail

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.260 

so<00:04:41.129> we<00:04:41.220> have<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.430> get<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:41.639> part<00:04:41.879> down<00:04:42.030> that's

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
so we have to get that part down that's

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.750 
so we have to get that part down that's
the<00:04:42.300> hardest<00:04:42.629> part<00:04:42.750> there

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.210 

I<00:04:49.820> keep<00:04:50.630> my<00:04:50.750> index<00:04:51.020> finger<00:04:51.260> flat<00:04:51.530> basically<00:04:52.010> on

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
I keep my index finger flat basically on

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.770 
I keep my index finger flat basically on
the<00:04:52.370> E<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.700> B<00:04:52.790> strings<00:04:53.090> for<00:04:53.270> that<00:04:53.390> so<00:04:53.570> I<00:04:53.600> can

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
the E and B strings for that so I can

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.850 
the E and B strings for that so I can
hit<00:04:53.900> that<00:04:54.020> seventh<00:04:54.350> fret<00:04:54.530> there<00:04:54.740> without

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
hit that seventh fret there without

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.290 
hit that seventh fret there without
having<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.310> move<00:04:57.520> now<00:04:58.520> if<00:04:58.580> we<00:04:58.790> got<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:59.060> down

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
having to move now if we got that down

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.690 
having to move now if we got that down
we<00:04:59.420> play<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.720> eighth<00:04:59.810> fret<00:05:00.020> again<00:05:00.610> then<00:05:01.610> the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
we play the eighth fret again then the

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.150 
we play the eighth fret again then the
