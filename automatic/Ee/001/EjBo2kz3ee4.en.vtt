don't know what it was really called
that<00:00:03.780> seems<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.259> be<00:00:04.290> all<00:00:04.440> it<00:00:04.529> does<00:00:04.680> it<00:00:04.980> plays<00:00:05.520> a

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
that seems to be all it does it plays a

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.210 
that seems to be all it does it plays a
few<00:00:06.120> songs<00:00:06.299> when<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.660> hit<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.870> one<00:00:07.020> button<00:00:07.230> in

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
few songs when you hit the one button in

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.790 
few songs when you hit the one button in
bending<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.240> installed<00:00:10.110> an<00:00:10.380> on/off<00:00:10.769> switch

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
bending it I installed an on/off switch

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.370 
bending it I installed an on/off switch
because<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.580> will<00:00:11.759> crash<00:00:12.059> occasionally<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.840> put

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
because it will crash occasionally I put

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.039 
because it will crash occasionally I put
in<00:00:13.469> three<00:00:13.769> body<00:00:13.980> contacts<00:00:14.580> quarter<00:00:15.570> inch<00:00:15.719> out

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
in three body contacts quarter inch out

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.000 
in three body contacts quarter inch out
or<00:00:16.650> switch<00:00:17.070> which<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.400> basically<00:00:17.940> for<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:19.010> it's

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
or switch which is basically for a it's

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.840 
or switch which is basically for a it's
kind<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> glitchy<00:00:22.100> superfast<00:00:23.100> mode<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.640> guess

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
kind of a glitchy superfast mode I guess

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.359 
kind of a glitchy superfast mode I guess
this<00:00:24.570> knob<00:00:24.960> controls<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.949> glitchy

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
this knob controls that glitchy

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.400 
this knob controls that glitchy
superfast<00:00:27.000> mode<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.539> then<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.960> knob<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
superfast mode and then this knob is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.089 
superfast mode and then this knob is
your<00:00:28.560> basic<00:00:29.210> pitch<00:00:30.210> Bend<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.230> there's<00:00:31.859> speed

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
your basic pitch Bend so there's speed

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.950 
your basic pitch Bend so there's speed
that<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.430> should<00:00:32.610> say<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.360> let's<00:00:33.540> start<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.840> it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
that I should say so let's start with it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:01:51.140 
that I should say so let's start with it
kind<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.200> slow<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.690> body

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.220 

now<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.910> faster<00:01:53.910> which<00:01:54.390> he<00:01:54.540> switch<00:01:54.900> over

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
now for the faster which he switch over

00:01:55.230 --> 00:03:37.210 
now for the faster which he switch over
here

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.430 

and<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:40.380> about<00:03:40.740> time
