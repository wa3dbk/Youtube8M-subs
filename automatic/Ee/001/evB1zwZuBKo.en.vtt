00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.799
 hello to all growers, fans of u 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.050
 tuba and everyone who watches this video 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:14.900
 Today I will tell about another bush 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:20.310
 your grape is an agate bush don 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:23.750
 Today we have May 1 and it came to the most 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.000
 time to do green operations 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.210
 hanging look in this bush over the past 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 year and before last how did it happen we 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.230
 have developed 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.710
 3 escapes for no 3 escapes each escape 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.410
 we winded and gives here such 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.770
 buds that is, all the buds wintered here 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.770
 2 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.680
 and here's the third cube means you have to achieve 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.430
 to 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.369
 next year there were 4 escapes or 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:11.450
 same 4 sleeves and what to do 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:16.970
 means what do i mean consider from 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:24.140
 1 let's say sleeve yes I will leave the most 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:28.990
 top and all these lower germinated here 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:33.140
 kidneys all completely removing 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:37.520
 he himself to the very bottom there is already one 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:43.399
 got cut here on one sleeve I left 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:46.100
 Only one kidney to wear I will say right away 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.780
 From this bush I do not want to achieve 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.440
 some crop 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.890
 I have it is not necessary although you can 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.420
 try let's still try 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.220
 second hand more so powerful 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:08.049
 on it I also break off everything 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.049
 completely these germinated buds below 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.460
 so here 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.280
 and leave the top how many 22 escape 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.879
 I leave her 2 wins and one kidney 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.450
 left and here's the second one I'll 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.650
 try to get 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.049
 maybe harvest some hron point with 2 i 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.190
 I will develop further this sleeve 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.980
 if it is to start up some loud 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.720
 I will leave it to see if not 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.659
 complete and then delete 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.659
 I will delete and I will just continue 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.629
 the movement of this sleeve is like this 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.239
 looks like hands after wreckage one we 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.900
 broken off 2 broken off and proceed to 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.150
 third here we have 3 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.920
 on the third sleeve also the kidneys 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:18.329
 it means all I just break the kidney 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:21.459
 leave one top break it all 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.620
 little still not bloomed too all 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.410
 I break off this little one too 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:33.060
 because in a week she turn into 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:37.599
 in the big here is a little too, we will remove it and 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.470
 leave here this lower kidney means with 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.510
 this lower kidney we will be exactly the same 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.810
 will grow big-big sleeve and y 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.049
 we will thus be formed bush 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.440
 in 4 sleeves here looks like a bush 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.930
 after 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.010
 debris that is green operations let's 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.010
 run through 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:07.420
 1 hand at the very bottom is empty 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.270
 other sleeve 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.810
 too empty top of the current leaving 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.190
 left one kidney and 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:21.390
 3 hands too to the top 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.390
 only one kidney is left here 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.590
 it is necessary to conduct these 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.020
 green operations do not seem to regret 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.380
 will grow more will be more grapes 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.180
 No, this is all a wrong opinion. 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.260
 be sure to carry out green operations 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.650
 then there will be a result 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.710
 correctly form a bush and after 3 2 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.810
 3 years after the formation of the bush you already 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.850
 will have a fully formed bush 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.330
 which will only please you further 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.010
 it means everything that we have will appear 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.800
 here we are all broken off but there will be 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.080
 again to appear kidneys make the way 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.140
 because with one kidney but here 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.850
 there are also broken off dormant buds of pieces 45 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.890
 there will again again all grow new 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.210
 buds will give some time this 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.410
 everything will be necessary 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:21.520
 break off break off so hd to the middle 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:24.820
 summer and promote only this growth 1 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:30.220
 in a row to extend this sleeve and do 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:34.810
 this sleeve is thicker still in this 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.570
 the beginning of May is there or earlier 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.450
 May there a week to do a good 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:46.350
 watering the vine and preferably it is all 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.350
 do with some kind of root 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:56.719
 fertilizer whether fertilizer stir it 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:06:01.580
 Do any stimulants and good to shed 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:03.159
 let the bush let it develop look at 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.309
 him for development 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:08.900
 main mistake do not leave too much on 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:11.839
 bush because the bush will be later 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:16.370
 look like you like a bush 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:21.080
 currants there or something else 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.849
 then on this bush I do not see what 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.899
 here something is tied though at me 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:28.460
 there are other bushes visible 

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:30.800
 small-small after the leaf is already inside 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.439
 will be well as i said on this bush and 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.990
 left here two buds to 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:37.550
 will there be a crop or not 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:43.240
 if it is not and still I will 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.240
 here's my bush 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.129
 subscribe to the channel and watch a lot 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:51.729
 here is useful not only about grapes 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:51.729
 to new meetings
