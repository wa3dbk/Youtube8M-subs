00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
consideration the fact that I had to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.350 
consideration the fact that I had to
manually<00:00:34.649> take<00:00:34.890> all<00:00:35.100> these<00:00:35.280> songs<00:00:35.550> playing<00:00:36.210> on

my<00:00:36.510> computer<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.399> since<00:00:38.399> most<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.910> them<00:00:39.090> have

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
my computer and since most of them have

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.979 
my computer and since most of them have
loops

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
loops

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.340 
loops
I<00:00:40.020> cut<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.770> songs<00:00:41.010> sort<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.910> randomly<00:00:42.360> well

not<00:00:44.160> randomly<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.090> honest<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.289> didn't

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
not randomly to be honest but I didn't

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.979 
not randomly to be honest but I didn't
go<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> such<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> precision<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.480> depends

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
go to such a precision that depends

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.549 
go to such a precision that depends
exactly<00:00:49.500> where<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> loop<00:00:50.070> starts<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.840> some

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
exactly where the loop starts so some

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.100 
exactly where the loop starts so some
songs<00:00:52.890> may<00:00:53.190> sound<00:00:53.460> too<00:00:53.699> short<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.780> they<00:00:55.050> do

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
songs may sound too short if they do

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.709 
songs may sound too short if they do
