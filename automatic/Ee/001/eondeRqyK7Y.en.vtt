hi welcome to co2 supermarket comm in
this<00:00:04.920> video<00:00:05.279> I'm<00:00:05.670> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> show<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.890> co2

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
this video I'm going to show you the co2

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.480 
this video I'm going to show you the co2
diffuser<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:09.059> recommend<00:00:10.099> this<00:00:11.099> diffuser

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
diffuser that we recommend this diffuser

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.890 
diffuser that we recommend this diffuser
uses<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.360> flow<00:00:12.599> from<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> pump<00:00:13.410> be<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.900> filter

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
uses the flow from a pump be the filter

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.779 
uses the flow from a pump be the filter
or<00:00:16.199> an<00:00:16.650> additional<00:00:17.130> pump<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.580> you've<00:00:17.670> added

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
or an additional pump that you've added

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.140 
or an additional pump that you've added
to<00:00:18.060> your<00:00:18.180> tank<00:00:18.560> to<00:00:19.560> mix<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> co2<00:00:20.130> into<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
to your tank to mix the co2 into the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.900 
to your tank to mix the co2 into the
water<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.619> return<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.400> carbonated

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
water and then return the carbonated

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.769 
water and then return the carbonated
water<00:00:24.090> back<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.019> your<00:00:25.140> tank<00:00:26.000> it<00:00:27.000> works<00:00:27.330> using

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
water back to your tank it works using

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.950 
water back to your tank it works using
two<00:00:28.439> impellers<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> top<00:00:29.760> which<00:00:30.300> rotate

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
two impellers at the top which rotate

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.560 
two impellers at the top which rotate
around<00:00:31.080> quickly<00:00:31.640> using<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.880> force<00:00:33.120> from<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
around quickly using the force from the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.010 
around quickly using the force from the
pump

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
pump

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.799 
pump
so<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.489> flow<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> water<00:00:36.870> comes<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.739> here

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
so the flow from the water comes in here

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.459 
so the flow from the water comes in here
the<00:00:39.809> co2<00:00:40.200> goes<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.670> top<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.660> it

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the co2 goes in the top there and it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.760 
the co2 goes in the top there and it
gets<00:00:43.559> round<00:00:43.890> mixed<00:00:44.399> around<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.700> top<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
gets round mixed around the top of the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.040 
gets round mixed around the top of the
unit<00:00:47.100> using<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> impellers<00:00:48.270> meaning<00:00:48.899> that

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
unit using the impellers meaning that

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.939 
unit using the impellers meaning that
only<00:00:49.340> carbonated<00:00:50.340> water<00:00:50.780> exits<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> unit<00:00:52.680> via

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
only carbonated water exits the unit via

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.049 
only carbonated water exits the unit via
the<00:00:53.280> tube<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.329> extends<00:00:54.750> down<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> bottom

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.959 

it<00:01:00.059> also<00:01:00.239> comes<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:01.079> bubble<00:01:01.590> counter<00:01:01.969> so

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it also comes with a bubble counter so

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.310 
it also comes with a bubble counter so
that<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.180> know<00:01:03.329> exactly<00:01:03.600> how<00:01:03.899> much<00:01:04.019> co2

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that you know exactly how much co2

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.140 
that you know exactly how much co2
you're<00:01:04.920> adding<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> water<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> I'll<00:01:09.030> now

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
you're adding to the water so I'll now

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.929 
you're adding to the water so I'll now
show<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> whole<00:01:09.659> thing<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.439> action<00:01:10.939> in

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
show you the whole thing in action in

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.420 
show you the whole thing in action in
this<00:01:12.090> particular<00:01:12.390> case<00:01:12.750> using<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.430> co2

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
this particular case using the co2

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.890 
this particular case using the co2
system<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.600> sell<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:15.960> co2<00:01:16.340> supermarket

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
system that we sell at co2 supermarket

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.520 
system that we sell at co2 supermarket
so<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> co2<00:01:19.560> exits<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:22.009> your<00:01:23.009> co2<00:01:23.490> source

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
so the co2 exits the your co2 source

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.920 
so the co2 exits the your co2 source
then<00:01:25.530> goes<00:01:25.710> into<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.490> bubble<00:01:26.820> counter<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
then goes into a bubble counter so you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.870 
then goes into a bubble counter so you
can<00:01:28.229> keep<00:01:28.710> track<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.920> how<00:01:29.100> much<00:01:29.220> co2<00:01:29.430> you're

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
can keep track of how much co2 you're

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.160 
can keep track of how much co2 you're
adding<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.250> goes<00:01:32.549> into<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.780> mixer

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
adding and it then goes into the mixer

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.399 
adding and it then goes into the mixer
diffuser<00:01:34.740> at<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> top<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.570> using<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
diffuser at the top here and using the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.010 
diffuser at the top here and using the
flow<00:01:37.619> from<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.090> case<00:01:39.299> an<00:01:39.509> external

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
flow from in this case an external

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.670 
flow from in this case an external
filter<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.950> mix<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.490> together<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.350> shine

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
filter to mix it together so if I shine

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.450 
filter to mix it together so if I shine
a<00:01:43.710> byte<00:01:43.950> on

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
a byte on

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.800 
a byte on
here<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.850> impellers<00:01:48.360> whizzing

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
here you can see the impellers whizzing

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.340 
here you can see the impellers whizzing
around<00:01:48.930> mixing<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.009> co2<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.670> water<00:01:51.350> and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
around mixing the co2 in the water and

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.120 
around mixing the co2 in the water and
if<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.770> turn<00:01:53.340> off<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> filter<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.950> see

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
if I turn off the filter you can see

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.330 
if I turn off the filter you can see
them<00:01:56.280> stop<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.710> when<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> turn<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.040> back<00:01:59.070> on

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
them stop and when I turn it back on

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.920 
them stop and when I turn it back on
again

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
again

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.380 
again
they<00:02:00.930> start<00:02:01.229> whizzing<00:02:01.380> round<00:02:01.560> again<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
they start whizzing round again so the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.749 
they start whizzing round again so the
carbonated<00:02:03.930> water<00:02:04.049> then<00:02:04.649> exits<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.369> bottom

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
carbonated water then exits the bottom

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.040 
carbonated water then exits the bottom
of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.420> diffuser<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:08.450> then<00:02:09.450> emerges<00:02:09.959> from

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
of the diffuser and then emerges from

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.000 
of the diffuser and then emerges from
the<00:02:10.259> top<00:02:10.500> here

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
the top here

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.610 
the top here
and<00:02:13.010> travels<00:02:13.550> all<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.820> way<00:02:13.910> back<00:02:14.210> up<00:02:14.480> into<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
and travels all the way back up into the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.390 
and travels all the way back up into the
tank<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.930> out<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.440> outlet<00:02:18.920> from<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
tank and out of the outlet from the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.030 
tank and out of the outlet from the
filter<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.900> if<00:02:21.680> i<00:02:21.830> zoom<00:02:21.860> in<00:02:22.750> you'll<00:02:23.750> see<00:02:24.050> that

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
filter and if i zoom in you'll see that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.030 
filter and if i zoom in you'll see that
very<00:02:25.100> little<00:02:25.700> co2<00:02:26.210> is<00:02:26.780> reaching<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.320> top<00:02:27.530> in

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
very little co2 is reaching the top in

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.270 
very little co2 is reaching the top in
the<00:02:28.340> form<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.820> bubbles<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.950> what<00:02:31.130> that

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
the form of bubbles and what that

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.430 
the form of bubbles and what that
basically<00:02:31.460> means<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.900> whole<00:02:33.170> system

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
basically means is that the whole system

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.640 
basically means is that the whole system
is<00:02:33.830> very<00:02:34.550> efficient<00:02:35.170> because<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.290> means<00:02:36.470> that

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
is very efficient because it means that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.820 
is very efficient because it means that
almost<00:02:37.400> all<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.760> co2<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.270> I'm<00:02:38.650> adding<00:02:39.650> is

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
almost all of the co2 that I'm adding is

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.280 
almost all of the co2 that I'm adding is
getting<00:02:40.610> diffused<00:02:40.880> in<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.270> water<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.930> not

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
getting diffused in the water and not

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.920 
getting diffused in the water and not
being<00:02:42.500> wasted<00:02:43.070> by<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:44.180> escaping<00:02:44.540> out<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
being wasted by just escaping out the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.010 
being wasted by just escaping out the
top<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.260> tank<00:02:47.320> as<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.500> said<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:50.780> can<00:02:50.990> use

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
top of the tank as I said you can use

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.990 
top of the tank as I said you can use
the<00:02:51.350> diffuser<00:02:51.710> with<00:02:52.070> an<00:02:52.340> additional<00:02:52.730> pump

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
the diffuser with an additional pump

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.080 
the diffuser with an additional pump
that<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.540> add<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.720> your<00:02:54.110> tank<00:02:54.790> which<00:02:55.790> we<00:02:55.940> do

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
that you add to your tank which we do

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.490 
that you add to your tank which we do
we'll<00:02:56.270> also<00:02:56.420> sell<00:02:56.900> at<00:02:57.110> co2<00:02:57.440> supermarket<00:02:58.280> comm

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
see I've got a mini submersible pump

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.000 
see I've got a mini submersible pump
here<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:08.000> I've<00:03:08.630> connected<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.350> the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
here and I've connected it to the

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.900 
here and I've connected it to the
diffuser<00:03:10.730> just<00:03:10.940> using<00:03:11.210> a<00:03:11.270> bit<00:03:11.420> of<00:03:11.560> tubing<00:03:12.560> and

just as before
it'll<00:03:15.620> mix<00:03:15.770> around<00:03:16.040> at<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.220> top<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.550> the

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
it'll mix around at the top of the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.400 
it'll mix around at the top of the
device<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.330> then<00:03:18.050> exit<00:03:18.620> out<00:03:18.740> at<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.950> top<00:03:20.410> so
