keyboard and you'll be using using it
with<00:02:16.690> your<00:02:16.720> s4<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.340> for<00:02:18.460> example<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:20.170> type<00:02:20.410> in

with your s4 so for example just type in
normal<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.570> quite<00:02:25.720> an<00:02:25.840> old<00:02:25.990> keyboard<00:02:26.200> to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
normal this is quite an old keyboard to

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.600 
normal this is quite an old keyboard to
thee

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.530 

and<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.340> shift<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.000> control<00:02:38.360> and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
and so the shift and the control and

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.440 
and so the shift and the control and
everything<00:02:38.870> works<00:02:39.110> exactly<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.770> same<00:02:39.860> way

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
everything works exactly the same way

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.830 
everything works exactly the same way
and<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.960> course<00:02:42.020> you<00:02:42.890> got<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:44.480> normal

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
and of course you got the the normal

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.720 
and of course you got the the normal
symbols<00:02:45.230> on<00:02:45.380> top<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.160> everything<00:02:46.520> like<00:02:46.670> that

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
symbols on top and everything like that

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.120 
symbols on top and everything like that
so<00:02:47.210> when<00:02:47.450> you've<00:02:47.600> got<00:02:47.780> your<00:02:47.840> keyboard<00:02:48.710> hog<00:02:48.860> top

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130
