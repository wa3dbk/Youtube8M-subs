00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.980 
want your student athletes to act in the
community<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:49.110> obviously<00:05:50.750> get<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:51.780> right

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
community and obviously get the right

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.900 
community and obviously get the right
type<00:05:52.170> of<00:05:52.200> student<00:05:52.440> athlete<00:05:52.860> in<00:05:53.010> the<00:05:53.460> classroom

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
type of student athlete in the classroom

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.060 
type of student athlete in the classroom
then<00:05:54.900> that's<00:05:55.050> going<00:05:55.170> to<00:05:55.290> lead<00:05:55.380> to<00:05:55.410> success<00:05:55.890> so

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
then that's going to lead to success so

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.090 
then that's going to lead to success so
hopefully<00:05:56.370> we'll<00:05:56.490> continue<00:05:56.610> to<00:05:56.940> do<00:05:57.030> that
