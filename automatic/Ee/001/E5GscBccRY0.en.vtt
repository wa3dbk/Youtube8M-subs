00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.600
 a very good evening from it 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.800
 albert park 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.259
 at the team at the sea kv Oostende 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.929
 that stands for a historic competition 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.000
 there on it may occur for the very first 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.279
 times in history 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.740
 places for the semi finals of the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.500
 Belgian cup 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:31.399
 our pushing error I thought no and then it was 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.730
 a particularly great chance for a drink 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.730
 after 2 minutes 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.920
 storage completely deleted 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.829
 This is the Ostend goalkeeper from Gabon 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.829
 didier ovono and now we look 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:09.299
 foam better death but also something 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.340
 so serious we suspect getting one 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.720
 no ziani each other 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.520
 what has remained is actually 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.659
 not great much reason to be like that 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.450
 stay on the cold grass mats 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.450
 although stands a solid income from sage 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.090
 then the ball or not to do it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.090
 that moment now 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:40.450
 well has pain inside just have to 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.450
 get out 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.510
 and siani 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.330
 stands by bushes and contribute to that must 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.660
 is to come to pass says doctor 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.660
 racing genk 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.740
 jacket 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.240
 pj 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.880
 are you 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.990
 rather it is saving in the middle of 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.990
 the goal of music 3 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.340
 a lot of feeling for it 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.970
 there is criticism that the flat earth 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.580
 partner that quick report there is faster 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.230
 and scores I closed the that's it 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.459
 it just before the break when one can not 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.690
 look longer 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.840
 Foxes must enter the field and for all your 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.250
 passion k is the end story in this 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.739
 contest 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.519
 the captain looks doubtful it will 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.519
 must come from him 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.640
 the tactical change on the field is that 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.040
 euros on the right button to play 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.040
 you can be trusted on the left there 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.890
 Secondly, Paul pauses 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.130
 the game wants without knowing 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.610
 we throw 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.610
 crazy 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.170
 a drink 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.040
 and put back 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.040
 posting forests 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.980
 that was the top shooter 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.480
 with almost sixteen of the season 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.519
 their third cup goal had been 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.970
 could be full or there was deep here 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.970
 hit 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.010
 did you participate too 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.080
 the question now is how fast the 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.900
 penalty kicks in the team 's head 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.000
 touch if that is fast we will open 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.370
 get nothing to see 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.640
 or try to score with a goal 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.640
 clear 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.140
 yes much more wants with her top had hard 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.709
 call 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.569
 is there for kv oostende and it's poncia 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.569
 done 95 minutes 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.040
 of course nothing changes due to genk 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.470
 we have to make higher next 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.240
 well 100 and a jet stop he is 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.900
 we can see which of reeds more 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.610
 to be 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.610
 want more is the declarant 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:45.480
 in calculus here don't do better on this 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:48.510
 can see balls up close 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.570
 wants to come and siani that is the triangle that 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:59.240
 provides the lead for kv 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:05.130
 Ostend 25 minutes 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.990
 historical evening comes with it 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.180
 that place that ball that at the battery 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.740
 and they hit the post 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.610
 imagine that they are on his 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.610
 there is another goal 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.379
 Marc Coucke price Mr. familial 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:24.669
 and three already but who makes a mistake 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:24.669
 don't make a mistake tonight 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.860
 Marc Coucke bearded the fourth man dares 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.860
 not to give another 2 minutes 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.909
 the portrait 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:51.409
 a few already it's over 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:56.619
 yes a lot of support the goes to half 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.619
 final the team with the biggest heart 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:04.819
 has made it and mario leg 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.529
 how much love he still gets what 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.759
 his playful have let him down 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:09.759
 that much is clear 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.230
 in the cup winner there is no way out 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.070
 foxes 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:29.230
 don't understand how this can come across as 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.230
 you zulte last year waregem 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.979
 solidify and all sorts off 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.410
 and this year the road was broken 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.270
 easier for yesterday went through two 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.949
 weeks goes into unemployed tender and 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.000
 maybe luring partying role software 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:49.850
 constandse absolutely not live kvl 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.850
 appeal the speaker and that is earned
