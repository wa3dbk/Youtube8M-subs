00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 and very well welcome we have video 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.759
 informative about also 5 spider-man 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.010
 3 this time it's about identity law 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.900
 of the man suspicious of the shadows in 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.460
 the amazing for n 2 just before 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.650
 that gave its term the intelligence 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.870
 artificial building we copy you three 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.490
 subjects mister fierce I follow den I'm 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.199
 saying that this generalist person is 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.180
 mike however a comment is made 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.220
 of jehova 16 to which I send a greeting 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.470
 I realized that the mysterious man 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.449
 of the shadows or the hat is like 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.090
 fierce also known as customers 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.529
 human or the Spanish called is sir yes 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.660
 I know it's not a big name for a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.640
 villain that we say besides that it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.620
 calls signature as I mentioned the tapes 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.600
 we know that neither in the printed one takes a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 cane like the film also 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.200
 smartware the director is amazing 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.399
 to add amazing winning man 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.440
 and that also indicates the third 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.879
 movie I say that this character went to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.590
 wait for the sequel to amazing 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.660
 spider-man and rather we did not see the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.039
 character or maybe and if this is 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.940
 the mysterious man with the hat and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.649
 the cane 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.420
 this character will only appear novels 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.250
 the trilogy the gathering of the six 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.320
 sinister so this character 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.390
 It is also related to this group of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.070
 super clement villains keeps a 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.870
 connection with peter parents and up 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.640
 pity enslaved to piti 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.620
 which was rumored to be the sister 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.330
 of peter although this I do not think it's 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.460
 possible the books are very little 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.560
 known but it is one of the classics of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.360
 spider-man as well we saw in the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.370
 movie the amazing spider-man 2 of the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.290
 peter pairs started a briefcase 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.240
 coffee color carrying several documents 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.130
 the same briefcase that come in the hands of 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.020
 peter in amazing spider man and the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.610
 amazing spider-man 2 but how is it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.960
 possible that the briefcase that assumes that 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.940
 must be next to the corpses of the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.950
 Peter's parents is now in the power of 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.840
 arachnid most likely the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.000
 Peter's parents are still alive or so 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 less only one of them if this were 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.500
 so the briefcase could have sent it to 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.330
 ben parker the uncle of peter so that what 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.460
 hid since he has very documents 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.380
 important many will say that it can be 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.570
 another briefcase but they see farc in the first 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.880
 part is current saga says it was a 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 gift from his mother for his father so 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.200
 I 30 with that briefcase two seems peter 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.480
 will be alive or as joey kept the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.800
 hands of Peter Parker giving understanding of 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.780
 that the shadow man likes 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.550
 fierce I hope that this list sent them to 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.200
 be an important character this 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.360
 character is fundamental and installs 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.100
 cinematographic which you are watching 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 on the screen although today you know if there is 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.640
 the tangles and if he will answer jj 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.620
 to defeat the arachnid since in the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.540
 comic happens but with the father of the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.980
 list smile although here in the film 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.020
 it could be different 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.850
 marc webb has said he wants to bring jj 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.620
 who are back in the saga and if 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.660
 this will happen we only have to deduce one 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.460
 thing if it's an enemy against lara that 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.870
 he does not want to unmask me or just 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.940
 do a destructive critic does the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.470
 what do you think, rent by 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.360
 all this apparently whoever enters with the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.400
 classic and modern to the history 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.890
 cinematic of spider-man something that 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.420
 I think if I like it and well between everything 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.310
 for this video explode to liked leave 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.780
 your comments thank you very much for watching and 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.780
 we'll see until the next
