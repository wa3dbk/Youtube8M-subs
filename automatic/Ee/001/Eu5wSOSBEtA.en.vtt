00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.139 
like try it mo whatever you want to lean
forward<00:01:45.950> just<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.700> little<00:01:46.729> bit<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:48.940> get<00:01:49.940> your

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
forward just a little bit to get your

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.550 
forward just a little bit to get your
groove<00:01:50.479> going<00:01:50.960> with<00:01:51.170> them

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
groove going with them

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.160 
groove going with them
the<00:01:52.009> motion<00:01:52.460> with<00:01:52.640> him<00:01:52.899> so<00:01:53.899> when<00:01:54.050> you're

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
the motion with him so when you're

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.370 
the motion with him so when you're
loping<00:01:54.619> they<00:01:55.070> have<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.580> motion<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.380> leap

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
loping they have that motion so leap

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.469 
loping they have that motion so leap
forward<00:01:58.000> use<00:01:59.000> your<00:01:59.240> thighs<00:01:59.509> and<00:02:00.670> you<00:02:01.670> will<00:02:02.240> go

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
forward use your thighs and you will go

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.510 
forward use your thighs and you will go
easier<00:02:03.080> with<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.320> motion<00:02:03.740> rather<00:02:04.250> than

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
easier with the motion rather than

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.730 
easier with the motion rather than
leaning<00:02:04.729> back<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:06.050> with<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.380> motion

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
leaning back and going with the motion

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.219 
leaning back and going with the motion
it's<00:02:06.920> harder<00:02:07.520> leaning<00:02:07.970> back<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:08.720> when<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.050> are

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
it's harder leaning back so when you are

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.699 
it's harder leaning back so when you are
going<00:02:09.610> faster<00:02:10.610> forward<00:02:11.320> use<00:02:12.320> your<00:02:12.470> thighs

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
going faster forward use your thighs

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.300 
going faster forward use your thighs
being<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.670> little<00:02:13.880> forward<00:02:14.350> if<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.830> have<00:02:16.040> to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
being a little forward if you have to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.790 
being a little forward if you have to
whichever<00:02:17.269> hand<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.660> write<00:02:17.840> with<00:02:18.019> grab<00:02:18.650> an

ice cream cone in this is what I call an
ice<00:02:20.780> cream<00:02:20.989> cone<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.590> one<00:02:22.130> hand<00:02:22.510> main<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
ice cream cone in one hand main and the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.320 
ice cream cone in one hand main and the
other<00:02:24.100> squeeze<00:02:25.100> your<00:02:25.250> thighs<00:02:25.310> lean<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.209> little

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
other squeeze your thighs lean a little

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.500 
other squeeze your thighs lean a little
forward<00:02:27.069> put<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.430> reins<00:02:28.640> up<00:02:28.850> here<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.300> let

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
forward put the reins up here and let

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.120 
forward put the reins up here and let
them<00:02:29.630> go<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:32.019> then<00:02:33.019> that<00:02:33.290> way<00:02:33.440> it's<00:02:33.650> easier<00:02:34.040> to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
them go and then that way it's easier to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.600 
them go and then that way it's easier to
go<00:02:34.220> with<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.430> motion<00:02:34.610> all<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.450> do<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:35.989> set<00:02:36.200> up
