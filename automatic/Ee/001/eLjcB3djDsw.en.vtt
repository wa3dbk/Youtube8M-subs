00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
through this brush it's going to lighten

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.590 
through this brush it's going to lighten
everything<00:01:57.000> up

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
everything up

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
everything up
so<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.290> don't<00:01:58.469> really<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.070> much<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.490> it

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
so I don't really have to do much do it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.130 
so I don't really have to do much do it
just<00:01:59.820> kind<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.090> go<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.240> start<00:02:00.630> blending<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
just kind of go and start blending it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.929 
just kind of go and start blending it
down<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.590> want<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.950> keep<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.219> out<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.549> center

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
down I want to keep it out of the center

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.700 
down I want to keep it out of the center
if<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.149> little<00:02:03.390> blends<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.409> not<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
if a little blends in there it's not the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.620 
if a little blends in there it's not the
end<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> world<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:05.969> do<00:02:06.119> want<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.450> keep

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
end of the world but I do want to keep

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.550 
end of the world but I do want to keep
it<00:02:06.810> fairly<00:02:07.320> yellow<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> middle<00:02:09.319> let's<00:02:10.319> go

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
it fairly yellow in the middle let's go

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.410 
it fairly yellow in the middle let's go
through<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.099> kind<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.550> liquefy<00:02:12.030> some<00:02:12.330> of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
through and kind of liquefy some of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.640 
through and kind of liquefy some of
these<00:02:12.480> colors

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
these colors

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.210 
these colors
and<00:02:14.640> I'm<00:02:15.480> leaving<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.230> barrier<00:02:16.650> between<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and I'm leaving a barrier between the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.000 
and I'm leaving a barrier between the
center<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.629> pedals<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.680> am<00:02:19.829> going<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
center and the pedals and I am going to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.610 
center and the pedals and I am going to
add<00:02:20.189> a<00:02:20.220> little<00:02:20.430> bit<00:02:20.579> more<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.390> pink<00:02:24.620> just

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
lot of it around here is that poison ivy

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.970 
lot of it around here is that poison ivy
leaves<00:03:15.930> usually<00:03:16.319> have<00:03:16.439> like<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.650> little<00:03:16.769> bit<00:03:16.889> of

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
leaves usually have like a little bit of

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.189 
leaves usually have like a little bit of
a<00:03:17.040> thumb<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.970> they're<00:03:18.120> kind<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.329> like<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.480> the

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
a thumb so they're kind of like a the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.509 
a thumb so they're kind of like a the
kind<00:03:19.379> of<00:03:19.590> oval<00:03:19.949> but<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:20.160> they<00:03:20.250> could<00:03:20.400> almost

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
kind of oval but then they could almost

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.979 
kind of oval but then they could almost
get<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> little<00:03:20.970> bump<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.480> think<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.870> as<00:03:21.959> a

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
get a little bump I think of that as a

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.659 
get a little bump I think of that as a
thumb<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.500> think<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.010> ones<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.459> thumb

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
thumb and I think the ones are the thumb

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.080 
thumb and I think the ones are the thumb
on<00:03:23.699> it<00:03:23.849> avoid<00:03:24.720> those<00:03:24.900> cuz<00:03:25.139> that's<00:03:25.260> poison<00:03:25.620> ivy

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
some of the mossy green I'll get a

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.749 
some of the mossy green I'll get a
really<00:05:10.930> cool<00:05:11.110> Brown<00:05:11.349> really<00:05:12.099> colorful<00:05:12.580> Brown

working with a smaller palette not so
many<00:05:29.139> colors<00:05:29.440> so<00:05:29.470> you're<00:05:29.680> forced<00:05:30.009> to<00:05:30.069> mix

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
many colors so you're forced to mix

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.620 
many colors so you're forced to mix
you're<00:05:30.460> forced<00:05:30.699> to<00:05:30.729> make<00:05:30.820> do<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.449> think

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630

you're forced to make do and I think
that's<00:05:31.780> excellent<00:05:32.199> I<00:05:32.560> mean<00:05:32.889> this<00:05:32.949> is<00:05:33.099> a<00:05:33.130> set<00:05:33.310> of

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
that's excellent I mean this is a set of

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.469 
that's excellent I mean this is a set of
24<00:05:33.699> so<00:05:33.880> I'm<00:05:33.940> like<00:05:34.030> you<00:05:34.090> have<00:05:34.120> to<00:05:34.240> do<00:05:34.330> much
