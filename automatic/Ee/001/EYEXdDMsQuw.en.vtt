00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.860
 hi how is this our model is 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.500
 representing the practice of titles 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.040
 flyers of growth in this case 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.189
 we are representing in general the auc 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.490
 if the is already a hormone that promotes 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.490
 rooting 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.170
 to the number of cases and outbreaks for sight 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.190
 for this practice we use what 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.550
 the gene has been 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.670
 which represents water the hydrogen that 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.909
 represents organic matter and 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.899
 stakes we also use stones from 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.260
 different colors 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.940
 -Good orange and red since we 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.290
 represent what has been the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.340
 toxins 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.930
 good as results of this practice 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.330
 we got what 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.530
 well we saw the difference of putting 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.150
 large quantities of good at 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 amounts of parts per million 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.130
 different types of stakes in the how 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.140
 in every experiment you should not miss 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.050
 our witness our witness there what 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.090
 we have no no we did not put offices and 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.200
 root growth because it was not 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.490
 a lot but if it was greater than some of the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.710
 following 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.869
 in the five parts per million there was 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.869
 an appearance of callus roots 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.090
 but it was not as good as the one we 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.510
 it seemed the optimum was 10 parts per 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.300
 million 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.300
 with it we see a lot of roots 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.509
 and some calluses if you can see 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.760
 like the emergence of buds that was 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.680
 good 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:09.700
 I loved the others 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.370
 in the 20 parts per million or one almost 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.890
 equality with 35 parts per million not 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.800
 there was not as good as the 10 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.300
 parts per million but where you notice the 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.220
 big difference is 4 million where 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:30.410
 we reduce that an excess 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.680
 offices in a to take root affect the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.680
 rooting 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.569
 here we have few roots 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.579
 we have few calluses 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.579
 and the outbreaks were very few too 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.960
 I can conclude that both 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.700
 as an excess as a lack of this 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.840
 hormone affects 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.590
 what has been the promotion of 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.590
 estate
