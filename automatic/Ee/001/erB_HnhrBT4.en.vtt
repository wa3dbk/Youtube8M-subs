right<00:00:09.120> here<00:00:09.389> Phil<00:00:09.750> I'll<00:00:09.870> have<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.050> look<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.530> see

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
right here Phil I'll have a look and see

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.169 
right here Phil I'll have a look and see
if<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.099> seven<00:00:11.460> will<00:00:11.580> go<00:00:11.700> off<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.000> nine

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
if that seven will go off the nine

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.970 
if that seven will go off the nine
because<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.660> definitely<00:00:13.049> does<00:00:13.200> looking<00:00:13.740> right

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
because it definitely does looking right

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.730 
because it definitely does looking right
now<00:00:17.480> and<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> other<00:00:18.720> option<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.560> back

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
now and the other option is to get back

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.170 
now and the other option is to get back
out<00:00:19.949> into<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> middle<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> table<00:00:20.880> that

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
out into the middle of the table that

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.840 
out into the middle of the table that
he's<00:00:21.270> looking<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.689> now<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.320> he's<00:00:22.820> when<00:00:23.820> he

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
he's looking at now so he's when he

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.519 
he's looking at now so he's when he
makes<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.269> seven<00:00:24.630> off<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> noise<00:00:25.080> he's<00:00:25.350> going

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
makes a seven off the noise he's going

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.109

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the angle that he had he may just try

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.209 
the angle that he had he may just try
