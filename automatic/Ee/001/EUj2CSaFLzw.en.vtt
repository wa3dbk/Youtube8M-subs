play<00:01:43.439> around<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.250> much<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
play around with this one as much and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.219

now<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> kind<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.060> wish<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.329> had<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.899> certainly

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
now I kind of wish I had it certainly

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.899 
now I kind of wish I had it certainly
felt<00:01:46.530> slower<00:01:46.920> than<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> looked<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> alpha

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.670 
felt slower than it looked in the alpha
which<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.299> good<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.750> didn't<00:01:49.079> try<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> shoot<00:01:49.500> too

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
the Alpha they look pretty distracting I

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.590 
the Alpha they look pretty distracting I
can<00:03:59.490> see<00:03:59.610> why<00:03:59.730> new<00:03:59.880> players<00:04:00.120> would<00:04:00.300> find<00:04:00.480> them

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
can see why new players would find them

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.120 
can see why new players would find them

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
useful but I didn't hate him as much as
