 Trepadito to a gate. As a child I saw you arrive. 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.090
 I was captivated by your figure and your cadence when walking. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 And between games and school, I learned to draw. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 To the air the handkerchiefs, they invite it to dance. 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.870
 Let this zamba party, raising the polvaderal. 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:54.000
 That today is the country people, the one who wants to sing to you. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Criollita like none. Like you, there is no other like it. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.560
 Girl zamba aroma, I want to reach you. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Because following your tracks, everyone walks behind. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.369
 No one has given these furrows, both effort and love. 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:50.000
 Gaucha you give hope, to the early bird man. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 And they tell of her in the field, which until the time she tamed. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 To the air the handkerchiefs, they invite it to dance. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Let this zamba party, raising the polvaderal. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.200
 That today is the country people, the one who wants to sing to you. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 The one who wants to sing to you 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.000
 The one who wants to sing to you
