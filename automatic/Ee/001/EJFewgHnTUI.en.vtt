00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
right here it's actually a rather big

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.379 
right here it's actually a rather big
map<00:03:46.139> that<00:03:46.440> doesn't<00:03:46.680> feel<00:03:47.310> like<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.819> big<00:03:48.150> map

shoes it's very tricky to do that like
get<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> map<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.199> a<00:03:55.530> big<00:03:55.799> map<00:03:55.949> but<00:03:56.220> doesn't

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
get a map that is a big map but doesn't

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.970 
get a map that is a big map but doesn't
play<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.790> way<00:03:57.180> just<00:03:57.449> perfect<00:03:57.870> uses<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.680> like

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
play that way just perfect uses of like

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.439 
play that way just perfect uses of like
areas<00:03:59.400> like<00:03:59.519> this<00:03:59.609> like<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.909> lifeguard<00:04:00.299> thing

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
areas like this like the lifeguard thing

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.180 
areas like this like the lifeguard thing
that<00:04:00.599> causes<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:01.440> beach<00:04:01.620> could<00:04:01.889> be<00:04:01.980> one

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
that causes this beach could be one

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.969 
that causes this beach could be one
gigantic<00:04:02.760> open<00:04:03.419> shoot<00:04:03.930> take<00:04:04.169> a<00:04:04.230> run-out<00:04:04.530> area

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
gigantic open shoot take a run-out area

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.649 
gigantic open shoot take a run-out area
but<00:04:05.459> since<00:04:05.639> I<00:04:05.729> put<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:05.940> lifeguard<00:04:06.269> house<00:04:06.449> here

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
but since I put the lifeguard house here

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.210 
but since I put the lifeguard house here
it's<00:04:07.109> actually<00:04:07.260> more<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.680> close<00:04:07.919> quarters

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220
