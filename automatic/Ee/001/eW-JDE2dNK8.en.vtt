00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
that stuff it really becomes a little

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.819 
that stuff it really becomes a little
bit<00:01:57.969> cumbersome<00:01:58.539> now<00:01:59.259> this<00:01:59.529> particular

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
bit cumbersome now this particular

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.239 
bit cumbersome now this particular
laptop<00:02:00.789> is<00:02:01.719> more<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.079> a<00:02:02.169> hybrid<00:02:02.409> kind<00:02:03.069> of

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
laptop is more of a hybrid kind of

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.729 
laptop is more of a hybrid kind of
laptop<00:02:03.729> I<00:02:03.969> can<00:02:04.299> essentially<00:02:05.289> turn<00:02:05.590> this

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:05.739 
laptop I can essentially turn this

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.210 
laptop I can essentially turn this
laptop<00:02:06.039> into<00:02:06.789> a<00:02:06.819> netbook<00:02:07.509> if<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.410> wanted<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:08.830> I

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
laptop into a netbook if I wanted to I

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.380 
laptop into a netbook if I wanted to I
just<00:02:10.000> Preston<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.479> eco<00:02:10.750> button<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.290> i<00:02:12.250> get<00:02:12.489> 4

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
just Preston the eco button and i get 4

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.530 
just Preston the eco button and i get 4
times<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.870> battery<00:02:14.319> life<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.940> i<00:02:15.970> could<00:02:16.390> always

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
times the battery life so i could always

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.320 
times the battery life so i could always
just<00:02:16.810> do<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.260> way<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:19.660> terms<00:02:19.990> of

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
just do it that way but the in terms of

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.650 
just do it that way but the in terms of
regular<00:02:22.330> kinds<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.020> laptops<00:02:23.500> even<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.070> kind

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
regular kinds of laptops even this kind

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.560 
regular kinds of laptops even this kind
versus<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.690> tablet<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.090> average<00:02:28.270> consumer

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
versus a tablet to the average consumer

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:37.610 
versus a tablet to the average consumer
a<00:02:30.060> tablet<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:32.340> more<00:02:33.340> suitable<00:02:33.760> than<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.780> laptop

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.870 

so<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.680> always<00:02:38.980> go<00:02:39.250> have<00:02:39.400> people<00:02:39.700> buying

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
so you always go have people buying

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.360 
so you always go have people buying
desktop<00:02:40.390> computers<00:02:40.840> because<00:02:41.350> let's<00:02:42.310> just

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
desktop computers because let's just

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.370 
desktop computers because let's just
face<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.670> desktop<00:02:43.180> computers<00:02:43.750> are<00:02:44.020> always

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
face it desktop computers are always

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.110 
face it desktop computers are always
going<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.650> be<00:02:44.680> more<00:02:44.890> powerful<00:02:45.130> than<00:02:45.610> laptop

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
going to be more powerful than laptop

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.620 
going to be more powerful than laptop
computers<00:02:46.690> but<00:02:47.410> tablet<00:02:47.860> computers<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:51.630> going

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
computers but tablet computers is going

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.170 
computers but tablet computers is going
to<00:02:52.720> be<00:02:52.840> more<00:02:53.110> functional<00:02:53.980> than<00:02:54.810> laptops<00:02:57.180> for

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
to be more functional than laptops for

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.420 
to be more functional than laptops for

story but the tablet in general for the
average<00:06:49.750> person<00:06:49.930> I<00:06:50.470> believe<00:06:50.980> is<00:06:51.190> going<00:06:51.310> to<00:06:51.430> be

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
average person I believe is going to be

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.760 
average person I believe is going to be
more<00:06:51.700> suitable<00:06:52.120> than<00:06:52.450> a<00:06:52.870> laptop<00:06:53.530> and<00:06:54.930> this<00:06:55.930> and

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
more suitable than a laptop and this and

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.500 
more suitable than a laptop and this and
I<00:06:57.670> believe<00:06:58.030> at<00:06:58.270> the<00:06:58.540> end<00:06:58.570> of<00:06:59.080> next<00:06:59.170> year<00:07:00.510> come

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
I believe at the end of next year come

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.970 
I believe at the end of next year come
around<00:07:01.750> the<00:07:01.960> summertime<00:07:02.500> in<00:07:02.650> 2012<00:07:04.980> we're

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:05.980 
around the summertime in 2012 we're

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.190 
around the summertime in 2012 we're
going<00:07:06.160> to<00:07:06.280> see<00:07:06.540> figures<00:07:07.540> that<00:07:08.280> states<00:07:09.280> that

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
going to see figures that states that

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.020 
going to see figures that states that
tablet<00:07:11.400> computers<00:07:13.860> will<00:07:14.860> sell<00:07:15.130> more<00:07:15.700> than

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
tablet computers will sell more than

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.090 
tablet computers will sell more than
laptops<00:07:17.670> so<00:07:18.670> I<00:07:18.700> think<00:07:19.380> 2012<00:07:20.380> is<00:07:20.650> going<00:07:20.920> to<00:07:21.010> be

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100 
laptops so I think 2012 is going to be

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.730 
laptops so I think 2012 is going to be
the<00:07:21.250> year<00:07:21.610> that<00:07:21.790> you<00:07:22.600> go<00:07:22.690> and<00:07:22.750> say<00:07:22.960> ship<00:07:23.320> from

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740 
the year that you go and say ship from

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.020 
the year that you go and say ship from
laptop<00:07:24.190> computers<00:07:24.910> to<00:07:25.330> tablet<00:07:25.780> computers

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.030 
laptop computers to tablet computers

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.270 
laptop computers to tablet computers
that's<00:07:28.030> just<00:07:28.150> me
