 correction of errors and improvements in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.139
 stability apart the people from being to 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.060
 all added two new packs is rhythm 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.100
 for all controllers and support 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.820
 for the new sandwich and the times to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.439
 times and 300 now in tournaments for 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.619
 effects was preserved is for it is 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.689
 free and the back pack that keeps paying and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.920
 the beige for obviously that is the one with 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.270
 which already well installed in the center 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.130
 all right 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.870
 now if we realize we have 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.110
 some repeated effects in the list 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.150
 this means that some effects to 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.800
 available in multi face mode and in 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.570
 the single effects mode we can give 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.739
 account for cycles 35 two or three 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.350
 circles determine that they are 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.910
 available in single multi fex mode 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.920
 today circle that is available in the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.690
 single mode and in single mode we can 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.940
 access to modify the parameters of 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.699
 each effect 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.759
 Now next for the activation of 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.190
 the effects of westpac we have to 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.729
 be with the latest version of the sheraton 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.759
 and the next 1.30 with the controller 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.729
 connected we go online we go to marcela 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.880
 I'll open a window and that window 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.909
 for registration it is to relieve one 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.579
 recorded time achieved 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.670
 and they're going to skip that other window in the 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:30.030
 which should only locate wolfpack and 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.719
 give it to activate the deactivated child 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.209
 close and remove it in online pana setup 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.680
 and we're going to see the new tab 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.230
 effects 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.450
 and all the effects available in the 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.000
 beige party in the world tag now 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.600
 traditionally to not have a list 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.970
 huge expandable and waxed of what 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.130
 has made people ceratto is to use 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.230
 a list of favorites in this case 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.450
 let's add the echo 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.450
 let's chop to see 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.799
 if not 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.649
 the next ones for example 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.200
 we have 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.180
 4en 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.180
 in multi we will add one more 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.570
 52 44 activate the check here above 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.600
 we leave effects and we see that the mode 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.250
 single determined by a single disc not 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.060
 we have the four effects that we have 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.770
 determined in multi mode we have the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.360
 four other effects that we have 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.400
 determined and that helps us like I said 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.080
 to not have a huge list of 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.600
 effects in which we have to navigate 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.610
 at the time we did work 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.350
