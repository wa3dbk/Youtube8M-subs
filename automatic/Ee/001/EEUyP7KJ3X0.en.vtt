00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
got here oops hmm it can be tricky to

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.389 
got here oops hmm it can be tricky to
find<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:49.439> really<00:01:49.710> easier<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.189> both

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
find and it's really easier with both

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.750 
find and it's really easier with both
hands<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:52.340> there<00:01:53.340> comes<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.790> bone

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
hands but there comes the bone

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.680 
hands but there comes the bone
alright<00:01:55.380> set<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.590> in<00:01:56.710> there<00:01:57.120> and<00:01:58.120> we'll<00:01:58.630> be

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
alright set that in there and we'll be

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.800 
alright set that in there and we'll be
back<00:01:58.930> in<00:01:59.260> a<00:01:59.620> minute<00:02:01.590> alright<00:02:03.240> our<00:02:04.240> salmon<00:02:04.660> has

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
back in a minute alright our salmon has

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.350 
back in a minute alright our salmon has
no<00:02:04.960> more<00:02:05.110> bones<00:02:05.320> in<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.820> they<00:02:06.820> were<00:02:06.970> running<00:02:07.120> in

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
no more bones in it they were running in

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.380 
no more bones in it they were running in
a<00:02:07.450> line<00:02:07.630> roughly<00:02:08.200> here<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:08.950> here<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.210> those

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
a line roughly here and here so those

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.180 
a line roughly here and here so those
are<00:02:10.510> all<00:02:10.540> set<00:02:10.869> next<00:02:11.860> up<00:02:13.290> basically<00:02:14.290> just<00:02:14.680> take

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
are all set next up basically just take

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.150 
are all set next up basically just take
the<00:02:15.340> salt<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.830> sugar<00:02:19.590> mix<00:02:20.590> into<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.950> ball

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
the salt and the sugar mix into the ball

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.490 
the salt and the sugar mix into the ball
I<00:02:23.130> did<00:02:24.130> wash<00:02:24.340> my<00:02:24.550> hands<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.870> know<00:02:28.500> because

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
I did wash my hands so you know because

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.660 
I did wash my hands so you know because
this<00:02:29.650> stuff<00:02:29.890> doesn't<00:02:30.190> really<00:02:30.220> get<00:02:30.460> heat

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
this stuff doesn't really get heat

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.280 
this stuff doesn't really get heat
applied<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.270> so<00:02:31.480> cleanliness<00:02:31.780> is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
applied to it so cleanliness is

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.770 
applied to it so cleanliness is
important<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.210> basically<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:34.420> dip<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
important and basically you just dip the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.220 
important and basically you just dip the
fish<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.410> get<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.040> good<00:02:36.280> encoded<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:38.050> all

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
fish in it get a good encoded on all

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.120 
fish in it get a good encoded on all
sides<00:02:38.850> with<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.970> salt<00:02:40.210> and<00:02:40.330> pepper<00:02:40.480> mixture

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
sides with the salt and pepper mixture

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.880 
sides with the salt and pepper mixture
and<00:02:42.900> can't<00:02:43.900> hurt<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.200> just<00:02:44.320> kind<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.650> picks

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
and can't hurt you just kind of picks

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:54.420 
and can't hurt you just kind of picks
them<00:02:45.070> up<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.460> pack<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.720> their<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:50.200> so

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.810 

actually<00:02:55.870> now<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:56.900> that's<00:02:57.230> their<00:02:57.820> basically

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
actually now that that's their basically

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.850 
actually now that that's their basically
lay<00:02:59.120> some<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.990> some<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.470> deal<00:03:00.650> on<00:03:00.830> the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
lay some of the some of the deal on the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.620 
lay some of the some of the deal on the
bottom<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.400> dish<00:03:01.990> like<00:03:02.990> so<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:05.450> more

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
bottom of the dish like so the more

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.030 
bottom of the dish like so the more
important<00:03:05.990> part<00:03:06.020> is<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.290> get<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.620> deal<00:03:06.800> in

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
important part is to get the deal in

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.560 
important part is to get the deal in
between<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.610> two<00:03:07.790> layers<00:03:07.970> which<00:03:08.330> are<00:03:08.420> going

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
between the two layers which are going

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.000 
between the two layers which are going
to<00:03:08.630> be<00:03:08.690> facing<00:03:08.930> each<00:03:09.170> other<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:09.590> sandwiched

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
to be facing each other and sandwiched

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.880 
to be facing each other and sandwiched
but<00:03:10.900> especially<00:03:11.900> since<00:03:12.290> we<00:03:12.470> have<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:12.770> much

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
but especially since we have so much

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.949 
but especially since we have so much
extra<00:03:13.190> dill<00:03:13.459> going<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.270> put<00:03:14.420> some<00:03:14.450> underneath

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
extra dill going to put some underneath

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.020 
extra dill going to put some underneath
and<00:03:15.230> on<00:03:15.410> top<00:03:15.620> as<00:03:15.800> well<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:16.730> there<00:03:16.850> goes<00:03:17.000> one

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
and on top as well so there goes one

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.980 
and on top as well so there goes one
piece<00:03:17.860> now<00:03:18.860> we're<00:03:19.040> going<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.690> just<00:03:20.690> lay<00:03:20.959> a

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
piece now we're going to just lay a

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.370 
piece now we're going to just lay a
bunch<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.380> dill<00:03:21.880> on<00:03:22.880> top<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.600> we're<00:03:24.260> going

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
bunch of dill on top of that we're going

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.190 
bunch of dill on top of that we're going
to<00:03:24.440> make<00:03:24.620> essentially<00:03:25.570> like<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.660> big<00:03:26.870> deal

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
to make essentially like a big deal

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.180 
to make essentially like a big deal
sandwich<00:03:27.890> with<00:03:28.959> salmon<00:03:29.959> as<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.230> bread<00:03:33.190> that

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
sandwich with salmon as the bread that

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.570 
sandwich with salmon as the bread that
should<00:03:34.370> really<00:03:34.550> probably<00:03:34.940> be<00:03:35.480> enough<00:03:36.580> now

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
should really probably be enough now

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.970 
should really probably be enough now
can't<00:03:38.090> get<00:03:38.209> too<00:03:38.390> much<00:03:38.600> deal<00:03:38.870> because<00:03:39.770> it's

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
can't get too much deal because it's

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.190 
can't get too much deal because it's
just<00:03:40.190> really<00:03:40.340> touching<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.880> surface<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.600> of

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
just really touching the surface and of

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.800 
just really touching the surface and of
course<00:03:42.440> your<00:03:43.220> guests<00:03:43.670> or<00:03:43.880> maybe<00:03:44.239> just<00:03:44.360> you<00:03:44.690> if

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
course your guests or maybe just you if

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.930 
course your guests or maybe just you if
you<00:03:44.930> eat<00:03:45.080> it<00:03:45.200> all<00:03:45.350> we'll<00:03:45.950> be<00:03:46.100> eating<00:03:46.489> all<00:03:46.700> the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
you eat it all we'll be eating all the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.810 
you eat it all we'll be eating all the
way<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.239> middle<00:03:47.420> of<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.810> fish<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:49.250> having

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
way to the middle of the fish so having

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.520 
way to the middle of the fish so having
a<00:03:50.000> stuff<00:03:50.239> having<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.930> good<00:03:51.080> amount<00:03:51.260> on<00:03:51.440> the

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
a stuff having a good amount on the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.020 
a stuff having a good amount on the
outside<00:03:51.940> can't<00:03:52.940> hurt<00:03:53.180> flavor-wise<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:55.040> so<00:03:55.880> we

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
outside can't hurt flavor-wise and so we

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.710 
outside can't hurt flavor-wise and so we
would<00:03:56.390> kind<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.750> coded<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.950> second<00:03:58.340> one<00:03:58.720> and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
would kind of coded the second one and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.660 
would kind of coded the second one and
if<00:04:00.110> you<00:04:00.200> used<00:04:00.380> full<00:04:00.680> size<00:04:00.920> pieces<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.549> fish

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
if you used full size pieces of fish

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.890 
if you used full size pieces of fish
there<00:04:01.850> probably<00:04:02.090> would<00:04:02.209> be<00:04:02.390> this<00:04:02.660> much<00:04:04.900> salt

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
there probably would be this much salt

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.780 
there probably would be this much salt
and<00:04:06.200> sugar<00:04:06.500> left<00:04:06.799> over<00:04:07.070> but<00:04:07.190> as<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.459> said<00:04:07.519> these

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
and sugar left over but as I said these

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.590 
and sugar left over but as I said these
are<00:04:07.850> these<00:04:08.120> guys<00:04:08.299> are<00:04:08.360> about<00:04:08.600> half<00:04:08.930> size<00:04:09.290> so

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
are these guys are about half size so

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.479 
are these guys are about half size so
then<00:04:11.600> you<00:04:11.720> lay<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.989> other<00:04:12.140> one<00:04:12.310> second<00:04:13.310> one<00:04:13.459> on

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
then you lay the other one second one on

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.150 
then you lay the other one second one on
top<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:13.970> first<00:04:14.500> going<00:04:15.500> if<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.040> look

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
top of the first going if you look

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.979 
top of the first going if you look
sideways<00:04:16.489> notice<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.269> thick<00:04:17.540> side<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:17.900> this

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
sideways notice the thick side of this

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.770 
sideways notice the thick side of this
is<00:04:18.729> opposite<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.790> thin<00:04:20.060> side<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.390> that<00:04:20.510> so

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
is opposite the thin side of that so

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.909 
is opposite the thin side of that so
they<00:04:20.870> make<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.049> pretty<00:04:21.260> kind<00:04:21.500> of<00:04:21.590> level
