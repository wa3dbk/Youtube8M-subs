00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
ipod touch itself okay so you should go

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.760 
ipod touch itself okay so you should go
ahead<00:01:39.650> put<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.130> sides<00:01:42.380> check<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.560> it's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
ahead put all the sides check if it's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.539

all<00:01:44.009> inside<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:45.770> your<00:01:46.770> case<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.369> you're

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
all inside and your case is on you're

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.749 
all inside and your case is on you're
ready<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.890> what<00:01:50.100> will<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
ready to go so this is what will it

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.639 
ready to go so this is what will it
looks<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.180> when<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.659> put<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.110> your<00:01:52.409> case

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
looks like when you put on your case

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.340 
looks like when you put on your case
itself<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.759> actually<00:01:54.149> make<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.630> case<00:01:54.960> much

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
itself they actually make the case much

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.800 
itself they actually make the case much
thicker<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.659> much<00:01:57.869> thicker<00:01:59.810> so

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
thicker as you can see much thicker so

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.410 
thicker as you can see much thicker so
when<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.439> drop<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.340> bottom<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:03.390> will

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
when you drop it on the bottom it will

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.139 
when you drop it on the bottom it will
actually<00:02:03.780> decrease<00:02:04.229> your<00:02:04.530> ipod<00:02:05.460> touch<00:02:05.670> damage

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
actually decrease your ipod touch damage

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.710 
actually decrease your ipod touch damage
because<00:02:06.860> slams<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.160> ground<00:02:08.640> hit<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.479> case

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
because slams in a ground hit the case

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.070 
because slams in a ground hit the case
first<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.319> then<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.160> ipod<00:02:11.489> touch<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.390> that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
first and then your ipod touch so that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.610 
first and then your ipod touch so that
is

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
is

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.059 
is
a really<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.489> nice<00:02:14.790> design<00:02:15.209> on<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.690> case

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
a really really nice design on this case

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.149 
a really really nice design on this case
so<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.400> really<00:02:17.790> nice<00:02:18.120> plus<00:02:18.599> point<00:02:18.980> overall<00:02:19.980> I

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
so a really nice plus point overall I

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.030 
so a really nice plus point overall I
think<00:02:20.280> there's<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.760> really<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.269> nice<00:02:21.510> case

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
think there's a really really nice case

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.830 
think there's a really really nice case
so<00:02:23.040> definitely<00:02:23.519> go<00:02:23.580> ahead<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.209> go<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.510> their
