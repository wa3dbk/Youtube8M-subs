so far most of the obstacles have been
fairly<00:01:42.290> easy<00:01:42.440> going<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.070> not<00:01:43.580> providing<00:01:43.909> any

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
fairly easy going and not providing any

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.630 
the test this is where the side steps
lift<00:03:48.690> kits<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.260> diff<00:03:49.680> locks<00:03:49.950> will<00:03:50.190> get<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.370> good

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
lift kits and diff locks will get a good

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.640 
lift kits and diff locks will get a good
workout<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:52.110> is<00:03:52.230> what<00:03:52.410> they'll<00:03:52.590> be

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
workout and this is what they'll be

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.880 
workout and this is what they'll be
hitting<00:03:52.860> over<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:54.209> starts<00:03:54.720> off<00:03:54.840> easy<00:03:55.110> but<00:03:55.739> as

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
hitting over it starts off easy but as

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.800 
hitting over it starts off easy but as
will<00:03:56.100> soon<00:03:56.400> see<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:57.030> only<00:03:57.480> going<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.750> get

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
will soon see is only going to get

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.940 
will soon see is only going to get
harder<00:03:59.360> it's<00:04:00.360> also<00:04:00.569> slow<00:04:01.049> going<00:04:01.500> especially

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
harder it's also slow going especially

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.370 
harder it's also slow going especially
when<00:04:02.489> you're<00:04:02.640> with<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.819> larger<00:04:03.209> group<00:04:03.260> but<00:04:04.260> it

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
when you're with a larger group but it

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.259 
when you're with a larger group but it
pays<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.620> be<00:04:04.890> on<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.099> ball<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.549> not<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:06.090> hit

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
pays to be on the ball and not just hit

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.670 
pays to be on the ball and not just hit
it<00:04:06.390> like<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.569> bull<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.019> gate<00:04:09.140> once<00:04:10.140> again

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680
