00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:46.839 
check that that much at all it's kind of

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:48.600 
check that that much at all it's kind of
better<00:05:46.990> if<00:05:47.139> you<00:05:47.229> don't<00:05:47.379> really<00:05:47.499> touch<00:05:47.709> it<00:05:47.949> but

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
better if you don't really touch it but

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.879 
better if you don't really touch it but
that's<00:05:48.759> where<00:05:49.089> it<00:05:49.179> is<00:05:49.300> but<00:05:50.169> again<00:05:50.289> everything

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
that's where it is but again everything

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.429 
that's where it is but again everything
is<00:05:51.009> labeled<00:05:51.369> so<00:05:51.969> if<00:05:52.180> you<00:05:52.389> are<00:05:52.689> unable<00:05:52.869> to<00:05:53.229> find

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:53.439 
is labeled so if you are unable to find

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.790 
is labeled so if you are unable to find
anything<00:05:53.979> just<00:05:54.669> look<00:05:54.969> at<00:05:55.149> the<00:05:55.300> little<00:05:55.800> little

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
anything just look at the little little

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.969 
anything just look at the little little
decals<00:05:57.159> on<00:05:57.369> here<00:05:57.610> because<00:05:57.969> they're<00:05:58.240> made<00:05:58.449> for

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
decals on here because they're made for

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.829 
decals on here because they're made for
you<00:05:59.979> know<00:06:00.099> even<00:06:00.519> people<00:06:00.999> that<00:06:01.029> work<00:06:01.419> on<00:06:01.569> cars

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:01.839 
you know even people that work on cars

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.359 
you know even people that work on cars
for<00:06:01.899> every<00:06:02.259> day<00:06:02.379> for<00:06:02.589> a<00:06:02.619> living<00:06:02.949> just<00:06:03.099> so<00:06:03.249> they

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:03.369 
for every day for a living just so they

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:14.700 
for every day for a living just so they
know<00:06:03.399> and<00:06:03.699> then<00:06:03.789> okay<00:06:04.029> sup<00:06:04.240> case<00:06:04.709> but<00:06:05.709> um

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.910 

so<00:06:15.710> if<00:06:16.040> you<00:06:16.130> don't<00:06:16.250> have<00:06:16.430> a<00:06:16.490> final<00:06:16.790> or<00:06:17.780> you<00:06:18.770> lose

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
so if you don't have a final or you lose

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.560 
so if you don't have a final or you lose
finals<00:06:19.340> because<00:06:19.730> everybody<00:06:20.420> loses

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
finals because everybody loses

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.420 
finals because everybody loses
everything<00:06:20.870> I<00:06:21.050> guess<00:06:21.200> you<00:06:21.890> can<00:06:22.040> make<00:06:22.160> a<00:06:22.190> funnel

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
everything I guess you can make a funnel

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.140 
everything I guess you can make a funnel
like<00:06:22.820> we<00:06:22.940> did<00:06:23.120> and<00:06:23.330> all<00:06:24.260> this<00:06:24.560> is<00:06:24.770> is<00:06:25.010> a<00:06:25.520> pop

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
like we did and all this is is a pop

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.380 
like we did and all this is is a pop
potater<00:06:26.510> or<00:06:26.870> so<00:06:27.200> depending

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.020 

bottom<00:06:31.840> and<00:06:32.410> then<00:06:32.860> you<00:06:33.100> take<00:06:33.280> a<00:06:33.460> knife<00:06:33.760> or

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
bottom and then you take a knife or

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.000 
bottom and then you take a knife or
whatever<00:06:34.390> you<00:06:34.480> have<00:06:34.600> and<00:06:34.930> cut<00:06:35.110> off<00:06:35.260> the<00:06:35.680> bottom

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
whatever you have and cut off the bottom

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:50.310 
whatever you have and cut off the bottom
of<00:06:36.130> it<00:06:36.160> and<00:06:36.400> make<00:06:36.700> sure<00:06:36.730> you<00:06:37.060> clean

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.590
