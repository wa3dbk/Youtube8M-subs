for many of these students is the first
time<00:00:19.410> they've<00:00:19.680> ever<00:00:19.800> presented<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.550> poster

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
students were thinking I'm just going to

get<00:01:15.869> an<00:01:16.020> AAS<00:01:16.290> degree<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
get an AAS degree and then that's it and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420 
get an AAS degree and then that's it and
now<00:01:18.420> they're<00:01:18.570> all<00:01:18.600> talking<00:01:18.720> PhD<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.830> fonda

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
now they're all talking PhD I fonda

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.830 
now they're all talking PhD I fonda
really

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
really

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.069 
really
idea<00:01:21.829> of<00:01:22.090> what<00:01:23.090> it's<00:01:23.210> like<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.600> be<00:01:23.750> in<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.899> lab

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
idea of what it's like to be in a lab

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.419 
idea of what it's like to be in a lab
every<00:01:24.530> day<00:01:24.679> doing<00:01:25.250> research<00:01:25.789> learning<00:01:26.750> and

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
every day doing research learning and

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.190 
every day doing research learning and
what<00:01:28.429> it<00:01:28.549> would<00:01:28.670> be<00:01:28.700> like<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.969> get<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> PhD<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.990> a

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
what it would be like to get a PhD and a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.719 
what it would be like to get a PhD and a
year<00:01:30.380> ago<00:01:30.500> if<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:30.859> would<00:01:31.039> have<00:01:31.219> showed<00:01:31.490> them<00:01:31.640> a

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
year ago if you would have showed them a

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.789 
year ago if you would have showed them a
bigger<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:32.119> say<00:01:32.270> analyze<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:33.049> they<00:01:33.710> would

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
bigger and say analyze this they would

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.800 
bigger and say analyze this they would
have<00:01:33.920> been<00:01:34.009> intimidated<00:01:34.609> by<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:34.789> now<00:01:35.359> they

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
have been intimidated by it now they

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.510 
have been intimidated by it now they
will<00:01:35.929> tell<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:36.409> what<00:01:36.829> it<00:01:36.979> means<00:01:37.219> and<00:01:37.399> then

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
will tell you what it means and then

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.949 
will tell you what it means and then
they'll<00:01:37.670> ask<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.060> questions<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.689> are<00:01:38.810> kind

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
they'll ask you questions that are kind

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.719 
they'll ask you questions that are kind
of<00:01:39.020> hard<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.500> answer<00:01:39.770> when<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.459> British

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
of hard to answer when the British

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.270 
of hard to answer when the British
program<00:01:41.030> was<00:01:41.179> brought<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.450> us<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:42.469> was<00:01:43.100> pretty

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
program was brought to us I was pretty

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.800 
program was brought to us I was pretty
excited<00:01:43.429> about<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:43.969> for<00:01:44.299> a<00:01:44.329> couple<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.630> reasons

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
excited about it for a couple of reasons

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.559 
excited about it for a couple of reasons
one<00:01:45.109> is<00:01:45.319> that<00:01:45.350> but<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.579> gave<00:01:47.240> us<00:01:47.420> an

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
one is that but it gave us an

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.599 
one is that but it gave us an
opportunity<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:48.170> interest<00:01:48.890> students<00:01:49.459> at<00:01:49.579> a

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
opportunity to interest students at a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.510 
opportunity to interest students at a
much<00:01:49.850> earlier<00:01:50.000> stage<00:01:50.240> in<00:01:50.840> their<00:01:51.399> training<00:01:52.399> and

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
much earlier stage in their training and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.669 
much earlier stage in their training and
development<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.329> also<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.810> fact<00:01:53.989> that<00:01:54.079> we

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
development and also the fact that we

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.649 
development and also the fact that we
