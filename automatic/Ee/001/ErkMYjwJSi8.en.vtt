00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
welcome to demolition ranch this is a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.150 
welcome to demolition ranch this is a
can<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.120> cold<00:00:09.389> fire<00:00:09.719> defense<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.800> can<00:00:11.010> be

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
can of cold fire defense and this can be

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.700 
can of cold fire defense and this can be
bought<00:00:12.090> from<00:00:12.240> air<00:00:12.420> 500<00:00:12.840> armored<00:00:13.019> calm<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
bought from air 500 armored calm and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.279 
bought from air 500 armored calm and
basically<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:14.880> just<00:00:14.940> an<00:00:15.150> aerosol<00:00:15.450> can<00:00:15.509> that

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
basically it's just an aerosol can that

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.920 
basically it's just an aerosol can that
I<00:00:16.800> think<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.520> cools<00:00:17.789> down<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.359> stuff<00:00:18.690> enough

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
I think just cools down the stuff enough

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.420 
I think just cools down the stuff enough
that<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.140> won't<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.470> fire<00:00:19.650> anymore<00:00:19.890> not

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
that it won't be on fire anymore not

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.500 
that it won't be on fire anymore not
real<00:00:20.580> sure<00:00:20.730> we're<00:00:20.880> gonna<00:00:21.000> try<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.420> today

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
real sure we're gonna try it out today

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.689 
real sure we're gonna try it out today
but<00:00:21.869> first<00:00:22.020> when<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.769> start<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.039> fire<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.519> down

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
but first when you start a fire so down

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.540 
but first when you start a fire so down
there<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.720> bowl<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> very<00:00:26.099> thin

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
there I have a bowl with a very thin

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.630 
there I have a bowl with a very thin
layer<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.849> gasoline

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
layer of gasoline

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.549 
layer of gasoline
all<00:00:29.640> right<00:00:29.789> don't<00:00:29.910> try<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.210> at<00:00:30.359> home<00:00:33.559> all

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
all right don't try this at home all

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.690 
all right don't try this at home all
right<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> gasoline<00:00:35.670> fire<00:00:37.520> let's<00:00:38.520> see

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
right we have a gasoline fire let's see

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.880 
right we have a gasoline fire let's see
what<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.879> stuff<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.390> do

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.800 

I<00:00:47.610> took<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.820> little<00:00:49.000> bit<00:00:49.180> then<00:00:49.360> it<00:00:49.480> snuffed<00:00:49.720> it

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
I took a little bit then it snuffed it

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.750 
I took a little bit then it snuffed it
out<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.710> this<00:00:50.830> stuff<00:00:51.040> does<00:00:51.190> not<00:00:51.220> say<00:00:51.580> it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
out and this stuff does not say it's

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.400 
out and this stuff does not say it's
made<00:00:51.940> for<00:00:52.150> gasoline<00:00:52.630> fire<00:00:52.810> so<00:00:53.050> that's<00:00:53.200> kind<00:00:53.380> of

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
made for gasoline fire so that's kind of

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.350 
made for gasoline fire so that's kind of
cool<00:00:53.560> I<00:00:53.860> think<00:00:54.250> what<00:00:54.520> this<00:00:54.670> stuff<00:00:54.880> is<00:00:55.000> is<00:00:55.210> just

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
cool I think what this stuff is is just

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.180 
cool I think what this stuff is is just
a<00:00:55.570> wetting<00:00:55.960> agent<00:00:56.320> actually<00:00:56.500> I<00:00:56.770> think<00:00:56.920> it's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
a wetting agent actually I think it's

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.360 
a wetting agent actually I think it's
just<00:00:57.430> kind<00:00:57.700> of<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.850> fireproof<00:00:58.980> gel<00:00:59.980> that<00:01:00.250> it

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
just kind of a fireproof gel that it

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.920 
just kind of a fireproof gel that it
sprays<00:01:00.580> on<00:01:00.790> there<00:01:01.000> this<00:01:01.420> is<00:01:01.630> what<00:01:01.780> it's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
sprays on there this is what it's

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.420 
sprays on there this is what it's
actually<00:01:02.230> designed<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.710> do<00:01:02.860> not<00:01:03.130> an<00:01:03.280> actual

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
actually designed to do not an actual

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.070 
actually designed to do not an actual
chemical<00:01:04.030> fire<00:01:04.180> or<00:01:04.330> anything<00:01:04.510> like<00:01:04.690> that<00:01:04.750> like

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
chemical fire or anything like that like

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.960 
chemical fire or anything like that like
that<00:01:05.110> gasoline<00:01:05.680> this<00:01:06.040> is<00:01:06.280> just<00:01:06.550> wood<00:01:06.760> burning

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
that gasoline this is just wood burning

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.100 
that gasoline this is just wood burning
right<00:01:07.180> here<00:01:07.360> you<00:01:07.510> can<00:01:07.630> see<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:07.840> white<00:01:07.960> smoke

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
right here you can see the white smoke

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.110 
right here you can see the white smoke
coming<00:01:08.260> off<00:01:08.620> it<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:08.920> there's<00:01:09.340> no<00:01:09.460> gasoline<00:01:09.729> in

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
coming off it so there's no gasoline in

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.730 
coming off it so there's no gasoline in
there<00:01:10.270> though<00:01:10.390> let's<00:01:10.750> see<00:01:10.900> how<00:01:10.960> fast<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:11.530> puts

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
there though let's see how fast it puts

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.660 
there though let's see how fast it puts
out<00:01:11.860> this<00:01:12.010> gonna<00:01:12.220> fire<00:01:17.190> pretty<00:01:18.190> much<00:01:18.340> no<00:01:18.520> issue

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
out this gonna fire pretty much no issue

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.190 
out this gonna fire pretty much no issue
with<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.060> let's<00:01:19.270> try<00:01:19.360> something<00:01:19.600> else<00:01:19.810> all

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
with that let's try something else all

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.240 
with that let's try something else all
right<00:01:20.259> I<00:01:20.350> got<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:20.590> little<00:01:20.770> fire<00:01:20.920> going<00:01:21.100> again

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
right I got that little fire going again

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.180 
right I got that little fire going again
I'm<00:01:22.060> gonna<00:01:22.210> put<00:01:22.450> this<00:01:22.570> one<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:23.710> next<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.100> it

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
I'm gonna put this one right next to it

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:35.010 
I'm gonna put this one right next to it
and<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:26.350> gonna<00:01:26.440> hit<00:01:26.560> with<00:01:26.740> seven<00:01:27.070> six<00:01:27.250> -<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
and I'm gonna hit with seven six - that

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.300 
and I'm gonna hit with seven six - that
actually<00:01:35.110> worked<00:01:35.500> I<00:01:35.710> did<00:01:35.860> not<00:01:35.950> know<00:01:36.100> if<00:01:36.190> that

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
actually worked I did not know if that

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:49.550 
actually worked I did not know if that
would<00:01:36.399> work<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:46.390> fire<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.950> extinguished

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
would work the fire is extinguished

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.420 
would work the fire is extinguished
