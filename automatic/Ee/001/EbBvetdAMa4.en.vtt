00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello dear fans today in this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.850
 video I will show you how you yours 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.870
 device routes can so samsung 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.219
 galaxy ace the old and the new version 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.380
 So you know that when in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.240
 one in when you download an app 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.460
 but wanted in the description of the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.580
 needs right and you do not 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.140
 know what is good is just the routes 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.330
 authority therefore needs some 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.260
 Experts need authorization 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.059
 but you okay so if we 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.079
 for example in the app titanium backup 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.820
 So is a backup version in the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.090
 backing up data could restore 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.100
 can then be sorry no ruth 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.289
 authority available this application 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.780
 can not do without root authority 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.149
 make sure you work around 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.739
 the route is and what the box contains 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.079
 and try again 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.870
 this version was commanded with the sud 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.390
 So the app is not done 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.899
 usable and now I want to show you 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.309
 we route once the route file needs 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.439
 I would you next description 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.020
 to link 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:16.310
 hold up your device from it is now now 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.189
 down when it shuts down 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.070
 you click the power button and the home 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.060
 button at the same time with it one 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.060
 bootloader is coming 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.939
 so 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.820
 He does not show her in a menu 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.259
 So the touchscreen works for you 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.890
 then go to lead update from sd card 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.810
 the second line click on it 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.869
 power button with the home button 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.590
 then the ruth has to go to the file 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.649
 you have unpacked and in the folder 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.950
 So in your own files folder 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.090
 then you get on it he load 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.230
 that and then shield install from the sd card 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:29.510
 complete then you go on reboot system 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:33.989
 then it sounds and drives up again 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.780
 So the device works 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.790
 it is exactly the same as all data 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:45.870
 available 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:47.459
 but you now have root rights so the 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.130
 first book takes a bit longer 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:57.000
 otherwise than that and installed on it 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.420
 the app was superuser that's the app 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.840
 manage their applications in the hat 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.840
 can 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.129
 and Co 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.400
 So go now in the menu 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.900
 The galaxy s suffers too much 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:30.519
 That's why I'll be here next 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.790
 make overclock video by me 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.390
 because the kernel surface and the process 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.390
 over clocks 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.310
 so 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.710
 20 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.590
 and a little bit more 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.930
 so 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:28.730
 so now you see in your applications 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:33.860
 Suddenly this app is superuser if 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:39.170
 you go in here, you see, here they are 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:42.560
 apps need the route authority 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:47.380
 So the app titanium backup in the us 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.820
 before that we could open it now 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:05:00.140
 and backups and then create them 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:05:04.970
 reopen and with with at 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:07.940
 tutu the app cpu master free the too 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:13.540
 you need ruth authority 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:17.180
 Overclock and manage your processor 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:20.840
 So currently I I 800 megahertz 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:26.720
 at most 800 at least 800 though 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.760
 usually the minimum is 320 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.220
 and the sixth was at 800 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.830
 that could then be set and it 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.680
 will be the same at the next reboot 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.520
 set and the tactics become friends 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.440
 then stay 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.510
 yes that was it then please 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.940
 subscribe and write comments 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.940
