d mu dash Q 101 it is 7.2 megabits

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.320 
d mu dash Q 101 it is 7.2 megabits

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
kilobits on the uplink and it's plugging

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.880 
kilobits on the uplink and it's plugging
to<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> back<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.389> UM<00:00:15.630> are<00:00:15.839> here<00:00:16.139> where<00:00:16.770> we

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
to the back of the UM are here where we

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.279 
to the back of the UM are here where we
have<00:00:16.920> two<00:00:17.369> USB<00:00:17.550> ports<00:00:17.820> if<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.539> go<00:00:18.779> join<00:00:19.109> them

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
have two USB ports if you go join them

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.560 
have two USB ports if you go join them
with<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> help<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.980> y<00:00:20.220> cable<00:00:20.539> into<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
with the help of a y cable into the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.160 
with the help of a y cable into the
modem<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.199> will<00:00:22.320> get<00:00:22.470> full<00:00:22.859> power<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:24.170> don't

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
modem you will get full power I don't

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.810 
modem you will get full power I don't
think<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.529> modem<00:00:25.949> actually<00:00:26.250> requires<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
think this modem actually requires it

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.820 
think this modem actually requires it
but<00:00:26.970> certain<00:00:27.269> modems<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.590> also<00:00:28.740> have

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
but certain modems do then you also have

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.519 
but certain modems do then you also have
for<00:00:29.189> LAN<00:00:29.369> ports<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:30.929> port<00:00:31.289> here

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
for LAN ports and this one port here

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.160 
for LAN ports and this one port here
will<00:00:31.830> be<00:00:32.040> activated<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.000> later<00:00:33.630> firmware

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
will be activated and later firmware

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.700 
will be activated and later firmware
release<00:00:34.790> right<00:00:35.790> now<00:00:36.000> without<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.500> also

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
release right now without do is and also

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.400 
release right now without do is and also
Wi-Fi<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.210> I'll<00:00:39.329> do<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.809> plug<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
Wi-Fi so what I'll do is a plug in the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.310 
Wi-Fi so what I'll do is a plug in the
ethernet<00:00:40.800> cable<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:42.540> modem<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.260> connected

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
ethernet cable as the modem is connected

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.459 
ethernet cable as the modem is connected
to<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.890> internet<00:00:44.539> play<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.690> finna<00:00:45.960> cable<00:00:46.260> into

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
to the internet play we finna cable into

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.520 
to the internet play we finna cable into
the<00:00:46.500> pc<00:00:46.980> here<00:00:49.850> mm-maybe<00:00:50.850> now<00:00:51.059> use<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:52.350> gotta

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the pc here mm-maybe now use you gotta

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.830

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
connect to the 3g network so i'll log

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.830 
connect to the 3g network so i'll log
out<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.420> part<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:03.780> we'll<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
you will actually get around up to a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.140 
you will actually get around up to a
megabit<00:02:35.450> upward<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.920> although<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.760> modem

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
megabit upward and although this modem

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.450 
megabit upward and although this modem
is<00:02:38.210> three<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.540> four<00:02:38.720> kilobytes<00:02:39.140> yeah<00:02:39.950> it's

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
is three to four kilobytes yeah it's

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.500 
is three to four kilobytes yeah it's
going<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.730> come<00:02:41.060> up<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.450> maybe<00:02:41.830> 352<00:02:42.830> 380

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
going to come up to maybe 352 380

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.090 
going to come up to maybe 352 380
kilobits<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.780> there<00:02:48.080> we<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.290> 2.26

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
kilobits so there we have a 2.26

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.280 
kilobits so there we have a 2.26
megabits<00:02:49.700> down<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.330> three<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:50.570> 230<00:02:50.840> kilobits

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
megabits down and three in 230 kilobits

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.480 
megabits down and three in 230 kilobits
up<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.770> guess<00:02:52.460> it's<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.700> busy<00:02:53.000> network<00:02:53.300> today
