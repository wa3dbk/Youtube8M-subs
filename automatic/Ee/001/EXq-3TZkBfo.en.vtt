00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.010 
the race did you think we had a chance
yeah<00:01:36.740> as<00:01:37.700> soon<00:01:37.970> as<00:01:38.060> we<00:01:38.210> got<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.509> that<00:01:38.540> caution

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
yeah as soon as we got to that caution

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.380 
yeah as soon as we got to that caution
and<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:39.259> restart<00:01:39.790> you<00:01:40.790> know<00:01:40.880> Mike's<00:01:41.150> like

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
and that restart you know Mike's like

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.910 
and that restart you know Mike's like
you're<00:01:41.570> gonna<00:01:41.689> have<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.930> get<00:01:42.049> big<00:01:42.259> numbers<00:01:42.290> and

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
you're gonna have to get big numbers and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.800 
you're gonna have to get big numbers and
I'm<00:01:43.220> like<00:01:43.430> I<00:01:43.579> know<00:01:43.640> we<00:01:43.880> can<00:01:43.909> do<00:01:44.150> it<00:01:44.180> you<00:01:44.509> know<00:01:44.630> we

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
I'm like I know we can do it you know we

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.390 
I'm like I know we can do it you know we
were<00:01:45.170> close<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.560> getting<00:01:45.770> those<00:01:45.890> earlier<00:01:46.250> on

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
were close to getting those earlier on

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.710 
were close to getting those earlier on
in<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:46.610> race<00:01:46.729> when<00:01:46.909> we<00:01:46.970> were<00:01:47.119> you<00:01:47.360> know<00:01:47.420> stuck

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
in the race when we were you know stuck

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.539 
in the race when we were you know stuck
by<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:47.899> Justin<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.470> Justin<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.250> be<00:01:49.280> honest

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
by and Justin and Justin to be honest

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:50.410 
by and Justin and Justin to be honest
was<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.790> reason<00:01:50.090> why<00:01:50.180> we<00:01:50.299> switched

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
was the reason why we switched

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.819 
was the reason why we switched
strategies<00:01:50.930> because<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.320> think<00:01:51.380> he<00:01:51.619> was<00:01:51.740> trying

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
strategies because I think he was trying

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.319 
strategies because I think he was trying
to<00:01:51.979> save<00:01:52.130> fuel<00:01:52.310> we're<00:01:52.549> trying<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:52.850> go<00:01:52.909> faster

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
to save fuel we're trying to go faster

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.780 
to save fuel we're trying to go faster
we're<00:01:53.689> like<00:01:53.840> we<00:01:53.960> gotta<00:01:54.140> switch<00:01:54.610> which<00:01:55.610> was

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
we're like we gotta switch which was

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.030 
we're like we gotta switch which was
probably<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.090> second<00:01:56.329> or<00:01:56.390> third<00:01:56.450> time<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.040> you

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
probably the second or third time so you

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.010 
probably the second or third time so you
know<00:01:58.159> Mike<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:58.700> everybody<00:01:59.180> on<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.720> team<00:01:59.750> did

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
know Mike and everybody on the team did

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.510 
know Mike and everybody on the team did
a<00:02:00.079> fantastic<00:02:00.259> job<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.680> strategy<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.250> was<00:02:01.399> gonna

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
a fantastic job a strategy I was gonna

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.039 
a fantastic job a strategy I was gonna
say<00:02:01.640> you're<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:02.030> pick<00:02:02.270> two<00:02:02.600> times<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:02.990> the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
say you're you pick two times in the

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.630 
say you're you pick two times in the
first<00:02:03.229> 12<00:02:03.409> hours<00:02:03.560> everything<00:02:03.979> okay<00:02:04.250> Dixon<00:02:04.579> is

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
first 12 hours everything okay Dixon is

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.459 
first 12 hours everything okay Dixon is
gonna<00:02:04.759> go<00:02:04.909> as<00:02:05.210> fast<00:02:05.630> he<00:02:05.840> can<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.140> whole<00:02:06.290> race

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
gonna go as fast he can the whole race

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.080 
gonna go as fast he can the whole race
and<00:02:06.740> then<00:02:06.829> that<00:02:07.009> changed<00:02:07.399> since<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:07.939> get

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
and then that changed since you get

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.850 
and then that changed since you get
stuck<00:02:08.329> we<00:02:09.019> were<00:02:09.140> gonna<00:02:09.229> start<00:02:09.500> running<00:02:09.739> out<00:02:09.829> of

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
stuck we were gonna start running out of

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.680 
stuck we were gonna start running out of
tires<00:02:10.130> i<00:02:10.459> think<00:02:10.670> was<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.790> father<00:02:11.060> who<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.570> go

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
tires i think was the father who you go

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.390 
tires i think was the father who you go
through<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.049> many<00:02:12.140> sets

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
through so many sets

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.339 
through so many sets
for<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.760> but<00:02:13.939> you<00:02:14.390> know<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.569> lengthen<00:02:15.200> those

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
for that but you know to lengthen those

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.660 
for that but you know to lengthen those
windows<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.860> get<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.069> gaps<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:16.430> needed

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
windows and get the gaps that we needed

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.280 
windows and get the gaps that we needed
to<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.569> know<00:02:17.629> I<00:02:17.720> think<00:02:17.780> with<00:02:17.989> board<00:02:18.200> a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
to and you know I think with board a

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.440 
to and you know I think with board a
swishy<00:02:18.620> on<00:02:18.769> that<00:02:18.920> restart<00:02:19.700> him<00:02:20.180> being<00:02:20.390> on

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
swishy on that restart him being on

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.179 
swishy on that restart him being on
blacks<00:02:20.720> helped<00:02:21.379> our<00:02:21.500> cause<00:02:21.680> because<00:02:21.950> we<00:02:22.099> were
