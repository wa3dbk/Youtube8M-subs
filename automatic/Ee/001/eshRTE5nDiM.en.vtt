00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.050 
on the Pegasus sort of an s-curve coming
from<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.570> back<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.990> ear<00:02:25.790> again<00:02:26.790> with<00:02:26.910> my

from the back of the ear again with my

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.000 
from the back of the ear again with my
one<00:02:27.240> inch<00:02:27.860> flat<00:02:28.860> brush<00:02:29.250> I've<00:02:29.520> got<00:02:29.850> um<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.890> is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
one inch flat brush I've got um this is

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.000 
one inch flat brush I've got um this is
from<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> purl<00:02:32.580> rainbow<00:02:33.090> by<00:02:33.330> tag<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:34.020> pulled<00:02:34.830> up

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
from the purl rainbow by tag I pulled up

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.370 
from the purl rainbow by tag I pulled up
just<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.460> purple<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:35.940> pink<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:37.080> placed

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
just the purple and pink and I placed

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.940 
just the purple and pink and I placed
the<00:02:37.800> purple<00:02:38.280> side<00:02:38.460> down<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:40.170> Pegasus<00:02:40.710> head

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
the purple side down on the Pegasus head

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.540 
the purple side down on the Pegasus head
and<00:02:41.250> created<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:42.080> triangle<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.290> then<00:02:43.550> flipped

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
and created a triangle and then flipped

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.060 
and created a triangle and then flipped
it<00:02:44.700> over<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.150> pink<00:02:45.390> met<00:02:46.140> up<00:02:46.410> with<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.680> pink

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
it over to the pink met up with a pink

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.680 
it over to the pink met up with a pink
and<00:02:47.310> then<00:02:47.460> created<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.910> tapered<00:02:48.330> smaller

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
and then created a tapered smaller

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.890 
and then created a tapered smaller
triangle<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.440> make<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:50.340> unicorn's<00:02:50.940> horn<00:02:51.000> and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
triangle to make the unicorn's horn and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.630 
triangle to make the unicorn's horn and
now<00:02:52.020> I'm<00:02:52.140> creating<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.560> eye<00:02:52.590> with<00:02:53.160> two<00:02:53.400> C

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
now I'm creating the eye with two C

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.180 
now I'm creating the eye with two C
shapes<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.330> filling<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.080> in<00:02:55.200> all<00:02:55.440> but<00:02:55.920> a

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
shapes and filling it in all but a

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.270 
shapes and filling it in all but a
little<00:02:56.690> space<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.440> shiny<00:02:58.800> part<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
little space for the shiny part of the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.490 
little space for the shiny part of the
eye<00:02:59.310> which<00:02:59.640> won't<00:02:59.820> be<00:02:59.970> there<00:03:00.150> later<00:03:00.500> outlining

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
eye which won't be there later outlining

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.310 
eye which won't be there later outlining
the<00:03:01.710> face<00:03:02.000> giving<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.150> hair<00:03:03.330> some<00:03:03.540> definition

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
the face giving the hair some definition

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.090 
the face giving the hair some definition
by<00:03:04.800> just<00:03:05.070> placing<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.820> pulling<00:03:06.740> curved<00:03:07.740> lines

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
by just placing and pulling curved lines

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.630 
by just placing and pulling curved lines
I<00:03:09.709> find<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:10.830> pretty<00:03:10.890> tricky<00:03:11.310> around<00:03:11.430> the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
I find it's pretty tricky around the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.880 
I find it's pretty tricky around the
nose<00:03:11.940> area<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.810> tend<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.260> slow<00:03:13.590> down<00:03:13.740> right

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
nose area so I tend to slow down right

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.680 
nose area so I tend to slow down right
there<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.650> little<00:03:16.890> smile<00:03:17.690> outlining

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
there just and a little smile outlining

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.699 
there just and a little smile outlining
the<00:03:19.050> unicorn<00:03:19.620> horn<00:03:21.260> came<00:03:22.260> out<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> little<00:03:22.500> bit

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
the unicorn horn came out a little bit

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.160 
the unicorn horn came out a little bit
thicker<00:03:23.100> on<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.250> bottom<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.120> then<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:24.810> top

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
thicker on the bottom and then on top

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.280 
thicker on the bottom and then on top
and<00:03:25.500> then<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.940> added<00:03:26.940> these<00:03:27.150> diagonal<00:03:27.750> lines<00:03:27.959> to

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and then I added these diagonal lines to

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.590 
and then I added these diagonal lines to
create<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.070> illusion<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.580> like<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> swirl<00:03:30.209> torn

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
create the illusion of like a swirl torn

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.350 
create the illusion of like a swirl torn
and<00:03:31.170> then<00:03:32.070> I'm<00:03:32.190> going<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.730> outlining<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
and then I'm going in and outlining the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.400 
and then I'm going in and outlining the
wings<00:03:35.390> still<00:03:36.390> getting<00:03:36.989> used<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.260> this

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
wings still getting used to this

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.310 
wings still getting used to this
technique<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:39.380> I'm<00:03:40.380> always<00:03:40.680> learning<00:03:42.320> okay

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
technique so I'm always learning okay

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.930 
technique so I'm always learning okay
now<00:03:43.470> I've<00:03:43.560> got<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.739> number<00:03:43.950> six<00:03:44.430> round<00:03:44.670> brush

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
now I've got a number six round brush

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.400 
now I've got a number six round brush
though<00:03:45.209> with<00:03:45.480> white<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.959> I'm<00:03:46.080> putting<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
though with white and I'm putting the

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.220 
though with white and I'm putting the
highlight<00:03:46.739> on<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.980> eye<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.900> starburst<00:03:48.900> on<00:03:49.110> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
highlight on the eye a starburst on the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:57.200 
highlight on the eye a starburst on the
wing<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.770> one<00:03:50.010> on<00:03:50.250> each<00:03:50.280> cheek

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.630 

now<00:03:58.210> I've<00:03:58.360> gone<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.750> on<00:03:58.960> the<00:03:59.230> rainbow

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
now I've gone in on the rainbow

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.130 
now I've gone in on the rainbow
eyeshadow<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.910> just<00:04:01.120> place<00:04:01.570> a<00:04:01.600> series<00:04:02.110> of

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
eyeshadow and just place a series of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.200 
eyeshadow and just place a series of
dots<00:04:02.470> from<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:02.980> hairline<00:04:03.190> all<00:04:03.580> the<00:04:03.670> way<00:04:03.790> onto

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
dots from the hairline all the way onto

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.810 
dots from the hairline all the way onto
the<00:04:04.630> eyelid<00:04:05.050> and<00:04:06.010> then<00:04:06.100> I'm<00:04:06.250> always<00:04:06.430> sure<00:04:06.670> to

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
the eyelid and then I'm always sure to

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.730 
the eyelid and then I'm always sure to
ask<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.180> children<00:04:07.900> okay<00:04:08.020> just<00:04:08.380> keep<00:04:08.560> your

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
eyes closed for 10 seconds then kind of

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.870 
eyes closed for 10 seconds then kind of
countdown<00:04:11.200> day<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:12.340> way<00:04:12.460> they<00:04:12.610> don't<00:04:12.700> mess

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
countdown day that way they don't mess

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.780 
countdown day that way they don't mess
it<00:04:12.910> up<00:04:14.010> here's<00:04:15.010> where<00:04:15.190> you<00:04:15.250> can<00:04:15.370> see<00:04:15.610> that<00:04:15.760> I

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
it up here's where you can see that I

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.890 
it up here's where you can see that I
decided<00:04:16.270> to<00:04:16.390> pull<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.840> white<00:04:17.200> down<00:04:18.660> along<00:04:19.660> the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
decided to pull the white down along the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.330 
decided to pull the white down along the
side<00:04:20.110> of<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.290> nose<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.739> think<00:04:20.770> it<00:04:21.010> came<00:04:21.160> out

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
side of the nose I think it came out

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.460 
side of the nose I think it came out
nicely<00:04:21.610> that<00:04:22.000> way<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.810> then<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.020> just<00:04:23.200> used

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
nicely that way and then I just used

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.180 
nicely that way and then I just used
them<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:24.810> white<00:04:25.810> B<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.140> blend<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:26.950> something

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
them a white B to blend it and something

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.620 
them a white B to blend it and something
until<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:28.030> faded<00:04:28.420> out<00:04:28.480> softly<00:04:29.080> they're<00:04:30.600> here

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
until it faded out softly they're here

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.080 
until it faded out softly they're here
I've<00:04:31.840> got<00:04:32.110> star<00:04:32.410> blends<00:04:32.680> red<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.700> I'm<00:04:33.910> using

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
I've got star blends red and I'm using
