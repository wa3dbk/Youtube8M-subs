00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
we were last time it doesn't look like

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.350 
we were last time it doesn't look like
there's<00:00:55.920> anything<00:00:56.100> different<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:57.270> you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
there's anything different but when you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.820 
there's anything different but when you
get<00:00:57.540> in<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.840> boat<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.200> start<00:00:58.500> looking<00:00:58.770> at

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
get in the boat you start looking at

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.500 
get in the boat you start looking at
what's<00:00:59.010> then<00:00:59.220> built<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.700> go<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.060> the<00:01:00.150> boat<00:01:00.330> is<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
what's then built to go in the boat is a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.620 
what's then built to go in the boat is a
lot<00:01:00.750> has<00:01:00.930> been<00:01:00.960> done<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.470> course<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.630> bridges

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
lot has been done of course the bridges

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.960 
lot has been done of course the bridges
being<00:01:04.140> completed<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.800> there's<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:05.490> tremendous

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
being completed so there's a tremendous

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.580 
being completed so there's a tremendous
amount<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.210> work<00:01:06.360> that's<00:01:06.540> happened<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.140> it's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
amount of work that's happened and it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.010 
amount of work that's happened and it's
a<00:01:07.650> lot<00:01:07.800> of<00:01:07.920> exciting<00:01:08.310> stuff<00:01:08.340> because<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
a lot of exciting stuff because the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.970 
a lot of exciting stuff because the
concept<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.200> we're<00:01:10.320> trying<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.590> build<00:01:10.770> is

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
concept of what we're trying to build is

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.770 
concept of what we're trying to build is
really<00:01:11.220> starting<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> come<00:01:11.760> into<00:01:11.910> play<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
really starting to come into play and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.390 
really starting to come into play and
all<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.290> decisions<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.980> to<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.160> made

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
all the decisions that have to be made

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.830 
all the decisions that have to be made
because<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.000> concept<00:01:15.390> we're<00:01:15.540> trying<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
because of the concept we're trying to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.750 
because of the concept we're trying to
build<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.140> coming<00:01:16.380> into<00:01:16.500> play<00:01:16.650> too<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
build is coming into play too so it's a

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.990 
build is coming into play too so it's a
pretty<00:01:17.910> busy<00:01:18.240> time<00:01:22.490> yeah<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.790> that's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
pretty busy time yeah I think that's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.100 
pretty busy time yeah I think that's
obviously<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> biggest<00:01:24.660> thing<00:01:24.960> that's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
obviously the biggest thing that's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.330 
obviously the biggest thing that's
different<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.560> you're<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.979> out<00:01:26.130> fishing

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
different if you're going out fishing

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.520 
different if you're going out fishing
it's<00:01:27.000> raining<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:27.630> whatever<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.260> just<00:01:28.410> want

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it's raining or whatever you just want

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.660 
it's raining or whatever you just want
to<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> elements<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.460> get

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
to get out of the elements you can get

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.000 
to get out of the elements you can get
down<00:01:29.850> below<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:31.260> enables<00:01:31.650> me<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.860> be

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
down below and that enables me to be

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.980 
down below and that enables me to be
with<00:01:32.220> my<00:01:32.369> family<00:01:32.550> too<00:01:32.910> you<00:01:32.940> know<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.869> be

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
able to spend time together that's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.260 
able to spend time together that's
really<00:01:35.190> what<00:01:35.400> boating<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.700> all<00:01:35.820> about<00:01:36.090> hasn't

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
really what boating is all about hasn't

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.640 
really what boating is all about hasn't
been<00:01:36.420> done<00:01:36.509> spend<00:01:36.780> time<00:01:36.960> together<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.500> we're

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
been done spend time together so we're

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.770 
been done spend time together so we're
trying<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.040> take<00:01:38.850> some<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> aspects<00:01:39.660> that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
trying to take some of the aspects that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.540 
trying to take some of the aspects that
you<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> Down<00:01:40.380> East<00:01:40.410> boat<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.460> know

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
you see in a Down East boat you know

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.400 
you see in a Down East boat you know
that<00:01:41.759> create<00:01:42.060> cruise<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:43.080> do<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> lot<00:01:43.290> of

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
that create cruise and don't do a lot of

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.440 
that create cruise and don't do a lot of
fishing<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.190> apply<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.550> a<00:01:44.790> boat<00:01:45.030> that's<00:01:45.240> ready

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
fishing and apply to a boat that's ready

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
to go hardcore fishing and in a size

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.450 
to go hardcore fishing and in a size
it's<00:01:48.509> something<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.110> manage<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:50.250> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
it's something I can manage so it's you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.620 
it's something I can manage so it's you
know<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.550> a<00:01:50.729> different<00:01:51.030> project<00:01:51.179> but<00:01:51.570> I

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
know it's a different project but I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.660 
know it's a different project but I
think<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.960> lot<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.200> fun<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.679> a<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.460> lot

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
think it's a lot of fun and it's a a lot
