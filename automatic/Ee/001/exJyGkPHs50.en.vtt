for<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.550> wire<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> fit<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.420> going

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
for the wire to fit and I'm just going

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.060 
for the wire to fit and I'm just going
to<00:01:06.600> keep<00:01:06.810> stringing<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:09.380> notice<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.619> I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
to keep stringing these on notice as I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.510 
to keep stringing these on notice as I
am<00:01:11.490> doing<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:13.110> wire<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.740> retaining<00:01:14.220> its

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
am doing this the wire is retaining its

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.990 
am doing this the wire is retaining its
shape<00:01:14.900> perfectly<00:01:16.159> now<00:01:17.810> one<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:20.000> drawbacks

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
shape perfectly now one of the drawbacks

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.230 
shape perfectly now one of the drawbacks
to<00:01:21.570> using<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.990> wire<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.650> because<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.850> retains

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to using this wire is because it retains

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.620 
to using this wire is because it retains
its<00:01:24.540> shape<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.049> well<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.159> little<00:01:26.430> hard<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
its shape so well it's a little hard to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.469 
its shape so well it's a little hard to
manipulate<00:01:28.100> when<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.340> want<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> make<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> loop

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
manipulate when you want to make a loop

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.050 
manipulate when you want to make a loop
at<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.720> end<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.829> require<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.610> lot

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
at the end it's going to require a lot

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.510 
at the end it's going to require a lot
more<00:01:33.439> strength<00:01:34.439> than<00:01:35.119> your<00:01:36.119> average<00:01:36.329> wire<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
more strength than your average wire of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.690 
more strength than your average wire of
this<00:01:38.520> thickness<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.220> get<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
this thickness but you know to get the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.569 
this thickness but you know to get the
benefit<00:01:42.150> sometimes<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.460> pay<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
benefit sometimes you have to pay the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.370 
benefit sometimes you have to pay the
price<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:45.899> I'm<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> take<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
price so now I'm going to take this and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.810 
price so now I'm going to take this and
I'm<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:53.119> attach<00:01:54.770> one<00:01:55.770> part<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.250> my<00:01:56.460> clasp

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
I'm going to attach one part of my clasp

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.109 
I'm going to attach one part of my clasp
now<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.119> can<00:01:57.450> make<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.200> wire<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:59.340> clip-on

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
now you can make the wire just clip-on

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.480 
now you can make the wire just clip-on
by<00:02:00.780> bending<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.350> little<00:02:01.469> piece<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> wire<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.280> one

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
by bending a little piece of wire on one

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.910 
by bending a little piece of wire on one
end<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.119> making<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> loop<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> other<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
end and making a loop on the other for a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.679 
end and making a loop on the other for a
necklace<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.490> fine<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> bracelet<00:02:06.659> you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
necklace that's fine for a bracelet you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.660 
necklace that's fine for a bracelet you
want<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.110> use<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.469> clasp<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.190> I'm<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.520> put

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
want to use a clasp but I'm going to put

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.869 
want to use a clasp but I'm going to put
one<00:02:08.819> end<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.270> clasp<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:10.129> this<00:02:11.129> end<00:02:11.430> now<00:02:11.819> I

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
one end of the clasp on this end now I

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.190 
one end of the clasp on this end now I
have<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.420> bend<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.870> out

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
have to just bend this out

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.040 
have to just bend this out
a little<00:02:13.470> bit<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.830> again<00:02:14.480> it's<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.840> little

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
a little bit and again it's a little

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.699 
a little bit and again it's a little
tricky<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:17.519> doable<00:02:18.019> I'm<00:02:19.019> going<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.530> put

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
tricky but it's doable I'm going to put

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.390 
tricky but it's doable I'm going to put
the<00:02:19.830> clasp<00:02:20.069> on<00:02:20.599> I'm<00:02:21.599> going<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.560> use<00:02:22.650> my<00:02:23.040> flat

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
the clasp on I'm going to use my flat

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.890 
the clasp on I'm going to use my flat
nose<00:02:23.700> pliers<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.690> close<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.680> up<00:02:26.480> then<00:02:27.480> on

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
nose pliers to close that up then on

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.390 
nose pliers to close that up then on
this<00:02:28.200> end<00:02:28.260> I'm<00:02:29.129> going<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.890> clipping<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.099> is

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
this end I'm going to clipping this is

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.770 
this end I'm going to clipping this is
very<00:02:33.410> difficult<00:02:34.410> because<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.459> wire<00:02:35.780> it

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
very difficult because of the wire it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.160 
very difficult because of the wire it
takes<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.200> lot<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.440> strength<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.690> always<00:02:39.690> cover

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
takes a lot of strength and always cover

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
takes a lot of strength and always cover
the<00:02:41.130> end<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.480> does<00:02:42.629> not<00:02:42.870> snap<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.769> your<00:02:43.799> face

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
the end so it does not snap in your face

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.400 
the end so it does not snap in your face
now<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> few<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.060> those<00:02:45.209> beads<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.900> came<00:02:46.170> off

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
now a few of those beads just came off

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.580 
now a few of those beads just came off
as<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.799> was<00:02:46.830> clipping<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.750> not<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> problem<00:02:49.110> I'll

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
as I was clipping it not a problem I'll

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.309 
as I was clipping it not a problem I'll
just<00:02:49.709> put<00:02:49.890> them<00:02:50.010> back<00:02:50.069> on<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:54.720> put<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
just put them back on and to put the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.930 
just put them back on and to put the
other<00:02:55.470> end<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.829> this<00:02:56.069> I'm<00:02:56.579> going<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:58.730> bend<00:02:59.730> this

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
other end of this I'm going to bend this

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.190 
other end of this I'm going to bend this
with<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.329> needlenose<00:03:00.630> pliers

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.589 

it's<00:03:04.200> very<00:03:04.650> difficult<00:03:05.340> be<00:03:05.940> careful<00:03:08.599> don't

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
it's very difficult be careful don't

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.059 
it's very difficult be careful don't
hold<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.959> too<00:03:10.110> close<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.500> your<00:03:10.620> face<00:03:10.829> because

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
hold it too close to your face because

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.979 
hold it too close to your face because
it<00:03:11.310> sometimes<00:03:11.519> slips<00:03:12.420> like<00:03:12.599> what<00:03:12.870> just

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
it sometimes slips like what just

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.460 
it sometimes slips like what just
happened<00:03:13.380> with<00:03:13.530> me<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:15.120> don't<00:03:15.750> want<00:03:16.049> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
happened with me you don't want the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.830 
happened with me you don't want the
pliers<00:03:16.799> or<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> wire<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:18.090> snap<00:03:18.359> into<00:03:18.630> your

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
face and I'm going to slide that down

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.569

there and then use the flat nose to
close<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.150> loop<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:27.980> there<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.400> a
