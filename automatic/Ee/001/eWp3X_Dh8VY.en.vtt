00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
alright this is jeff a quadcopter and

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.070 
alright this is jeff a quadcopter and
today<00:00:15.180> we're<00:00:15.330> going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> be<00:00:15.570> talking<00:00:15.719> about

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.910 
today we're going to be talking about
the<00:00:16.410> hdmi<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.430> SD<00:00:18.360> converter<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.860> is

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the hdmi to SD converter and this is

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920 
the hdmi to SD converter and this is
just<00:00:20.009> pretty<00:00:20.160> much<00:00:20.930> debugging

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
just pretty much debugging

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.720 
just pretty much debugging
troubleshooting<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.430> thing<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
troubleshooting so the first thing you

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.429 
troubleshooting so the first thing you
want<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.300> make<00:00:24.599> sure<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.320> we're

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
want to do is make sure that we're

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.769 
want to do is make sure that we're
getting<00:00:25.560> an<00:00:25.860> hdmi<00:00:26.400> out<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.789> our<00:00:26.880> camera<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.750> we

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
getting an hdmi out of our camera so we

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.679 
getting an hdmi out of our camera so we
here<00:00:28.200> we<00:00:28.290> have<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.649> 5d<00:00:29.070> mark<00:00:29.250> three<00:00:29.540> hdmi<00:00:30.540> out

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
here we have the 5d mark three hdmi out

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.600 
here we have the 5d mark three hdmi out
hdmi<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.829> to<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.220> small<00:00:32.460> HD<00:00:33.000> monitor<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:35.520> we

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
hdmi in to the small HD monitor so we

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.340 
hdmi in to the small HD monitor so we
can<00:00:35.760> see<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.210> we're<00:00:36.390> getting<00:00:36.510> signal<00:00:36.989> so

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
can see that we're getting signal so

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.430 
can see that we're getting signal so
that<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> first<00:00:37.980> step<00:00:38.219> that's<00:00:38.610> good<00:00:39.440> so

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that is the first step that's good so

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.120 
that is the first step that's good so
now<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.579> next<00:00:41.610> step<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.890> we'll<00:00:43.890> go<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
now the next step is we'll go to the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.710 
now the next step is we'll go to the
hdmi<00:00:44.670> converter<00:00:47.000> plug<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.210> into<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.720> fs700

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
hdmi converter plug that into the fs700

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.260 
hdmi converter plug that into the fs700
wait<00:00:51.720> about<00:00:51.960> five<00:00:52.230> seconds<00:00:52.880> for<00:00:53.880> it<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.970> sync

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
wait about five seconds for it to sync

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.990 
wait about five seconds for it to sync
up<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> signal<00:00:54.950> so<00:00:55.950> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> now<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.489> picture

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
up the signal so this is now the picture

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.270 
up the signal so this is now the picture
coming<00:00:57.239> off<00:00:57.390> our<00:00:57.540> fs700<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:58.560> how<00:00:59.010> we're<00:00:59.160> doing

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
coming off our fs700 and how we're doing

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.640 
coming off our fs700 and how we're doing
this<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.820> made<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.660> debugging<00:01:01.260> cable

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
this is we made a little debugging cable

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.990 
this is we made a little debugging cable
at<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.190> shop<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:05.070> take<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> look<00:01:05.549> at<00:01:05.610> this

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
at the shop so you take a look at this

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.109 
at the shop so you take a look at this
cable<00:01:06.509> this<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.259> same<00:01:07.790> cable-<00:01:08.790> these

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
cable this is the same cable- these

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.740 
cable this is the same cable- these
plugs<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:11.759> hdmi<00:01:12.329> package

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
plugs that you get in the hdmi package

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.399 
plugs that you get in the hdmi package
so<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.909> side<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.479> white<00:01:15.630> cable<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
so on this side the white cable is the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.160 
so on this side the white cable is the
video<00:01:16.649> black<00:01:17.639> is<00:01:17.880> ground<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.780> did<00:01:19.020> was<00:01:19.049> I

video black is ground all I did was I

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.590 
video black is ground all I did was I
just<00:01:19.350> soldered<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.009> an<00:01:20.159> RCA<00:01:20.549> male<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:21.389> the

you first plug this into the camera

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.949 
you first plug this into the camera
without<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.429> is<00:02:05.639> going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.060> go<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.810> color

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
without this is going to go to the color

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.380 
without this is going to go to the color
bars<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.469> you'll<00:02:07.950> see<00:02:08.160> input<00:02:08.670> no<00:02:08.970> signal

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
bars and you'll see input no signal

there's no camera out let's give this

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.040 
there's no camera out let's give this
ntsc<00:02:12.170> once<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.290> plug<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:15.630> will<00:02:15.750> find<00:02:15.959> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
ntsc once we plug this in it will find a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.210 
ntsc once we plug this in it will find a
signal<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.010> see<00:02:17.190> what<00:02:17.370> you're

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
signal and you can see what you're

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.450 
signal and you can see what you're
