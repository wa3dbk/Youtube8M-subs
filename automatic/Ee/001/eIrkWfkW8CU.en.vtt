00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
say nice having not sure that's really

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.039 
say nice having not sure that's really
than<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.549> best<00:01:35.880> word<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.270> using<00:01:36.509> it's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
than what the best word to be using it's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.749 
than what the best word to be using it's
pretty<00:01:37.380> horrible<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> way<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.460> swings

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
pretty horrible it's the way it swings

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.249 
pretty horrible it's the way it swings
down<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> fact<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.079> it's

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
down but I do like the fact that it's

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:40.999 
down but I do like the fact that it's
really<00:01:40.470> unique

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
really unique

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.190 
really unique
which<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.729> pretty<00:01:42.090> cool<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:42.840> they

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
which is pretty cool you know if they

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.840 
which is pretty cool you know if they
were<00:01:43.259> all<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> same<00:01:43.530> you're<00:01:44.310> all<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.670> same

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
were all the same you're all the same

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.359 
were all the same you're all the same
generic<00:01:45.750> over<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> camera<00:01:47.100> thing<00:01:47.250> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
generic over the camera thing you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069 
generic over the camera thing you
wouldn't<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> same<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.960> it's

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
wouldn't really be the same so it's

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.330 
wouldn't really be the same so it's
really<00:01:49.229> nice<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> nice

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
really nice to see that it as a nice

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.850

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
mixed up one there and it's horrible

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.530 
mixed up one there and it's horrible
because<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.549> him<00:01:53.670> actually<00:01:53.939> coming

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
really horrible the way it comes through

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.530 
really horrible the way it comes through
the<00:03:28.860> corridor<00:03:29.370> it's<00:03:29.760> like<00:03:29.880> quite<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.209> long

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.630 
the corridor it's like quite a long
period<00:03:30.930> we<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:32.010> know<00:03:32.070> compared<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.430> some<00:03:32.549> of

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
the others only a couple seconds but

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.140 
the others only a couple seconds but
compared<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.440> others<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:35.430> quite<00:03:35.910> long

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
compared to the others it's quite long

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.420 
compared to the others it's quite long
where<00:03:36.840> it's<00:03:37.080> coming<00:03:37.530> straight<00:03:37.739> at<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.220> for

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
really not a nice one it's a really

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.910 
really not a nice one it's a really
unique<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:43.049> so<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.200> asked<00:03:43.410> me<00:03:43.530> one<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.769> most

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
unique one so I asked me one of the most

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.030 
unique one so I asked me one of the most
unique<00:03:44.250> on<00:03:44.489> here<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.420> really<00:03:46.080> scary<00:03:46.620> one<00:03:46.830> that

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
unique on here so really scary one that

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.220 
unique on here so really scary one that
definitely<00:03:48.030> getting<00:03:48.269> up<00:03:48.360> into<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.780> solid

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
definitely getting up into a solid

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.470 
definitely getting up into a solid
fourth<00:03:49.620> position<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.340> number<00:03:50.970> three<00:03:51.330> now

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
fourth position and number three now

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.479 
fourth position and number three now
this<00:03:51.660> had<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.410> been<00:03:52.680> able<00:03:52.769> to<00:03:52.890> pick<00:03:53.070> these<00:03:53.250> all

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
this had I been able to pick these all

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.640 
this had I been able to pick these all
just<00:03:54.000> my<00:03:54.120> own<00:03:54.239> opinion<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.870> would<00:03:55.260> probably

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
just my own opinion I would probably

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.009 
just my own opinion I would probably
have<00:03:55.739> put<00:03:55.920> this<00:03:56.010> in<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.250> joint<00:03:56.489> first<00:03:56.820> but<00:03:57.780> I

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
have put this in a joint first but I

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.080 
have put this in a joint first but I
think<00:03:58.200> it's<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.920> one's<00:03:59.130> not<00:03:59.340> too<00:03:59.610> popular

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
think it's this one's not too popular

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.550 
think it's this one's not too popular
amongst<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.600> community<00:04:00.959> compared<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.410> the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
amongst the community compared to the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.979 
amongst the community compared to the
other<00:04:01.920> two<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.340> have<00:04:03.269> gotten<00:04:03.480> slightly<00:04:03.810> above

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
other two and have gotten slightly above

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.110 
other two and have gotten slightly above
it<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.650> this<00:04:04.769> third<00:04:05.010> one<00:04:05.190> for<00:04:05.370> me<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.670> Freddy

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
it so this third one for me is Freddy

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.970 
it so this third one for me is Freddy
fazbear's<00:04:06.630> jump<00:04:06.930> scare<00:04:07.200> from<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.440> first<00:04:07.709> game

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
fazbear's jump scare from the first game

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.440 
fazbear's jump scare from the first game
while<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.519> still<00:04:08.820> have<00:04:08.880> power

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
while you still have power

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.660 
while you still have power
now<00:04:09.959> Freddy<00:04:10.260> Freddy<00:04:10.829> has<00:04:11.040> quite<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.340> few<00:04:11.519> jumps

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
now Freddy Freddy has quite a few jumps

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.460 
now Freddy Freddy has quite a few jumps
to<00:04:11.790> get<00:04:11.850> across<00:04:12.060> these<00:04:12.209> two<00:04:12.360> games<00:04:12.570> but<00:04:13.170> for<00:04:13.230> me

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
to get across these two games but for me

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.500 
to get across these two games but for me
this<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:13.650> his<00:04:13.860> most<00:04:14.070> scary<00:04:14.370> when<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.390> one

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
this is his most scary when the one

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.289 
this is his most scary when the one
where<00:04:15.690> he<00:04:15.840> comes<00:04:16.079> from<00:04:16.440> behind<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:17.160> like<00:04:17.880> he's

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
where he comes from behind you like he's

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.670 
where he comes from behind you like he's
been<00:04:18.479> sat<00:04:18.720> behind<00:04:18.870> your<00:04:19.140> chair<00:04:19.169> this<00:04:19.500> whole

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
been sat behind your chair this whole

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.620 
been sat behind your chair this whole
time<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.609> don't<00:04:20.700> know<00:04:20.970> until<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.299> point

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
time and you don't know until that point

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.750 
time and you don't know until that point
I<00:04:21.900> think<00:04:22.440> that's<00:04:22.590> really<00:04:23.070> clever<00:04:23.280> part<00:04:23.610> about

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
I think that's really clever part about

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.250 
I think that's really clever part about
it<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.240> don't<00:04:24.419> know<00:04:24.570> he's<00:04:24.750> there<00:04:24.960> he<00:04:25.140> could

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
it you don't know he's there he could

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.400 
it you don't know he's there he could
stay<00:04:25.470> there<00:04:25.680> for

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
stay there for

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.900 
stay there for
sometimes<00:04:26.710> ridiculous<00:04:27.220> amount<00:04:27.460> of<00:04:27.490> times<00:04:27.760> the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
sometimes ridiculous amount of times the

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.480 
sometimes ridiculous amount of times the
scariest<00:04:28.390> experience<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:28.810> had<00:04:28.990> with<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.230> I<00:04:29.490> was

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
scariest experience I had with it I was

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.800 
scariest experience I had with it I was
aware<00:04:30.760> that<00:04:30.940> he<00:04:31.060> was<00:04:31.120> in<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.330> room<00:04:31.480> so<00:04:31.720> I

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
aware that he was in the room so I

you actually see it coming towards you
before<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.860> actual<00:05:15.160> impact<00:05:15.520> which<00:05:15.700> is<00:05:15.820> always

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
before the actual impact which is always

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.400

Freddy had him in my own opinion by
knows<00:06:08.230> who's<00:06:08.640> undoubtedly<00:06:09.640> the<00:06:09.880> most<00:06:10.090> popular

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.570 
knows who's undoubtedly the most popular
amongst<00:06:11.500> and<00:06:11.740> the<00:06:11.830> reason<00:06:12.100> this<00:06:12.190> has<00:06:12.310> gotten

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
amongst and the reason this has gotten

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.370 
amongst and the reason this has gotten
the<00:06:12.880> number<00:06:13.090> one<00:06:13.240> spot<00:06:13.480> is<00:06:13.630> because<00:06:13.660> it's

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
the number one spot is because it's

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.960 
the number one spot is because it's
normally<00:06:14.680> one<00:06:14.800> of<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:14.920> most<00:06:15.070> common<00:06:15.460> but<00:06:15.790> it's

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
normally one of the most common but it's

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.180 
normally one of the most common but it's
also<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.330> most<00:06:16.570> scary<00:06:16.960> as<00:06:17.140> well<00:06:17.350> I<00:06:17.560> mean<00:06:18.070> we

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
also the most scary as well I mean we

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.580 
also the most scary as well I mean we
know<00:06:18.310> mix<00:06:18.580> of<00:06:18.730> both<00:06:19.030> it's<00:06:19.600> just<00:06:19.900> horrible<00:06:20.320> I

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
know mix of both it's just horrible I

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.740 
know mix of both it's just horrible I
mean<00:06:20.740> maybe<00:06:21.640> you'd<00:06:21.730> want<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.150> most<00:06:22.390> common

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
mean maybe you'd want the most common

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.040 
mean maybe you'd want the most common
one<00:06:22.840> to<00:06:22.990> be<00:06:23.110> the<00:06:23.550> nicest<00:06:24.550> one<00:06:24.940> but<00:06:25.630> for<00:06:25.900> pretty

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
one to be the nicest one but for pretty

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.780 
one to be the nicest one but for pretty
much<00:06:26.140> well<00:06:26.710> I<00:06:26.740> would<00:06:27.190> say<00:06:27.280> the<00:06:27.370> majority<00:06:27.460> of

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
much well I would say the majority of

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.820 
much well I would say the majority of
players<00:06:28.230> foxy<00:06:29.230> is<00:06:29.320> the<00:06:29.410> one<00:06:29.500> that<00:06:29.590> gets<00:06:29.680> you

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
players foxy is the one that gets you

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.560 
players foxy is the one that gets you
the<00:06:29.920> most<00:06:30.100> you<00:06:30.250> know<00:06:30.430> if<00:06:30.910> it's<00:06:31.060> not<00:06:31.180> the<00:06:31.270> puppet

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
the most you know if it's not the puppet

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.330 
the most you know if it's not the puppet
it's<00:06:31.690> him<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:32.470> others<00:06:32.740> you<00:06:32.860> can<00:06:33.040> come<00:06:33.220> back
