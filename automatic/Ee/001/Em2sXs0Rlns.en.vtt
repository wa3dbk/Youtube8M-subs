00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
but since I hit ninety two strength I

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.670

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
out see how it did and surprisingly I

I've<00:03:21.180> noticed<00:03:21.599> that<00:03:21.750> broad<00:03:22.109> bolts<00:03:22.560> are

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
I've noticed that broad bolts are

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.619 
I've noticed that broad bolts are
probably<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.609> way<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.730> go<00:03:23.969> if<00:03:24.180> you're<00:03:24.269> not

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
probably the way to go if you're not

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.420 
probably the way to go if you're not
looking<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.590> spend<00:03:25.769> too<00:03:25.950> much<00:03:26.069> money<00:03:26.280> on

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
ammunition

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.690 
ammunition
but<00:03:28.079> I<00:03:28.379> think<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.799> diamond<00:03:28.980> bolts<00:03:29.340> hid<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.670> lot

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
but I think the diamond bolts hid a lot

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.479 
but I think the diamond bolts hid a lot
better<00:03:30.239> as<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:31.260> speck<00:03:31.500> weakens<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.099> defense

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
better as the speck weakens the defense

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.179 
better as the speck weakens the defense
