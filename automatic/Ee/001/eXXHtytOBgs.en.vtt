00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
going to drop your own load so if you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.560 
going to drop your own load so if you
have<00:01:18.780> two<00:01:19.020> 16<00:01:19.500> ohm<00:01:19.680> cabinets<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.360> that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
have two 16 ohm cabinets and you do that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.359 
have two 16 ohm cabinets and you do that
you're<00:01:21.840> gonna<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.020> running<00:01:22.320> an<00:01:22.590> 8<00:01:22.799> ohm<00:01:22.830> load<00:01:23.189> on

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you're gonna be running an 8 ohm load on

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.580 
you're gonna be running an 8 ohm load on
your<00:01:23.490> amplifier<00:01:24.090> if<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.200> 8<00:01:25.380> ohm

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.109 
your amplifier if you have to 8 ohm
cabinets<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.729> you're<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
cabinets and you do that you're going to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.640 
cabinets and you do that you're going to
be<00:01:27.240> running<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.600> 4<00:01:27.900> ohm<00:01:28.110> load<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.470> your

be running a 4 ohm load on your
amplifier<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:29.909> also<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:31.310> what's<00:01:32.310> called

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
amplifier now we also have what's called

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.850 
amplifier now we also have what's called
a<00:01:32.579> stereo<00:01:33.060> mono<00:01:33.479> combo<00:01:34.400> input<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.860> where

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
a stereo mono combo input which is where

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.260 
a stereo mono combo input which is where
you<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.990> left-right<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.100> mono<00:01:41.430> which

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you have a left-right and a mono which

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.859 
you have a left-right and a mono which
in<00:01:42.689> effect<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.530> exactly<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.149> it's

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
in effect is exactly what that is it's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.020 
in effect is exactly what that is it's
for<00:01:46.170> running<00:01:46.500> stereo<00:01:47.040> where<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.700> two

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
for running stereo where you have two

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.510 
for running stereo where you have two
outputs<00:01:48.270> two<00:01:48.810> individual<00:01:49.560> outputs<00:01:49.979> an<00:01:50.130> A<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
outputs two individual outputs an A and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.450 
outputs two individual outputs an A and
a<00:01:50.579> B<00:01:50.610> output<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.479> your<00:01:51.509> amplifier<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.619> their

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
a B output on your amplifier and their

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.310 
a B output on your amplifier and their
separate<00:01:53.880> volume<00:01:54.270> controls<00:01:54.689> their<00:01:54.930> separate

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
separate volume controls their separate

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.440 
separate volume controls their separate
transformers<00:01:56.040> or<00:01:56.189> separate<00:01:56.579> amplifiers<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
transformers or separate amplifiers and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.990 
transformers or separate amplifiers and
that's<00:01:58.079> your<00:01:58.350> stereo<00:01:58.799> left<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.219> right<00:01:59.430> this

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
that's your stereo left and right this

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.929 
that's your stereo left and right this
so<00:02:00.750> if<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.439> plug<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:01.979> speaker<00:02:02.460> cable

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
so if you just plug one speaker cable

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.899 
so if you just plug one speaker cable
into<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.659> left<00:02:04.200> input<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:05.130> only<00:02:05.460> gonna<00:02:05.759> run

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
into the left input it's only gonna run

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.809 
into the left input it's only gonna run
the<00:02:06.540> left<00:02:06.840> speaker<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.190> if<00:02:08.399> you

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the left speaker and that's it if you

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.790 
the left speaker and that's it if you
unplug<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.750> plug<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.140> into<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> right

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
unplug it and plug it into the right

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.190 
unplug it and plug it into the right
it's<00:02:11.310> only<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> run<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.390> right<00:02:12.629> speaker

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it's only going to run the right speaker

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.570 
it's only going to run the right speaker
and

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.180 
and
that's<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.000> their<00:02:14.450> individual<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.710> can<00:02:15.890> do<00:02:16.040> it

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
that's it their individual you can do it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.430 
that's it their individual you can do it
like<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.430> they're<00:02:17.360> not<00:02:17.690> tied<00:02:18.050> in<00:02:18.260> together

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
like that they're not tied in together

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.850 
like that they're not tied in together
to<00:02:18.890> where<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:20.150> right<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.660> mono<00:02:21.110> unless<00:02:21.650> you

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
to where the right is mono unless you

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.440 
to where the right is mono unless you
have<00:02:22.040> something<00:02:22.400> plugged<00:02:22.550> into<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.030> left<00:02:23.270> one

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
have something plugged into the left one

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.180 
have something plugged into the left one
and<00:02:23.480> all<00:02:23.660> these<00:02:23.810> crazy<00:02:24.040> configurations<00:02:25.040> I

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
and all these crazy configurations I

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.350 
and all these crazy configurations I
read<00:02:25.400> about<00:02:26.140> then<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.260> mono<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:29.180> input

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
read about then the mono is the input

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.950 
read about then the mono is the input
the<00:02:30.200> parallel<00:02:30.770> input<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.760> runs<00:02:32.150> both<00:02:32.690> the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
the parallel input that runs both the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.520 
the parallel input that runs both the
left<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.500> right<00:02:33.950> speaker<00:02:34.490> then<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:36.290> have

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
left and the right speaker then we have

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.480 
left and the right speaker then we have
what's<00:02:36.800> called<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:37.340> 4<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.420> 16<00:02:38.930> ohm<00:02:39.410> ohm<00:02:40.100> load

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
what's called a 4 and 16 ohm ohm load

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.690 
what's called a 4 and 16 ohm ohm load

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
are what I call tone robbers now then

are what I call tone robbers now then
I've<00:05:36.360> got<00:05:36.660> quite<00:05:37.200> a<00:05:37.260> few<00:05:37.320> emails<00:05:37.830> about<00:05:38.510> these

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
I've got quite a few emails about these

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.230 
I've got quite a few emails about these

speaker<00:05:42.240> tabs<00:05:44.780> these<00:05:45.780> are<00:05:45.990> kind<00:05:46.410> of<00:05:46.500> cool<00:05:46.770> if

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
speaker tabs these are kind of cool if

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.280 
speaker tabs these are kind of cool if
you're<00:05:47.370> experimenting<00:05:48.060> with<00:05:48.240> speakers<00:05:48.690> to

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
you're experimenting with speakers to

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.770 
you're experimenting with speakers to
get<00:05:49.530> to<00:05:50.430> try<00:05:50.670> to<00:05:50.730> experiment<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.540> see<00:05:51.600> what

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
get to try to experiment and see what

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.750 
get to try to experiment and see what
speaker<00:05:52.230> you're<00:05:52.350> gonna<00:05:52.440> like<00:05:52.710> best<00:05:53.010> what<00:05:53.610> you

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
speaker you're gonna like best what you

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.250 
speaker you're gonna like best what you
do<00:05:53.910> with<00:05:54.060> these<00:05:54.240> things<00:05:54.510> is<00:05:54.690> you<00:05:54.840> just<00:05:54.990> take

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
do with these things is you just take

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.350 
do with these things is you just take
and<00:05:55.560> you<00:05:55.980> stick<00:05:56.280> it<00:05:56.310> on<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.640> end<00:05:56.760> of<00:05:56.910> a<00:05:57.030> strip

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
and you stick it on the end of a strip

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.810 
and you stick it on the end of a strip
speaker<00:05:57.810> wire<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:58.380> then<00:05:59.040> you<00:05:59.190> crimp<00:05:59.550> this

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
speaker wire and then you crimp this

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.950 
speaker wire and then you crimp this
down<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:01.430> in<00:06:02.430> effect<00:06:02.910> you<00:06:03.270> know<00:06:03.420> creates<00:06:03.870> a

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
down and in effect you know creates a

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.040 
down and in effect you know creates a
very<00:06:04.170> quick<00:06:04.730> connect<00:06:05.750> hookup<00:06:06.750> to<00:06:06.780> your

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
very quick connect hookup to your

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.650 
very quick connect hookup to your
speaker<00:06:07.470> like<00:06:07.650> so<00:06:08.180> these<00:06:09.180> are<00:06:09.360> great<00:06:09.630> for

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
speaker like so these are great for

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.800 
speaker like so these are great for
speaker<00:06:10.470> experimentation<00:06:11.480> but<00:06:12.480> I<00:06:12.540> don't

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
speaker experimentation but I don't

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.800 
speaker experimentation but I don't
recommend<00:06:13.350> them<00:06:13.530> for<00:06:14.420> permanent<00:06:15.420> speaker

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
recommend them for permanent speaker

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.110 
recommend them for permanent speaker
