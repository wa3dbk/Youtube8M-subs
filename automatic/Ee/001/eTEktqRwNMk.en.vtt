if<00:00:00.930> you<00:00:01.079> didn't<00:00:01.290> have<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.500> at<00:00:01.650> 500<00:00:02.159> if<00:00:02.280> you

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
if you didn't have this at 500 if you

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.860 
if you didn't have this at 500 if you
were<00:00:02.580> too<00:00:02.730> far<00:00:02.909> away<00:00:03.000> we<00:00:03.179> just<00:00:03.360> say<00:00:03.449> can't<00:00:03.750> do

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
were too far away we just say can't do

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.710 
were too far away we just say can't do
it<00:00:03.990> you're<00:00:04.110> too<00:00:04.259> far<00:00:04.470> camp<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.250> but<00:00:05.940> by<00:00:06.060> setting

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
it you're too far camp on but by setting

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.690 
it you're too far camp on but by setting
this<00:00:06.779> smart<00:00:07.140> on<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.649> by<00:00:07.919> making<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.519> range

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
this smart on and by making the range

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.839 
this smart on and by making the range
500<00:00:09.440> you<00:00:10.440> can<00:00:10.590> sell<00:00:10.830> from<00:00:11.040> far<00:00:11.250> away<00:00:11.280> but<00:00:11.490> your

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
500 you can sell from far away but your

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.370 
500 you can sell from far away but your
guy<00:00:11.940> will<00:00:12.120> walk<00:00:12.269> all<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.570> way<00:00:12.599> up<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:12.929> sell<00:00:13.230> it

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
guy will walk all the way up and sell it

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.919 
guy will walk all the way up and sell it
so<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.460> think<00:00:14.580> if<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.880> don't<00:00:15.030> check<00:00:15.269> smart<00:00:15.599> then

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
so I think if you don't check smart then

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.120 
so I think if you don't check smart then
you<00:00:16.020> guy<00:00:16.109> will<00:00:16.289> sell<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.650> from<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.890> literally

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
you guy will sell it from the literally

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.010 
you guy will sell it from the literally
500<00:00:17.699> range<00:00:17.850> which<00:00:18.060> would<00:00:18.210> be<00:00:18.300> wouldn't<00:00:18.869> make

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
500 range which would be wouldn't make

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.200 
500 range which would be wouldn't make
any<00:00:19.170> sense<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:20.160> by<00:00:20.279> checking<00:00:20.520> smart<00:00:20.970> he'll

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
any sense so by checking smart he'll

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.200 
any sense so by checking smart he'll
come<00:00:21.449> up<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> he'll<00:00:22.050> sell<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:23.150> I<00:00:24.150> don't

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
come up and he'll sell it and I don't

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.120 
come up and he'll sell it and I don't
think<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.570> need<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.470> fact<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.890> don't

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
think we need to do in fact I don't

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.849 
think we need to do in fact I don't
think<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.490> need<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.900> I<00:00:30.320> think<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.560> might<00:00:31.679> only

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
think we need to I think we might only

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.110 
think we need to I think we might only
need<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.309> thing<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:35.120> refund

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
need to do one thing here refund

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.560 
need to do one thing here refund
fraction<00:00:36.690> which<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:38.000> let<00:00:39.000> saved<00:00:39.329> Oh

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
fraction which is just let saved Oh

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.020 
fraction which is just let saved Oh
point<00:00:39.840> 5<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:42.710> all<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.579> different<00:00:44.850> things

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
point 5 for all all the different things

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
point 5 for all all the different things
I<00:00:45.379> don't<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.440> why<00:00:46.559> there's<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:46.920> many

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
I don't know why there's so many

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.569 
I don't know why there's so many
different<00:00:47.160> indices<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:49.340> was<00:00:50.340> sort<00:00:50.550> of

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
different indices here I was sort of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.520 
different indices here I was sort of
confused<00:00:50.700> by<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.180> thing<00:00:51.539> by<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.320> how<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
confused by this thing by the how the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.840 
confused by this thing by the how the
pawn<00:00:52.770> ability<00:00:53.129> works<00:00:53.309> I've<00:00:53.460> never<00:00:53.610> really

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
pawn ability works I've never really

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.369 
pawn ability works I've never really
looked<00:00:54.000> into<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> think<00:00:54.930> as<00:00:55.110> long<00:00:55.260> as

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
looked into it but I think as long as

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.310 
looked into it but I think as long as
you<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.680> set<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.660> refund<00:00:57.660> fraction<00:00:58.170> there

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you just set the refund fraction there

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.920 
you just set the refund fraction there
that's<00:00:58.530> all<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.770> really<00:00:58.859> need<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.930> for

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that's all you really need to do for

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.080 
that's all you really need to do for
this<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.350> now<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.370> back<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.550> our<00:01:02.760> Forge

class<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:14.060> want<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.420> drop<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.900> then<00:02:14.990> you<00:02:15.110> set

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
class you want to drop and then you set

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.840 
class you want to drop and then you set
the<00:02:15.440> minimum<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.860> maximum<00:02:15.950> level<00:02:16.490> from<00:02:16.700> that

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
the minimum and maximum level from that

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.000 
the minimum and maximum level from that
class<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.300> it'll<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:18.080> pick<00:02:18.380> something

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
class and it'll like pick something

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.540 
class and it'll like pick something
random<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.400> think<00:02:20.680> but<00:02:21.680> that's<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.280> sort<00:02:22.520> of

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
random I think but that's not sort of

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.950 
random I think but that's not sort of
what<00:02:22.670> i<00:02:22.700> want<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.390> i'm<00:02:24.140> actually<00:02:24.320> going<00:02:24.620> to

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
what i want so i'm actually going to

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.540 
what i want so i'm actually going to
change<00:02:26.960> this<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.380> be<00:02:27.650> as<00:02:28.300> set<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:30.310> think<00:02:31.310> that'll

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
change this to be as set I think that'll

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.380 
change this to be as set I think that'll
be<00:02:31.580> ideal<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.980> children<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:37.210> now<00:02:38.210> is

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
be ideal so the children and now is

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.210 
be ideal so the children and now is
we're<00:02:38.570> actually<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.930> should<00:02:39.170> have<00:02:39.290> add<00:02:40.130> another

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
we're actually I should have add another

we're actually I should have add another

deserve one and zergling blood loot the
set<00:03:04.520> here<00:03:05.000> we'll<00:03:05.830> have<00:03:06.830> children<00:03:08.440> chance

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
set here we'll have children chance

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.650 
set here we'll have children chance
let's<00:03:09.830> say<00:03:10.040> fifty<00:03:10.640> percent<00:03:10.940> chance<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.480> get

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
let's say fifty percent chance to get

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.110 
let's say fifty percent chance to get
none<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.140> then<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.010> fifty<00:03:13.340> percent<00:03:13.640> chance<00:03:13.850> to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
none and then a fifty percent chance to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.740 
none and then a fifty percent chance to
get<00:03:14.680> circling<00:03:15.680> blood<00:03:16.630> okay<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:19.690> now<00:03:20.690> we

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
get circling blood okay and so now we

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.170 
get circling blood okay and so now we
have<00:03:20.900> these<00:03:21.500> two<00:03:21.739> things<00:03:21.860> set<00:03:22.100> up<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:22.430> then<00:03:23.060> we

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
have these two things set up and then we

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.360 
have these two things set up and then we
can<00:03:23.300> go<00:03:23.390> back<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.870> unit's<00:03:24.470> here<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.890> find

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
can go back to the unit's here and find

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.130 
can go back to the unit's here and find
circling<00:03:29.950> which<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.220> not<00:03:31.400> custom<00:03:31.760> yet<00:03:32.140> and

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
every second circling should give us a

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.759 
every second circling should give us a
wriggling<00:04:00.920> blood<00:04:01.790> if<00:04:02.410> statistics<00:04:03.410> work<00:04:03.590> out
