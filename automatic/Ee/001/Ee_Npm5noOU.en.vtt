00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.570
 government of doctor pastrana 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 President Uribe has made many efforts to consolidate peace 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.910
 in Colombia but on the scheme 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.570
 fundamental of the democratic security policy point the operation of a

 collaboration in mind I find out about intelligence 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:25.119

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:29.439

 We are going to use them in Colombia to finish defeating 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.679
 the terrorism of the FARC is for the only thing because we 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:44.789
