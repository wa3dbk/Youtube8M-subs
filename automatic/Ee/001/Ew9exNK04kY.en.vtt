00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello everyone today i will show how 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.140
 correct favor for the shadowplay program 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.429
 actually click on the program itself 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.049
 geforce experience 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.850
 and the first requirement is your video card 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.550
 must be at least gtx 650 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.310
 as below you just have yes 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.150
 write 0 I don't know what you have there 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.560
 it will be but the fact that below 10 should not be 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.110
 I personally have 660ti 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.739
 its what we do go in geforce 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.510
 experience click shadow play in 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.030
 here everything will look standard 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.910
 something like this and there will be others 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.329
 the buttons I did for myself and the same tweaked 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.969
 here is what we should immediately replace 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:57.149
 should change the input mode well mode 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.750
 turn on off select manual and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.370
 thereby 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.109
 click on the button we start recording 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.809
 pressing again we stop it 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.880
 pretty comfortable quality we leave 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.659
 high sound soundtrack 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.040
 leave in place the bill settings here 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.659
 here we indicate what we need 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.570
 buttons which you are also comfortable here 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.479
 where you need to point daddy where 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.020
 will be video recorded and so since 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.310
 whose disk is not divided into two 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.159
 drive c will somehow 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.390
 Well, you know drive c small 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:41.909
 usually here is actually shadow play 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.960
 set the manual mode to everything else 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.659
 leave unchanged except we 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.280
 you understand the button insert 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.070
 minimize and actually run but 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.180
 Here we are actually in the game because 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.420
 me 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.990
 button in the 9th and to record fraps before 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.210
 play me recording started simultaneously 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.530
 that is, for fraps 30 fps and for 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.100
 play 60 now let's see what we have from 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.100
 it will be 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.130
 well, well, well, well, well 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.580
 touch it that's fine 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.410
 absolutely player ps 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.410
 no squats no lags 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.510
 little Vrezh that involve the long 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.510
 this 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.750
 but bumped into the plan let's still a little 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.750
 a little bit we wo n't do 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.860
 showed tags 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.370
 catacombs 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.370
 and weighs 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.040
 and actually at the end you do not put here 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.060
 the original of the record which 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.060
 now we spend online 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:32.660
 but here we are actually out of the game 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.310
 We look how much it turned out to write 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.940
 rather did it really 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.739
 it turned out well here and a half minutes 596 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.390
 megabyte with fraps well 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.940
 compare because phrase fraps would 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:54.650
 now would weigh a gigabyte 2videos of 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.650
 slavery well, and now the video will start 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:03.799
 Perhaps you can note two main advantages 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.790
 shadow play is the first thing most important 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.599
 the fact that it does not load the system 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.180
 almost no way it is possible 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.269
 think no card purchase 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:22.889
 video capture and nothing like it at all 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:27.000
 Well, the second is pretty small 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.830
 the volume of the recording file that is to 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.039
 frapsom again I say this by no means 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.039
 compare 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.110
 Well, that's all who this video was 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:42.139
 helpful like subscribe to 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.139
 my channel all good luck all bye
