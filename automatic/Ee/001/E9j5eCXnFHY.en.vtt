00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.929 
and put a layer of mulch on these beds
now<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.439> will<00:01:52.619> provide<00:01:52.979> some<00:01:53.250> protection

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
now this will provide some protection

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.149 
now this will provide some protection
but<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> main<00:01:54.810> thing<00:01:55.110> it'll<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.710> help<00:01:56.100> keep

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
but the main thing it'll do is help keep

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.609 
but the main thing it'll do is help keep
some<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> those<00:01:56.880> early<00:01:57.299> weeds<00:01:57.600> from<00:01:57.990> coming<00:01:58.079> up

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
some of those early weeds from coming up

one other point that I failed to make

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.270 
one other point that I failed to make
before<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.110> put<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.350> mulch<00:02:04.710> down<00:02:05.009> I'm<00:02:05.159> gonna

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
before I put that mulch down I'm gonna

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.709 
before I put that mulch down I'm gonna
take<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> little<00:02:05.700> fertilizer<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.509> I'm<00:02:06.570> going

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.820 
to work around each one of these plants
and<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.270> reason<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.770> that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
and the reason for that is that that

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.150
