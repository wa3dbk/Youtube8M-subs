00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello I am 28 bodybuilding 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.799
 get to know the sweepstakes my video 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.109
 on sunday he gave a scandal 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.340
 defective videos i have a fake video 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.199
 immediately recognized otherwise would have the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.279
 first place made at second effect 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.439
 video I did not recognize 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.869
 I was made aware of that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.849
 that someone has a video and cloud 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.260
 and it's from youtube, so to speak 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.900
 has downloaded and then as his 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.160
 video uploaded was yes for me 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.290
 that could not be recognized 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.440
 many thanks to the fag basta 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.600
 who have noticed that someone is here 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 not honest and not at not 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.660
 showing his own achievement is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.890
 of course totally described 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.350
 honestly it is not possible 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.750
 kept that someone is so stupid and one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.390
 video cloud and the high lives or that 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.649
 someone so his video so fekter 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.940
 I would have a little more honesty 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.320
 thought but probably it was 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.090
 just my mistake i was a bit 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.980
 too naive a little too blue-eyed one 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.239
 a bit too good faith that will become 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.100
 change at the next games of chance 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.500
 will be all that from the start 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.680
 be excluded yes as I said 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.790
 I learned from that 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.780
 Of course this is the first place 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.180
 become free again 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.500
 or at the first place of the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.799
 second place slips at first 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.619
 space 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.299
 the first place is rivva chamber 2 6 4 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.680
 We already wrote 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.150
 You confirmed that to me you have one 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.830
 confirmation video uploaded 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.180
 I saw that so that the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.430
 thing scratched of course i have too 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.869
 all information i need just that 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.750
 Swiss winner forward 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 Win a win in any case then 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.049
 I have to send in the same connection 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.520
 to this video then your information 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.860
 continue to endure and then you get yours 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.759
 win home everything clearly the second 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.619
 course is natural again 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.960
 freed 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.640
 for basically several people and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.409
 the participant field very tight 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.659
 moved together yes the participant field 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.759
 then became very tight because we 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.340
 several people had where was at 18 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.920
 repetitions plus - a little something 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.899
 when and where did I say okay here 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.460
 could the pull but what unplug the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.460
 funny is i have people in front of it 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.560
 I have before that over 25 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.880
 other participants and we 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.550
 had evaluated that together 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.930
 and at once are of these 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.490
 videos are not all in there anymore 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.170
 that means for us they do not live 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.730
 that means somehow man 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.570
 probably the author himself has 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.400
 taken her out 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.570
 Of course they can do that now 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.280
 is no longer involved 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.590
 super annoying for these two people 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.900
 here would have come into question yes 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.170
 but there are still two for this one 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.110
 place in question came and then becomes the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.210
 I've got to evaluate videos right away 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.670
 previously it had been so say almost the 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.020
 really was so extremely close together 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.400
 we said then look here 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.690
 Repetition does not count in any case 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.820
 we have both repetition with 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.740
 deducted then we said okay one 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.670
 the repetition was not 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.740
 We can still be 100 percent there 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.390
 Making a withdrawal is the other video 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.090
 but also watch another while the 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.890
 will do it one hundred percent fast 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.720
 Said around me, these two are enough 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.600
 videos are at eye level 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.000
 we have to decide now 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.420
 have set a coin who have 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.430
 who is announced kevin s head and how 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.070
 have thrown the coin and kevin tarte 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.520
 so kevin online you have it 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.620
 second place proves to be lucky 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.300
 on your side was the sporty 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.770
 performance but it also giants 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.350
 really great 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.630
 and yes, there you are finally 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.040
 even by losglÃ¼ck against the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.900
 others enforced one too 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.820
 Real really outstanding performance 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.010
 but it just brought bad luck 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.630
 that it has decided against him 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.070
 or the patch has because of it 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.170
 like no other no third place 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.790
 Maybe yes, that will happen 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.260
 I would not say much for that 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.700
 the next competition 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.930
 I do not want to anticipate everything 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.280
 take it with the totally boring though 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.989
 I already tell everything but 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.670
 maybe we will do it then 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.970
 third place I still know 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.590
 Not 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.840
 I will definitely be back 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.280
 to think of something I think that it 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.019
 definitely start this year 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.910
 I'm pretty pretty 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.280
 pretty sure if it is still in there 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.820
 november starts or only in december 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.400
 I do not know that yet but there is 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.780
 quite a lot of great plans 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.000
 yes i want to go here again 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.800
 Thank you to all participants 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.870

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.790
 and 20 great videos it's really fun 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.440
 made it was exciting 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.690
 I have seen each other 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.549
 discussed and also have the participants 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.190
 the competition videos looked at and 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.800
 Although really cool to remember that 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.180
 They enjoy it and I want to 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.100

 Many thanks for that sponsored 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.050
 you have allowed us such a 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.410
 athletic contest with youtube too 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.440
 do 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.270
 All right, the other video where I have the 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.740
 fake winner announced that would take 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.410
 Of course, I am now out of myself 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.750
 that's why this is the official one 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.940
 Video where the host announces the winners 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.260
 have been us once very briefly to 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.670
 say from the first place I already have 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.010
 a confirmation video seen 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.020
 kevin online please also briefly 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.750
 confirm a video setting where you are 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.340
 then I say hello I am really and 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.140
 best in the same place 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.670
 product video recorded on 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.780
 best if you have the things then 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.190
 Do you also pull the same things? 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.390
 to the video needs for you so 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.710
 Upload that everyone sees the 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.300
 you do not need to upload publicly 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.340
 but also privately because then it even looks 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.140
 No one in the middle can not be listed 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.090
 click then you send me to the link 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.900
 and only the one with the life can do that 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.430
 watch a video 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.070
 I would just have a quick look 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.200
 then you get the profit 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.180
 when I saw this video 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.950
 so you can also have yours right now 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.840
 address send everything clearly 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.040
 please stay one week, you would come 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.570

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.570
 Report to me within a week 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:39.440

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.880
 sent so yes I just 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.710
 sunday had no more desire on the 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.300
 somehow it's fun for me 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.010
 for sunday passed after me 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.190
 somehow proclaimed in wrinkle winner 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.980
 I think it's great that it's here 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.330
 so many submissions are that it 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.950
 here are really many people are theirs 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.000
 have uploaded a few videos are 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.600
 as I said before again 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.310
 rausgenommen 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.110
 too bad a pity especially for two 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.230
 people who are now potential second 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.090
 be space come into question 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.850
 All right that would be so far from me 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.540
 I do not have much to say 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.540
