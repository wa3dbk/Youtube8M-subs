whenever<00:00:41.440> I<00:00:41.649> look<00:00:41.859> at<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.129> family's<00:00:42.730> team

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
whenever I look at the family's team

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.919 
whenever I look at the family's team
playing<00:00:43.179> they<00:00:43.300> always<00:00:43.480> seem<00:00:43.629> to<00:00:43.690> be<00:00:43.749> playing

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929

at<00:00:44.050> Brookvale<00:00:44.440> they<00:00:44.979> just<00:00:45.219> I'll<00:00:45.850> get<00:00:45.999> the

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
at Brookvale they just I'll get the

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.579 
at Brookvale they just I'll get the
feeling<00:00:46.569> they<00:00:46.690> have<00:00:46.780> more<00:00:46.899> home<00:00:47.140> games<00:00:47.409> than

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
feeling they have more home games than

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.410 
feeling they have more home games than
anyone<00:00:47.769> else<00:00:48.039> I'm<00:00:48.609> sure<00:00:48.789> it's<00:00:48.909> not<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.089> case

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
anyone else I'm sure it's not the case

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.729 
anyone else I'm sure it's not the case
but<00:00:49.659> I<00:00:49.719> feel<00:00:49.989> that<00:00:50.019> way<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.409> I<00:00:50.469> think<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:50.679> gives

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
but I feel that way and I think it gives

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.410 
but I feel that way and I think it gives
them<00:00:50.859> such<00:00:51.069> such<00:00:51.460> an<00:00:51.579> advantage<00:00:51.879> I'm

Hodges<00:01:37.360> still<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.500> they'll<00:01:38.680> be<00:01:38.860> fantastic

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670

but<00:01:40.120> I<00:01:40.180> just<00:01:40.450> think<00:01:40.660> that<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.840> cowboys<00:01:41.230> will

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
but I just think that the cowboys will

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.690 
but I just think that the cowboys will
be<00:01:41.500> too<00:01:41.710> strong<00:01:42.040> think<00:01:42.340> it's<00:01:42.430> going<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.580> be<00:01:42.670> a

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
be too strong think it's going to be a

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.100 
be too strong think it's going to be a
high<00:01:42.850> quality<00:01:42.910> game<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.630> given<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.080> fact

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.960 
know it is a big step up but you know
what<00:02:51.630> i<00:02:52.110> think<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.340> Roosters<00:02:53.700> will<00:02:53.850> get

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
what i think that the Roosters will get

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.420 
what i think that the Roosters will get
the<00:02:54.090> Sharks<00:02:54.570> not<00:02:55.440> just<00:02:55.650> because<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.070> usual

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the Sharks not just because of the usual

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.210 
the Sharks not just because of the usual
who<00:02:56.760> do<00:02:56.910> around<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.630> new<00:02:58.380> coach<00:02:58.620> company<00:02:59.100> and

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
who do around a new coach company and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.950 
who do around a new coach company and
getting<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.490> win<00:02:59.640> but<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.330> Sharks<00:03:00.660> without

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
getting the win but the Sharks without

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.540 
getting the win but the Sharks without
Kamali<00:03:01.410> or<00:03:01.560> dykes<00:03:01.800> in<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.040> halves<00:03:02.220> their<00:03:02.430> eyes

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
Kamali or dykes in the halves their eyes

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.920 
Kamali or dykes in the halves their eyes
I<00:03:02.760> haven't<00:03:03.000> seen<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.210> all<00:03:03.420> year<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.630> don't

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
I haven't seen that all year I don't

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.720 
I haven't seen that all year I don't
think<00:03:04.080> that'll<00:03:04.260> help<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.710> agree<00:03:05.220> with<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.430> and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
think that'll help I agree with you and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.640 
think that'll help I agree with you and
I<00:03:06.210> think<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> changing<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.440> coach<00:03:07.620> is

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
I think the changing of the coach is

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.050 
I think the changing of the coach is
significant<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.430> think<00:03:08.550> it's<00:03:08.670> significant

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
significant and I think it's significant

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.850 
significant and I think it's significant
that<00:03:09.090> it's<00:03:09.270> brad<00:03:09.450> fittler<00:03:09.690> such<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.320> legend<00:03:10.770> out

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
that it's brad fittler such a legend out

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.890 
that it's brad fittler such a legend out
at<00:03:10.980> Bondi<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.490> know<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.360> players<00:03:12.540> will<00:03:12.750> rally

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
at Bondi I know the players will rally

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.570 
at Bondi I know the players will rally
around<00:03:13.020> him<00:03:13.290> even<00:03:13.440> if<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.740> is<00:03:13.860> for<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.130> week<00:03:14.340> so

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
around him even if it is for one week so

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.820 
around him even if it is for one week so
i<00:03:14.610> think<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.360> Roosters<00:03:15.720> will<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:16.320> this<00:03:16.560> win

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
i think the Roosters will have this win

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
get this one just being down there in

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.760 
get this one just being down there in
Canberra<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.660> Michael<00:04:19.170> Weyman<00:04:19.290> back<00:04:19.590> into

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
Canberra and Michael Weyman back into

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.010 
Canberra and Michael Weyman back into
the<00:04:19.859> side<00:04:20.070> again<00:04:20.340> he's<00:04:20.580> a<00:04:20.880> ruffnut<00:04:21.480> and<00:04:21.720> I
