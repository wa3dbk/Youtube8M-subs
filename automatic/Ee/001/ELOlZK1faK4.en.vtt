eat

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.000 

hopefully<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.349> show<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.709> some<00:03:16.890> these

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
hopefully I can show you some these

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.800 
hopefully I can show you some these
graphics<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.670> saw<00:03:17.909> some<00:03:18.150> screen<00:03:18.420> shots<00:03:18.450> at

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
graphics that I saw some screen shots at

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.700 
graphics that I saw some screen shots at
it<00:03:18.840> really<00:03:19.170> know

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.620 

holy<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.870> psychedelic<00:03:26.710> man<00:03:27.630> this

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
holy this is psychedelic man this

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.090 
holy this is psychedelic man this
must<00:03:28.840> be<00:03:28.990> what<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.140> looks<00:03:29.320> like<00:03:29.440> inside<00:03:29.650> Jimi

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
must be what it looks like inside Jimi

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.360 
must be what it looks like inside Jimi
Hendrix<00:03:30.540> bladder<00:03:31.770> when<00:03:32.770> he<00:03:32.860> was<00:03:32.950> alive<00:03:33.160> I

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
Hendrix bladder when he was alive I

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.970 
Hendrix bladder when he was alive I
guess<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.540> basically<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:38.080> control<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.530> dragon

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
guess so basically I control this dragon

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.310 
guess so basically I control this dragon
thing<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.280> just<00:03:39.550> numb<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.330> everything<00:03:40.750> nom

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
thing and just numb on everything nom

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.240 
thing and just numb on everything nom
nom<00:03:41.620> nom<00:03:41.860> long<00:03:45.510> until<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:46.540> evolve<00:03:46.960> and<00:03:47.260> then<00:03:48.040> I'm

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
nom nom long until I evolve and then I'm

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.610 
nom nom long until I evolve and then I'm
nom<00:03:48.850> on<00:03:49.000> some<00:03:49.210> bigger<00:03:52.260> but<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.380> music

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
nom on some bigger but the music

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.080 
nom on some bigger but the music
and<00:03:53.710> visuals<00:03:54.040> are<00:03:54.130> really<00:03:54.280> nice<00:03:54.400> it's<00:03:54.730> pretty

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
and visuals are really nice it's pretty

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.790 
and visuals are really nice it's pretty
mellow<00:03:55.300> I<00:03:55.630> think<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.200> could<00:03:56.320> chill<00:03:56.530> out<00:03:56.650> on<00:03:56.680> this

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
mellow I think I could chill out on this

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.290 
mellow I think I could chill out on this
game<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.190> while<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:59.670> probably<00:04:00.670> just<00:04:00.820> on<00:04:01.120> my

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
game for a while I probably just on my

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.860 
game for a while I probably just on my
way<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.780> next<00:04:01.990> level<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.940> go<00:04:03.940> exploring<00:04:04.780> a

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
way to the next level and go exploring a

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.470 
way to the next level and go exploring a
little<00:04:05.140> bit<00:04:07.140> not<00:04:08.140> sure<00:04:08.170> if<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.650> am<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.270> bad

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
little bit not sure if I am it is bad

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.170 
little bit not sure if I am it is bad
guys<00:04:10.780> or<00:04:11.110> what<00:04:11.670> so<00:04:12.670> let's<00:04:12.820> go<00:04:12.970> have<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.150> look

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
guys or what so let's go have a look

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.990 
guys or what so let's go have a look
around

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.150 

the<00:04:16.540> controls<00:04:16.989> are<00:04:17.140> really<00:04:17.380> like<00:04:17.530> inertia<00:04:17.890> be

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
the controls are really like inertia be

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.910 
the controls are really like inertia be
so<00:04:18.459> once<00:04:18.730> you<00:04:18.820> lose<00:04:18.970> your<00:04:19.209> speed<00:04:19.829> you've<00:04:20.829> got

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
so once you lose your speed you've got

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.690 
so once you lose your speed you've got
to<00:04:21.040> sort<00:04:21.160> of<00:04:21.220> build<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.519> back<00:04:21.609> up<00:04:21.670> again<00:04:23.700> this

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
to sort of build it back up again this

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.510 
to sort of build it back up again this
creature<00:04:25.060> reminds<00:04:25.450> me<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.870> an<00:04:26.260> insect<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.310> once

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
creature reminds me of an insect I once

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.950 
creature reminds me of an insect I once
found<00:04:27.700> in<00:04:27.850> my<00:04:27.940> swimming<00:04:28.270> pool<00:04:28.540> when<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.780> was<00:04:28.810> a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
found in my swimming pool when I was a

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.220 
found in my swimming pool when I was a
little<00:04:29.350> boy<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.510> scared<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.810> out<00:04:31.960> of<00:04:31.990> me

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.810 

it's<00:04:35.230> probably<00:04:35.620> also<00:04:35.800> an<00:04:36.250> accurate

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
it's probably also an accurate

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.690 
it's probably also an accurate
simulation<00:04:37.360> of<00:04:37.480> what<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:39.220> looks<00:04:39.370> like<00:04:39.490> inside

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
simulation of what it looks like inside

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.950 
simulation of what it looks like inside
lindsay<00:04:40.060> lohan's<00:04:40.480> uterus<00:04:41.790> you<00:04:42.790> know<00:04:43.000> who

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
lindsay lohan's uterus you know who

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.730 
lindsay lohan's uterus you know who
wants<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.350> go<00:04:44.470> there<00:04:46.260> anyway<00:04:47.260> guys<00:04:47.410> on<00:04:47.650> that

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
wants to go there anyway guys on that

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.970 
wants to go there anyway guys on that
horrible<00:04:48.130> know<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:48.460> might<00:04:48.610> wrap<00:04:48.820> this<00:04:48.970> up<00:04:49.980> go

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
horrible know I might wrap this up go

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.110 
horrible know I might wrap this up go
check<00:04:51.160> out<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.280> demo<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.790> games<00:04:51.970> really
