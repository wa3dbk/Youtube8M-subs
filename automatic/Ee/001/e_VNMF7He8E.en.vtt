00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Hi,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
how many people are there!

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
What are you chewing?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Mmm... I thought trophy canned food.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
Common, enough!

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Draw your attention away from your meal and let's imagine...

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
You are a rich manufacture.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Yes-yes, you are.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.500
On the excellent tallship you carry brocade and spices.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
There is a long trip, your cabin is warm,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
the sea and sky... wonderful!

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.500
But one day in the hold

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500
rats started spoiling your precious textiles

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.500
and shit into your spices.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
How can you get rid of them?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
You put five rats in a barrel,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.500
close it for several weeks, right?..

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.500
till only one rat survives

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500
the one who've eaten his fellows.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.500
So, we've go - whom? -

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.500
Right!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500
"Rat Lion"

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
who prefers of all dishe - what?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.500
- Right! -

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
meat of his relatives.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500
Now just let him into the hold and...

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Simple like that!

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
Hamsters, wolves and some cats 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
eat their new-born babies - it's normal.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
Lemming-mice

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500
who commit mass suicides

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500
if the food is not enough -

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
it is also normal, isn't it?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
The meat of the member of your own kind

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
assimilates better than any other food

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.500
as protein and salt structure

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
of the victim and the eater is similar.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.500
By the way, cannibalism,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.500
as cultural phenomenon,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.500
was always in place -

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500
everybody is aware of such types as

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.500
religious or sexual cannibalism.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.500
Anyway, it is exotica for

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500
curious specialists and thrill-seekers.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500
We, the true gourmets who ignore foolish prejudices and

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.500
fickle morality - 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500
we are more interested in economic aspect.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.500
So, attention!

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
The most serious universal problem

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500
is not global warming but

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
overpopulation and lack of food.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500
During past 50 years

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500
the same amount of people were born and died

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.500
as throughout the whole previous history of humanity.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
It means there are a bit too many of us.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Do you see my point?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500
Scaring for wimps, the day will come soon

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
when everybody understands

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500
we are the food for ourselves.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500
In underdeveloped countries

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.500
eating men by men will be chaotic -

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
on the principal "who catches, wins" -

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.500
the same way as sexual process happens.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
In civilized world this process,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500
for sure, should be industrially organized.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
Just imagine - spacious light farms

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500
where in comfortable boxes

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
with newest sophisticated technologies

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500
selected two-legged cattle

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500
is raised.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500
By the way those animals who afford to "be food"

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.500
are winning in interspecific struggle for 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.500
Control of the Planet.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500
Do you realize it?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500
How many tigers are there in the Earth?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500
Bears?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500
Only a few!

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500
But let's think about cows,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500
how many of them are on the planet?

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.500
Half as much as people! Got it?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500
And now attention!

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500
Have you ever thought WHO has already started

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.500
raising us for nourishment?

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.500
Right now we are in process of 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500
psychological and social training.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
Look!

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500
Stem cells - one!

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
Medical serum of aborted materials - two!

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500
Popular movies about zombie,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500
eating each other - three!

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.500
Laws for euthanasia - four!

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500
Donar kebabs and hotdogs at each corner -

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.500
made of nobody-knows-what - five!

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.500
Do you really know 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
what it is made of?

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.500
And nobody would be afraid of future,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500
no crisis can scare us!

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.500
All vegans and green-peace followers

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500
would be happy

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500
- nobody will touch their beloved animals any more.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.500
However, won't vegans and greens

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500
be in the first portion of universal protein food ration, mmm?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500
Chew on that for a while!
