pocket<00:00:42.820> because<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:43.270> was<00:00:43.390> more<00:00:43.600> accessible

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
but when it's clipped you can't see it

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.180 
but when it's clipped you can't see it
it<00:01:04.860> looks<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.400> little<00:01:06.920> big<00:01:07.920> pan<00:01:10.040> but<00:01:11.040> it's
