the<00:04:45.199> iPad<00:04:45.560> air<00:04:50.259> and<00:04:52.000> because<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.389> of<00:04:53.930> course

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
the iPad air and because the of course

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.960 
the iPad air and because the of course
because<00:04:54.710> it's<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:54.949> touch<00:04:55.160> screen<00:04:55.190> compatible

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970

because it's a touch screen compatible
device<00:04:56.660> this<00:04:57.470> emulator<00:04:58.100> works<00:04:58.820> better<00:04:59.120> in<00:04:59.539> my

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
device this emulator works better in my

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.480 
device this emulator works better in my
opinion<00:04:59.900> in<00:05:00.320> any<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.740> other<00:05:00.889> emulators

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
opinion in any of the other emulators

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.760 
opinion in any of the other emulators
because<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.389> bottom<00:05:02.720> screen<00:05:03.139> works<00:05:03.500> as

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
because the bottom screen works as

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.620 
because the bottom screen works as
normal<00:05:04.250> because<00:05:04.669> it's<00:05:04.850> all<00:05:05.030> touchscreen<00:05:05.300> of

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
normal because it's all touchscreen of

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:30.170 
normal because it's all touchscreen of
course<00:05:06.020> so<00:05:06.650> we<00:05:06.800> can<00:05:06.949> go<00:05:07.100> to<00:05:07.130> new<00:05:08.030> game

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.790 

now<00:05:31.180> this<00:05:31.330> is<00:05:31.480> what<00:05:31.660> I<00:05:31.690> was<00:05:31.840> saying<00:05:32.140> about<00:05:32.290> this
