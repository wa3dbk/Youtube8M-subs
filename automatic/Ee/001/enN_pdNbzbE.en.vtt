00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.609
 cuckoo te mongori jo movie video because 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.200
 in fact I'm going to organize a competition 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.780
 dry so this is my first contest 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.360
 slesch then mountain is to make 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.280
 horse ball sketch matches and two 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.719
 teams of three 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.960
 as for the false killed six people who 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.340
 play against each other so a team 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.700
 of three people were 3 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.830
 people that's six people so 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.570
 mu it i want them to have only five 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.620
 participants here then it starts from 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.530
 today that April 15, 2013 and I 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.330
 wanted until May 1, 2013 which 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.170
 clijsters or they will be given the bag 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.720
 but the mails therefore deals with four days 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.250
 after because I have to spend the 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.330
 means and or so I'm going to you 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
 explain a little how things are going 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.850
 unroll so in fact it needs to be your 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.170
 match lasts 5 minutes five minutes of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.460
 match is wrong only when you will have a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.770
 line of videos online 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.600
 it will be necessary that we send a 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.640
 message saying that my your video is 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.080
 put online manage the voice I do not 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.970
 will not cause it because it's a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.110
 surprise the press and more the contest 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.869
 it goes a little to the trap so I'm going 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 noted on horse behavior 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.960

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.390
 noted the commands and riders were 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.160
 dug up on their lands to find out 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.780
