 ride that dream team in fifa 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.080
 then complications with the fifa staff 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.039
 with the purchase as well as being very cheap 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.650
 trustworthy 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.150
 Laíse use the code for more than 8% 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.400
 discount 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.199
 and there everything is right here I heard 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.140
 talk and welcome the eighth episode 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.689
 she would be betting pay the bbva league 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.940
 the spanish championship 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.430
 our last episode I ended up taking and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.980
 two defeats and only one win 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.410
 get the gameiro there in the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.239
 because I thought the rest 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.040
 Rodrigues although it was very good to come back 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.050
 a little physical strength 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.420
 missing a bit of header and a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.219
 a little more of one of the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.230
 by the way let's say that way 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.120
 so I ended up betting high 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 very high that could also lose 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.199
 lost rodrigues to put the keeper 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.809
 of a team so that in the next match 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.149
 could place bet on the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.280
 reality the Diego coast that our 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.950
 next bet and for 10 cas 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.990
 our first opponent today is the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.689
 vicente ferreira worth 10 case diego 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.090
 coast and see with the biptel team with 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.970
 meton soares willian fernandinho is not 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.460
 or ramires purchase and david luiz finally the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.070
 everybody good and best publisher 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.810
 daniel and just three minutes adryan 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.430
 dominated and hit the goalkeeper's exit 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.259
 peter cech for him to get our 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.540
 first goal in two minutes then 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.220
 vicente came up 8 rebated I found 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.920
 that the danger of leaving 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.409
 Only then are we going to be crazy, I 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.280
 and we ended up taking the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.220
 draw 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.710
 oier that player there on silver Sunday 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.000
 indicates non-rare silver of a dry cut 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.680
 He left the goalkeeper one defender 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 talking alone to get to the second 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.540
 goal and a and benzema with all its class 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.950
 just dominated and hit there in the corner 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.509
 indefensible 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.030
 suárez tried to score a goal for 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.180
 coverage these saw the ball over 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.740
 left ahead and ended up crossing 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.020
 he designed the ball, he ended up passing by 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.420
 under the leg of the Czech pilot 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.009
 I left the replay there but that was it 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.890
 We happened to make the fourth goal 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.010
 suarez next made the painting there to 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.470
 make three goals 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.629
 him and he needed this game a lot 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.450
 However, it was up and adrán made our 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.620
 fifth goal before the end of the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.510
 was going to leave it cheap 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.659
 placed in front nanni hit the ball 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.579
 left in the reader and fortunately thanks to 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.739
 God the judge whistled for him to reach the 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.659
 our our first win in a video 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.879
 today got eight kicks on target and 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.099
 stayed with 5 where I made four goals 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.470
 we were also there with 82% of passes 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.980
 correct while he was 71% and 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.799
 then we put Diego Costa now without 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.950
 have a very respectful attack with 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.650
 benzema and diego costa I'm sure 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.720
 will yield much fruit for many goals 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.909
 that we can follow here in the series to 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.620
 Our second bet is on the rains. 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.139
 that worth three cases against gabriel 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.889
 Mayan it comes with this timaço around the 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:05.769
 bundesliga with lewandowski the myth god 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:08.440
 dogs that are also aubameyang in the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.540
 ahead 27 minutes into the match 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.700
 I think it was the branch of law that won 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.810
 to our area header very well and 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.000
 people ended up taking the first goal 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.959
 diego costa has already started premiering 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.060
 making goal 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.129
 we got the equalizer in the 50th minute 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.040
 there is not much to see this difficult game 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.109
 too much gabriel played too much and then 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.199
 benzema dominated put in front and 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.690
 benzema does not play in country 2 to 1 service 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.459
 For us, the band also received 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.760
 he put on the front as well as benzema 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.849
 and burst his foot to make 2 to 2 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.340
 already in overtime loss took the rebound and 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.470
 My goodness is outside the area. 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.660
 was in the box and at 120 minutes was already 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.849
 finished even tried to give a cart 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.829
 there's a horrible little thing with a 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.260
 goalkeeper as I often do 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.190
 people ended up taking 4 to 2 he even asked 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.299
 Calm down, sure, Gabriel, thanks for the game. 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.000
 we were then there with five kicks 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.510
 Nordic with six kicks we were 82% 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.750
 of Easter he got 70% being like this 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.979
 the big iran other that made the goal and had 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.069
 who left scored in the first match 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:15.819
 had to leave to give place to the spirit 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.409
 and a rare bronze Mexican player who 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.269
 play on the video is real 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:21.010
 Let's go to the last game of this game. 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.120
 episode with a side fringe 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.330
 rare silver law 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.199
 against the bial ap by biel ap for three 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.570
 cas 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.090
 he had this thimble and the bundesliga only 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.300
 very good times playing there the episode of 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.160
 today and at 21 minutes benzema pitching is 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.970
 see that player who entered our 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.040
 team 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.710
 in the past episode he gave the pass to 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.479
 diego costa make the only goal of the match 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.580
 we became aware five kicks in goal 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.010
 on target and got six kicks on target 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.550
 justified with 82% of pasqua says 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.050
 while he was 79 and so 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.940
 we can then put incidentally is the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.400
 left side not right sorry 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.100
 people when we can then put the 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.310
 ruan fran our statistics we have to 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:08.240
 Law 24 needs to be posted 16 expired eight 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:11.030
 requests 69 cases won 38 p 38 lost 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.190
 which gives a balance of 31 houses 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.139
 I do not know if you have accompanied ii 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.150
 but we've lost a lot of matches 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.910
 practically we have practically no 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.760
 then we have a lost game every 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.520
 episode as if basically throughout the 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.789
 episode and the two matches and we lose 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.039
 we lost one and we agreed there 's a lot 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.289
 cool since maybe that makes a great and 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.760
 already has two matches and win the two 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.500
 other matches to be able to do 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.250
 upgrade so let's see how it is 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.860
 that skating and a lot is at the beginning 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.840
 and not even in the middle of the series 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.639
 our team so today we managed to 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.710
 put the diego coast which is one more 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.599
 player of another rare one that even 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.310
 Play just there to losing 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.020
 put the iff place of it we will not go 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.729
 download because it is excellent 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.039
 also since they have the company of the 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.470
 benzema and cajias also in these 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.849
 positions are not even changed 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.280
 that we miss 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.110
 only three positions are missing for 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.780
 we put the rare gold team for the 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.849
 except the right-back there we have 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.440
 to upgrade silver not infrequently 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.380
 say so in this people can win 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.510
 all matches and then on the crossbar 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.560
 left only one game to reach the 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.150
 gold not uncommon 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.099
 already in the middle of the field the situation also 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.680
 intense and they have to rise to gold 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.560
 silver often after rare silver and the 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.750
 this power to rise to gold not uncommon 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.740
 When are we going to get into the 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.450
 series 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.039
 I think now with Diego Costa in 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.590
 Benzema front will stay a little bit 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:38.290
 easier our work 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.240
 if you liked then leave the joinha to
