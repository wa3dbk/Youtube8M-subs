00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.429
 Press conferences are by the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.230
 gamescom is running and we can 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.969
 foreplay announcements no longer 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.470
 save halli hello internet i am 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.119
 Michael Obermeier and that are the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.119
 gamescom news from wednesday 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.500
 It started with the press conferences 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.240
 yesterday with microsoft and there with a 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.189
 announcement not necessarily only 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.530
 has been positively accepted 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.970
 rise of the tomb raider the next 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.790
 game by crystal dynamics is the tomb 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.280
 raider's main series will be exclusive to xbox 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.930
 One will appear that you have in one 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.460
 admitted something very shabby 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.019
 Presentation on the xbox 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.910
 there was a press conference 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.040
 namely only three images from the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.690
 tomb raider render trailer from the e3 too 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.280
 see and all this story 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.600
 wanting the thing exclusively for the xbox 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.309
 it almost fell in the middle 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.539
 subordinate clause 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.699
 Corroded accordingly is the tomb 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.890
 raider community especially the part of 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.719
 no one has xbox one at home though 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.100
 fear not crystal dynamics has 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.960
 in an official position 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.580
 practical tips given what you can do 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.080
 We could do that, we can 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.700
 example simply lara croft in the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.590
 temple of fire is so that tomb raider 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.570
 spin on buy that is there for 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.460
 all platforms or and that I drink 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.110
 not me out of the old one 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.110
 tomb raider play how about it 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.750
 the highlight of the microsoft show was 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.490
 Clearly the gameplay presentation of 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.320
 Quantum break and that 's on the big one 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.090
 all that we have already thought 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.210
 namely a mix of max payne and 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.680
 alan wake say a very nice cover 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.680
 shooter with time manipulation 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.329
 sony was not the only one 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.920
 game scenes from platform so the new 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.289
 play the dark souls macher to see 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.450
 but also a huge surprise 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.280
 Suddenly the hall of the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.409
 project manager of daisy on the stage 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.909
 has announced that daisy next to the pc 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.780
 now also for the playstation 4 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.250
 will appear 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.860
 besides, one works on a new one 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.290
 rendering engine the two version so 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.980
 where the pc so the ps4 version prettier 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.200
 to do 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.420
 unclear is what that is for h1n1 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.129
 So the sony's own daisy clown 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.180
 means of which one has namely the 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.920
 All day then nothing more heard 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.349
 the kreml this time that himself 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.030
 surpassed video kojima the man behind 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.650
 Of course, metal gear was also on the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.959
 gamescom sony-press conference and has 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.360
 At first only a harmless game scene 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.739
 from metal gear solid 5 presented there 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.420
 It was about the snack in this 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.579
 cardboard box sits in the then one 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.049
 surprising content in it is then 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.459
 the coach have always deducted 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.500
 As I said here, incidentally, has even 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.060
 nothing to do with china look here so 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.859
 a little teaser for a horror game 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.440
 can you download now on psn 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.549
 Try it now and startle 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.930
 but you sometimes have a bit has nothing 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.760
 to do with china is not that her 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.829
 some people think that 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.139
 let things get scared down 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.030
 and if you like the whole thing then 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.980
 you really only come to the end 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.109
 on the croup of a thing for how 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.639
 Metal gear is in the box 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.280
 Surprising in it is the whole 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:15.519
 namely a playable teaser too silent 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.959
 Hill's his new silent hill game 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.030
 Do not do the cosima with anyone here 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.220
 lesser than gilliam model toro 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.090
 together and the main role is played by the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.090
 walking dead star norman reedus 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.090
 donnerwetter 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.500
 not so complicated but always 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.599
 still surprising was the announcement 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.969
 that's the new one 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.799
 game of ninja theory and not just the 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.090
 figure in the trailer but also the 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.739
 title lay journal 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.489
 this will be a continuation to 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.489
 playstation classic 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.210
 And Michelle was on stage too 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.610
 but not in his function this time 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.710
 as ubisoft man but as the boss of his 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.570
 new indie studios wild sheep and such 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.160
 is also the game that made that there 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.810
 that's not so far that's just it 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.030
 wild and it is the sheer madness of the 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.430
 play surface of this survival mmo 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.140
 in fact, that of the whole of europe 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.690
 correspond and you can also there 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.980
 every creature in the game too 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.470
 press release is in it 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.450
 yes you can also play a trout 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.070
 what exactly does the trout do when that 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.690
 Whole comes out what I sell Michael 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.400
 actually thought it would be us 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.240
 hopefully soon they say are in fact 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.240
 very much looking forward to it 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.149
 And even if the games announcement 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.819
 It was pretty cool then 

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:41.860
 a feature that really everyone in the room 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:45.159
 Surprised was the new cher 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.839
 play that comes with system update 2.0 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.270
 the playstation 4 and works that way 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:51.459
 Playstation Plus owners can all 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.649
 games that you own with you 

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:55.089
 other ps plus players are sharing this 

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:57.309
 means I can now via internet 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:58.839
 Invite someone to a ps plus 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:59.409
 play a playstation 4 game 

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:01.300
 play 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.889
 I can either watch or I can 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.050
 can you still invite a cooperative 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.430
 or competitive multiplayer 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.830
 play along and the other has to do that 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.180
 do not own a game he does not have to 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.499
 have downloaded the whole 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.389
 somehow works via streaming 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:15.610
 am very curious what in practice 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.709
 In any case, there was standing 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.709
 ovations pretty cool in the room 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.669
 Last but not least, then came 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:29.319
 electronic arts with the press conference 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.479
 and there was clearly the highlight 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.999
 federal it that he was already a long time 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.830
 been said in the run-up to the 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.689
 is the new game of bioware more accurate 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.419
 said bioware austin and it's one 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:42.279
 online action role-playing that follows 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.110
 a now very trendy principle 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.270
 namely the fell against 1 principle 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.909
 four heroes of light fight against 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.069
 a skull is a dungeon 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.409
 Master of the player as a jailer 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:55.650
 which monster on the neck rushes and 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.900
 they fall nasty in front of the lump bangs 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.669
 there were first scenes in the trailer too 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.259
 you can see that too 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.699
 convince yourself like the whole game 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.229
 it will be no man at the fair 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.849
 namely, you can allude to yourself 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.199
 also on the official website for 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.990
 register alpha test 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.360
 which was a bit strange to me 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.580
 bioware has ridiculously often mentioned that 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.289
 the whole guaranteed story has it 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.520
 really has a biogas sorry we say it 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.189
 you are real story 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.259
 that happened a bit too often than that 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:26.310
 you should not be suspicious 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.779
 but wait and see 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.520
 that was quite a lot now and that 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.080
 is only the first day of the fair but 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.550
 now that's done and no matter if 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.169
 now sitting in front of the screen at home 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.669
 or on the gamescom bike i say 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.669
 continue to play
