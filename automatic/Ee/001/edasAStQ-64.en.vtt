00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
interact with the things in the building

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.050 
interact with the things in the building
maybe<00:01:42.750> read<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> book<00:01:43.470> build<00:01:43.980> a<00:01:44.100> fire<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.550> just

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
maybe read a book build a fire or just

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.670 
maybe read a book build a fire or just
chill<00:01:45.240> out<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> bit<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.080> your<00:01:46.380> bodies

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

naked<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.700> bathing<00:01:47.910> area<00:01:48.390> my<00:01:49.020> only

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
naked in the bathing area my only

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
naked in the bathing area my only
criticism<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.860> far<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.670> items<00:01:50.910> are

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
criticism so far is that the items are

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.060 
criticism so far is that the items are
slightly<00:01:51.540> clustered<00:01:52.050> so<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.680> easy<00:01:52.920> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
slightly clustered so it's easy to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.010 
slightly clustered so it's easy to
trigger<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.640> wrong<00:01:53.850> thing<00:01:54.120> especially<00:01:54.510> if

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
trigger the wrong thing especially if

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
trigger the wrong thing especially if
you<00:01:55.170> turn<00:01:55.380> your<00:01:55.530> hood<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.310> your<00:01:56.460> video

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you turn your hood off so your video

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.340 
you turn your hood off so your video
look<00:01:56.880> slightly<00:01:57.150> prettier<00:01:57.720> for<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.990> people

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
look slightly prettier for the people

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.230 
look slightly prettier for the people
watching<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.860> triggering<00:01:59.640> two<00:01:59.820> or<00:02:00.000> more

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
watching it triggering two or more

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.210 
watching it triggering two or more
animations<00:02:00.840> at<00:02:01.050> once<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.620> lead<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.010> some

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
animations at once can lead to some

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.740 
animations at once can lead to some
books<00:02:02.490> something<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:03.030> maundy<00:02:03.330> fell<00:02:03.480> apart

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
books something the maundy fell apart

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.110 
books something the maundy fell apart
did<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.260> about<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.800> because<00:02:05.550> my<00:02:05.580> hood<00:02:05.940> was

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
did one about and because my hood was

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.730 
did one about and because my hood was
turned<00:02:06.360> off<00:02:06.570> something<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:06.990> experienced

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
turned off something I experienced

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.590
