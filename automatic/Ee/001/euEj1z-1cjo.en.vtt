00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.020
 hello everyone good 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.000
 I want to tell you that I am very happy 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.170
 because I'm going to do my first video on 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.180
 youtube and I started thinking good I have 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.840
 many cans that I can make I 'm going to 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.560
 throw away or recycle and I can 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.890
 I said I have a tablecloth of sticks 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.200
 bamboo I can make with my tablecloth 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.590
 bamboo sticks and with my good can 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.440
 I have this can that I bought 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.360
 a few chocolate sticks and not the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.930
 I want to throw it away I also have 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.630
 this other and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.200
 Honey sachets came but I'm going to 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.650
 need at this moment only is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.290
 and this is the milestone tablecloth that I am 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.670
 speaking I think it has very colorful 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.660
 pretty 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 we are going to need resistol or glue or 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.790
 rubber scissors and only good what 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.620
 let's do let's take the lid off 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.480
 then 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.480
 let's measure 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.310
 you have to go calculating 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.340
 the perfect point 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.340
 good 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.430
 and do not be afraid the only thing they have 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.430
 what to do is cut it 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.810
 very slowly because that they are like 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.409
 cooked and if they do it very hard they are 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.670
 it's going to break 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.670
 they have to cut it 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.030
 it does not matter if the first one took off 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.030
 there we go 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.470
 good 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.539
 outside 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.150
 or 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.410
 It is very easy to work with this material 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.410
 I used to think it was difficult 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.330
 just apply a little bit of pressure 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.150
 cut the three spaces 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.820
 the scissors if it has to be a scissor 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.820
 pretty tough 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.099
 because I remember what wood which 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.099
 we're 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.890
 the pieces that we need remove where 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.660
 is 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.410
 and so 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.410
 now 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.670
 glue 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.400
 the good thing about working with this material 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.000
 is that you can 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.990
 it does not matter if something is messy 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.990
 then it will be 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.430
 a pretty part 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.110
 clarita 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.990
 almost invisible 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.440
 to the tin 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.460
 and they can leave it and if they want to 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.460
 can apply 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.460
 quite 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.000
 Wait for three hours and you're ready 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.180
 can use of the rubber that is 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.520
 hot with the with the gun 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.160
 silicone but I prefer to do it that way 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.130
 simpler and if they want to clean it 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:34.340
 after his little can only do it with 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.340
 a milestone tablecloth and already 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:42.520
 you can not wash it with water 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.520
 because then if they would not be 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.380
 how are you looking 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.900
 perfect good in this case for question 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.669
 of time 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.970
 you are the only thing they have to do 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.700
 if they are left like this is to press it and 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.190
 add him 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.690
 a little more glue on top not 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.690
 matter how is mine 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.920
 perfect and almost perfect 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.500
 good this 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.689
 you do not have to press 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.700
 only so 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:21.689
 and can control it 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.249
 A) Yes 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:28.009
 and here I have one already finished 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:31.379
 here where I have put some 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:34.030
 skewers and some 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:37.180
 makeup I have and you can 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.370
 use another type of cans so 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.949
 I hope you liked it and I hope 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.949
 in the next video thanks
