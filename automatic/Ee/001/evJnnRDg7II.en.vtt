00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
and here is the move but another know if

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.290 
and here is the move but another know if
you<00:02:19.850> can<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.330> logo<00:02:20.540> on<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:22.180> quite<00:02:23.180> an

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
you can see the logo on that quite an

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.180 
you can see the logo on that quite an
awkward<00:02:23.570> angle<00:02:24.520> or<00:02:25.520> anyway<00:02:26.590> let's<00:02:27.590> fit<00:02:28.070> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
awkward angle or anyway let's fit the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:37.110 
awkward angle or anyway let's fit the
motion<00:02:28.520> controller<00:02:28.850> in<00:02:32.890> let's<00:02:33.890> do<00:02:34.190> this

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.400 

wooden<00:02:38.120> will<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.330> face<00:02:38.510> matches<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.170> exact

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
wooden will you face matches the exact

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.370 
wooden will you face matches the exact
color<00:02:39.560> it's<00:02:40.100> quite<00:02:40.280> nice<00:02:40.750> now<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.900> sits<00:02:42.200> in

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
color it's quite nice now that sits in

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.350 
color it's quite nice now that sits in
there<00:02:42.560> I'll<00:02:42.860> probably<00:02:43.580> undo<00:02:43.970> this<00:02:44.120> later

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
there I'll probably undo this later

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.670 
there I'll probably undo this later
because<00:02:44.630> if<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:44.900> don't<00:02:44.990> really<00:02:45.140> need<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.470> hold

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
because if you don't really need to hold

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.610 
because if you don't really need to hold
that<00:02:45.770> do<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:45.980> while<00:02:46.370> you're<00:02:46.520> holding<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.850> gun

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
that do you while you're holding a gun

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.280 
that do you while you're holding a gun
navigation<00:02:48.620> controller<00:02:52.750> there<00:02:53.750> we<00:02:54.050> go<00:02:54.260> again

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290

right so first of all this is pump

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.890 
right so first of all this is pump
action<00:03:03.680> which<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.760> quite<00:03:04.910> useful<00:03:05.120> feature<00:03:05.510> I

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
action which is quite useful feature I

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.180 
action which is quite useful feature I
think<00:03:06.800> and<00:03:07.060> here<00:03:08.500> depending<00:03:09.500> on<00:03:09.500> how<00:03:10.010> long
