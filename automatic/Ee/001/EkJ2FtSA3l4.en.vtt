00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:03.440 
okay this is our homemade doom buggy

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.720 
okay this is our homemade doom buggy
it's<00:00:04.440> made<00:00:04.799> out<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:06.049> hydraulic<00:00:07.049> tubing<00:00:07.730> so

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
it's made out of hydraulic tubing so

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.999 
it's made out of hydraulic tubing so
it's<00:00:08.880> really<00:00:09.150> tough<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:10.400> long<00:00:11.400> frame<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.240> it

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
it's really tough a long frame on it

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.099 
it's really tough a long frame on it
when<00:00:14.009> we<00:00:14.190> started<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.700> build<00:00:14.910> us<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.929> was

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
when we started to build us it was

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.769 
when we started to build us it was
actually<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.710> foot<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.310> half<00:00:17.340> shorter<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:18.720> I

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
actually a foot and a half shorter but I

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.950 
actually a foot and a half shorter but I
grew<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.680> put<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> foot<00:00:20.279> into<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.689> cut

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
grew and we put a foot into it just cut

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.269 
grew and we put a foot into it just cut
it<00:00:22.050> down<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.680> sides<00:00:24.199> great<00:00:25.199> about<00:00:25.529> here<00:00:26.250> i

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
it down the sides great about here i

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.419 
it down the sides great about here i
think<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.260> we<00:00:28.260> put<00:00:28.500> half<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> foot<00:00:29.250> in

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
think it was and we put half a foot in

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.810 
think it was and we put half a foot in
and<00:00:29.699> took<00:00:30.599> time<00:00:31.289> off<00:00:31.500> from<00:00:31.740> fixing<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and took time off from fixing and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.620 
and took time off from fixing and
building<00:00:33.180> stuff<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.850> i<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:36.390> in

building stuff on to it and i get in
again<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.230> had<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> put<00:00:37.500> another<00:00:37.680> foot<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.129> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.299 
again we had to put another foot in that
saw<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:40.940> shocks<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> back<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.160> don't<00:00:44.160> like

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
saw the shocks on the back I don't like

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.799 
saw the shocks on the back I don't like
how<00:00:44.489> they're<00:00:44.610> set<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:44.910> how<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.270> got<00:00:45.539> them<00:00:45.719> in

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
how they're set up how we got them in

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.049 
how they're set up how we got them in
there<00:00:46.020> right<00:00:46.680> now<00:00:46.890> we're<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.430> piecing<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
there right now we're just piecing it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
there right now we're just piecing it
together<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.690> once<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.410> together

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
together and once it's all together

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
together and once it's all together
we're<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> take<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.190> apart<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.640> blast

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
we're going to take it apart and blast

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.220 
we're going to take it apart and blast
it<00:00:51.719> all<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.199> paint<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.120> has<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.230> gravity-fed

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it all and paint it it has a gravity-fed

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.099 
it all and paint it it has a gravity-fed
gas<00:00:56.219> tank<00:00:56.550> right<00:00:56.760> now<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.449> depends<00:00:57.960> how<00:00:58.050> we

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
gas tank right now but depends how we

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.630 
gas tank right now but depends how we
set<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.800> might<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.190> might<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> get

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
set it up it might we might have to get

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.860 
set it up it might we might have to get
a<00:00:59.699> pump<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.829> think<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.129> 5-gallon<00:01:03.090> tank

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
a pump I think it's like a 5-gallon tank

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.750 
a pump I think it's like a 5-gallon tank
or<00:01:04.080> something<00:01:04.350> there's<00:01:04.860> foam<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.519> though

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
or something there's foam in it though

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.480 
or something there's foam in it though
so<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.299> cracks<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> rock<00:01:07.680> hits<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> bust

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so it cracks or a rock hits in the bust

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.820 
so it cracks or a rock hits in the bust
the<00:01:09.270> gas<00:01:09.479> gets<00:01:09.780> soaked<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.290> by<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> foam

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the gas gets soaked up by the foam

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.240 
the gas gets soaked up by the foam
inside<00:01:12.500> steering<00:01:13.500> wheels<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.979> holding

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
inside steering wheels kind of holding

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.030 
inside steering wheels kind of holding
it<00:01:14.369> right<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.290> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.470> first<00:01:16.650> earring

it right there but on the first earring

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.609 
it right there but on the first earring

challenger wheel or something in the 70s
early<00:01:23.070> seventies<00:01:25.250> we<00:01:26.250> brought<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
early seventies we brought it down to I

don't know place that does stuff with

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.800 
don't know place that does stuff with
metal<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.530> got<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.220> put<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.810> quick

to a three speed with a shifter for like

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.009 
to a three speed with a shifter for like
a<00:02:30.790> hand<00:02:31.090> shifter<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:32.349> has<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:33.450> 250<00:02:34.450> moto<00:02:34.659> for

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
engine in it it has high mole and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.910 
engine in it it has high mole and
reversing<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.719> a<00:02:40.870> five<00:02:41.109> speed<00:02:41.439> but<00:02:41.739> we're

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
reversing it it's a five speed but we're

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.879 
reversing it it's a five speed but we're
