air<00:00:48.309> filter<00:00:48.760> but<00:00:49.690> other<00:00:49.840> than<00:00:49.930> that<00:00:50.020> it<00:00:50.590> was

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
air filter but other than that it was

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.990

pretty much stock in the 23 cc motor

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.780 
pretty much stock in the 23 cc motor
there<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.559> oh<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:56.890> they<00:00:57.010> had<00:00:57.130> a<00:00:57.160> tee<00:00:57.430> speed

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
there and oh and they had a tee speed

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.660 
there and oh and they had a tee speed
key<00:00:58.660> speed<00:00:58.930> on<00:00:59.079> it<00:00:59.230> so<00:00:59.469> what<00:00:59.980> I've<00:01:00.130> done<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.430> I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
key speed on it so what I've done is I

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.749 
key speed on it so what I've done is I
converted<00:01:01.540> that<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:02.399> 10<00:01:03.399> SS<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:05.019> so<00:01:06.009> I<00:01:07.380> just

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
converted that to 10 SS and so I just

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.419 
converted that to 10 SS and so I just
the<00:01:09.759> first<00:01:09.999> thing<00:01:10.329> that<00:01:10.389> I<00:01:11.319> did<00:01:11.409> was<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:11.920> just<00:01:11.979> I

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
the first thing that I did was I just I

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:20.489

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
got a 26 CC fuelie motor and I put the

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:23.190 
got a 26 CC fuelie motor and I put the
the<00:01:20.529> oh<00:01:20.859> you<00:01:21.459> know<00:01:21.549> cone<00:01:21.789> filter<00:01:22.090> back<00:01:22.840> up<00:01:23.020> on
