folder will just be called online you
can<00:04:15.230> probably<00:04:15.520> and<00:04:16.520> then<00:04:16.670> it'll<00:04:16.910> be<00:04:17.120> this

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
can probably and then it'll be this

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.590 
can probably and then it'll be this
right<00:04:17.570> here<00:04:17.900> I<00:04:18.230> named<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:19.750> 549<00:04:20.750> si<00:04:21.140> si<00:04:21.320> si<00:04:21.500> si<00:04:21.680> si

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
right here I named it 549 si si si si si

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.050 
right here I named it 549 si si si si si
si<00:04:23.600> si<00:04:23.810> si<00:04:24.080> si<00:04:24.230> whatever<00:04:24.920> and<00:04:25.340> then<00:04:25.820> it'll<00:04:26.000> be

si si si si whatever and then it'll be

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.820 
si si si si whatever and then it'll be
another<00:04:26.300> one<00:04:26.450> called<00:04:26.690> build<00:04:26.990> files<00:04:27.320> and<00:04:27.680> it'll

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
another one called build files and it'll

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.540 
another one called build files and it'll
have<00:04:27.920> content<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.120> can<00:04:29.270> see<00:04:29.510> that<00:04:30.040> my<00:04:31.040> ESP

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
have content and you can see that my ESP

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.500 
have content and you can see that my ESP
plugins<00:04:32.060> right<00:04:32.270> there

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.320 

so<00:04:36.510> that's<00:04:36.720> how<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:36.960> take<00:04:37.110> that's<00:04:38.100> just<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.520> PC

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
so that's how you take that's just a PC

I've<00:04:51.990> been<00:04:52.200> doing<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:52.560> long<00:04:52.830> enough<00:04:52.860> to

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
I've been doing this long enough to

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.640 
I've been doing this long enough to
figure<00:04:53.520> that<00:04:53.820> out<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:56.660> that's<00:04:57.660> about<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.200> if

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
figure that out and that's about it if

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.030 
figure that out and that's about it if
you<00:04:58.920> can<00:04:59.130> save<00:04:59.640> it<00:04:59.850> or<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:00.120> can<00:05:00.270> just<00:05:00.920> exit<00:05:01.920> out

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
you can save it or you can just exit out

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.330 
you can save it or you can just exit out
say<00:05:02.400> no<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:03.300> won't<00:05:03.600> save<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.140> X<00:05:04.380> less<00:05:04.680> file<00:05:05.010> but

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
say no it won't save the X less file but

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.280 
say no it won't save the X less file but
you'll<00:05:05.460> still<00:05:05.670> have<00:05:05.820> your<00:05:05.880> built<00:05:06.750> mod<00:05:06.990> right

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
you'll still have your built mod right

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.790 
you'll still have your built mod right
there<00:05:09.230> and<00:05:10.230> that<00:05:10.440> should<00:05:10.860> just<00:05:10.890> about<00:05:11.310> do<00:05:11.760> it
