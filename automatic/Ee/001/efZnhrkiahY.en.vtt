so<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.470> combine<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.860> weapons<00:01:44.100> together

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
so you can combine the weapons together

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.639 
so you can combine the weapons together
this<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.329> something<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.600> started<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.049> want<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
this is something that started I want to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.649 
this is something that started I want to
say<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.460> prime<00:01:47.700> cyberverse<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.509> whole

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
say in the prime cyberverse this whole

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.020 
say in the prime cyberverse this whole
like<00:01:48.810> merging<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.350> weapons<00:01:49.680> thing<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
like merging of weapons thing and it's a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.999 
like merging of weapons thing and it's a
cool<00:01:51.210> gimmick<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.689> uses<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> unified<00:01:52.590> peg<00:01:52.829> hole

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
cool gimmick it uses a unified peg hole

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.179 
cool gimmick it uses a unified peg hole
system<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.549> neat<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.720> also

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
system it's neat and it's also

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.420 
system it's neat and it's also
forgettable

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
forgettable

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.880

really made me say what a cool toy was

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.870 
really made me say what a cool toy was
his<00:02:01.140> transformation<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.100> let's<00:02:02.310> get<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
his transformation so let's get to that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.740 
his transformation so let's get to that
right<00:02:03.810> now<00:02:07.459> where's<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.700> music<00:02:09.090> oh<00:02:09.119> yeah

right we're doing it this way okay so

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.650 
right we're doing it this way okay so
transforming<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.540> guy<00:02:12.720> is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
transforming this guy is

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.500 
transforming this guy is
is<00:02:14.070> quite<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.100> pleasure<00:02:15.580> especially<00:02:15.970> for<00:02:16.180> a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
is quite a pleasure especially for a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.390 
is quite a pleasure especially for a
cyberverse<00:02:17.110> legion<00:02:17.170> toy<00:02:17.680> that's<00:02:18.070> where<00:02:18.280> this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
cyberverse legion toy that's where this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.700 
cyberverse legion toy that's where this
guy's<00:02:18.580> engineering<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.450> really<00:02:19.720> shines

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
guy's engineering I think really shines

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.280 
guy's engineering I think really shines
and<00:02:21.010> comes<00:02:21.310> out<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.760> shows<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:22.900> who<00:02:23.110> it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
and comes out and shows you just who it

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.530 
and comes out and shows you just who it
is<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:24.430> first<00:02:24.640> cool<00:02:24.820> thing<00:02:25.030> aside<00:02:25.270> from<00:02:25.390> this

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
is the first cool thing aside from this

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.560 
is the first cool thing aside from this
like<00:02:25.750> massive<00:02:26.170> flip<00:02:26.710> over<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.570> this

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
like massive flip over is that this

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.540 
like massive flip over is that this
thing<00:02:28.780> locks<00:02:29.080> in<00:02:29.380> real<00:02:30.100> solid<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:30.970> uh<00:02:32.550> his

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
thing locks in real solid like uh his

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.640 
thing locks in real solid like uh his
feet<00:02:33.850> are<00:02:34.000> kind<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.300> huge<00:02:34.630> they're<00:02:35.380> kind<00:02:35.620> of

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
feet are kind of huge they're kind of

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.070 
feet are kind of huge they're kind of
like<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.950> cyber<00:02:36.250> versus<00:02:36.610> bumblebee<00:02:36.970> legs<00:02:37.840> and

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
like the cyber versus bumblebee legs and

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.070 
like the cyber versus bumblebee legs and
feet<00:02:38.320> in<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:39.070> there's<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.490> major<00:02:40.390> curvature

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
feet in that there's a major curvature

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.810 
feet in that there's a major curvature
and<00:02:41.290> there's<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.710> huge<00:02:42.130> flat<00:02:42.460> part<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
and there's a huge flat part in the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.280 
and there's a huge flat part in the
bottom<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.210> then<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:43.420> weird<00:02:43.630> gap<00:02:44.020> if<00:02:44.230> you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
bottom and then this weird gap if you

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.320 
bottom and then this weird gap if you
start<00:02:44.530> trying<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:44.830> use<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.280> fake<00:02:45.970> ankle

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
start trying to use the fake ankle

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.570 
start trying to use the fake ankle
joints<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.200> know<00:02:47.410> what<00:02:47.620> maybe<00:02:48.250> just<00:02:48.550> just

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
joints so you know what maybe just just

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.580 
joints so you know what maybe just just
leave<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.000> alone<00:02:49.060> for<00:02:49.330> now<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:50.110> real<00:02:50.350> magic

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
leave that alone for now the real magic

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.060 
leave that alone for now the real magic
is<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.820> rest<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.270> this<00:02:52.480> stuff<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.710> up<00:02:53.830> here

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
is the rest of this stuff so up here

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.390 
is the rest of this stuff so up here
you've<00:02:54.250> got<00:02:54.490> this<00:02:55.500> split<00:02:56.500> down<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.950> top<00:02:57.280> of

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
you've got this split down the top of

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.670 
you've got this split down the top of
the<00:02:57.460> roof<00:02:57.670> yeah<00:02:58.420> pull<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:58.960> apart<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.410> we'll

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
the roof yeah pull that apart and we'll

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.590 
the roof yeah pull that apart and we'll
stir<00:02:59.920> doing<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.460> you're<00:03:00.670> also<00:03:00.820> noticing<00:03:01.450> hey

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
stir doing so you're also noticing hey

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.050 
stir doing so you're also noticing hey
it's<00:03:01.750> connected<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.440> doors<00:03:02.710> these<00:03:03.670> doors

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
it's connected to the doors these doors

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.330 
it's connected to the doors these doors
are<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.510> think<00:03:04.930> where<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.560> bulk<00:03:05.740> of<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.950> magic

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
are I think where the bulk of the magic

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.820 
are I think where the bulk of the magic
is<00:03:06.550> because<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.750> way<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.050> this<00:03:08.230> arm<00:03:08.500> works

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
is because the way that this arm works

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.830 
is because the way that this arm works
is<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.130> swing<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.550> around<00:03:09.640> here<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.240> then<00:03:10.720> it

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
is you swing it around here and then it

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.900 
is you swing it around here and then it
really<00:03:11.200> solidly<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.280> it's<00:03:12.490> not<00:03:12.670> like

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
really solidly and and it's not like

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.010 
really solidly and and it's not like
this<00:03:13.090> out<00:03:13.210> of<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.390> package<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.750> actually

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
this out of the package you actually

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.150 
this out of the package you actually
have<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.200> tweak<00:03:14.440> this<00:03:14.620> once<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:14.890> open<00:03:15.070> this

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
have to tweak this once you open this

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.530 
have to tweak this once you open this
guy<00:03:15.310> up<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:16.030> clicks<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.800> super<00:03:17.800> damn<00:03:18.010> tight

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
guy up it clicks in super damn tight

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.480 
guy up it clicks in super damn tight
thanks<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> little<00:03:19.900> lip<00:03:20.560> on<00:03:20.770> this<00:03:21.220> gray

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
mean if I yank down on it yeah it's

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.560 
mean if I yank down on it yeah it's
gonna<00:03:26.500> come<00:03:26.680> apart<00:03:26.800> I'm<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.160> I'm<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.790> grown<00:03:28.209> dude

gonna come apart I'm a I'm a grown dude

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.400 
gonna come apart I'm a I'm a grown dude
but<00:03:29.020> a<00:03:29.940> little<00:03:30.940> clique<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.540> friction<00:03:32.260> is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
but a little clique of friction is

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.800 
but a little clique of friction is
really<00:03:32.740> helpful<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.340> then<00:03:33.880> it's<00:03:34.270> topped<00:03:34.600> off

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
really helpful and then it's topped off

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.830 
really helpful and then it's topped off
by<00:03:34.870> when<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.650> fold<00:03:36.190> this<00:03:36.340> door<00:03:36.520> forward<00:03:36.880> this

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
by when you fold this door forward this

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.020 
by when you fold this door forward this
thing<00:03:38.140> is<00:03:38.260> cut<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.800> fit<00:03:38.830> into<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.490> gap<00:03:39.790> between

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
thing is cut to fit into the gap between

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.570 
thing is cut to fit into the gap between
the<00:03:40.450> wheel<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:42.630> arced<00:03:43.630> part<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.410> car<00:03:44.860> hood

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
the wheel and the arced part of car hood

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.800 
the wheel and the arced part of car hood
I<00:03:45.910> know<00:03:46.510> cars<00:03:47.080> and<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:48.070> doesn't<00:03:48.700> click<00:03:49.000> in<00:03:49.239> but

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
I know cars and it doesn't click in but

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.750 
I know cars and it doesn't click in but
if<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.020> get<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.470> wheel<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:51.340> know<00:03:51.430> hold<00:03:51.640> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
if you get the wheel you know hold the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.949 
if you get the wheel you know hold the
wheel<00:03:51.880> down<00:03:52.120> here<00:03:52.480> because<00:03:52.570> it's<00:03:52.750> kind<00:03:52.870> of

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
wheel down here because it's kind of

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.050 
wheel down here because it's kind of
jostling<00:03:53.470> around<00:03:53.560> on<00:03:53.830> its<00:03:53.980> axle<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.489> just

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
jostling around on its axle and just

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.290 
jostling around on its axle and just
push<00:03:55.239> this<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.959> leave<00:03:56.770> things<00:03:57.010> be<00:03:57.340> it's<00:03:58.239> a

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
push this in and leave things be it's a

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.729 
push this in and leave things be it's a
pretty<00:03:58.480> solid<00:03:58.690> connection<00:03:59.290> like<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.500> can<00:03:59.650> you

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
pretty solid connection like I can you

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.560 
pretty solid connection like I can you
can<00:03:59.890> waggle<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.340> arm<00:04:00.489> around<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:01.090> it's<00:04:01.390> not

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
can waggle the arm around and it's not

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.530 
can waggle the arm around and it's not
full<00:04:01.870> I'm<00:04:02.770> a<00:04:02.830> grown<00:04:03.220> man<00:04:03.520> yanking<00:04:04.030> on<00:04:04.150> this<00:04:04.330> arm

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
full I'm a grown man yanking on this arm

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.449 
full I'm a grown man yanking on this arm
anyway<00:04:05.050> it's<00:04:05.290> tighter<00:04:05.590> than<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.920> should<00:04:06.250> be<00:04:06.430> I

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
anyway it's tighter than it should be I

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.340 
anyway it's tighter than it should be I
think<00:04:06.610> it's<00:04:07.060> it's<00:04:07.270> tighter<00:04:07.510> than<00:04:07.690> by<00:04:08.170> all

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
think it's it's tighter than by all

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.290 
think it's it's tighter than by all
accounts<00:04:08.530> such<00:04:09.100> an<00:04:09.310> engineering<00:04:09.910> feat<00:04:10.150> on

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
accounts such an engineering feat on

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.210 
accounts such an engineering feat on
such<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.510> small<00:04:10.810> toy<00:04:11.020> should<00:04:11.320> turn<00:04:11.530> out<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:11.920> I

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
such a small toy should turn out and I

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.070 
such a small toy should turn out and I
was<00:04:12.400> verily<00:04:13.180> impressed<00:04:13.600> by<00:04:13.870> it

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
was verily impressed by it

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.880 
was verily impressed by it
and<00:04:14.820> this<00:04:15.820> is<00:04:15.940> all<00:04:16.060> topped<00:04:16.330> off<00:04:16.540> by<00:04:16.859> what<00:04:17.859> I

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
and this is all topped off by what I

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.979 
and this is all topped off by what I
deemed<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.280> be<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.430> cherry<00:04:18.850> on<00:04:18.940> top<00:04:19.060> that<00:04:19.780> is

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
deemed to be the cherry on top that is

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.529 
deemed to be the cherry on top that is
why<00:04:20.620> he<00:04:20.830> has<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.100> head<00:04:21.489> that's<00:04:21.940> not<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.300> cherry

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
why he has a head that's not the cherry

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.870 
why he has a head that's not the cherry
on<00:04:22.600> top<00:04:22.690> though<00:04:23.140> you<00:04:23.950> put<00:04:24.130> this<00:04:24.250> down<00:04:24.310> here<00:04:24.490> and

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
on top though you put this down here and

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.700 
on top though you put this down here and
then<00:04:25.120> when<00:04:25.210> you<00:04:25.300> fold<00:04:25.450> this<00:04:25.720> thing<00:04:25.780> down<00:04:26.200> if

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
then when you fold this thing down if

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.629 
then when you fold this thing down if
you<00:04:26.890> take<00:04:27.100> a<00:04:27.130> look

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
you take a look

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.710 
you take a look
at<00:04:27.789> where<00:04:28.629> there<00:04:28.990> are<00:04:29.199> ridges<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:30.039> nubs<00:04:30.819> there

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
at where there are ridges and nubs there

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.999 
at where there are ridges and nubs there
is<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:33.030> lack<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.060> focus<00:04:34.449> and<00:04:34.990> there's<00:04:35.680> also<00:04:35.830> a

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
is a lack of focus and there's also a

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.300 
is a lack of focus and there's also a
nub<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:37.419> goes<00:04:37.629> into<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.930> Ridge<00:04:38.259> that's<00:04:38.919> cut

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
nub that goes into a Ridge that's cut

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.089 
nub that goes into a Ridge that's cut
into<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.759> windshield<00:04:40.599> down<00:04:40.930> there<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:41.469> this

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
into the windshield down there and this

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:43.290 
into the windshield down there and this
is<00:04:42.189> kind<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.400> tricky<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.699> line<00:04:42.849> up<00:04:42.969> you<00:04:43.060> kind<00:04:43.240> of

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
is kind of tricky to line up you kind of

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.200 
is kind of tricky to line up you kind of
to<00:04:43.449> fold<00:04:43.689> this<00:04:43.780> out<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:44.020> bit<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.469> then<00:04:45.090> there<00:04:46.090> it

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
to fold this out a bit and then there it

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.969 
to fold this out a bit and then there it
is<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:47.020> this<00:04:47.199> thing's<00:04:47.409> all<00:04:47.560> locked<00:04:47.830> together

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
is so this thing's all locked together

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.499 
is so this thing's all locked together
and<00:04:48.340> with<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.580> one<00:04:48.699> locked<00:04:48.849> in<00:04:49.090> it's<00:04:49.240> now<00:04:49.360> in

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
and with that one locked in it's now in

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:50.640 
and with that one locked in it's now in
position<00:04:49.780> for<00:04:50.050> me<00:04:50.110> just<00:04:50.289> to<00:04:50.319> pull<00:04:50.469> this<00:04:50.590> down

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
position for me just to pull this down

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.670 
position for me just to pull this down
and<00:04:51.129> then<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:52.349> missed<00:04:53.349> it

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
and then I missed it

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.909 
and then I missed it
to<00:04:53.919> pull<00:04:54.099> this<00:04:54.250> down<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.849> then<00:04:55.000> uh<00:04:55.389> ah<00:04:55.919> there

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
to pull this down and then uh ah there

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.959 
to pull this down and then uh ah there
we<00:04:57.009> go<00:04:57.039> so<00:04:57.789> basically<00:04:58.740> this<00:04:59.740> is<00:04:59.800> super<00:05:00.759> tight

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
we go so basically this is super tight

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:05.490 
we go so basically this is super tight
now<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:03.270> it's<00:05:04.270> a<00:05:04.389> great<00:05:04.629> locking<00:05:05.020> mechanism

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
now and it's a great locking mechanism

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.050 
now and it's a great locking mechanism
because<00:05:05.919> with<00:05:06.039> all<00:05:06.159> this<00:05:06.310> lock<00:05:06.490> together<00:05:06.669> now

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
because with all this lock together now

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.589 
because with all this lock together now
we<00:05:07.120> have<00:05:07.419> just<00:05:07.629> this<00:05:07.860> super<00:05:08.860> damn<00:05:09.009> tight<00:05:09.599> robot

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
we have just this super damn tight robot

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.420 
we have just this super damn tight robot
mode<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.590> looks<00:05:11.830> pretty<00:05:12.069> good<00:05:12.280> the

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
mode and it looks pretty good the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.279 
mode and it looks pretty good the
transformation<00:05:13.030> is<00:05:13.090> really<00:05:13.330> fun<00:05:13.569> he's

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
transformation is really fun he's

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.709 
transformation is really fun he's
decently<00:05:15.190> cyberverse<00:05:15.759> legion<00:05:15.940> poseable<00:05:16.599> he's

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
decently cyberverse legion poseable he's

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.180 
decently cyberverse legion poseable he's
got<00:05:16.840> ball<00:05:17.020> jointed<00:05:17.440> shoulders<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.039> hips

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
got ball jointed shoulders and hips

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.059 
got ball jointed shoulders and hips
basically<00:05:18.849> means<00:05:19.779> he<00:05:19.900> can<00:05:20.080> totally<00:05:20.620> look<00:05:20.919> like

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
basically means he can totally look like

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.019
