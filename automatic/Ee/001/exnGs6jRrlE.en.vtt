00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.780

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.410

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.340
 path 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.340

 gold control here 7 to 6 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.080
 we are in school and we see traces of 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.990
 recent coca activity this was 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.460

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.990

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:27.050

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.729

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.790
