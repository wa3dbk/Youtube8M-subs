this<00:01:21.180> into<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.659> container<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.560> what<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.860> can

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
this into the container so what you can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.149 
this into the container so what you can
actually<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:24.990> pop<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.830> in

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159

here like this and then you put your
sticker<00:01:31.380> on

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.740 

and<00:01:36.320> just<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.460> basically<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.570> do

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and just and then basically what you do

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480 
and just and then basically what you do
is<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.200> pop<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.560> straight<00:01:44.009> into<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
is you pop it straight into the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.820 
is you pop it straight into the
container<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.330> this<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:48.330> that<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.619> makes

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
container like this and that just makes

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.499 
container like this and that just makes
it<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.130> much<00:01:50.189> easier<00:01:50.490> other<00:01:50.909> than<00:01:51.210> putting

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
it so much easier other than putting

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.510 
it so much easier other than putting
your<00:01:51.630> fingers<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.500> getting<00:01:53.070> all<00:01:53.310> dirty

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
your fingers and getting all dirty

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.480 
your fingers and getting all dirty
around<00:01:53.940> there<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.500> wonderful<00:01:56.070> trip

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
around there so that is a wonderful trip

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.029 
around there so that is a wonderful trip
so<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:57.060> trick<00:01:57.450> number<00:01:57.840> two<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.700> other

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
so that's trick number two and the other

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.740 
so that's trick number two and the other
trick<00:02:02.039> that<00:02:02.070> I've<00:02:02.369> always<00:02:02.549> done<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.450> always

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
trick that I've always done is always

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.340 
trick that I've always done is always

and the different types of soy that you

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.400 
and the different types of soy that you
might<00:02:41.549> come<00:02:41.820> across

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
might come across

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.960 
might come across
there's<00:02:43.410> certainly<00:02:43.829> ones<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.280> I've<00:02:44.489> used<00:02:44.730> in

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
there's certainly ones that I've used in

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.870 
there's certainly ones that I've used in
the<00:02:45.060> past<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.810> use<00:02:45.959> anymore<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:47.340> soy<00:02:47.549> wax

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
the past of it use anymore the soy wax

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.870 
the past of it use anymore the soy wax
it<00:02:48.150> tends<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.709> crap<00:02:49.709> run<00:02:50.070> middle<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:50.760> it's

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
it tends to crap run middle and it's

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.460 
it tends to crap run middle and it's
just<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.630> presentable<00:02:52.410> obviously<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.820> I

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
just not presentable obviously so I

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.509 
just not presentable obviously so I
don't<00:02:55.470> use<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.620> works<00:02:55.980> anymore<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.459> I've

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
don't use that works anymore and I've

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.849 
don't use that works anymore and I've
tried<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.239> many<00:02:57.540> different<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.709> it

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
tried that many different and so it

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.470 
tried that many different and so it
waxes<00:02:59.250> them<00:02:59.459> really<00:02:59.760> have<00:02:59.910> with<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.209> blends

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
waxes them really have with the blends

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.460 
waxes them really have with the blends
that<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.750> use<00:03:01.049> now<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:02.750> but<00:03:03.750> anyway<00:03:04.109> sometimes

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
that I use now and but anyway sometimes

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.590 
that I use now and but anyway sometimes
it<00:03:04.859> doesn't<00:03:05.040> always<00:03:05.280> hit<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.090> way<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.480> you

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
it doesn't always hit the way that you

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.150 
it doesn't always hit the way that you
want<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.930> see<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.410> might<00:03:07.590> pour<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.040> at

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
want to see you might pour it at

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.610 
want to see you might pour it at
different<00:03:08.340> times<00:03:08.579> so<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:10.079> definitely<00:03:10.290> my

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
different times so this is definitely my

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.090 
different times so this is definitely my
best<00:03:10.859> friend<00:03:11.329> with<00:03:12.329> this<00:03:12.510> particular<00:03:12.930> candle

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
best friend with this particular candle

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.220 
best friend with this particular candle
it<00:03:14.519> looks<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.090> sunken<00:03:15.630> in<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.900> little

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
it looks like it's sunken in a little

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.949 
it looks like it's sunken in a little
just<00:03:16.500> around<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.220> middle<00:03:17.550> there<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.480> what<00:03:18.780> I'm

and then I just carefully so I'm just
bring<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.549> down<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.879> temperature<00:03:30.150> just

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
bring it down to the temperature just

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.860 
bring it down to the temperature just
carefully<00:03:31.560> bring<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.790> around<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.840> just

carefully bring that around so just
smooth<00:03:34.590> off<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.129> edge<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.360> keep<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.690> away

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
smooth off the edge and I keep it away

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.759 
smooth off the edge and I keep it away
from<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.530> weak<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:39.140> then<00:03:40.140> it's<00:03:40.319> going<00:03:40.560> to

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
from the weak and then it's going to

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.220 
from the weak and then it's going to
basically<00:03:41.360> reset<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:43.079> have<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> nice<00:03:43.860> top<00:03:44.670> and
