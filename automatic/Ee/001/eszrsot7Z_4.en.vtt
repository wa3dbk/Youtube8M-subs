00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
like gets to level six he should be

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
like gets to level six he should be
perfectly<00:01:32.100> fine<00:01:32.340> which<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> saw<00:01:32.909> were<00:01:33.180> as

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
perfectly fine which you saw were as

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.210 
perfectly fine which you saw were as
soon<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.290> six<00:01:34.500> he<00:01:34.590> roamed<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.040> lane

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
soon as he was six he roamed the lane

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.010 
soon as he was six he roamed the lane
and<00:01:35.250> he<00:01:35.549> got<00:01:35.640> two<00:01:35.790> kills<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.540> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and he got two kills because of that so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.050 
and he got two kills because of that so
like<00:01:37.590> instead<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> ghost<00:01:38.520> Olaf<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
like instead of like a ghost Olaf I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.249 
like instead of like a ghost Olaf I
would<00:01:39.180> recommend<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.780> something<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
would recommend it like something like a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.899 
would recommend it like something like a
lease<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.710> could<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.009> jump<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.400> renekton

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
lease and I could just jump on renekton

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.789 
lease and I could just jump on renekton
essentially<00:01:42.720> jump<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> cast<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.470> lock<00:01:43.649> them

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
essentially jump on a cast and lock them

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
essentially jump on a cast and lock them
down<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> kill<00:01:44.250> him<00:01:44.369> before<00:01:44.460> six<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
down and kill him before six and that

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.760 
down and kill him before six and that
would<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.750> liked<00:01:45.869> completely<00:01:46.259> punished<00:01:46.590> him

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
would have liked completely punished him

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.109 
would have liked completely punished him
talk<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.369> me<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> little<00:01:47.520> bit<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.759> what<00:01:47.909> you've

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
talk to me a little bit of what you've

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.700 
talk to me a little bit of what you've
seen<00:01:48.270> from<00:01:48.329> cloud<00:01:48.899> nine<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> team<00:01:49.560> because

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
seen from cloud nine as a team because

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.940 
seen from cloud nine as a team because
they<00:01:49.950> seem<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.840> rotate<00:01:51.840> well<00:01:52.110> effectively<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
they seem to rotate well effectively and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.170 
they seem to rotate well effectively and
they<00:01:53.009> seem<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.220> make<00:01:53.399> good<00:01:53.610> decisions<00:01:53.759> about

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
they seem to make good decisions about

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.819 
they seem to make good decisions about
which<00:01:54.420> fights<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.899> pick<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.290> which<00:01:55.500> ones<00:01:55.680> not

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
which fights to pick and which ones not

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.069 
which fights to pick and which ones not
to<00:01:55.979> get<00:01:56.070> involved<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.570> example<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
to get involved in like for example a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.499 
to get involved in like for example a
good<00:01:58.229> rotation<00:01:58.350> would<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:59.070> right<00:01:59.969> after<00:02:00.149> they

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
good rotation would be right after they

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.910 
good rotation would be right after they
gotta<00:02:00.689> kill<00:02:00.899> bottom<00:02:01.229> i<00:02:01.290> believe<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.740> like

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
gotta kill bottom i believe it was like

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.399 
gotta kill bottom i believe it was like
lemon<00:02:02.250> initiated<00:02:02.880> onto<00:02:03.240> yellow<00:02:03.719> star<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
lemon initiated onto yellow star and

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.859 
lemon initiated onto yellow star and
then<00:02:04.500> media's<00:02:04.829> came<00:02:05.040> down<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:06.240> put<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
then media's came down like that put the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.990 
then media's came down like that put the
pressure<00:02:07.079> against<00:02:08.039> like<00:02:08.190> phonetics<00:02:08.610> portland

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
pressure against like phonetics portland

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.780 
pressure against like phonetics portland
and<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.810> randomly<00:02:10.020> saw<00:02:10.379> cyanide<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and then you randomly saw cyanide in the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.900 
and then you randomly saw cyanide in the
red<00:02:12.120> jungle

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
red jungle

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.850 
red jungle
meals<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.510> he<00:02:13.870> got<00:02:13.990> caught<00:02:14.050> out<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.500> he<00:02:14.650> died

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
meals and he got caught out and he died

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.420 
meals and he got caught out and he died
and<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.610> not<00:02:16.210> only<00:02:16.270> did<00:02:16.510> he<00:02:16.540> die<00:02:16.840> but<00:02:17.280> ce9<00:02:18.280> got

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
and that not only did he die but ce9 got

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.920 
and that not only did he die but ce9 got
a<00:02:18.460> free<00:02:18.610> dragon<00:02:18.940> because<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.570> just

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
a free dragon because of that and just

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.870 
a free dragon because of that and just
feel<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> lot<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.160> gold<00:02:21.400> and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
feel that like a lot of the gold and

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.990 
feel that like a lot of the gold and
just<00:02:22.300> map<00:02:23.020> control<00:02:23.410> went<00:02:23.680> into<00:02:23.830> c9's<00:02:24.160> hands<00:02:24.400> if

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
just map control went into c9's hands if

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.580 
just map control went into c9's hands if
we<00:02:25.180> maybe<00:02:25.330> look<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.630> little<00:02:25.780> bit<00:02:25.990> closer<00:02:26.200> to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
we maybe look a little bit closer to

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.950 
we maybe look a little bit closer to
individual<00:02:27.160> performances<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:27.970> when<00:02:28.630> we<00:02:28.780> talk

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
individual performances I when we talk

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.840 
individual performances I when we talk
about<00:02:28.990> fanatic<00:02:29.590> we<00:02:29.680> inevitably<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.670> talk

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
about fanatic we inevitably have to talk

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.230 
about fanatic we inevitably have to talk
about<00:02:31.150> reckless<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.140> kind<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.890> feel<00:02:33.070> like

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
about reckless and I kind of feel like

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.240 
about reckless and I kind of feel like
he<00:02:34.240> kept<00:02:34.630> up<00:02:34.750> in<00:02:34.900> farm<00:02:35.140> very<00:02:35.560> well<00:02:35.770> extremely

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
he kept up in farm very well extremely

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.490 
he kept up in farm very well extremely
well<00:02:36.370> actually<00:02:36.580> but<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.270> wasn't<00:02:37.780> up<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.960> him<00:02:38.290> he

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
well actually but it wasn't up to him he

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.560 
well actually but it wasn't up to him he
couldn't<00:02:39.040> actually<00:02:39.220> do<00:02:39.520> anything<00:02:39.910> yeah<00:02:40.540> I

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
couldn't actually do anything yeah I

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.090 
couldn't actually do anything yeah I
think<00:02:40.810> his<00:02:40.900> solo<00:02:41.110> Lane<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.620> felt<00:02:41.800> too<00:02:41.860> far

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
think his solo Lane it just felt too far

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.340 
think his solo Lane it just felt too far
behind<00:02:42.220> hi<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.330> balls<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.810> particular<00:02:44.080> play

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
behind hi and balls in particular play

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.190 
behind hi and balls in particular play
very<00:02:44.560> solidly<00:02:44.890> very<00:02:45.130> well<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:46.050> meteors<00:02:47.050> in

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
very solidly very well and meteors in

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.350 
very solidly very well and meteors in
Game<00:02:47.350> one<00:02:47.380> went<00:02:47.830> monstrous<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.850> really

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
Game one went monstrous and really

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.910 
Game one went monstrous and really
prevented<00:02:49.900> reckless<00:02:50.290> from<00:02:50.410> even<00:02:50.620> having<00:02:50.650> an

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
prevented reckless from even having an

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.560 
prevented reckless from even having an
impact<00:02:51.130> in<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> game<00:02:51.490> yeah<00:02:51.850> like<00:02:52.030> I'd<00:02:52.180> have<00:02:52.360> to

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
impact in the game yeah like I'd have to

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.970 
impact in the game yeah like I'd have to
put<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.110> lot<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:54.600> credit<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:56.470> top<00:02:56.680> side<00:02:56.890> of

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
put a lot of credit to the top side of

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.490 
put a lot of credit to the top side of
the<00:02:57.070> map<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.580> balls<00:02:58.150> high<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.960> medias<00:02:59.290> all

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
the map like balls high and medias all

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
and that's all you could ask for and I

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.080 
and that's all you could ask for and I
really<00:03:29.860> thought<00:03:30.010> equalizers<00:03:30.670> with<00:03:30.820> good<00:03:30.940> this

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
really thought equalizers with good this

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.880 
really thought equalizers with good this
matchup<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.600> think<00:03:31.810> every<00:03:32.200> single<00:03:32.470> equalizer

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
matchup I think every single equalizer

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.790 
matchup I think every single equalizer
was<00:03:33.610> teamfight<00:03:34.420> changing<00:03:34.990> and<00:03:35.140> allowed<00:03:35.530> them

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
was teamfight changing and allowed them

was teamfight changing and allowed them
