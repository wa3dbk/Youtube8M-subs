maybe<00:03:01.390> it's<00:03:01.510> maybe<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.140> lack<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.350> of

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
maybe it's maybe it's the lack of of

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.340 
maybe it's maybe it's the lack of of
crunch<00:03:04.000> in<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.390> crust<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:04.960> was<00:03:05.140> really
