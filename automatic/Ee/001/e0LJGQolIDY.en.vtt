00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.750
 to germinate the leaves we need a 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.590
 container can already be plastic or 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.550
 glass soybeans that can be 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.750
 buy perfectly in the supermarket 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.750
 and a little water 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.590
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.590
 on the basis that we have chosen 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.420
 very large amount of soybeans 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.670
 no need to fill it 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.270
 this is going to occupy everything and we will be 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 in water 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.080
 a time nothing needless 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.680
 too 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.680
 this will quickly start to grow 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.060
 and if they see that the water evaporates 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.400
 is going to be consumed by applying a 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.690
 little more water to follow 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.910
 growing and after 67 days and the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.910
 will have lists how are you 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.950
 that are already big enough 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.550
 you ready 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.690
 they are already to be taken out then in a 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.690
 empty container what we are going to do is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.690
 take them out 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.280
 we can put it there 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.950
 It yields a lot with a few that 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.950
 put out a huge amount 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.790
 and before buying them in the supermarket 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.340
 but they were also faces I did not last 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.620
 long time 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.709
 and in this way I can have all 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.090
 the weeks the bean sprouts when 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.489
 you need them without any problem this already 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.430
 it is to put it in the fridge and go 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.930
 to continue to grow a little bit but 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.940
 we have them ready to eat for 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.940
 put them in salads on meals 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.140
 a jan wok dish where they want are 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.930
 very healthy very nutritious more or less 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.350
 how to eat meat so I hope that you 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.090
 have liked the tutorial that if you 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.450
 they like the bean sprouts that do it 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.140
 because it really is very easy they can 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.090
 have them always at home and remember now 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.150
 They know how to rate the video or leave their 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.310
 comments subscribe to the channel and already 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.310
