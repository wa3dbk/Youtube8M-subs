00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
you should say something like this this

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.700 
you should say something like this this
is<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> manual<00:01:54.240> road<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.600> what<00:01:55.590> you're

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
is the manual road and what you're

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.630 
is the manual road and what you're
looking<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.689> side<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
looking for is in this side it's the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.399 
looking for is in this side it's the
power<00:01:59.640> jack

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.820 

so

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
so

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.000 
so
when<00:02:06.010> you<00:02:06.160> see<00:02:07.090> your<00:02:07.240> poet<00:02:07.540> check<00:02:07.690> you<00:02:07.900> should

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
when you see your poet check you should

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.580 
when you see your poet check you should
release<00:02:09.010> it<00:02:09.070> by<00:02:09.760> unscrewing<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.750> hinges<00:02:11.290> on

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
release it by unscrewing the hinges on

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.550 
release it by unscrewing the hinges on
both<00:02:11.830> side<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.750> then<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.840> should<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.170> able<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
both side and then you should be able to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.640 
both side and then you should be able to
take<00:02:14.950> out<00:02:15.130> your<00:02:15.510> poor<00:02:16.510> jack<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.050> that's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
take out your poor jack and that's

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.720 
take out your poor jack and that's
exactly<00:02:17.980> what<00:02:18.280> I'm<00:02:18.370> gonna<00:02:18.550> do<00:02:18.730> now<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:21.520> was

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
exactly what I'm gonna do now so it was

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.790 
exactly what I'm gonna do now so it was
a<00:02:21.760> little<00:02:22.150> bit<00:02:22.270> harder<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.750> dig<00:02:23.290> down<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.500> the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
a little bit harder to dig down to the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.130 
a little bit harder to dig down to the
AC<00:02:23.980> power<00:02:24.310> over<00:02:24.940> check<00:02:25.180> but<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.450> finally<00:02:25.960> did<00:02:26.080> it

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
AC power over check but I finally did it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.230 
AC power over check but I finally did it
I<00:02:26.380> took<00:02:26.410> out<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.890> motorboat<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.490> took<00:02:27.760> off<00:02:27.970> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
I took out the motorboat I took off the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.200 
I took out the motorboat I took off the
display<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.340> why<00:02:30.700> your<00:02:30.910> computer

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
display and this is why your computer

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.790 
display and this is why your computer
isn't<00:02:31.630> charging<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.880> jack<00:02:34.420> as

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
isn't charging so this is the jack as

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.580 
isn't charging so this is the jack as
you<00:02:35.800> can<00:02:35.950> see<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.430> has<00:02:37.240> holes<00:02:37.660> in<00:02:37.810> one<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.320> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
you can see it has holes in one of the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.430 
you can see it has holes in one of the
wires<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.580> ground<00:02:39.850> one<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.330> now<00:02:41.050> I'm<00:02:41.170> going

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
wires the ground one and now I'm going

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.890 
wires the ground one and now I'm going
to<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.800> solder<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.340> back<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:43.030> it's<00:02:43.390> walking

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
to just solder it back so it's walking
