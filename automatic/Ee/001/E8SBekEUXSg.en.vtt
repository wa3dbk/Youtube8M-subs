00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.180
 of patience with your new coach

 Americanist past he was pressured with 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.890
 insults songs and at the end of the meeting 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.390
 some college followers 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.130
 failed in their attempts to send it to 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.130
 dressing soaked in beer 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.470
 the coach did not hide was all 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.700
 the time on the edge of the court 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.100
 analyzing every moment of the game 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.589
 giving instructions and consulting 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.750
 continually with his coaching staff or in 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.270
 contact with the grandstand where his 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.620
 nephew omar cheek analyzing what 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.620
 It happened on the court 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.970
 the strategist made decisions even to 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.920
 mid-first half modified the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.280
 way in which he separated his team that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.780
 started with five line and then 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.640
 cheek completely changed the stopped 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.770
 to the return of the half time when happening the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.850
 line three back and send three 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.850
 front to attack 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.290
 but fortune wanted an error back 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.060
 give the advantage to San Luis and not 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.370
 got the formula to open the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.000
 bolt that put its Ã¡lex counterpart 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.670
 aguinaga 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.340
 at the end the players asked the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.630
 Patience hobby with your trainer yo 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.920
 I think it's a little premature of the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.330
 people 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.070
 mario has a party in action I think 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.140
 who is with us to get out of this 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.250
 is to bring good things and good 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.470
 to stay a little while wants 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.050
 add wants to contribute a lot 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.490
 experience with us and good you have to 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.570
 support it we have to support it both we 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.060
 how people have to give it time 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.340
 so you can answer in the song 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.760
 This was the first game of Carrillo 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.230
 between insults knew how to make decisions and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.209
 that gives the impression that if you have 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.670
 time to get that variants 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.950
 work the vats are going to become a 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.580
 headache for any rival who 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.580
 the opposite 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.950
 as well
