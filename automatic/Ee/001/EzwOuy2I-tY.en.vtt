00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.500
 There are already several such questions. 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.950
 continue to talk another question how 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.580
 defeat a high and strong opponent 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:19.010
 look for his elder two meters then 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.250
 there is this word high here again 7 you 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:29.429
 look it's a strong man 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:31.890
 you look from the side this is a strong man 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.960
 really should 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.370
 usually according to high implied 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.629
 a long wick 2 meters a day artist 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.260
 There was nothing you see here represent 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.660
 snares here it is possible to look here for the sake of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.190
 interest watered half day here they will kill 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.989
 looked a dozen like and not from 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.789
 plastic here using only my 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.820
 methods here are secret ways 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.180
 studied there generally there obtained from 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.500
 master element from special forces professor 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:13.380
 still from somewhere here you are a winner but 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:16.259
 responding see if you 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.060
 theoretically I was not there level on 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.880
 which now what can i do here 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.220
 to such an enemy we will inform 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.009
 the easiest way to stay whole is 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.579
 run let's say you still have to 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.579
 migration but a classic let's consider 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.979
 but the usual home is rarely high 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.659
 the opponent needs to beat ruble's belly 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.240
 the middle there is this area 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.299
 he will then fold but you understand the matter 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.979
 that high opponents are mild later 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:53.750
 will not want the noise of the mobile will 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:02:01.380
 answer and answer leg classic so 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:11.899
 so I can not say here is the winner to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:11.899
 fight his head more comfortable you understand 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.720
 melee is the only possible 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.060
 do the only thing you understand 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.250
 he gave no more if you stay on 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.290
 long distance here I read tear 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.290
 distance ie working at a distance 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.790
 from the length of what is this wonderful distance 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.590
 distance you remember from which 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.530
 hit on the steps that is only 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.450
 don't deliver i need to remove pasha but in 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.500
 the time when i need to strike 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.360
 sport stride it will strike madam 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.850
 so you understand this distance 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.120
 disappears immediately 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.430
 the average distance of this distance with 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:55.030
 which I can work just put 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.030
 hand punches at this distance 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.800
 the case is much stronger 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.150
 besides at the same distance he can 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.490
 drive loki he will deliver the temperature 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.250
 the distances of my punch 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.170
 This is an ideal position for women and hitting 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.020
 knee 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.420
 if she lights up the enemy yet 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.150
 strong you understand the fight will end 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.180
 after in one beat 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.310
 I won't tell you can win 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.590
 Well, I do not do cheap trick 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.140
 the only way to try 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.030
 win really from high and 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.209
 a strong opponent who's exactly 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.720
 here is well prepared this appeal to 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.630
 him the death than you can but I will not say 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.750
 win but this is the only way to 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.970
 which is the only condition under which 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.350
 conclusion can fight him and then 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.760
 try to do this appeals to 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.850
 block a little bit when i can 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.130
 be knees and elbows fists that is 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.019
 you will be in equal measure with him 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.570
 conditions this is the only thing you can 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.500
 do that is here being in position 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.440
 finch 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.540
 you can work the same condition 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.700
 Dog motive there against my dexterous you 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.340
 his knee against mine is not enough 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.640
 This is the only position that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:26.479
 leaves chances i didn't do cheap 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:30.950
 tricks to win you understand cramming with 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.840
 we block even a little of it 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:37.150
 movement when trying to figure it out 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.150
 make it just the size of the neck 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.320
 that is, this is the distance - handing 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.620
 the factory is exactly handed funny for years 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.530
 here here he can do the same 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.450
 that can do that is, the advantages of 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.450
 you will not be equal to you 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.630
 chances are the only one I know 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.630
 the way
