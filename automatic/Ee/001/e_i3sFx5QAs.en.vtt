00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
 prepared 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.700
 Action! 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.840
 It is a great honor to be in Sandan, Norway. 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.440
 Where we found it 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.780
 the world's most dangerous looking runway. 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.080
 This scenario 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.220
 was really great, 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 and that's why I bite into it 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 and I really wanted to work on it. 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.780
 There's an adventure story 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.900
 without a single word 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960
 or comments. 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.000
 The light that best shows the headlights 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.400
 is actually dark. 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.800
 But it's about introducing a new one 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.040
 of the newly designed, newly created Monde. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.000
 But you need light to show the car 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.060
 to see the car at all. 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 So it's about finding a short time 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.780
 when it's dark enough to show the headlights 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.780
 but there is also enough light to see the car. 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.180
 So we rehearse during daylight 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.240
 and then when the light is almost right, 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 we go for a sharp shoot. 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.680
 When we get to the place, we have two hours to shoot. 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.600
 We must be ready, 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.520
 because in two hours we have to shoot, 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.420
 which would take several days of work for most ads. 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.840
 My philosophy is generally that you will not replace reality with anything. 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.080
 And while CG technology can come true, 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.220
 never reaches her. 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.120
 We have done a lot to make the shots. 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.560
 We land with the plane directly over the car 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.940
 as in a real stunt. 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.540
 I think viewers will really appreciate that we have created 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 this innovative advertising. 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.200
 At least I appreciate it 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.360
 and indeed it is my honor to be the one who directed her. 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.200
 I think if more ads about cars, 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.860
 she had this level of ingenuity and imagination, 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.360
 we would sell more cars and do better ads.
