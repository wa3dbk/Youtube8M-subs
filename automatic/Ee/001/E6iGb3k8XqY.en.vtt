maybe<00:05:35.669> give<00:05:35.849> it<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.120> a<00:05:36.150> friend<00:05:36.180> and<00:05:36.539> now<00:05:36.660> so

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
maybe give it to a friend and now so

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.100 
maybe give it to a friend and now so
this<00:05:37.620> came<00:05:37.830> free<00:05:38.240> this<00:05:39.240> came<00:05:39.510> together<00:05:39.720> with

clovers and tell us here the phantom

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.570 
clovers and tell us here the phantom
itself<00:06:50.150> comes<00:06:50.479> with<00:06:50.840> a<00:06:51.020> dipole<00:06:51.500> antenna<00:06:51.919> small

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
itself comes with a dipole antenna small

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.089 
itself comes with a dipole antenna small
little<00:06:52.729> dipole<00:06:53.210> antenna<00:06:53.539> it<00:06:53.870> works<00:06:54.470> well<00:06:54.770> but

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
little dipole antenna it works well but

00:06:55.099 --> 00:07:01.420 
little dipole antenna it works well but
with<00:06:56.060> the<00:06:56.800> 1000<00:06:57.800> yard<00:06:58.479> promise<00:06:59.479> from<00:06:59.720> the<00:07:00.710> DJI

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
with the 1000 yard promise from the DJI

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.240 
with the 1000 yard promise from the DJI
we<00:07:02.330> feel<00:07:02.780> that<00:07:02.810> start<00:07:03.229> reading<00:07:03.410> up<00:07:03.680> and<00:07:03.919> a<00:07:04.069> lot

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
we feel that start reading up and a lot

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.700 
we feel that start reading up and a lot
of<00:07:04.280> people<00:07:04.940> that<00:07:05.180> I've<00:07:05.270> flown<00:07:05.599> with<00:07:05.900> do<00:07:06.470> want

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
of people that I've flown with do want

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.439 
of people that I've flown with do want
to<00:07:06.860> extend<00:07:07.160> it<00:07:07.400> a<00:07:07.520> little<00:07:07.550> bit<00:07:07.849> further<00:07:08.120> and

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:08.449 
to extend it a little bit further and

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:11.499 
to extend it a little bit further and
that's<00:07:08.720> where<00:07:09.050> you<00:07:09.919> came<00:07:10.159> up<00:07:10.220> with<00:07:10.610> the<00:07:11.030> right

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:11.509 
that's where you came up with the right

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.649 
that's where you came up with the right
now<00:07:11.720> horizon<00:07:12.440> antennas<00:07:12.919> limit<00:07:13.280> with<00:07:13.430> this<00:07:13.659> to

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:14.659 
now horizon antennas limit with this to

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:17.409 
now horizon antennas limit with this to
clover<00:07:15.139> and<00:07:15.319> this<00:07:15.590> really<00:07:16.009> helps<00:07:16.370> a<00:07:16.430> lot<00:07:16.580> as

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:17.419 
clover and this really helps a lot as

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.960 
clover and this really helps a lot as
you<00:07:17.630> notice<00:07:18.050> these<00:07:18.289> are<00:07:18.590> all<00:07:18.800> left<00:07:19.490> hand

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:19.970 
you notice these are all left hand

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.740 
you notice these are all left hand
circular<00:07:20.750> polarized<00:07:21.349> same<00:07:22.130> with<00:07:22.310> here<00:07:22.750> when

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 
circular polarized same with here when

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.620 
circular polarized same with here when
you<00:07:23.960> modify<00:07:24.770> everything<00:07:25.729> using<00:07:26.120> the<00:07:26.389> left

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:26.630 
you modify everything using the left

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.510 
you modify everything using the left
hand<00:07:27.880> circular<00:07:28.880> polarized<00:07:29.419> entire<00:07:30.520> antennas

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 
hand circular polarized entire antennas

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.309 
hand circular polarized entire antennas
you<00:07:31.699> find<00:07:32.000> that<00:07:32.180> the<00:07:32.240> reception<00:07:33.080> would<00:07:33.169> be

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:33.319 
you find that the reception would be

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.040 
you find that the reception would be
much<00:07:33.590> much<00:07:33.860> better<00:07:34.210> smoother<00:07:35.210> clearer<00:07:35.690> and

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.050 
much much better smoother clearer and

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.189 
much much better smoother clearer and
extend<00:07:36.949> extension<00:07:37.789> which<00:07:38.000> eve<00:07:38.419> trouble<00:07:38.960> free

extend extension which eve trouble free

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.950 
extend extension which eve trouble free
and<00:07:39.470> that<00:07:40.190> will<00:07:40.550> be<00:07:40.669> talked<00:07:40.940> about<00:07:41.060> in<00:07:41.240> part

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
and that will be talked about in part

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.159 
and that will be talked about in part
four<00:07:42.229> in<00:07:42.560> part<00:07:43.190> 5<00:07:43.430> we<00:07:43.729> will<00:07:43.880> do<00:07:44.060> a<00:07:44.300> range<00:07:44.719> test

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:45.169 
four in part 5 we will do a range test

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.560 
four in part 5 we will do a range test
and<00:07:45.469> we<00:07:45.620> will<00:07:45.770> find<00:07:46.009> out<00:07:46.250> after<00:07:46.820> all<00:07:47.360> this

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.570 
and we will find out after all this

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.230 
and we will find out after all this
modification<00:07:48.229> is<00:07:48.800> how<00:07:49.070> much<00:07:49.370> distance<00:07:49.639> we<00:07:50.030> can

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 
modification is how much distance we can

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.080 
modification is how much distance we can
