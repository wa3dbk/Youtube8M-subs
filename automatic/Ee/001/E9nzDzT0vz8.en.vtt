00:00:01.174 --> 00:00:03.174
 Planing machine for wood craftsman hands 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.960
 in front of you 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.340
 Planing machine 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.340
 hand made 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.700
 this is a very complicated unit 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400
 It was made for many years 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.860
 this is my pride 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.720
 he does almost all operations 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700
 planes 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 fuguet in size 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 sawing 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 he is 3 speed 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.600
 show some of its features 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.180
 This is a gearshift 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.420
 on the top table we plan the board on one side 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.440
 knives are visible 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.400
 here is another desktop 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.760
 when we hit the top of the board 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.720
 turn it over and push it into this cavity 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.380
 size is set here 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 these screws 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.240
 a ruler is visible here 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.350
 now it is 12 mm 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.860
 from this side we push 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.860
 and come out with us from this side 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.680
 12 mm board comes out 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.540
 this is a cutting table 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.860
 he's adjustable 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.880
 can be raised and lowered 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.420
 3 kW electric motor 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.420
 transferred from network 220 to 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.800
 it gives 2 kW of power 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.620
 in this box are capacitors 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.380
 planing board 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:57.729
 for safety reasons, there is a cover 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:04.729
 in order to open and close the size 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.500
 put a saw 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:02.809
 you can make boards of the same length 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.229
 this machine is very complex 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.320
 difficult to manufacture 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.500
 and not everyone can make such a machine 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.309
 so for our subscribers we decided to make a simple machine 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:48.599
 which everyone can do 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:55.599
 here we are on the table 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.740
 we will tell about him 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.110
 and show
