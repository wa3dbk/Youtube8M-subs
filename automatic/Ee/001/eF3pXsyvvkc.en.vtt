00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.719
 is digging 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.070
 around the Mediterranean that will us 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.630
 bring instability but 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.070
 everywhere else and always 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.380
 anticyclonic conditions 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.730

 sweetness that begins in the north of the country 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.640

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.590
 anticyclonic in autumn what wants 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.629
 to say a lot of bombs scrambled and 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.000
