00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
how to get the demolished part to

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.349 
how to get the demolished part to
achievement<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:05.970> where<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.180> must

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
achievement this is where you must

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.310 
achievement this is where you must
destroy<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:07.049> total<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.710> 50<00:00:08.370> houses<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.320> this

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
destroy a total of 50 houses and this

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.830 
destroy a total of 50 houses and this
does<00:00:10.679> take<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> long<00:00:11.519> time<00:00:11.940> but<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.509> good

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
does take a long time but a good

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.870 
does take a long time but a good
boosting<00:00:13.259> point<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.860> mission<00:00:14.250> heavy

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
boosting point is the mission heavy

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.330 
boosting point is the mission heavy
metal<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:16.350> believe<00:00:16.560> there<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:17.130> house

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
metal and I believe there is one house

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.650 
metal and I believe there is one house
coming<00:00:17.760> up<00:00:17.789> right<00:00:18.000> here<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.330> believe

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
coming up right here that believe

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.900 
coming up right here that believe
there's<00:00:18.900> some<00:00:19.080> kind<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.410> guided<00:00:19.770> missile<00:00:20.160> base

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
there's some kind of guided missile base

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.120 
there's some kind of guided missile base
camp<00:00:21.210> right<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.779> there's<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.529> house<00:00:22.890> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
camp right here and there's one house to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.189 
camp right here and there's one house to
the<00:00:23.220> side<00:00:23.460> where<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.330> take<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.810> out<00:00:24.840> so

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the side where you can take one out so

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.740 
the side where you can take one out so
there's<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.330> obviously<00:00:27.330> just<00:00:27.570> want<00:00:27.689> to

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
there's one and obviously just want to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.330 
there's one and obviously just want to
say<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.109> off<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.260> bat<00:00:28.439> there's<00:00:28.830> obviously

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
say right off the bat there's obviously

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.980 
say right off the bat there's obviously
many<00:00:29.789> more<00:00:29.970> chances<00:00:30.179> throughout<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> entire

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
many more chances throughout the entire

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.930 
many more chances throughout the entire
game<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.439> demolish<00:00:31.980> houses<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
game to demolish houses you just have to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
game to demolish houses you just have to
use<00:00:33.090> grenade<00:00:33.420> launchers<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:33.899> RPGs<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.559> you

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
use grenade launchers or RPGs that you

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.160 
use grenade launchers or RPGs that you
do<00:00:35.100> find<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.360> trick<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> taking<00:00:37.050> out

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
do find and the trick to taking out

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.810 
do find and the trick to taking out
houses<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.710> actually<00:00:38.070> take<00:00:38.219> out<00:00:38.370> every

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
houses is actually take out every

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.270 
houses is actually take out every
surrounding<00:00:39.510> wall<00:00:39.829> you<00:00:40.829> can't<00:00:41.040> take<00:00:41.190> out

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
surrounding wall you can't take out

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.040 
surrounding wall you can't take out
supporting<00:00:41.760> walls<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> take<00:00:42.989> out

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
supporting walls you have to take out

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.200 
supporting walls you have to take out
every<00:00:43.280> surrounding<00:00:44.280> walk<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.640> said<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
every surrounding walk I just said and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.970 
every surrounding walk I just said and
that<00:00:45.480> surrounds<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> entire<00:00:46.230> house<00:00:46.649> since

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that surrounds the entire house since

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.770 
that surrounds the entire house since
it's<00:00:47.760> pretty<00:00:47.940> obvious<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> probably

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it's pretty obvious you know I probably

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.080 
it's pretty obvious you know I probably
know<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.050> mean<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.879> getting

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
know what I mean and so first to getting

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.720 
know what I mean and so first to getting
the<00:00:51.180> UAV<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.890> actually<00:00:53.460> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the UAV here and this actually I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.209 
the UAV here and this actually I
actually<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.239> shot<00:00:54.270> down<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.800> doesn't

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
actually get shot down but it doesn't

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.000 
actually get shot down but it doesn't
matter<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> actually<00:00:57.149> keeps<00:00:57.270> track

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
matter because it actually keeps track

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.979 
matter because it actually keeps track
so<00:00:59.010> even<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.550> die<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.570> restart<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
so even if you die or if you restart a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.200 
so even if you die or if you restart a
checkpoint<00:01:01.260> it'll<00:01:02.219> still<00:01:02.430> count<00:01:02.670> upwards

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
checkpoint it'll still count upwards

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.700 
checkpoint it'll still count upwards
like<00:01:03.539> it'll<00:01:03.750> still<00:01:03.989> count<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.530> still

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
like it'll still count like it still

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.200 
like it'll still count like it still
count<00:01:04.920> what<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.369> did<00:01:05.580> even<00:01:05.909> though<00:01:05.939> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
count what you just did even though you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
count what you just did even though you
got<00:01:06.330> shot<00:01:06.630> down<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.650> don't<00:01:07.950> worry<00:01:08.130> because

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
got shot down so don't worry because

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.399 
got shot down so don't worry because
this<00:01:08.970> UAV<00:01:09.360> does<00:01:09.630> make<00:01:09.900> things<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.229> lot<00:01:10.350> easier

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
this UAV does make things a lot easier

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.200 
this UAV does make things a lot easier
so<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.220> either<00:01:11.400> keep<00:01:11.549> doing<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.970> here

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
so you can either keep doing it here

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.350 
so you can either keep doing it here
just<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> couple<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.740> small<00:01:13.920> houses<00:01:14.360> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
just take a couple of small houses and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.840 
just take a couple of small houses and
yeah<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> UAV<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.340> takes<00:01:17.700> about

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
yeah like because the UAV it takes about

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.020 
yeah like because the UAV it takes about
one<00:01:18.479> shot<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:19.290> destroy<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> entire<00:01:20.040> house<00:01:20.310> so

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
one shot to destroy the entire house so

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.370 
one shot to destroy the entire house so
why<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.869> either<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.200> keep

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
why not do it you can either just keep

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.620 
why not do it you can either just keep
doing<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> UAV<00:01:23.220> or<00:01:23.400> what<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> do

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
doing with the UAV or what I like to do

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.880 
doing with the UAV or what I like to do
is<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> there's<00:01:25.170> actually<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.530> couple<00:01:25.650> houses

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
is that there's actually a couple houses

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
is that there's actually a couple houses
afterwards<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.420> obviously<00:01:27.659> can't

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
afterwards that you can obviously can't

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350 
afterwards that you can obviously can't
hit<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.220> can't<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.970> floor<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
hit because you can't go that floor and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.390 
hit because you can't go that floor and
the<00:01:31.049> tank<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.409> take<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> mountain<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
the tank can take the mountain but the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.940 
the tank can take the mountain but the
tank<00:01:32.640> takes<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.180> while<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:34.110> there's<00:01:34.770> still

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
tank takes a while but there's still

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
tank takes a while but there's still
houses<00:01:35.159> available<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.810> achievement

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
houses available and this achievement

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.069 
houses available and this achievement
again<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.740> gonna<00:01:38.430> take<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.790> long<00:01:39.119> time<00:01:39.720> I

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
again is gonna take a long time I

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.710 
again is gonna take a long time I
believe<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> took<00:01:40.799> me<00:01:40.860> about<00:01:41.220> maybe<00:01:41.759> 10-15

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
believe it took me about maybe 10-15

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.289 
believe it took me about maybe 10-15
minutes<00:01:43.229> after<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.130> beat<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> campaign<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
minutes after I beat the campaign and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.300 
minutes after I beat the campaign and
after<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.530> actually<00:01:46.829> specifically

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
after I was actually specifically

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.609 
after I was actually specifically
boosting<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.079> believe<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.439> can

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
boosting for it and I believe you can

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
boosting for it and I believe you can
and<00:01:49.890> once<00:01:50.040> you've<00:01:50.280> gotten<00:01:50.520> finished<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and once you've gotten finished to the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
and once you've gotten finished to the
area<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> show<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> end<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:53.159> this

read through the entire mission it is up
to<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:02.640> either<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.509> should<00:02:03.540> produce

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
to you but either way you should produce

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.830 
to you but either way you should produce
restart<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> entire<00:02:04.920> mission<00:02:05.630> but<00:02:06.630> that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
restart the entire mission but that

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.260 
restart the entire mission but that
guided<00:02:07.259> missile<00:02:07.710> house<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> very<00:02:08.759> first<00:02:09.030> one

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
guided missile house the very first one

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.729 
guided missile house the very first one
the<00:02:09.300> beginning<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> video<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.440> pretty

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the beginning of the video that's pretty

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.110 
the beginning of the video that's pretty
much<00:02:10.860> right<00:02:11.220> at<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> beginning<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
much right at the beginning in the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.180 
much right at the beginning in the
levels<00:02:12.420> not

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
levels not

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.180 
levels not
for<00:02:13.460> after<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:13.940> it's<00:02:14.180> not<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.480> big<00:02:14.960> deal<00:02:15.190> and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
for after so it's not a big deal and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.840 
for after so it's not a big deal and
here<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.720> go<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.350> town<00:02:18.590> anyhow<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.640> did

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
here I just go to town anyhow that I did

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.090 
here I just go to town anyhow that I did
not<00:02:20.000> blow<00:02:20.360> up<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.080> believe<00:02:21.350> this<00:02:21.650> video<00:02:21.950> is

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
not blow up and I believe this video is

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.790 
not blow up and I believe this video is
sped<00:02:22.430> up<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.790> lot<00:02:23.270> because<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:24.140> takes<00:02:24.380> forever

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
sped up a lot because it takes forever

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.360 
sped up a lot because it takes forever
to<00:02:25.400> blow<00:02:25.640> up<00:02:25.730> houses<00:02:26.120> in<00:02:26.870> general<00:02:27.410> anyways<00:02:27.800> so

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
to blow up houses in general anyways so

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.770 
to blow up houses in general anyways so
I<00:02:28.400> think<00:02:28.550> we<00:02:28.820> speed<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.090> here<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.510> couple

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
I think we speed up here in a couple

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.830 
I think we speed up here in a couple
seconds<00:02:30.110> at<00:02:30.380> least<00:02:30.440> like<00:02:30.710> I<00:02:30.860> hope<00:02:31.250> so

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
seconds at least like I hope so

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.290 
seconds at least like I hope so
but<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:33.260> just<00:02:33.290> keep<00:02:33.650> going<00:02:34.010> for<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:35.270> is

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
but you just keep going for it and it is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.110 
but you just keep going for it and it is
very<00:02:35.840> time<00:02:36.170> consuming<00:02:36.200> as<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.580> can<00:02:37.730> obviously

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
very time consuming as you can obviously

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.570 
very time consuming as you can obviously
tell<00:02:38.350> but<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.770> right<00:02:39.920> now<00:02:40.040> I'm<00:02:40.130> just<00:02:40.190> working

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
tell but so right now I'm just working

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.070 
tell but so right now I'm just working
those<00:02:40.850> houses<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.420> was<00:02:41.570> shooting<00:02:41.810> down<00:02:41.840> with

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
those houses I was shooting down with

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.750 
those houses I was shooting down with
UAV<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.650> any<00:02:42.830> houses<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.430> missed<00:02:43.640> with

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
UAV so any houses that you missed with

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.030 
UAV so any houses that you missed with
UAV<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.780> can<00:02:44.930> easily<00:02:45.110> take<00:02:45.500> out<00:02:45.590> with<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
UAV you can easily take out with the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.790 
UAV you can easily take out with the
tank<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.640> why<00:02:47.450> am<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.900> not<00:02:48.020> spending<00:02:48.470> up<00:02:48.620> this

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
tank and why am I not spending up this

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.530 
tank and why am I not spending up this
port<00:02:49.070> yeah<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.430> understand<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.180> think<00:02:50.210> anytime

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
port yeah I understand I think anytime

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.450 
port yeah I understand I think anytime
soon<00:02:50.930> now<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.980> know<00:02:52.100> when<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> house<00:02:52.430> is

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
soon now and you know when a house is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.070 
soon now and you know when a house is
going<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.790> collapse<00:02:53.000> pretty<00:02:53.390> obvious<00:02:53.690> but<00:02:53.810> new

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
going to collapse pretty obvious but new

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.510 
going to collapse pretty obvious but new
players<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:54.740> kind<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:54.950> there's<00:02:55.430> a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
players just kind of there's a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.440 
players just kind of there's a
definitely<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:55.960> noticeable<00:02:56.960> audio<00:02:57.350> tune<00:02:58.450> I'm

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
definitely a noticeable audio tune I'm

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.690 
definitely a noticeable audio tune I'm
not<00:02:59.660> gonna<00:02:59.840> lip-sync<00:03:00.740> here<00:03:00.980> or<00:03:01.100> anything<00:03:01.310> but

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
not gonna lip-sync here or anything but

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.000 
not gonna lip-sync here or anything but
it's<00:03:02.150> pretty<00:03:02.330> recognizable<00:03:02.810> if<00:03:03.620> you're<00:03:03.860> too

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
it's pretty recognizable if you're too

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.230 
it's pretty recognizable if you're too
close<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.550> house<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.060> it's<00:03:06.050> coming

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
close to the house and it's coming

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.310 
close to the house and it's coming
something<00:03:08.240> like<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.690> thought<00:03:08.960> that<00:03:09.020> was

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
something like that I thought that was

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.160 
something like that I thought that was
dumb<00:03:09.620> but<00:03:10.280> something<00:03:11.000> like<00:03:11.240> that<00:03:11.510> there<00:03:12.050> we<00:03:12.080> go

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
dumb but something like that there we go

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.670 
dumb but something like that there we go
and<00:03:13.180> it's<00:03:14.180> just<00:03:14.210> gonna<00:03:14.510> have<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.960> keep<00:03:15.200> going

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
and it's just gonna have to keep going

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.010 
and it's just gonna have to keep going
for<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.190> does<00:03:16.370> take<00:03:16.550> a<00:03:16.640> long<00:03:16.790> time<00:03:17.090> but<00:03:17.840> if

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
for it it does take a long time but if

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.500 
for it it does take a long time but if

wouldn't<00:04:58.560> like<00:04:59.070> it<00:04:59.190> would<00:04:59.280> open<00:04:59.430> but<00:04:59.850> it<00:04:59.940> only

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
wouldn't like it would open but it only

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.910 
wouldn't like it would open but it only
low<00:05:00.330> like<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.690> first<00:05:00.870> half<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.440> second<00:05:01.770> of<00:05:01.830> the

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
low like the first half a second of the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.010 
low like the first half a second of the
video<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.520> was<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:02.850> so<00:05:03.540> I<00:05:03.570> guess<00:05:03.780> I<00:05:03.810> just

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
video and that was it so I guess I just

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.810 
video and that was it so I guess I just
have<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.200> like<00:05:04.350> transfer<00:05:04.950> it<00:05:05.010> downstairs<00:05:05.430> to

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
have to like transfer it downstairs to

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.130 
have to like transfer it downstairs to
the<00:05:05.940> other<00:05:06.060> computer<00:05:06.420> and<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:06.960> should

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
the other computer and it should

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.320 
the other computer and it should
probably<00:05:07.230> work<00:05:07.470> by<00:05:07.710> then<00:05:07.980> but<00:05:08.730> I<00:05:09.030> don't<00:05:09.270> know

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
probably work by then but I don't know

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.370 
probably work by then but I don't know
it's<00:05:09.510> just<00:05:09.570> kind<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:09.840> weird<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.050> was<00:05:10.140> like<00:05:10.230> what

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
it's just kind of weird I was like what

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.220 
it's just kind of weird I was like what
the<00:05:10.530> hell<00:05:10.710> is<00:05:11.160> going<00:05:11.550> on<00:05:11.700> so<00:05:12.300> oh<00:05:12.630> it's<00:05:12.840> oh<00:05:13.020> and

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
the hell is going on so oh it's oh and

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.110 
the hell is going on so oh it's oh and
again<00:05:13.350> so<00:05:14.040> you're<00:05:14.160> making<00:05:14.250> away<00:05:14.490> after<00:05:15.060> you

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
again so you're making away after you

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.880 
again so you're making away after you
blow<00:05:15.240> up<00:05:15.300> all<00:05:15.420> those<00:05:15.510> houses<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.650> have<00:05:16.770> a

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
blow up all those houses and you have a

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.070 
blow up all those houses and you have a
couple<00:05:17.100> more<00:05:17.340> houses<00:05:17.460> so<00:05:18.030> why<00:05:18.570> not<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:18.990> know

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
couple more houses so why not you know

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.570 
couple more houses so why not you know
it's<00:05:19.260> just<00:05:19.350> two<00:05:19.650> more<00:05:19.890> I<00:05:19.920> like<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.250> think<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.460> it

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
it's just two more I like to think of it

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.790 
it's just two more I like to think of it
as<00:05:20.700> that's<00:05:21.360> two<00:05:21.660> more<00:05:21.840> I<00:05:21.900> didn't<00:05:22.440> have<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.650> blow

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
as that's two more I didn't have to blow

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.710 
as that's two more I didn't have to blow
up<00:05:22.980> later<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.520> just<00:05:23.730> save<00:05:24.000> me<00:05:24.120> some<00:05:24.270> time<00:05:24.510> and

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
up later and just save me some time and

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.070 
up later and just save me some time and
actually<00:05:25.530> kind<00:05:25.860> of<00:05:25.980> not<00:05:26.940> really<00:05:27.090> like<00:05:27.330> semi

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
actually kind of not really like semi

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.690 
actually kind of not really like semi
small<00:05:28.470> fell<00:05:28.710> here<00:05:28.920> so<00:05:29.100> I'm<00:05:29.160> taking<00:05:29.460> out<00:05:29.490> these

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
small fell here so I'm taking out these

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.850 
small fell here so I'm taking out these
couple<00:05:29.910> of<00:05:29.970> houses<00:05:30.120> but<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:30.870> forgot<00:05:31.410> to<00:05:31.560> realize

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
couple of houses but I forgot to realize

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.400 
couple of houses but I forgot to realize
that<00:05:32.100> if<00:05:32.310> I<00:05:32.490> get<00:05:32.730> too<00:05:32.910> close<00:05:32.940> or<00:05:33.540> Drive<00:05:33.930> too<00:05:34.140> far

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
that if I get too close or Drive too far

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.710 
that if I get too close or Drive too far
away<00:05:34.530> they'll<00:05:35.310> actually<00:05:35.550> activate<00:05:36.390> the<00:05:36.540> next

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
away they'll actually activate the next

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.650 
away they'll actually activate the next
part<00:05:37.140> of<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:37.590> story<00:05:37.950> which<00:05:38.610> is<00:05:38.670> okay<00:05:39.270> because

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
part of the story which is okay because

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.510 
part of the story which is okay because
you<00:05:39.990> actually<00:05:40.110> get<00:05:40.320> like<00:05:40.500> a<00:05:40.560> huge<00:05:40.980> predator

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
you actually get like a huge predator

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.360 
you actually get like a huge predator
missile<00:05:42.410> airstrike<00:05:43.410> kind<00:05:43.710> of<00:05:43.800> thing<00:05:43.980> going<00:05:44.250> on

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
missile airstrike kind of thing going on

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.040 
missile airstrike kind of thing going on
and<00:05:44.760> you<00:05:45.150> can<00:05:45.270> actually<00:05:45.360> take<00:05:45.600> out<00:05:45.750> a<00:05:45.780> couple

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
and you can actually take out a couple

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.460 
and you can actually take out a couple
more<00:05:46.290> houses<00:05:46.500> with<00:05:47.190> this<00:05:47.370> kind<00:05:47.640> of<00:05:48.470> airstrike

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
more houses with this kind of airstrike

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.820 
more houses with this kind of airstrike
and<00:05:49.680> a<00:05:49.710> almost<00:05:50.490> super<00:05:51.330> epic<00:05:51.690> fail<00:05:51.930> here<00:05:52.200> but<00:05:52.530> I

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
and a almost super epic fail here but I

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.070 
and a almost super epic fail here but I
do<00:05:53.040> make<00:05:53.400> it<00:05:53.430> out<00:05:53.640> in<00:05:53.790> time<00:05:53.970> for<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.720> house<00:05:54.810> to

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
do make it out in time for the house to

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.260 
do make it out in time for the house to
go<00:05:55.200> down<00:05:55.500> and<00:05:56.010> I'm<00:05:56.310> not<00:05:56.520> quite<00:05:56.760> sure<00:05:56.820> if<00:05:57.090> that

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
go down and I'm not quite sure if that

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.120 
go down and I'm not quite sure if that
would<00:05:57.420> count<00:05:57.600> but<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.560> doesn't<00:05:58.860> matter<00:05:58.980> cuz

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
would count but it doesn't matter cuz

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.800 
would count but it doesn't matter cuz
he's<00:05:59.280> probably<00:05:59.400> already<00:05:59.610> taken<00:06:00.000> out<00:06:00.090> what

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
he's probably already taken out what

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.650 
he's probably already taken out what
about<00:06:01.140> 10<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.620> 15<00:06:01.920> houses<00:06:02.340> already<00:06:02.580> so<00:06:03.060> just

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510
