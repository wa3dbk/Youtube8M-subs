00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
kind of do it I play the key the key is

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.999 
kind of do it I play the key the key is
a<00:00:26.640> flat<00:00:26.910> minor<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> play<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> flat<00:00:28.800> minor<00:00:29.039> 7

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
a flat minor so I play a flat minor 7

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.340 
a flat minor so I play a flat minor 7
okay<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.250> then<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.630> don't<00:00:33.809> know<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
okay and then I don't know if this is a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.319 
okay and then I don't know if this is a
chord<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:34.800> whatever<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.670> put<00:00:36.000> my<00:00:36.030> middle

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
chord or whatever but I put my middle

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.520 
chord or whatever but I put my middle
finger<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> 8th<00:00:37.230> fret<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.829> 5th<00:00:38.820> string

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
finger on the 8th fret of the 5th string

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.770 
finger on the 8th fret of the 5th string
so<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.670> root<00:00:41.879> note<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.239> an<00:00:42.390> F<00:00:42.540> but

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
so it's like a the root note is an F but

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.209 
so it's like a the root note is an F but
it's<00:00:42.960> still<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.350> E<00:00:43.379> flat<00:00:43.559> minor<00:00:44.040> 7<00:00:44.760> shape

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.979 

and<00:00:49.219> then<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.329> go<00:00:50.540> to<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.930> a<00:00:51.379> flat<00:00:51.800> minor<00:00:52.100> seven

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
and then I go to a a flat minor seven

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.939 
and then I go to a a flat minor seven
down<00:00:53.989> here<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.200> the<00:00:54.320> fourth<00:00:54.530> fret<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:56.949> then

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
down here to the fourth fret and then

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.549 
down here to the fourth fret and then
finally<00:00:58.489> resolving<00:00:59.000> on<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.180> not<00:00:59.960> resolving<00:01:00.350> but

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
finally resolving on a not resolving but

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.810 
finally resolving on a not resolving but
the<00:01:01.550> last<00:01:01.699> chord<00:01:02.059> is<00:01:02.149> a<00:01:02.210> b-flat<00:01:02.690> minor<00:01:02.840> seven

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820
