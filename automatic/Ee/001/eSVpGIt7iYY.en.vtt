hypothetically<00:01:38.880> Ronaldo<00:01:39.630> should<00:01:39.869> always<00:01:40.110> be

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
hypothetically Ronaldo should always be

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.490 
hypothetically Ronaldo should always be
a<00:01:40.770> striker<00:01:41.280> or<00:01:41.610> worst<00:01:42.000> case<00:01:42.450> scenario<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> left

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
a striker or worst case scenario a left

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.859 
a striker or worst case scenario a left
winger<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.100> don't<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.850> using<00:01:45.119> him<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
winger I don't like using him on the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
winger I don't like using him on the
left<00:01:46.079> because<00:01:46.500> he<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.280> has<00:01:47.610> too<00:01:48.000> much

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
left because he just has too much

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.960 
left because he just has too much
quality<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.200> finishing<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.040> waste<00:01:50.369> him<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
quality in finishing to waste him on the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.960 
quality in finishing to waste him on the
wind<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.810> prefer<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.320> sub<00:01:52.770> him<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.220> after

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
wind so I prefer to sub him in after

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.660 
wind so I prefer to sub him in after
minute<00:01:54.299> one<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:55.079> doesn't<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:56.310> problems

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
minute one so he doesn't get problems

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.179 
minute one so he doesn't get problems
with<00:01:56.939> chemistry<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.320> sub<00:01:58.560> him<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
with chemistry you can sub him in in a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.300 
with chemistry you can sub him in in a
formation<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.479> two<00:02:00.750> strikers<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.469> use<00:02:01.950> him

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
formation with two strikers and use him

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.429 
formation with two strikers and use him
as<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> left<00:02:02.820> striker<00:02:03.180> or<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.170> substitute

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
as a left striker or you can substitute

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.429 
as a left striker or you can substitute
him<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.310> formation<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:06.360> only<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:07.020> striker

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
him in a formation with only one striker

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.999 
him in a formation with only one striker
and<00:02:07.740> maybe<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.879> where<00:02:09.119> he<00:02:09.360> performs<00:02:10.200> his

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
and maybe this is where he performs his

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.640 
and maybe this is where he performs his
best<00:02:11.340> because<00:02:11.640> he<00:02:12.150> has<00:02:12.420> all<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:13.080> X
