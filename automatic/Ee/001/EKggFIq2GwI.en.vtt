right now I was MVP I've got four we see
that<00:02:10.530> red<00:02:10.679> red<00:02:10.920> bar<00:02:11.190> at<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.430> bottom<00:02:11.489> right

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that red red bar at the bottom right

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.510 
that red red bar at the bottom right
there<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
there with the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.680 
there with the
insignia<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:12.970> then<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.240> have<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.420> four

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
insignia and then you have the four

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.410 
insignia and then you have the four
right<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.590> number<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.420> represents

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
right that number in it represents

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.690 
right that number in it represents
basically<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:17.140> you'll<00:02:17.830> see<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.100> there's<00:02:18.340> 60

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
basically so you'll see that there's 60

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.580 
basically so you'll see that there's 60
times<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.120> have<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.270> get<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.570> MVP<00:02:19.690> once<00:02:20.500> you

all this a lot of it's going to be

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.280 
all this a lot of it's going to be
changed<00:02:33.580> obviously<00:02:33.730> when<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.330> full<00:02:34.750> game<00:02:34.990> is

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
I did pretty good I guess I didn't

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.380

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.320 
really pick it up that that often but
270<00:04:48.110> kills<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.500> not<00:04:48.680> bad<00:04:48.890> not<00:04:49.700> bad<00:04:49.730> at<00:04:49.910> all<00:04:50.090> I

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
270 kills is not bad not bad at all I

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.060 
270 kills is not bad not bad at all I
have<00:04:50.930> way<00:04:51.200> more<00:04:51.230> kills<00:04:51.620> with<00:04:51.770> it<00:04:51.890> than<00:04:51.980> the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
have way more kills with it than the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.700 
have way more kills with it than the
boom<00:04:52.250> shot<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:52.760> that's<00:04:53.720> that's<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.320> good<00:04:54.470> sign<00:04:54.680> i

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
boom shot so that's that's a good sign i

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.380 
boom shot so that's that's a good sign i
guess<00:04:55.010> i<00:04:55.280> don't<00:04:55.610> i'm<00:04:55.910> not<00:04:55.940> really<00:04:56.180> gonna<00:04:56.270> be
