00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 I will ride in magnificent French 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.150
 tanks 5 fbi and one of course this tank 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.730
 has a lot of unpleasant names but 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.650
 Nevertheless , I consider him the best on the fifth 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.180
 level to the best heavy tanks on the fifth 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.510
 more than that, this is one of my 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.810
 favorite tanks 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.630
 I like him a lot because of my 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.570
 high alfia 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.510
 thanks to its quite good dynamic 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 characteristics but unfortunately awful 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.500
 armored absolutely cardboard but it 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.829
 character characteristic of all 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.950
 French tanks threw us and seventh 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.320
 the cause is worse to throw us just 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.420
 his forks although no theoretically could 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.789
 throw even worse if everyone were 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.789
 seventh I we were the last 5 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.270
 corr values ​​like me 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.689
 most likely I will go to the city because 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.460
 insist here i'm not in principle i 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:21.640
 I like to play like I like to play like 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.960
 captive on this tank but 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.750
 case 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.330
 just do not ride because of the enemies 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.920
 there is a very enemy there are so many techniques 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.100
 which surpasses me in its 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 characteristics 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.180
 i i think 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.869
 and we see that already trees and x and even 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.409
 punches I don't get hurried 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.320
 so do not 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.210
 you 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.310
 I don't know how he is here so quickly 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.430
 turned out to be just missed she rather 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.060
 the whole plot will die at least me and 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:00.530
 try to contribute wow 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.690
 you get to 425 from someone I even 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.650
 I do not know how they are so fast here 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:14.790
 besieged to and it is worth forgetting that 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:20.870
 fighting in capture mode in assault mode i 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.870
 I have a tower of the enemy which 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.609
 successfully shot for the fight you can try 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.099
 pierce you who are like all smart guys 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.849
 decided to become an abortion and get me 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.700
 fate same 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.599
 here at last I make a good shot 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.659
 Well, nevertheless, I 'm doing it so much 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.430
 not worth it because in this fight you can 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.670
 always count exclusively 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:52.379
 but glows with 8 you can try 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.379
 plan to get there and even have a good chance 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.610
 random goal but here we have a class 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.860
 Well potential class ogrebaet 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.860
 there somewhere we have but 80 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.530
 taught 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.380
 our ally up 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.870
 so where are we 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.940
 at-8 is a big problem 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.840
 especially for us because we can 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.240
 punch it only 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.030
 bead and maybe maybe the back 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.730
 body part 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.790
 enemy garbage 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.700
 while trying to flee someone 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.159
 I ricochet this very badly need 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.159
 try to call in the safe 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:48.170
 drying lacquer a little lag so I 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:52.100
 do you did there so we are here 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.690
 we have enemy and full enemy T1 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.240
 heavy 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:01.520
 also full rebound on isu it is unlikely 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.370
 whether it will turn out and robs them but there is 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.570
 get me a visit bill it's not bad 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.300
 You can even try to drive off with 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.840
 but for her mind 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.269
 then our ally I drank for escapes 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.560
 flight is beautiful that is, we are not 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.560
 we deliver if thanks to your taste 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.750
 quite hard to immediately play and talk 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.520
 it really affects the syringe 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.230
 and on the stock these pains fall 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.169
 where how 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.379
 probably 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:49.639
 the question is not to forget about the essay but 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:52.039
 in advance you can try it great 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.800
 now shows one of my favorites 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.820
 favorite techniques tanked alongside the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.270
 sorry 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.900
 you can even try to make -2 pick 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.139
 that 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.139
 this 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.129
 hitting the rails was worth the wait 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.480
 a few seconds while he 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:17.790
 grin 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.890
 now most likely he will take an ally 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.040
 p1 heavy 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:28.700
 out of the tank side as I hatch 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:31.100
 for me of course I'm breaking through so from 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.620
 looking at me you can again his 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.040
 of course I would now be 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.180
 nice to set it on fire because 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.630
 fires the modules and 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.110
 and nice 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.650
 with us and I can get on 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.650
 somewhere 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.560
 how not passes but in vain 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.980
 go 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.980
 Ksyusha 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:02.700
 could seem the second floor 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:05.129
 Well, not frags happiness part 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.470
 is that we have dragged this was 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:11.800
 if the whole how it does 90 percent 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.800
 to the player 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.490
 somewhere remains this 820 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:23.720
 interesting here we see you 8 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:26.539
 last time most likely at-8 now 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:31.090
 try to go shoot down a capture either 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:33.620
 will try to go and pick up our arta 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.120
 our allies have already left to meet 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.210
 so 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:43.389
 little chance in the meantime we are capturing 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:51.470
 the base is all absolutely relaxed 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:58.030
 good fight victory 1260 damage that is 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:58.030
 average result that we 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:04.289
 need many pachino on damagu 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:07.240
 fourth place by experience in first place 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:10.870
 that is, this is usually pretty 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:14.939
 normal battle in a french heavy tank 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:19.810
 Level 5 bdr g1 b 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:23.560
 notice 20,000 silver clean 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:26.789
 that is, this tank is pretty good farmer thanks 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.789
 for watching bye
