start<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.149> my<00:00:36.239> problems<00:00:36.660> after<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.050> I

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
start of my problems after that I

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200 
start of my problems after that I
decided<00:00:37.350> by<00:00:37.590> Justin<00:00:38.010> pogey<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.610> back<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:39.030> for

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.389 
decided by Justin pogey to back up for
DiPietro<00:00:39.780> because<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.770> game<00:00:40.860> goalies

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
DiPietro because in this game goalies

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.250 
DiPietro because in this game goalies
have<00:00:41.579> fatigue<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.540> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.809> stupid<00:00:43.020> I

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
have fatigue which is kind of stupid I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.360 
have fatigue which is kind of stupid I
think<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> nuisance<00:00:44.129> than

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
think it's just more of a nuisance than

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.569 
think it's just more of a nuisance than
anything<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.800> beside<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> pick<00:00:47.100> him<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
anything and beside I pick him up that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.240 
anything and beside I pick him up that
way<00:00:47.700> when<00:00:47.910> deep<00:00:48.390> yet<00:00:48.600> rope<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.590> tired<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.129> can

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
way when deep yet rope is tired I can

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.790 
way when deep yet rope is tired I can
sub<00:00:50.460> him<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.379> got<00:00:52.500> him<00:00:52.710> for

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.890 
eloquently Danny Sabourin from a free
pack<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.060> pretty<00:01:06.240> sure<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.570> when<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> looked

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
pack I'm pretty sure and when I looked

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.750 
pack I'm pretty sure and when I looked
in<00:01:06.990> my<00:01:07.049> collection<00:01:07.530> who<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.159> actually<00:01:08.400> two

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
in my collection who is actually two

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.700

overall<00:01:08.970> higher<00:01:09.360> than<00:01:09.689> bogey

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
overall higher than bogey

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
overall higher than bogey
so<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> decided<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.030> keep<00:01:12.420> him<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:12.960> these

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.570 
so I decided just to keep him for these
worth<00:01:13.229> zero<00:01:13.470> points<00:01:13.530> cuz<00:01:13.979> I'm<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.250> free<00:01:14.400> pack

the Jets logo yeah so I thought I'd be
able<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.860> beat<00:01:38.009> him<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.310> our<00:01:38.490> teams<00:01:38.670> are

able to beat him you know our teams are

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.880 
able to beat him you know our teams are
really<00:01:38.909> similar<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.900> only<00:01:40.020> had<00:01:40.170> one<00:01:40.200> loss<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
really similar and I only had one loss I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.140 
really similar and I only had one loss I
really<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> couple<00:01:41.460> losses<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.060> was

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
really are like a couple losses so I was

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.050 
really are like a couple losses so I was
feeling<00:01:42.509> pretty<00:01:42.600> good<00:01:43.549> came<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.000> is

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
feeling pretty good came in and this is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.530 
feeling pretty good came in and this is
the<00:01:45.180> only<00:01:45.600> goal<00:01:45.780> actually<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.500> game<00:01:46.970> as<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the only goal actually the game as you

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.999 
the only goal actually the game as you
see<00:01:48.720> I'm<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:48.840> missing<00:01:49.259> point<00:01:49.530> shots<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
see I'm just missing point shots and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.410 
see I'm just missing point shots and
this<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.159> no<00:01:50.250> one's<00:01:50.399> -<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.759> finally<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.149> dish

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
this is no one's - I finally just dish

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.780 
this is no one's - I finally just dish
it<00:01:51.540> out<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.720> front<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.290> goal<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.790> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it out in front and get to goal and that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.190 
it out in front and get to goal and that
was<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.750> me<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.049> I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
was like that was it for me I think I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.050 
was like that was it for me I think I
lost<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> 6-3<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.430> actually<00:01:56.700> no<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> just

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
lost like a 6-3 so actually no I just

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.450 
lost like a 6-3 so actually no I just
got<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> couple<00:01:57.509> more<00:01:57.659> after<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.460> didn't

got a couple more after that but didn't

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.420 
got a couple more after that but didn't
really<00:01:59.640> matter<00:01:59.820> still<00:02:00.210> lost<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> mean<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.310> was

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
really matter still lost so I mean I was

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.190 
really matter still lost so I mean I was
getting<00:02:02.850> pretty<00:02:02.969> disappointed<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.960> I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
getting pretty disappointed I was like I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.920 
getting pretty disappointed I was like I
lost<00:02:05.130> my<00:02:05.280> last<00:02:05.399> two<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> row<00:02:06.000> actually<00:02:06.810> when

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
lost my last two in a row actually when

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.359 
lost my last two in a row actually when
I've<00:02:06.990> been<00:02:07.020> three<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.409> row<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.250> was

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
I've been three in a row I think I was

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.979 
I've been three in a row I think I was
four<00:02:08.550> when<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.849> I'm<00:02:09.030> not<00:02:09.360> actually<00:02:09.479> sure<00:02:09.660> but

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
four when one I'm not actually sure but

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.750 
four when one I'm not actually sure but
as<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.649> see<00:02:10.770> guys<00:02:10.860> sold<00:02:11.129> pony<00:02:11.400> which<00:02:11.640> is

really good
and<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.319> be<00:02:13.379> much<00:02:13.530> all<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.040> went

as you can see Sabourin still starting

the Winterhawks logo and he actually had

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.000

Ryan<00:02:33.629> Johansson<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.260> his<00:02:34.439> starting<00:02:34.680> senator

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
Ryan Johansson as his starting senator

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.800 
Ryan Johansson as his starting senator
Ryan<00:02:35.189> Hansen<00:02:35.459> place<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.239> Winterhawks<00:02:36.480> he

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
Ryan Hansen place for the Winterhawks he

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.569 
Ryan Hansen place for the Winterhawks he
don't<00:02:37.079> know<00:02:37.170> he's<00:02:37.409> a<00:02:37.439> top<00:02:37.890> prospect<00:02:38.159> for<00:02:38.519> the

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
don't know he's a top prospect for the

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.759 
don't know he's a top prospect for the
Blue<00:02:38.730> Jackets<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.930> that's<00:02:40.170> originally<00:02:40.560> plan

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
Blue Jackets so that's originally plan

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.050 
Blue Jackets so that's originally plan
that<00:02:40.890> stood<00:02:41.010> out<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.250> me<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.400> his<00:02:41.549> team<00:02:41.579> so<00:02:42.030> I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
that stood out to me on his team so I

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.000 
that stood out to me on his team so I
figured<00:02:42.359> it's<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.569> easy<00:02:42.900> win<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.739> right<00:02:43.890> here

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
figured it's the easy win and right here

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.979 
figured it's the easy win and right here
I<00:02:44.040> get<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> pretty<00:02:45.150> nice<00:02:45.299> goal<00:02:45.659> just<00:02:45.810> deep

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
I get a pretty nice goal just deep

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.839 
I get a pretty nice goal just deep
through<00:02:46.200> some<00:02:46.349> guys<00:02:46.530> like<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.799> cross<00:02:47.519> priest

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
through some guys like a cross priest

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.610 
through some guys like a cross priest
Evander<00:02:48.239> Kane<00:02:48.450> when<00:02:49.079> I<00:02:49.170> still<00:02:49.379> ended<00:02:49.470> up

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
Evander Kane when I still ended up

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.530 
Evander Kane when I still ended up
losing<00:02:49.799> for<00:02:50.220> one<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.609> was<00:02:50.639> my<00:02:50.790> only<00:02:50.970> goal<00:02:51.150> so

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
losing for one that was my only goal so

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.569 
losing for one that was my only goal so
as<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.470> guys<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.769> see<00:02:52.829> this<00:02:53.069> is<00:02:53.220> not<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.400> good

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
as you guys can see this is not a good

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.250 
as you guys can see this is not a good
day<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:54.000> probably<00:02:54.329> should<00:02:54.750> stop<00:02:55.019> playing

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
losing with or without him so side as

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.479 
losing with or without him so side as
might<00:03:15.450> as<00:03:15.510> well<00:03:15.599> get<00:03:15.720> some<00:03:15.900> pucks<00:03:16.139> for<00:03:16.319> him

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489

upgrade<00:03:18.690> cards<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:19.049> him<00:03:19.169> like<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.319> +5<00:03:20.010> high<00:03:20.639> or

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
upgrade cards on him like a +5 high or

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.330 
upgrade cards on him like a +5 high or
something<00:03:21.359> in<00:03:21.480> like<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.629> +9<00:03:22.230> quickness<00:03:22.560> or<00:03:22.859> +7

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
something in like a +9 quickness or +7

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.059 
something in like a +9 quickness or +7
quickness<00:03:23.900> something<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.169> so<00:03:25.829> I<00:03:25.889> kind

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
quickness something like that so I kind

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.319 
quickness something like that so I kind
of<00:03:26.099> wasted<00:03:26.400> those<00:03:26.519> cards<00:03:26.879> but<00:03:27.060> oh<00:03:27.120> well

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
of wasted those cards but oh well

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.849 
of wasted those cards but oh well
hopefully<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:28.139> get<00:03:28.199> a<00:03:28.319> little<00:03:28.440> bit<00:03:28.590> more<00:03:28.739> out<00:03:28.829> of

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
hopefully I get a little bit more out of

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.890 
hopefully I get a little bit more out of
them<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.669> I'm<00:03:29.760> pretty<00:03:30.030> sure<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.569> ended<00:03:30.780> up

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
them and I'm pretty sure that I ended up

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.159 
them and I'm pretty sure that I ended up
pricing<00:03:31.379> him<00:03:31.560> at<00:03:31.739> start<00:03:32.220> price<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:33.019> 3,000<00:03:34.019> and

pricing him at start price of 3,000 and

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.550 
pricing him at start price of 3,000 and
by<00:03:34.379> now<00:03:34.669> 4,000<00:03:35.669> I<00:03:35.699> believe<00:03:36.230> not<00:03:37.230> exactly

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
by now 4,000 I believe not exactly

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.619 
by now 4,000 I believe not exactly
positive<00:03:37.799> but<00:03:38.400> I'm<00:03:38.609> pretty<00:03:39.030> sure<00:03:39.090> ended<00:03:39.540> up

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
positive but I'm pretty sure ended up

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.330 
positive but I'm pretty sure ended up
doing<00:03:39.900> as<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.769> see<00:03:40.889> right<00:03:41.010> here<00:03:41.069> I'm<00:03:41.250> just

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
doing as you can see right here I'm just

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.890 
doing as you can see right here I'm just
kind<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.639> staring<00:03:41.879> at<00:03:42.060> him<00:03:42.150> like<00:03:42.180> should<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.840> do

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
kind of staring at him like should I do

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.500 
kind of staring at him like should I do
this<00:03:43.169> should<00:03:43.229> I<00:03:43.530> know<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:44.430> did<00:03:45.030> decide<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.389> do

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
it obviously and I don't think it was

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.539 
it obviously and I don't think it was
too<00:03:48.510> bad<00:03:48.599> of<00:03:48.720> an<00:03:48.810> idea<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.229> mean<00:03:49.769> you'll<00:03:50.340> see

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
playing now I don't understand that

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.180 
playing now I don't understand that
because<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:19.289> don't<00:04:19.739> know<00:04:19.829> how<00:04:19.919> they're<00:04:20.070> my

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
because I don't know how they're my

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.560 
because I don't know how they're my
tournament<00:04:20.639> or<00:04:20.729> if<00:04:20.849> you<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.060> play<00:04:21.329> random

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
tournament or if you just play random

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.850 
tournament or if you just play random
people<00:04:21.870> but<00:04:22.019> you're<00:04:22.260> in<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.380> tournament<00:04:22.590> I

people but you're in the tournament I

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.070 
people but you're in the tournament I
think<00:04:22.889> that's<00:04:23.159> stupid<00:04:23.370> but<00:04:23.719> whatever<00:04:24.719> I<00:04:24.779> place

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
think that's stupid but whatever I place
