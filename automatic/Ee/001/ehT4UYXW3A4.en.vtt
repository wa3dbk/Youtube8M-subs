favorite kitchen I've ever made because

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.729 
favorite kitchen I've ever made because
it's<00:02:44.829> so<00:02:45.160> practical<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.870> island<00:02:47.349> counter

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
it's so practical and the island counter

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.620 
it's so practical and the island counter
in<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:47.920> middle<00:02:48.280> was<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.459> very<00:02:48.760> creative<00:02:49.150> idea<00:02:49.360> I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
in the middle was a very creative idea I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.220 
in the middle was a very creative idea I
thought<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.230> course<00:02:50.980> this<00:02:51.190> has<00:02:51.400> just<00:02:51.640> general

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
thought of course this has just general

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.610 
thought of course this has just general
equipment<00:02:53.230> use<00:02:53.380> for<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:54.510> sims<00:02:55.510> 3<00:02:55.599> kitchen<00:02:56.290> so

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
equipment use for a sims 3 kitchen so

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.740 
equipment use for a sims 3 kitchen so
it's<00:02:56.890> pretty<00:02:57.190> standard<00:02:57.579> but<00:02:57.879> I've<00:02:58.269> added<00:02:58.510> a

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
it's pretty standard but I've added a

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.080 
it's pretty standard but I've added a
bit<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:59.049> creative<00:02:59.410> flair<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.370> if<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.640> can<00:03:00.819> say

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
bit of creative flair to it if I can say

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.089 
bit of creative flair to it if I can say
that<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.540> I've<00:03:01.989> used<00:03:02.170> move<00:03:02.440> objects<00:03:02.980> to

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
that and I've used move objects to

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.430 
that and I've used move objects to
attach<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.610> bar<00:03:03.819> here<00:03:04.420> we<00:03:04.599> are<00:03:04.629> going<00:03:05.170> into

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
attach the bar here we are going into

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.559 
attach the bar here we are going into
the<00:03:05.620> sunken<00:03:06.220> dining<00:03:06.730> room<00:03:06.940> this<00:03:07.120> was<00:03:07.329> a<00:03:07.360> bit

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
the sunken dining room this was a bit

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.170 
the sunken dining room this was a bit
creative<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.379> thought<00:03:08.709> as<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.430> can<00:03:09.579> see<00:03:09.849> it's

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
creative I thought as you can see it's

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.809 
creative I thought as you can see it's
on<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> lower<00:03:11.290> level<00:03:11.590> which<00:03:11.890> is<00:03:12.040> quite<00:03:12.310> nice<00:03:12.519> and

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
on a lower level which is quite nice and

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.360 
on a lower level which is quite nice and
last<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:14.140> not<00:03:14.349> least<00:03:14.650> here<00:03:14.920> we<00:03:14.950> are<00:03:15.069> in<00:03:15.280> the
