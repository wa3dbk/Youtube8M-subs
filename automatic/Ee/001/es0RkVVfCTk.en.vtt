which<00:01:36.030> will<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.360> halfway<00:01:36.780> down<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> game

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
which will be halfway down the game

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.890

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
because even though heavy ammo these

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090 
because even though heavy ammo these
games<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.180> very<00:01:45.450> very<00:01:45.720> fast<00:01:46.079> paced<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.770> even

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
games are very very fast paced and even

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.950 
games are very very fast paced and even

though heavy mo may not be that big of a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
though heavy mo may not be that big of a
deal<00:01:49.170> since<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.770> coming<00:01:50.040> every<00:01:50.430> three

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
deal since it's not coming every three

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.999 
deal since it's not coming every three
minutes<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.149> regular<00:01:51.720> crucible<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.439> still

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
minutes like regular crucible it still

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.740 
minutes like regular crucible it still
does<00:01:53.250> make<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> big<00:01:53.729> difference<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.299> keep<00:01:54.570> an

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
does make a big difference so keep an

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.899 
does make a big difference so keep an

map<00:02:56.849> control<00:02:57.329> because<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.629> guess<00:02:57.840> none<00:02:58.439> of<00:02:58.560> us

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
map control because I guess none of us

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.530 
map control because I guess none of us
are<00:02:58.829> very<00:02:59.010> familiar<00:02:59.219> with<00:02:59.669> this<00:02:59.760> map<00:02:59.969> but<00:03:00.510> oh

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
there's my ten kill streak but what we

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.940 
there's my ten kill streak but what we
are<00:03:03.000> doing<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.540> we're<00:03:04.079> going<00:03:04.349> around<00:03:04.680> just

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950

not<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.139> great<00:03:07.349> they're<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:07.709> very

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
not that great they're not very

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.649 
not that great they're not very
coordinated<00:03:08.129> either<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.060> when<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.389> do<00:03:09.629> have

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
full team or people that know what

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.750 
full team or people that know what
they're<00:03:13.469> doing<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.010> they're<00:03:14.159> communicating

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
they're doing and they're communicating

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.819 
they're doing and they're communicating
yeah<00:03:15.599> it's<00:03:15.780> going<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:15.989> be<00:03:16.109> a<00:03:16.139> lot<00:03:16.379> tougher<00:03:16.590> to

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
yeah it's going to be a lot tougher to

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.770 
yeah it's going to be a lot tougher to
beat<00:03:16.859> them<00:03:17.159> right<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.669> gotta<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.389> sure

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
