00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.760
 openoffice 3.0 is out and I want to 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.410
 in this workshop show how to do it 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.719
 relatively quick and easy to install 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.059
 Can you have that open office package 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.800
 download to www points 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.320
 go to openoffice.org 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.960
 you have this file on the desktop with 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.609
 he opens the dmg with a double click 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.830
 image of team openoffice.org dropped 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.710
 the rows in the applications 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.250
 the whole is then copied that could 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.920
 right now see here at the moment it is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.680
 here is a word if we from 407 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.480
 Megabyte speak but she also saw 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.559
 everything in it 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.620
 that is, database spreadsheet 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.730
 word processing, graphic processing 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.190
 Scheduling so it's really real 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.140
 very many programs in there about 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.530
 so 30 seconds then the whole is done 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.789
 installed when the whole is done 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:09.180
 can you go and have your partner 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.590
 because and where are we at home lmno 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.020
 open office org 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.900
 we clearly asked the question 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.170
 the first time we win that more 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.130
 that's more likely if he does that now 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.900
 the first time the openoffice opens 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.960
 It takes a little moment because he 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.810
 Of course, first of all the system has to be used 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.720
 to prepare practically for it 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.939
 that means you practically see the window 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.840
 in which openoffice is opened and then 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.899
 are you always welcome window us 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.040
 So go through the setup wizard 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:51.990
 Here you can enter in first names 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.520
 he made a shortcut to it car times 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.630
 I also wanted to search for updates 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.280
 i would definitely do that 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.140
 I would basically recommend 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.930
 you can join openoffice 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.760
 register but you must not do 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.380
 however, you can decide that yourself 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.350
 I will decide later too 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.980
 do not register me there 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.620
 you just go to finish and that 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.480
 whole works now again in 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.739
 background and then he opens 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.360
 openoffice the first time that ever 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.020
 which systems have at the moment 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.020
 can last 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.590
 if now openoffice the first time 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.920
 you have opened son you come 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.870
 window you get it though 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.670
 opened eat later on can you 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.790
 decide if a text document of 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.370
 presentation a database of tables 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.800
 Documents times or formula editor 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.670
 you want to be able to do the template as well 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:56.489
 open vending text document you 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.040
 Are you a text document now ? 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.150
 value also knows the relative 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.150
 Get to know each other quickly 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.590
 that's how it looks with other programs 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.940
 from that we are new here on file 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.380
 you can decide right now 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.000
 would like to do the drawings 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:20.040
 database tables document so that is 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.040
 you get an excel table here 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.590
 okay that 's it from my side me 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.760
 Hope you liked it and we are 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.760
 us despite the next workshop
