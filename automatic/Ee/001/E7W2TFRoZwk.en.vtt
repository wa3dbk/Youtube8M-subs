muscle work your progress is gonna be

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.910 
muscle work your progress is gonna be
very<00:02:11.540> slow<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.200> know<00:02:12.260> something<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.800> could

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
very slow you know something you could

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.800 
very slow you know something you could
do<00:02:13.070> guys<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.580> just<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.150> said<00:02:14.390> apples

do guys it's just like I said apples
forty<00:02:15.170> second<00:02:15.620> sets<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.550> there<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.820> know<00:02:16.910> time

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
forty second sets in there you know time

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.690 
forty second sets in there you know time
under<00:02:17.570> tension<00:02:17.830> if<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.010> do<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.490> notice

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
under tension if you do that you notice

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.460 
under tension if you do that you notice
you're<00:02:20.270> gonna<00:02:20.360> get<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.570> bigger<00:02:20.840> pump<00:02:21.200> more

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
you're gonna get a bigger pump more

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.040 
you're gonna get a bigger pump more
muscle<00:02:21.920> contraction<00:02:22.640> over<00:02:23.300> times<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.870> only

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
muscle contraction over times and only

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.990 
muscle contraction over times and only
two<00:02:24.200> more<00:02:24.320> muscle<00:02:24.740> growth<00:02:24.920> if<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.850> keep

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
two more muscle growth if you just keep

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.090 
two more muscle growth if you just keep
doing<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.300> regular<00:02:26.600> setting<00:02:27.050> or<00:02:27.140> just<00:02:27.290> pushing

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
doing a regular setting or just pushing

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.500 
doing a regular setting or just pushing
up<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.340> down<00:02:28.580> pushing<00:02:28.850> some<00:02:29.090> have<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.330> wait

up and down pushing some have you wait
you<00:02:29.690> know<00:02:29.780> for<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.020> couple<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.650> reps<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.610> know

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
you know for a couple of reps you know

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.300 
you know for a couple of reps you know
20-second<00:02:32.390> reps<00:02:32.630> you're<00:02:33.230> not<00:02:33.410> gonna<00:02:33.500> see<00:02:33.710> you

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
20-second reps you're not gonna see you

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.740 
20-second reps you're not gonna see you
see<00:02:34.610> progression<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:35.300> going<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.480> be<00:02:35.570> really

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.170 
see progression is going to be really
slowly<00:02:36.170> make<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.130> muscle<00:02:37.520> work<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.850> muscles

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
slowly make the muscle work the muscles

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.670 
slowly make the muscle work the muscles
gonna<00:02:38.330> grow<00:02:38.660> when<00:02:38.900> it's<00:02:39.050> under<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.320> lot<00:02:39.650> of

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
gonna grow when it's under a lot of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.220 
gonna grow when it's under a lot of
stress<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.670> want<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.330> put<00:02:41.510> as<00:02:41.600> much<00:02:41.840> stress<00:02:42.200> as
