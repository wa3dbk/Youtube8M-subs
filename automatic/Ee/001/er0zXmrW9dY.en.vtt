00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
falling right but I tried to do a

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.129

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
different technique I'm I saw pretty

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.730

particular<00:04:41.469> do<00:04:41.919> and<00:04:42.249> I<00:04:43.169> don't<00:04:44.169> know<00:04:44.289> I<00:04:44.469> had<00:04:44.650> to

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
particular do and I don't know I had to

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.279 
particular do and I don't know I had to
do<00:04:44.889> to<00:04:45.159> Barnes<00:04:45.729> but<00:04:45.939> my<00:04:46.180> hair<00:04:46.419> is<00:04:46.449> so<00:04:46.689> thick<00:04:46.719> and
