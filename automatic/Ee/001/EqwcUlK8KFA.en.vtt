00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
part there's a little retaining screw at

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.570 
part there's a little retaining screw at
the<00:01:05.519> bottom<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.119> comes<00:01:06.420> off<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:08.369> this

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the bottom which comes off and in this

the bottom which comes off and in this
slides<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:11.390> there<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> screw<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:14.159> undo

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
slides up and there is a screw to undo

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.810 
slides up and there is a screw to undo
here<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.470> that<00:01:16.470> slides<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.700> will

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
here and that slides up and it will

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.590 
here and that slides up and it will
slide<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.330> down<00:01:18.479> turn<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> screw<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
slide up and down turn the screw to to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.570 
slide up and down turn the screw to to
lock<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.520> little<00:01:23.580> retaining<00:01:24.180> screw

then<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.670> come<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> softbox<00:01:27.770> in<00:01:28.770> this

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
then we come to the softbox in this

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.710 
then we come to the softbox in this
small<00:01:29.820> bag<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:32.340> there<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.630> will

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
small bag and there it is and it will

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.390 
small bag and there it is and it will
spring<00:01:34.049> open<00:01:34.939> like<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.210> form<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.869> triangle

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
spring open like that form a triangle

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.719 
spring open like that form a triangle
all<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.150> pull<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> apart

all you have to do is pull it apart
slide<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> softbox<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:44.340> fits<00:01:44.579> on

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
slide it it is a softbox and it fits on

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.840 
slide it it is a softbox and it fits on
the<00:01:44.880> bracket<00:01:45.240> fairly<00:01:45.659> tightly<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:47.670> don't

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the bracket fairly tightly you don't

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.069 
the bracket fairly tightly you don't
want<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:49.070> coming<00:01:50.070> off<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.439> clips<00:01:52.680> in

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
want it coming off so it just clips in

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.050 
want it coming off so it just clips in
like<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:56.969> rotated<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.820> comes

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
like that and it can be rotated it comes

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.200 
like that and it can be rotated it comes
with<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:02.280> inner<00:02:02.700> diffuser<00:02:04.640> which<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.909> clips

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
with the inner diffuser which just clips

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.469 
with the inner diffuser which just clips
on

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:19.640 

like<00:02:09.479> so

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.429 

year<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.280> diffuse<00:02:20.730> disease<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.659> it<00:02:22.200> has

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
year in the diffuse disease and it has

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.920 
year in the diffuse disease and it has
now<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.680> diffuser<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:24.090> fits<00:02:24.329> with<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
now the diffuser that fits with the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.800 
now the diffuser that fits with the
hulking<00:02:25.230> oil<00:02:25.379> system<00:02:26.189> and<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.450> pushes

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
hulking oil system and this just pushes

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.539 
hulking oil system and this just pushes
up<00:02:28.819> pushes<00:02:29.819> on<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:32.150> really<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.329> is<00:02:33.540> what

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
up pushes on and really this is what

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:42.949 
up pushes on and really this is what
keeps<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.790> shape<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.629> soft<00:02:36.840> wax<00:02:41.959> this

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
keeps the shape of the soft wax this

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.130 
keeps the shape of the soft wax this
holds<00:02:43.379> it<00:02:43.470> all<00:02:43.590> nice<00:02:43.859> and<00:02:44.659> taut<00:02:45.659> and<00:02:45.959> you

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
holds it all nice and taut and you

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.229 
holds it all nice and taut and you
pusher<00:02:47.150> push<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.299> all<00:02:48.390> we're<00:02:48.659> out<00:02:48.689> there<00:02:50.239> and

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
pusher push it all we're out there and

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.379 
pusher push it all we're out there and
there<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.480> are<00:02:52.609> we<00:02:53.609> go<00:02:53.760> around<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.180> look<00:02:54.239> at

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
there you are we go around and look at

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.680 
there you are we go around and look at
the<00:02:54.450> back<00:02:54.659> now<00:02:56.000> if<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.389> wireless

twisting and bringing these hairs

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.680 
twisting and bringing these hairs
together<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.769> forms<00:03:59.159> a<00:03:59.280> loop<00:03:59.479> bring<00:04:00.479> that

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
together so it forms a loop bring that

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.839 
together so it forms a loop bring that
thumb<00:04:00.930> up<00:04:01.139> you<00:04:01.949> can<00:04:02.069> see<00:04:02.280> there's<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.579> loop

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
thumb up you can see there's a loop

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.649 
thumb up you can see there's a loop
being<00:04:03.299> pull<00:04:03.629> on<00:04:03.870> top<00:04:04.109> you<00:04:04.440> bring<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.829> over

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
being pull on top you bring that over

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.869 
being pull on top you bring that over
and<00:04:06.659> now<00:04:07.229> that's<00:04:07.470> small<00:04:07.739> enough<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:08.159> go<00:04:10.609> in<00:04:11.609> the

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
and now that's small enough to go in the

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:22.310 
and now that's small enough to go in the
bag

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.380
