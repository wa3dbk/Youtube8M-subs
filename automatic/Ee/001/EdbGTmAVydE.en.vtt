with<00:00:02.790> another<00:00:02.850> minecraft<00:00:03.330> build<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:04.110> will<00:00:04.890> see

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
with another minecraft build I will see

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.070 
with another minecraft build I will see
originally<00:00:05.430> with<00:00:05.609> my<00:00:05.940> idea<00:00:06.240> for<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.569> safe<00:00:06.810> room

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
originally with my idea for a safe room

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.140 
originally with my idea for a safe room
which<00:00:07.259> was<00:00:07.589> kind<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.980> neat<00:00:08.130> idea<00:00:08.250> for<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> safe

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
which was kind of a neat idea for a safe

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.480 
which was kind of a neat idea for a safe
room<00:00:09.360> or<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.630> trip<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> series<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.010> wooden

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
room or you trip a series of wooden

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.919 
room or you trip a series of wooden
pressure<00:00:11.849> plates<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.540> would<00:00:12.630> open<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
pressure plates and that would open a

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.180 
pressure plates and that would open a
door<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.349> could<00:00:13.500> come<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.830> grab<00:00:14.070> your

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
door and you could come in grab your

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.220 
door and you could come in grab your
stuff<00:00:14.340> grab<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> item<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.900> closed<00:00:16.049> behind

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
stuff grab the item and it closed behind

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.810 
stuff grab the item and it closed behind
you<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.710> out<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.310> problem<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.699> it's

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
you and you get out the problem is it's

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.279 
you and you get out the problem is it's
not<00:00:17.880> really<00:00:18.330> what<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.539> wanted<00:00:18.990> because

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
not really what I wanted because

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.779 
not really what I wanted because
essentially<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:20.010> could<00:00:20.160> throw<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.490> item

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
essentially you could throw the item

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.450 
essentially you could throw the item
anyone<00:00:21.570> could<00:00:21.689> walk<00:00:21.810> through<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:23.250> doors

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
anyone could walk through and the doors

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.099 
anyone could walk through and the doors
would<00:00:23.640> still<00:00:23.820> stay<00:00:24.000> open<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.510> tell<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.720> item

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
would still stay open and tell that item

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.720 
would still stay open and tell that item
was<00:00:25.230> removed<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.099> there's<00:00:26.189> no<00:00:26.369> way<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
was removed and there's no way really to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.130 
was removed and there's no way really to
come<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.060> collect<00:00:27.210> items<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.810> get<00:00:27.930> through

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
come and collect items and get through

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.950 
come and collect items and get through
before<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.619> doors<00:00:28.800> closed<00:00:29.570> overall<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.840> was

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
before the doors closed overall it was

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.790 
before the doors closed overall it was
just<00:00:31.070> impractical<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.969> did<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> kind

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
just impractical so I did this is a kind

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.549 
just impractical so I did this is a kind
of<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.950> panic<00:00:35.520> room<00:00:35.550> mark<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.380> what<00:00:37.530> I

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
of a panic room mark to this is what I

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.470 
of a panic room mark to this is what I
really<00:00:37.860> had<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.129> mind<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.730> let<00:00:39.300> me<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.450> ahead

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
really had in mind so let me go ahead

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.880 
really had in mind so let me go ahead
and<00:00:39.629> show<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.809> how<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.200> works<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.800> if

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and show you how this works and see if

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.190 
and show you how this works and see if
you<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.270> basically<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.870> general

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you like it basically I have a general

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
you like it basically I have a general
safe<00:00:43.440> room<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> series<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.789> alcoves

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
safe room with a series of alcoves

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.260 
safe room with a series of alcoves
around<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> password

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
around it and if you know the password

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.670 
around it and if you know the password
when<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.360> put<00:00:48.510> down<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> redstone<00:00:49.079> torch<00:00:49.200> in

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
when you put down a redstone torch in

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.490 
when you put down a redstone torch in
the<00:00:49.710> right<00:00:49.920> order<00:00:50.719> what<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.379> when

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the right order what you can do is when

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.260 
the right order what you can do is when
you<00:00:52.590> place<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> last<00:00:53.250> torch<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> timer

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you place the last torch it's on a timer

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.990 
you place the last torch it's on a timer
so<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.050> you're<00:00:55.140> fast<00:00:55.530> about<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.010> break<00:00:56.820> that

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
so if you're fast about it break that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.560 
so if you're fast about it break that
torch<00:00:57.300> break<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.760> break<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> come<00:01:00.210> back<00:01:00.390> in

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
torch break it break it come back in

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.680 
torch break it break it come back in
time<00:01:00.750> get<00:01:01.320> through<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> door<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.690> bam

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
time get through the door and bam

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.020 
time get through the door and bam
automatically<00:01:04.439> closes<00:01:04.710> behind<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.519> now

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
automatically closes behind you and now

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.080 
automatically closes behind you and now
here<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:07.140> panic<00:01:07.590> room<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
here is your panic room and then you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.210 
here is your panic room and then you
also<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.869> little<00:01:10.290> extra<00:01:10.710> security<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
also have this little extra security you

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.210 
also have this little extra security you
can<00:01:11.340> flick<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.700> BAM<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.720> shuts<00:01:13.650> those<00:01:13.860> gates

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
can flick it BAM and shuts those gates

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.850 
can flick it BAM and shuts those gates
behind<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.200> effectively<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.590> what

torches as well well we put the panic

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.110 
torches as well well we put the panic
switch<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.020> when<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.470> opens

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.640 

this<00:01:46.720> is<00:01:46.840> what<00:01:46.960> they're<00:01:47.080> going<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.260> see<00:01:47.470> it's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
this is what they're going to see it's

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.640 
this is what they're going to see it's
just<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.890> wall<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.400> a<00:01:49.150> safe<00:01:49.420> so<00:01:50.410> they<00:01:50.440> can

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
just a wall and a safe so they can

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.290 
just a wall and a safe so they can
really<00:01:50.770> think<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.490> know<00:01:51.610> maybe<00:01:51.850> this<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.270> just

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
really think you know maybe this is just

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.330 
really think you know maybe this is just
extra<00:01:52.930> security<00:01:53.320> for<00:01:53.410> your<00:01:53.650> valuables<00:01:54.160> and

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
extra security for your valuables and

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.240 
extra security for your valuables and
leave<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.640> at<00:01:54.730> that<00:01:55.260> and<00:01:56.260> then<00:01:56.740> if<00:01:56.890> they<00:01:57.010> start

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
leave it at that and then if they start

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.840 
leave it at that and then if they start
breaking<00:01:57.580> through<00:01:57.790> here<00:01:59.250> you<00:02:00.250> can<00:02:00.400> set<00:02:00.520> up<00:02:00.670> an

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
breaking through here you can set up an

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.700 
breaking through here you can set up an
alarm<00:02:01.120> system<00:02:01.390> here<00:02:01.840> which<00:02:01.960> will<00:02:02.110> alert<00:02:02.470> you

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
alarm system here which will alert you

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.860 
alarm system here which will alert you
that<00:02:02.740> someone's<00:02:03.160> coming<00:02:03.460> in<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.940> bam<00:02:04.510> you<00:02:04.750> can

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
that someone's coming in and bam you can

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.680 
that someone's coming in and bam you can
make<00:02:04.990> your<00:02:05.170> escape<00:02:06.330> another<00:02:07.330> thing<00:02:07.510> I<00:02:07.570> like

make your escape another thing I like

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.950 
make your escape another thing I like
about<00:02:07.750> this<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:10.270> it's<00:02:10.630> also<00:02:11.190> has<00:02:12.190> traps

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
about this is that it's also has traps

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.270 
about this is that it's also has traps
so<00:02:13.960> let<00:02:14.050> me<00:02:14.080> run<00:02:14.320> down<00:02:14.350> here<00:02:14.710> real<00:02:15.010> quick<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.860> we

so let me run down here real quick so we

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.580 
so let me run down here real quick so we
have<00:02:18.460> this<00:02:18.640> three<00:02:19.030> one<00:02:19.360> two<00:02:19.600> three<00:02:19.750> position

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
have this three one two three position

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.560 
have this three one two three position
combination<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.430> if<00:02:21.880> any<00:02:22.060> one<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.270> these<00:02:22.390> are

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
combination and if any one of these are

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.070 
combination and if any one of these are
taken<00:02:22.900> off<00:02:23.490> after<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.610> pause<00:02:24.850> it'll<00:02:25.270> turn

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
taken off after the pause it'll turn

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.870 
taken off after the pause it'll turn
this<00:02:26.260> off<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.830> put<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.340> walls<00:02:27.490> back<00:02:29.880> however

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
this off and put the walls back however

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.870 
this off and put the walls back however
if<00:02:31.390> they<00:02:32.320> put<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.710> redstone<00:02:32.950> torch<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
if they put a redstone torch in the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.300 
if they put a redstone torch in the
wrong<00:02:34.330> position<00:02:34.570> any<00:02:35.140> one<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.770> these<00:02:36.010> wrong

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
wrong position any one of these wrong

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.070 
wrong position any one of these wrong
positions<00:02:36.820> what<00:02:37.000> I'll<00:02:37.090> do<00:02:37.240> is<00:02:37.360> it'll<00:02:37.600> start<00:02:37.990> a

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
positions what I'll do is it'll start a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.350 
positions what I'll do is it'll start a
trap<00:02:38.380> which<00:02:39.340> will<00:02:39.490> pour<00:02:39.730> lava<00:02:40.060> from<00:02:40.210> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
trap which will pour lava from the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.270 
trap which will pour lava from the
ceiling<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.870> attempt<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.290> kill<00:02:41.800> them<00:02:42.010> so

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
ceiling and attempt to kill them so

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.820 
ceiling and attempt to kill them so
we'll<00:02:42.400> do<00:02:42.520> this<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.350> again<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.500> trap<00:02:44.710> door

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
we'll do this and again the trap door

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.220 
we'll do this and again the trap door
open<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:45.460> would<00:02:45.700> normally<00:02:45.790> be<00:02:46.090> lava<00:02:46.360> come<00:02:47.080> in

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
open this would normally be lava come in

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.900 
open this would normally be lava come in
fill<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.710> room<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.520> best<00:02:48.700> thing<00:02:48.820> about

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
fill the room and the best thing about

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.890 
fill the room and the best thing about
this<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.480> if<00:02:50.110> they<00:02:50.230> remove<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.709> torch

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
this is that if they remove this torch

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.130 
this is that if they remove this torch
that<00:02:52.900> stays<00:02:53.200> open<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.550> it's<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.820> an<00:02:55.120> or<00:02:55.720> gate<00:02:55.750> I

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
that stays open so it's on an or gate I

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.560 
that stays open so it's on an or gate I
believe<00:02:56.410> is<00:02:56.530> what<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.709> call<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.570> basically

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
believe is what you call it basically

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.630 
believe is what you call it basically
this<00:02:58.780> will<00:02:58.959> stay<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.170> until<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.800> get<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
this will stay on until you get the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.020 
this will stay on until you get the
correct<00:03:00.850> combination<00:03:01.180> put<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:03.640> come<00:03:03.850> back

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
correct combination put in so come back

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.070 
correct combination put in so come back
here<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:06.520> will<00:03:06.730> turn<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.750> trap<00:03:08.050> off

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
here and that will turn the trap off

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.790 
here and that will turn the trap off
after<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.110> slight<00:03:11.350> delay<00:03:13.200> there<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:14.290> go<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:14.620> now

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
after a slight delay there we go so now

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.620 
after a slight delay there we go so now
the<00:03:14.980> doors<00:03:15.340> open<00:03:15.700> trap<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.540> turned<00:03:16.750> off<00:03:18.630> so

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
the doors open trap is turned off so

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.500 
the doors open trap is turned off so
that's<00:03:19.720> essentially<00:03:20.350> my<00:03:20.590> idea<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:22.209> obviously

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
that's essentially my idea and obviously

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.110 
that's essentially my idea and obviously
if<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.780> come<00:03:22.930> over<00:03:23.050> here<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.380> look<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.970> is

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
if you come over here and look this is

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.440 
if you come over here and look this is
not<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.330> simple<00:03:26.459> redstone<00:03:27.459> device<00:03:27.820> this<00:03:28.060> is<00:03:28.239> a

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
not a simple redstone device this is a

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.410 
not a simple redstone device this is a
little<00:03:29.080> intricate<00:03:29.560> but<00:03:30.000> really<00:03:31.000> wasn't<00:03:31.269> too

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
little intricate but really wasn't too

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.210 
little intricate but really wasn't too
hard<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.840> make<00:03:32.080> once<00:03:32.320> I<00:03:32.410> figured<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.830> out<00:03:32.950> if

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
hard to make once I figured it out if

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.729 
hard to make once I figured it out if
you<00:03:33.880> want<00:03:33.910> more<00:03:34.360> details<00:03:34.420> as<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.050> exactly<00:03:35.320> how
