00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
to check to see if the pattern was the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.380 
to check to see if the pattern was the
same<00:03:00.480> thing<00:03:00.900> as<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.260> I'm<00:03:02.130> for<00:03:02.340> shoes<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.850> to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
same thing as the I'm for shoes and to

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.960 
same thing as the I'm for shoes and to
my<00:03:03.570> knowledge<00:03:03.990> it<00:03:04.920> looks<00:03:05.160> like<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
my knowledge it looks like it is the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.330 
my knowledge it looks like it is the
same<00:03:06.000> pattern<00:03:06.500> going<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.620> let<00:03:07.740> me<00:03:07.830> verify<00:03:08.040> that

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
same pattern going on let me verify that

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.090 
same pattern going on let me verify that
yeah<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.720> same<00:03:09.930> pattern<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.440> both<00:03:10.680> the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
yeah it is the same pattern on both the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.470 
yeah it is the same pattern on both the
shoes<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.490> obviously<00:03:11.850> just<00:03:12.180> flipped<00:03:12.360> around

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
shoes just obviously just flipped around

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.260 
shoes just obviously just flipped around
because<00:03:13.340> we<00:03:14.340> have<00:03:14.550> left<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.300> right<00:03:17.120> but<00:03:18.120> this

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
because we have left and right but this

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.430 
because we have left and right but this
will<00:03:18.420> definitely<00:03:18.540> be<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.900> shoe<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.230> I'll<00:03:19.350> be

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440
