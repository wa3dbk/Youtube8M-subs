00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:19.110
 in this part of the instructions of the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:23.369
 table and lorenz first the seams 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.699
 of the hull glued to this I draw 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.510
 something concealed with microfiber 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.739
 Put the epoxy on a syringe and pull 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.050
 a little epoxide probably in the bumps 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.070
 between the plates the wires save 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.070
 I'm off again 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.760
 after it has cured epoxy 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.090
 I remove the third one 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.910
 the shapes are still something 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.060
 sewn and only at the top 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.720
 Fixing all other devices namely 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.720
 out 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.640
 Next, the epoxide will pick up 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.100
 the stitches are fed 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:41.380
 For this I glue the seams first off 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.380
 nice clean killen probably to reach 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.990
 Now I want some epoxide on that 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.760
 me with wood flour and microspheres 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:21.080
 Cover up the right advertising and 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.690
 has consistency and fill these in fit 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.980
 a syringe bag 1 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.800
 you can also do a simple one 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.810
 keep fresh bag 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:39.640
 I cut off a corner and can 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.640
 Now push the epoxide into the seams 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.900
 The throats were saved with a wood 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.240
 now smooth and remove right in 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.260
 connection to it 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.070
 excess and come out 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.070
 succeed 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:50.280
 are the local smooth removed 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.280
 I immediately tape that off 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.489
 put on the still fresh probably many 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:10.950
 I now put glass fabric on and 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:14.690
 Pressed it lightly without the 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.690
 fresh probably to damage 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.100
 then then the glass fabric 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:06.210
 tied with un-decorated oxide and one 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.830
 Brush soaked until it is complete 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.830
 has become transparent 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.940
 after a brushing of the fabric ribbon 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.160
 with epoxide the fabric structure is still 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.540
 very clearly visible but there are 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.250
 no more bright spots in the glass fabric 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.590
 these would show that here too few 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.340
 epoxide was used 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:55.540
 in the bow and stern, I also spatulate 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:59.730
 something densifies epoxide around this 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.730
 particular regions
