00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.350
 hello there we are again 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.619
 today we are going to learn how to eye one 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.050
 no murder for years 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.619
 what do you do we try to make a video 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.779
 to make 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.550
 oh sorry i love to see you 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.609
 how you want to burn it when you close 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.019
 the then far away no but for a moment 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.630
 serious 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:35.770
 this is an interesting i'm up in 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.470
 each other but how come you 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.980
 and see closely where this thou 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.680
 enters like me and also ways 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.030
 jantje quite easy 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.030
 see you also want is good idea 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.870
 hey boys and girls this movie is going 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.820
 so basically about subscribing 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.149
 I'll explain it to you first 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.039
 Start looking at parts of it too 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.309
 you see the outer part of it 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.220
 eye with eyebrows and eyelashes that 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.350
 protect us against dust and dirt 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.200
 you can also make the eye white nicely colored 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.360
 see iris and the pupil 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.610
 these parts are of course bad 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.130
 important but for focusing 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.380
 from wild we also have to agree 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.610
 more accurate viewing this is one 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.410
 schematic cross section of it too 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.130
 the harvest is here above and below 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.500
 pictured 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.500
 with this you can turn the eyeball 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.310
 further you see from the outside in the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:44.050
 Hard fleece with warm fleece often 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:48.460
 frieze and the retina in the retina 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.810
 are the sensitive senses we 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.939
 see the glassy body 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.049
 the optic nerve 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.539
 the iris and the pupil 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.670
 for focusing the image 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.939
 the front part of the eye 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.489
 very important with the lens 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.619
 namely dollar or cleaned 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.330
 to become 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.569
 this is done through good collaboration 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.580
 between the jet body 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.980
 the rens and rens drinks 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.709
 extra body is stuck on the edge of 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.849
 it often dirty and firm with the hard 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:33.860
 eye membrane connected in the jet body 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.860
 is the accommodation 4 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.290
 this muscle can tighten or 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.510
 relax 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.400
 look i have a model of this here 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.340
 part of the eye i like that for it 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.680
 accumulating care is in the center 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.680
 Imagine the lens The lens is moving with the lens 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.640
 pawns connected radiate body for 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.670
 natures 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.950
 let's have a toilet and bulbs first 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.269
 focus on an image in the distance 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.269
 am copying 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.920
 let me think 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.760
 I learned that that's why 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.709
 plant enzymes need doing quite like 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.859
 for example, you focus on the blackboard 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.079
 receive your beam body 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.299
 therefore it comes naturally 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.970
 original form and in this 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.620
 form is to combinations 4 in extra 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.450
 body limp and the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.670
 I see you the lens is now flat 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.290
 pulled through the lens mittens 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.079
 so the muscles in the radiation corridor 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.470
 are relaxed and the lens walls 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.359
 tightened at the lip now close as 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.450
 you are not close to focusing 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.819
 then you also have to put more effort into it 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.069
 The lens must be made bow 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.989
 muscles start tightening in radiation 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.850
 civil for together 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.900
 this causes the lens forks to come loose 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.769
 Windows 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.760
 the lens takes its natural waveform 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.260
 so just borrow 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.900
 For example, if there are reading 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.360
 then how most my body is constantly 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.390
 constrict 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.250
 indeed focusing far away 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.180
 does not cost energy because of the muscles 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.120
 relaxed are close focus 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.590
 it takes a lot of energy to celebrate that 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.080
 are large flat 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.970
 snappie you that was indeed not the case 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.859
 you know how difficult it is 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.859
 we show the animation again 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.320
 thanks for the clear explanation ladies 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.320
 so watch
