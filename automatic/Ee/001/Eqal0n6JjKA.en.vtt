00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.860 
Chinese I can only make the 230 million
per<00:00:58.739> battery<00:00:59.570> which<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.840> believe<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.410> true

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
per battery which I do believe it's true

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.070 
per battery which I do believe it's true
let's<00:01:03.870> take<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> closer<00:01:04.680> look<00:01:05.010> at<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> watch

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
let's take a closer look at the watch

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.230 
let's take a closer look at the watch
the<00:01:07.130> straps<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.670> made<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.210> very<00:01:09.450> soft

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
the straps here are made of a very soft

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.789 
the straps here are made of a very soft
plastic<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:12.540> exactly<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
plastic I don't exactly like it that

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.260 
plastic I don't exactly like it that
much<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.340> makes<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> watch<00:01:15.210> feel<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> bit<00:01:16.080> cheap

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
much it makes the watch feel a bit cheap

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.840 
much it makes the watch feel a bit cheap
but<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> material<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.400> comes

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
but this this is the material that comes

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.550 
but this this is the material that comes
with<00:01:21.060> Pantry<00:01:21.509> sure<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.960> change<00:01:22.290> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
with Pantry sure you can change this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.929 
with Pantry sure you can change this
somehow<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.850> haven't<00:01:24.240> tried<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:25.640> this<00:01:26.640> side

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939

the<00:04:52.920> phone's<00:04:53.460> camera<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:55.410> crash<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:55.980> quite<00:04:56.250> a

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
the phone's camera this crash is quite a

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.170 
the phone's camera this crash is quite a
bit<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:57.000> it's<00:04:57.420> not<00:04:57.720> very<00:04:57.960> reliable

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
bit so it's not very reliable

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.030 
bit so it's not very reliable
for<00:05:00.180> example<00:05:00.660> now<00:05:00.900> it's<00:05:01.200> probably<00:05:01.770> not<00:05:01.830> gonna

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
for example now it's probably not gonna

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.470 
for example now it's probably not gonna
start<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.990> failed<00:05:04.700> if<00:05:05.700> you<00:05:05.820> turn<00:05:06.060> off<00:05:06.210> the

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
start and it failed if you turn off the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.020 
start and it failed if you turn off the
watch<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:06.990> turn<00:05:07.140> it<00:05:07.260> back<00:05:07.290> on<00:05:07.710> again<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:08.790> will

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
watch and turn it back on again it will

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.030 
watch and turn it back on again it will

is the Settings app it has quite a few
languages<00:05:41.160> as<00:05:41.430> you<00:05:41.550> can<00:05:41.730> see<00:05:44.030> the<00:05:45.030> clock<00:05:45.330> type

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
languages as you can see the clock type

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.220 
languages as you can see the clock type
this<00:05:46.320> is<00:05:46.500> how<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:46.740> change<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:48.120> watch<00:05:48.570> face<00:05:48.680> so

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
this is how you change the watch face so

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.660 
this is how you change the watch face so
see<00:05:52.230> that<00:05:52.260> watch<00:05:52.650> face<00:05:52.920> is<00:05:52.950> now<00:05:53.250> different<00:05:55.670> the

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
see that watch face is now different the

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.970 
see that watch face is now different the
power<00:05:56.940> saving<00:05:57.270> model<00:05:57.930> you<00:05:58.170> basically<00:05:58.560> enable

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
power saving model you basically enable

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.820 
power saving model you basically enable
disabled<00:05:59.610> if<00:05:59.730> you<00:05:59.880> are<00:05:59.940> enable<00:06:00.330> it<00:06:00.830> the

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
disabled if you are enable it the

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.700 
disabled if you are enable it the
brightness<00:06:02.520> is<00:06:02.820> lower<00:06:03.540> if<00:06:03.900> it<00:06:04.050> is<00:06:04.200> simple<00:06:04.590> if

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
brightness is lower if it is simple if

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.370 
brightness is lower if it is simple if
the<00:06:04.830> premise<00:06:05.280> is<00:06:05.460> a<00:06:05.490> full<00:06:06.210> so<00:06:06.570> you<00:06:06.630> need<00:06:07.170> that

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
the premise is a full so you need that

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.190 
the premise is a full so you need that
during<00:06:08.040> the<00:06:08.160> day<00:06:08.310> otherwise<00:06:08.640> you<00:06:08.880> cannot<00:06:09.210> see

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
during the day otherwise you cannot see

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.040 
during the day otherwise you cannot see
the<00:06:10.350> watch<00:06:12.500> the<00:06:13.500> anti<00:06:13.950> lost<00:06:14.220> just<00:06:14.750> as<00:06:15.750> soon<00:06:15.930> as

the watch the anti lost just as soon as

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.170 
the watch the anti lost just as soon as
the<00:06:16.200> watch<00:06:16.770> disconnects<00:06:17.340> from<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.610> phone<00:06:17.940> it
