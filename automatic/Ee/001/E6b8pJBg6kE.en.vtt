 I play in xbox live game tech is victor 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.899
 with 382 r I started playing in xbox 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.620
 live at 16 to 18 months out there yang era 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.739
 lose pcm group the console by 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.670
 basically because of 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.920
 players I know there is very little player 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.510
 the code of the pc have always been dying 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.770
 Coin bath dying is not with 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.950
 hills on Avenue 3 né that I started to 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.790
 walk three and had very rock rap hacker 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.369
 and just like that, and her sister could not give 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.420
 a stabilized one but the one launched was 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.140
 delta one 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.850
 thence threw threw not né 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.960
 the frigate where I know how many I speak 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.570
 happened and launch the attack on the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.619
 borges I think everyone went there 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.470
 It's good that I'm more connected by 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.540
 nothing just to forget you what it was like 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.560
 So I went there and started doing more 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.720
 game place 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.680
 I thought of following plate pushing the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.110
 once every two three months and 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.119
 when he threw the score the two of you 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.490
 I gave more because really the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.630
 number of hackers below more 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.689
 absurdly then it gave me enough 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.670
 going to post gameplay out when is 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.229
 always well at the time met in sebrae 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.110
 bmw 3 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.260
 It was at this time that I met him. 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.180
 we already played together then training to 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.950
 We've known each other for a long time. 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.200
 that's when he started posting videos 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.080
 in his channel he begins to devote himself to seeing 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.570
 It was cool, I'm connected, and I 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.220
 Also playing well at that time comes 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.010
 get some cool gameplay 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.720
 so I decided to make a channel too 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.710
 So this story about me is this. 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.710
 Victor 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.280
 For who wants to know, that's it folks. 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.470
 is to have more about me in this personal life 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.100

 I was playing on the xbox live is live 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.180
