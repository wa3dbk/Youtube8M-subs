the<00:00:05.910> original<00:00:06.630> diesel<00:00:07.439> engine<00:00:08.330> invented<00:00:09.330> by

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
the original diesel engine invented by

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.990 
the original diesel engine invented by
rudolf<00:00:09.900> diesel<00:00:10.320> was<00:00:10.830> created<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.280> run<00:00:11.880> off

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
rudolf diesel was created to run off

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.610 
rudolf diesel was created to run off
peanut<00:00:12.330> oil<00:00:12.480> that's<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.990> little-known<00:00:13.290> fact

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
peanut oil that's a little-known fact

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.470 
peanut oil that's a little-known fact
engines<00:00:14.190> were<00:00:14.310> made<00:00:14.520> to<00:00:14.670> run<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:15.090> vegetable

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
engines were made to run on vegetable

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.480 
engines were made to run on vegetable
oil<00:00:15.810> since<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.500> time<00:00:16.560> obviously<00:00:17.070> there<00:00:17.400> have

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
oil since that time obviously there have

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.980 
oil since that time obviously there have
been<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> lot<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.880> technological<00:00:18.570> changes<00:00:18.839> but

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
been a lot of technological changes but

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.989 
been a lot of technological changes but
the<00:00:19.019> real<00:00:19.259> problem<00:00:19.499> with<00:00:20.099> why<00:00:20.339> vegetable<00:00:20.910> oil

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:20.999 
the real problem with why vegetable oil

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.120 
the real problem with why vegetable oil
isn't<00:00:21.179> prevalent<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.839> because<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.589> congeals

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
isn't prevalent is because it congeals

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.390 
isn't prevalent is because it congeals
when<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.490> gets<00:00:23.640> cold<00:00:24.679> our<00:00:25.679> vehicles<00:00:26.310> are

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
when it gets cold our vehicles are

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.679 
when it gets cold our vehicles are
converted<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.029> they<00:00:27.150> actually<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.480> heaters

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
converted and they actually have heaters

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.859 
converted and they actually have heaters
in<00:00:27.929> them<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.460> we<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.759> turn<00:00:29.999> on<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.269> van<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
in them so we can turn on the van that

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.080 
in them so we can turn on the van that
the<00:00:30.989> vegetable<00:00:31.380> oil<00:00:31.529> fuel<00:00:31.859> feed<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.640> up<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:33.060> it

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the vegetable oil fuel feed it up get it

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.090 
the vegetable oil fuel feed it up get it
a<00:00:33.329> little<00:00:33.540> more<00:00:33.720> viscous<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.920> now<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
a little more viscous and so now the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.069 
a little more viscous and so now the
real<00:00:35.370> problem<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.879> how<00:00:36.359> do<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.870> fuel

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
real problem is how do you get this fuel

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.689 
real problem is how do you get this fuel
I<00:00:37.320> mean<00:00:37.649> how<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.859> get<00:00:37.980> enough<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
I mean how do you get enough of it and

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.729 
I mean how do you get enough of it and
so<00:00:39.329> we're<00:00:39.480> working<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> lot<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> things<00:00:40.590> on

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
so we're working on a lot of things on

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.490 
so we're working on a lot of things on
how<00:00:40.859> to<00:00:40.920> collect<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.430> waste<00:00:42.030> fuel<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
how to collect this waste fuel the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.959 
how to collect this waste fuel the
burger<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.980> you're<00:00:44.160> eating<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> fries<00:00:44.670> that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
burger that you're eating the fries that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.520 
burger that you're eating the fries that
you're<00:00:45.090> eating<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.570> waste<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.289> can

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
you're eating a waste from that can

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.020 
you're eating a waste from that can
transport<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.100> back<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> restaurant<00:00:47.670> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
things that go inside that fryer so we

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.130 
things that go inside that fryer so we
actually<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:02.190> btv<00:01:02.699> burrito<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.390> good<00:01:03.960> time

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
actually at btv burrito and good time

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.960 
actually at btv burrito and good time
charlies<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.739> actually<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.550> a<00:01:05.580> special

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
charlies we actually have a special

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
charlies we actually have a special
process<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.600> which<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:07.079> remove<00:01:07.500> grease<00:01:07.799> from

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
process in which we remove grease from

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.859 
process in which we remove grease from
our<00:01:08.100> fryers<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:09.000> tend<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.360> much<00:01:09.540> cleaner

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
our fryers we tend to have much cleaner

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.300 
our fryers we tend to have much cleaner
grease<00:01:10.200> than<00:01:10.409> most<00:01:10.619> restaurants<00:01:10.979> live

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
grease than most restaurants live

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.530 
grease than most restaurants live
because<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.610> care<00:01:11.820> about<00:01:11.909> how<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> comes<00:01:12.390> back

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
because we care about how it comes back

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.109 
because we care about how it comes back
out<00:01:12.890> we<00:01:13.890> also<00:01:14.070> use<00:01:14.369> grease<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.700> some<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> our

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
out we also use grease from some of our

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.429 
out we also use grease from some of our
other<00:01:15.150> partners<00:01:15.720> around<00:01:15.900> ann<00:01:16.200> arbor

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
that help us out we actually collected

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.480 
that help us out we actually collected
cold<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.680> collect<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> back<00:01:23.220> into<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
cold we collect it back into the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.670 
cold we collect it back into the
containers<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> came<00:01:24.329> in<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.560> we

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
containers it came in and then we

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.800 
containers it came in and then we
purified<00:01:26.220> here

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.080

the b2b party bus operates in three ways
it<00:01:35.270> operates<00:01:35.690> like<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.140> bus<00:01:36.410> you<00:01:36.620> can<00:01:36.770> flag<00:01:37.010> it

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
it operates like a bus you can flag it

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.340 
it operates like a bus you can flag it
down<00:01:37.190> on<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.580> street<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.000> jump<00:01:38.360> on<00:01:38.510> or<00:01:39.140> like<00:01:39.320> a

whatever and use it for extended period
of<00:01:50.420> time<00:01:50.560> our<00:01:51.560> idea<00:01:51.920> basically<00:01:52.130> was<00:01:52.550> that<00:01:52.729> it's

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
of time our idea basically was that it's

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.500 
of time our idea basically was that it's
fun<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:54.110> cheap<00:01:54.560> it's<00:01:55.070> easy<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.520> use<00:01:55.580> OE<00:01:56.090> and

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
fun it's cheap it's easy to use OE and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.200 
fun it's cheap it's easy to use OE and
also<00:01:56.990> it's<00:01:57.260> green<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:57.800> completely<00:01:58.610> green<00:01:58.880> so

also it's green and completely green so
we<00:01:59.600> find<00:01:59.840> that<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.110> that's<00:02:00.350> an<00:02:00.710> awesome

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
we find that that that's an awesome

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.770 

one<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.310> base<00:02:24.460> ideas<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.300> green<00:02:25.570> company

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
one of the base ideas of a green company

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.040 
one of the base ideas of a green company
is<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.380> not<00:02:27.040> create<00:02:27.280> waste<00:02:27.610> right<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.210> actually

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
is to not create waste right so actually

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.080 
is to not create waste right so actually
our<00:02:29.170> buses<00:02:29.500> are<00:02:29.650> used<00:02:29.920> buses<00:02:30.430> our<00:02:30.700> ideas<00:02:30.970> to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
our buses are used buses our ideas to

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.820 
our buses are used buses our ideas to
rescue<00:02:31.420> them<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.690> put<00:02:32.230> them<00:02:32.260> back<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
rescue them and put them back on the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.290 
rescue them and put them back on the
streets<00:02:33.160> we<00:02:33.550> are<00:02:33.610> going<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.760> be<00:02:33.880> adding<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:34.270> a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
streets we are going to be adding on a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.080 
streets we are going to be adding on a
couple<00:02:34.600> buses<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.110> next<00:02:35.350> few<00:02:35.500> months<00:02:35.650> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
couple buses in the next few months and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.490 
couple buses in the next few months and
we've<00:02:37.090> also<00:02:37.270> actually<00:02:37.750> introduced<00:02:38.110> our<00:02:38.260> first

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
we've also actually introduced our first

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.380 
we've also actually introduced our first
mini<00:02:38.920> bus<00:02:39.160> within<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.700> next<00:02:39.880> couple<00:02:40.060> months

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
mini bus within the next couple months

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.390 
mini bus within the next couple months
we're<00:02:40.630> going<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.930> be<00:02:41.080> converting<00:02:41.740> to<00:02:41.920> run<00:02:42.190> on

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
we're going to be converting to run on

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.850 
we're going to be converting to run on
hho<00:02:43.090> technology<00:02:43.660> which<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.990> a<00:02:44.020> hydrogen

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
hho technology which is a hydrogen

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.900 
hho technology which is a hydrogen
conversion<00:02:45.820> if<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.090> will<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:51.250> can<00:02:51.459> do<00:02:51.640> green

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
conversion if you will you can do green

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.240 
conversion if you will you can do green
things<00:02:52.239> without<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:53.260> being<00:02:53.709> more<00:02:53.950> expensive

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
things without it being more expensive

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.060 
things without it being more expensive
or<00:02:55.030> more<00:02:55.270> tedious<00:02:55.690> or<00:02:55.930> more<00:02:56.230> work<00:02:56.440> for<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.830> and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
or more tedious or more work for you and

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.340 
or more tedious or more work for you and
I<00:02:57.610> think<00:02:57.670> that's<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.090> best<00:02:58.360> way<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.690> get<00:02:58.900> green

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
I think that's the best way to get green

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.530 
I think that's the best way to get green

get sustainability to catch on is to

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.900 
get sustainability to catch on is to
find<00:03:01.780> ways<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.380> make<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.860> just<00:03:03.070> as<00:03:03.520> easy<00:03:03.700> as

find ways to make it just as easy as
everything<00:03:04.300> else<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.600> do<00:03:04.720> that's<00:03:05.080> really<00:03:05.380> the

everything else to do that's really the
