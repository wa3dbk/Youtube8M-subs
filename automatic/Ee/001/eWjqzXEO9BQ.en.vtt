downstairs bare feet on concrete what

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.469 
downstairs bare feet on concrete what
happens<00:01:20.710> you<00:01:21.190> feel<00:01:21.490> cold<00:01:21.729> right<00:01:22.149> because<00:01:22.330> your

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
happens you feel cold right because your

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.389 
happens you feel cold right because your
body<00:01:22.720> is<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.899> mini<00:01:23.140> radiator<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:24.070> all<00:01:24.250> this

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
body is a mini radiator and all this

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.010 
body is a mini radiator and all this
heat<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:24.640> leaving<00:01:25.060> your<00:01:25.179> body<00:01:25.300> chasing<00:01:25.929> this

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
heat is leaving your body chasing this

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.080 
heat is leaving your body chasing this
cold<00:01:26.259> surface<00:01:26.679> trying<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.250> heat<00:01:27.429> up<00:01:27.460> that<00:01:27.580> slab

cold surface trying to heat up that slab

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.240 
cold surface trying to heat up that slab
which<00:01:28.360> obviously<00:01:28.810> won't<00:01:29.110> happen<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:30.100> we're

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
which obviously won't happen so we're

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.010 
which obviously won't happen so we're
radiant<00:01:30.610> floor<00:01:30.850> what<00:01:31.090> we<00:01:31.240> do<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.659> heat<00:01:31.869> the

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
radiant floor what we do is heat the

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.140 
radiant floor what we do is heat the
surfaces<00:01:32.500> in<00:01:32.619> your<00:01:32.770> home<00:01:32.979> get<00:01:33.759> them<00:01:33.850> up<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.119> a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
surfaces in your home get them up to a

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.420 
surfaces in your home get them up to a
nice<00:01:34.329> comfortable<00:01:34.780> temperature<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.560> then<00:01:36.130> we

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
nice comfortable temperature and then we

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.010 
nice comfortable temperature and then we
don't<00:01:36.579> have<00:01:36.729> cold<00:01:36.970> surfaces<00:01:37.509> around<00:01:37.659> us

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
don't have cold surfaces around us

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.230 
don't have cold surfaces around us
therefore<00:01:38.979> our<00:01:39.310> bodies<00:01:39.610> warm<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:39.939> don't<00:01:40.119> have

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
therefore our bodies warm we don't have

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.819 
therefore our bodies warm we don't have
this<00:01:40.360> thermal<00:01:40.720> transfer<00:01:41.049> between<00:01:41.320> our<00:01:41.619> body

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
in a cold surface in theory that's how

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.170 
in a cold surface in theory that's how
radiant<00:01:44.740> floor<00:01:45.009> works<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.520> what<00:01:45.700> exactly<00:01:45.790> are

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
radiant floor works and what exactly are

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.940 
radiant floor works and what exactly are
the<00:01:46.450> benefits<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:46.960> installing<00:01:47.320> radiant<00:01:47.530> floor

the benefits of installing radiant floor
heat<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.850> obvious<00:01:49.210> benefit<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.720> we<00:01:49.840> don't

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
heat the obvious benefit is we don't

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.719 
heat the obvious benefit is we don't
have<00:01:50.140> any<00:01:50.290> air<00:01:50.470> blowing<00:01:50.710> around<00:01:50.890> our<00:01:51.130> house<00:01:51.310> we

couch maybe an ottoman or a Hutt's

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:08.940 
couch maybe an ottoman or a Hutt's
you'll<00:02:08.259> have<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.440> worry<00:02:08.560> about<00:02:08.649> where<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
you'll have to worry about where the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.529 
you'll have to worry about where the
registers<00:02:09.369> are<00:02:09.519> going<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.759> go<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.329> you<00:02:10.360> have

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
registers are going to go so you have

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.759 
registers are going to go so you have
complete<00:02:10.899> design<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.410> have<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.560> worry<00:02:11.680> about

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
complete design you have to worry about

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.380 
complete design you have to worry about
grapes<00:02:12.100> laying<00:02:12.370> down<00:02:12.579> over<00:02:12.850> things<00:02:13.090> getting

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
grapes laying down over things getting

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.539 
grapes laying down over things getting
blown<00:02:13.570> around<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:14.799> just<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.070> quieter

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
blown around and it's just a quieter

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.640 
blown around and it's just a quieter
much<00:02:15.910> more<00:02:16.209> efficient<00:02:16.690> system<00:02:17.019> so<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.470> really

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
much more efficient system so it really

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.710 
much more efficient system so it really
puts<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.950> heat<00:02:18.190> where<00:02:18.610> your<00:02:18.760> body<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.600> is

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
puts the heat where your body is that is

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.660 
puts the heat where your body is that is
correct<00:02:19.959> yeah<00:02:20.380> what<00:02:20.739> about<00:02:20.799> energy<00:02:21.100> savings

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
correct yeah what about energy savings

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.910 
correct yeah what about energy savings
energy<00:02:22.269> savings<00:02:22.480> twenty<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.350> forty<00:02:23.590> percent

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
energy savings twenty to forty percent

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.819 
energy savings twenty to forty percent
on<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.280> normal<00:02:24.790> that's<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.840> huge<00:02:26.109> saving<00:02:26.590> huge

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
on a normal that's a huge saving huge

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.410 
on a normal that's a huge saving huge
savings<00:02:27.250> over<00:02:27.430> conventional<00:02:27.910> forced<00:02:28.269> air

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
savings over conventional forced air

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.479

heat<00:02:28.630> with<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.500> type<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:29.739> heating<00:02:30.010> system

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
heat with that type of heating system

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.599 
heat with that type of heating system
you're<00:02:30.970> blowing<00:02:31.209> air<00:02:31.540> around<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.989> home<00:02:32.170> and

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
you're blowing air around the home and

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.009 
you're blowing air around the home and
there's<00:02:33.609> a<00:02:33.670> misconception<00:02:33.850> between<00:02:34.570> hot<00:02:34.810> air

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
there's a misconception between hot air

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.290 
there's a misconception between hot air
rising<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.590> heat<00:02:35.769> heat<00:02:36.250> does<00:02:36.489> not<00:02:36.670> rise<00:02:36.970> but

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
rising and heat heat does not rise but

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.089 
rising and heat heat does not rise but
hot<00:02:37.510> air<00:02:37.540> does<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.200> for<00:02:38.230> blowing<00:02:38.560> hot<00:02:38.769> air<00:02:38.800> into

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
hot air does so for blowing hot air into

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.780 
hot air does so for blowing hot air into
the<00:02:39.250> home<00:02:39.430> all<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:40.060> hot<00:02:40.420> air

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
floor what goes on top of that we put a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.659 
floor what goes on top of that we put a
toward<00:04:05.379> underlayment<00:04:06.379> on<00:04:06.709> top<00:04:06.949> of<00:04:07.129> that<00:04:07.280> of<00:04:07.519> a

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
toward underlayment on top of that of a

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.030 
toward underlayment on top of that of a
it's<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.060> lightweight<00:04:08.389> port<00:04:08.690> underlayment<00:04:09.109> and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
it's a lightweight port underlayment and

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.589 
it's a lightweight port underlayment and
then<00:04:10.220> generally<00:04:10.729> the<00:04:10.819> floor<00:04:11.030> covering<00:04:11.479> is

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
then generally the floor covering is

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.869 
then generally the floor covering is
ceramic<00:04:11.900> tile<00:04:12.290> now<00:04:13.010> if<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.459> wanted<00:04:13.669> to<00:04:13.760> put

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
ceramic tile now if I wanted to put

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.509 
ceramic tile now if I wanted to put
carpet<00:04:14.060> down<00:04:14.329> could<00:04:14.569> I<00:04:14.629> do<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:14.780> yeah

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
carpet down could I do that yeah

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.349 
carpet down could I do that yeah
generally<00:04:16.519> if<00:04:16.639> you're<00:04:16.760> going<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:16.970> put<00:04:17.150> carpet

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
generally if you're going to put carpet

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.810 
generally if you're going to put carpet
we<00:04:17.690> recommend<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.289> thinner<00:04:18.769> pad<00:04:19.099> on<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.459> carpet

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
we recommend a thinner pad on the carpet

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.670 
we recommend a thinner pad on the carpet
so<00:04:19.849> that<00:04:20.180> heat<00:04:20.510> radiates<00:04:21.019> up<00:04:21.289> through<00:04:21.590> the

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
so that heat radiates up through the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.020 
so that heat radiates up through the
floor<00:04:21.949> a<00:04:21.979> little<00:04:22.130> bit<00:04:22.370> better<00:04:22.460> what<00:04:22.940> about

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
floor a little bit better what about

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.270 
floor a little bit better what about
wood<00:04:23.300> floors<00:04:23.539> you<00:04:24.229> can<00:04:24.440> use<00:04:24.590> wood<00:04:24.800> floors<00:04:25.039> also

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
wood floors you can use wood floors also

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.870 
wood floors you can use wood floors also
we<00:04:26.240> recommend<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.870> laminated<00:04:27.620> wood<00:04:27.800> floor<00:04:28.099> as

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
we recommend a laminated wood floor as

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.719 
we recommend a laminated wood floor as
it<00:04:29.150> won't<00:04:29.650> shrink<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:30.889> expand<00:04:31.220> as<00:04:31.370> much<00:04:31.520> as<00:04:31.699> a

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
it won't shrink and expand as much as a

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.969 
it won't shrink and expand as much as a
regular<00:04:32.120> wood<00:04:32.330> floor<00:04:32.599> would<00:04:32.810> okay<00:04:33.470> now<00:04:33.860> when

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
regular wood floor would okay now when

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.050 
regular wood floor would okay now when
you're<00:04:34.070> talking<00:04:34.370> about<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.639> underlayment

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
you're talking about the underlayment

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.719 
you're talking about the underlayment
I've<00:04:35.270> heard<00:04:35.479> it<00:04:35.570> referred<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.870> as<00:04:36.169> concrete<00:04:36.830> is

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
I've heard it referred to as concrete is

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.120 
I've heard it referred to as concrete is
that<00:04:38.000> an<00:04:38.240> issue<00:04:38.620> when<00:04:39.620> you're<00:04:39.740> not<00:04:39.889> on<00:04:40.009> the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
that an issue when you're not on the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.320 
that an issue when you're not on the
first<00:04:40.340> floor<00:04:40.490> cuz<00:04:40.699> we're<00:04:40.849> in<00:04:40.909> a<00:04:40.970> first<00:04:41.180> floor

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
first floor cuz we're in a first floor

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.339 
first floor cuz we're in a first floor
right<00:04:41.539> now<00:04:41.720> but<00:04:41.840> let's<00:04:41.990> say<00:04:42.110> there<00:04:42.229> was<00:04:42.320> a

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
right now but let's say there was a

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.140 
right now but let's say there was a
second<00:04:42.770> floor<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.460> weight<00:04:43.639> of<00:04:43.669> that<00:04:43.909> would

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
second floor the weight of that would

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.390 
second floor the weight of that would
that<00:04:44.240> be<00:04:44.389> a<00:04:44.419> problem<00:04:44.690> well<00:04:45.320> generally<00:04:45.919> if<00:04:46.159> you

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
that be a problem well generally if you

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.860 
that be a problem well generally if you
were<00:04:46.520> going<00:04:46.639> to<00:04:46.729> do<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:46.909> I'm<00:04:47.419> sure<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.750> house

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
were going to do that I'm sure the house

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.659 
were going to do that I'm sure the house
would<00:04:48.080> be<00:04:48.110> engineered<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.650> accommodate<00:04:49.490> that

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
would be engineered to accommodate that

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:50.879 
would be engineered to accommodate that
weight<00:04:49.909> and<00:04:50.150> this

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
weight and this

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.640 
weight and this
underlayment<00:04:51.159> is<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.520> lighter<00:04:52.509> than<00:04:53.020> the

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
underlayment is a lighter than the

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.140 
underlayment is a lighter than the
concrete<00:04:54.099> that<00:04:54.219> we're<00:04:54.340> going<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.639> basement

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
concrete that we're going the basement

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.450 
concrete that we're going the basement
or<00:04:55.330> something<00:04:55.509> of<00:04:55.810> that<00:04:55.840> nature<00:04:55.990> okay<00:04:56.830> well

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
or something of that nature okay well

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.189 
or something of that nature okay well
this<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.669> a<00:04:57.699> really<00:04:57.969> exciting<00:04:58.060> process<00:04:58.599> and<00:04:59.080> I

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
this is a really exciting process and I

00:04:59.199 --> 00:04:59.999 
this is a really exciting process and I
