00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
a similar dot on the second try but I

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.240 
a similar dot on the second try but I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
ended up making it a little bit too

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.429 
ended up making it a little bit too
large<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:10.270> what<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.479> did<00:01:10.570> is<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:10.929> went<00:01:10.960> back<00:01:11.289> to

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
large so what I did is I went back to

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.959 
large so what I did is I went back to
the<00:01:11.560> first<00:01:11.740> one<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.009> just<00:01:12.310> made<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.759> same

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
the first one and just made it the same

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:18.429 
the first one and just made it the same
size<00:01:13.299> as<00:01:13.539> the<00:01:13.600> second<00:01:14.229> one

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.480 

then<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.679> toothpick<00:01:20.069> I'm<00:01:20.249> just

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
then with the toothpick I'm just

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.940 
then with the toothpick I'm just
dragging<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.030> color<00:01:21.240> downward<00:01:21.810> until<00:01:22.469> I<00:01:22.679> have

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
dragging the color downward until I have

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.109 
dragging the color downward until I have
a<00:01:22.979> perfect<00:01:23.609> outline<00:01:24.140> at<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.380> bottom<00:01:25.939> which<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
a perfect outline at the bottom which is

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.370 
a perfect outline at the bottom which is
going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> create<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.899> little<00:01:28.140> triangle

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
going to create that little triangle

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.139 
going to create that little triangle
shape<00:01:28.859> so<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.459> first<00:01:29.490> little<00:01:29.880> heart

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
shape so that's my first little heart

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.779 
shape so that's my first little heart
didn't<00:01:30.600> come<00:01:30.719> out<00:01:30.750> too<00:01:30.990> great<00:01:31.459> second<00:01:32.459> one<00:01:32.609> I

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
didn't come out too great second one I

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.429 
didn't come out too great second one I
just<00:01:33.030> did<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.359> two<00:01:33.509> little<00:01:33.719> dots<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.200> then<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
just did the two little dots and then I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
just did the two little dots and then I
decided<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.979> angle<00:01:35.340> my<00:01:35.459> hand<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
decided to angle my hand like so to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.270 
decided to angle my hand like so to
create<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.259> triangle<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> bottom

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
create the little triangle at the bottom

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.050 
create the little triangle at the bottom
I<00:01:38.459> started<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.630> better<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.380> progressed

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
I started to get better as I progressed

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
I started to get better as I progressed
then<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.420> moved<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.079> my<00:01:43.229> middle<00:01:43.500> finger<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
then I moved on to my middle finger and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.760 
then I moved on to my middle finger and
as<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.849> can<00:01:45.000> see<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.929> little<00:01:46.109> hearts<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.530> just

as you can see my little hearts are just

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.029 
as you can see my little hearts are just
starting<00:01:47.069> to<00:01:47.099> get<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> lot<00:01:47.609> better<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:49.590> takes<00:01:49.860> a

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
starting to get a lot better it takes a

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.669 
starting to get a lot better it takes a
lot<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> practice<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.239> you<00:01:51.329> cannot<00:01:51.719> expect

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
lot of practice and you cannot expect

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.919 
lot of practice and you cannot expect
