 f01 to zero and have 03 days 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.299
 Common useful functions 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.299
 I would like to introduce you about 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.210
 Recent mobile phones 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.210
 The result is the result of the function 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.240
 If it has been running for a long time 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.479
 It's getting more and more integrated 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.879
 Or there is a thing that the operation becomes unstable 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.760
 right 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.720
 That 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.540
 It is a function to avoid in advance 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.830
 801 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.830
 It is installed in the 2034th on the 02nd 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.690
 It is called full participation in the terminal 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.220
 It is a function 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.990
 This function is 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.140
 It is loaded from tel 0612 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.350
 Personally 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.410
 I think it may be a function that is not well known 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.410
 I decided to solidify the video like this 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.450
 Before now 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240
 f03 new 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.390
 I'm just stuck 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.560
 As usage is common because it is the same city 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.560
 Eco life 03 days 15 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.060
 I would like to introduce a model 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.060
 Anzu and Shaoxing pickled 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.969
 However, how to use the inflation indicator is very easy and laughs 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.760
 Expand 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.150
 Prevent luxury 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.120

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.500
 Will respond 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.640

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.840
 High 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.370
 It started with this 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.000
 Now the terminal 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.400
 Recent 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.400
 I'm calling 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
 Other started earlier 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.699
 The main function is different from the normal function screen 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.830
 Let's refresh 1 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.779
 The hand is displayed 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.739
 When this is power-on to normal os 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.089
 Well different 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.089
 It is a place 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.759

 What this day is doing 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.329
 In fact, when things get worse now on a PC 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.429
 Same as rebooting 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:05.950
 By restarting the terminal 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.739

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:14.019
 By activating the system again 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.739
 Try to improve stability 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.739
 2 is also new to black 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.399

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:25.399
 Terminal refresh function 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.389
 Setting welcome 0 people 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:37.729

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.889
 Factory setting is on and the implementation time 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.769

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.689
 Designed to restart 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:13.689
 Day of the health section of the set time is repeated daily restart every minute 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:14.569
 Do 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.879
 Choose a weekday and restart 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:21.569
 It is fine before you choose a holiday and restart it 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.879
 I wonder if you are in Japan with customization 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:26.970
 By the way 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.590
 I live to the station and use f01 for shooting 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.680
 My 0112 is 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.210
 After a shallow day every day but tough to Tamachi that is to restart 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.219
 It is decided to 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:45.869
 There is also a foma card that selects the item that you care about 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.900
 When it starts to restart while using on the terminal 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.580
 I can not return to the screen widely in the city of the station southeast 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.430
 It is a place, but please rest assured about the issue 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.499
 Software Update- 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.110
 Same as recent 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.629
 Power talk in China 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.629
 It is supposed to bypass 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.599
 Anoff two power until there 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.919
 The power supply is switched once as an example 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.919
 It is area of ​​16 months 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.139
 In that 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.879
 Steel own 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.879
 It's also a Fujitsu terminal, isn't it? 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.529
 I think the operation has become unstable again 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.389
 In some cases, try this terminal refresh function 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.159
 I wonder if I see you 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.809
 I said immediately that 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:40.520
 I also became a video for something 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.810
 I would like to raise it, so I would like expansion.
