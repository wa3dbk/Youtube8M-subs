of his mobility which could affect the

animals ability to grow and and also his
comfort<00:02:45.420> ability<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.780> think<00:02:46.049> that's<00:02:46.200> another

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
comfort ability I think that's another

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:47.449 
comfort ability I think that's another
thing<00:02:46.620> that's<00:02:46.799> important<00:02:47.159> about<00:02:47.220> these

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
thing that's important about these

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.740 
thing that's important about these
projects<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.090> young<00:02:48.389> people<00:02:48.659> are

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
projects is that young people are

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.319 
projects is that young people are
certainly<00:02:49.049> responsible<00:02:49.980> for<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.459> health<00:02:51.000> and

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
certainly responsible for the health and

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.929

period as well and you know one of the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.750 
period as well and you know one of the
things<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.970> nobody<00:02:57.329> ever<00:02:57.540> talks<00:02:57.870> about<00:02:58.760> they

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.699 
purchased and they're not exactly team
are<00:03:08.519> they<00:03:08.790> no<00:03:09.269> that's<00:03:09.689> correct<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.200> also<00:03:10.319> takes

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
are they no that's correct it also takes

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.500 
are they no that's correct it also takes
an<00:03:10.829> investment<00:03:11.069> of<00:03:11.400> time<00:03:11.939> and<00:03:12.180> effort<00:03:12.420> and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
an investment of time and effort and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.189 
an investment of time and effort and
breaking<00:03:13.079> these<00:03:13.169> calves<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.650> lead<00:03:14.359> it's<00:03:15.359> a<00:03:15.569> lot

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:16.199 
breaking these calves to lead it's a lot

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.780 
breaking these calves to lead it's a lot
different<00:03:16.410> from<00:03:16.650> maybe<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.280> commercial

animal<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.829> perform<00:03:53.159> well<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.430> do<00:03:53.519> well<00:03:53.699> at

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
animal to perform well and do well at

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.610 
animal to perform well and do well at
the<00:03:53.879> fair<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:54.269> they<00:03:54.299> certainly<00:03:54.659> try<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:55.440> get

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
the fair so they certainly try to get

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.680 
the fair so they certainly try to get
the<00:03:55.739> best<00:03:55.919> of<00:03:56.129> feed<00:03:56.340> for<00:03:56.579> those<00:03:56.699> calves<00:03:57.030> over

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
the best of feed for those calves over

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.059 
the best of feed for those calves over
the<00:03:57.780> past<00:03:57.989> couple<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.530> years<00:03:58.739> we've<00:03:58.919> seen

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
the past couple of years we've seen

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.960 
the past couple of years we've seen
significant<00:03:59.639> increases<00:03:59.760> in<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:01.819> prices<00:04:02.819> of

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
significant increases in the prices of

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.670 
significant increases in the prices of
feed<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.510> are<00:04:04.019> going<00:04:04.169> to<00:04:04.229> go<00:04:04.349> into<00:04:04.530> these

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
feed that are going to go into these

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.020 
feed that are going to go into these
calves<00:04:04.979> into<00:04:05.250> getting<00:04:05.459> these<00:04:05.579> cattle

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
calves into getting these cattle

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.360 
calves into getting these cattle
finished<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:07.500> that's<00:04:07.650> partially<00:04:08.040> due<00:04:08.190> the

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
finished and that's partially due the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.030 
finished and that's partially due the
energy<00:04:08.729> costs<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:09.389> forth<00:04:09.659> in<00:04:10.040> marketplace

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
energy costs and so forth in marketplace

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.839 
energy costs and so forth in marketplace
today

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
today

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.879 
today
so<00:04:12.150> certainly<00:04:13.079> students<00:04:13.409> are<00:04:13.530> going<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.769> have

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
so certainly students are going to have

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.000 
so certainly students are going to have
to<00:04:14.010> learn<00:04:14.159> to<00:04:14.220> be<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.790> little<00:04:15.060> bit<00:04:15.209> more<00:04:16.010> bit

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
to learn to be a little bit more bit

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.649 
to learn to be a little bit more bit
sharper<00:04:17.579> with<00:04:17.729> their<00:04:17.880> pencils<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:18.359> terms<00:04:18.510> of

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
sharper with their pencils in terms of

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.029 
sharper with their pencils in terms of
making<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.930> profit<00:04:19.169> with<00:04:19.469> these<00:04:19.620> cattle<00:04:20.010> I

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
making a profit with these cattle I

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.350 
making a profit with these cattle I
guess

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
guess

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.480 
guess
one<00:04:21.810> more<00:04:22.020> thing<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.350> I'd<00:04:22.710> like<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.340> talk

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
one more thing that I'd like to talk

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.080 
one more thing that I'd like to talk
about<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:26.430> select<00:04:26.910> these

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
about and that is that you select these

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.690 
about and that is that you select these
calves<00:04:27.480> for<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.320> most<00:04:28.680> muscling<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:29.580> the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
calves for the most muscling and the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.180 
calves for the most muscling and the
best<00:04:29.910> bone<00:04:30.180> structure<00:04:30.690> like<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.290> ultimately

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
best bone structure like and ultimately

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.750 
best bone structure like and ultimately
it's<00:04:32.820> what<00:04:33.420> happens<00:04:33.930> on<00:04:34.260> their<00:04:34.920> grading<00:04:35.490> yield

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
it's what happens on their grading yield

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.430 
it's what happens on their grading yield
would<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.420> explain<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.810> little<00:04:36.960> bit<00:04:37.200> about

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
would you explain a little bit about

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.820 
would you explain a little bit about
that<00:04:37.710> well<00:04:38.310> sorry<00:04:38.520> it's<00:04:38.910> it's<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.360> bit<00:04:39.480> of<00:04:39.600> a

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
that well sorry it's it's a bit of a

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.750 
that well sorry it's it's a bit of a
extrapolation<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.920> look<00:04:41.070> at<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.280> calves<00:04:41.520> and

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
extrapolation to look at the calves and

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.070 
extrapolation to look at the calves and
try<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.000> guess<00:04:42.270> what<00:04:42.420> they're<00:04:42.570> going<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.720> do<00:04:42.930> in

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
try to guess what they're going to do in

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.330 
try to guess what they're going to do in
terms<00:04:43.200> of<00:04:43.380> what<00:04:43.440> their<00:04:43.710> carcass<00:04:44.070> is<00:04:44.160> gonna

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
terms of what their carcass is gonna

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.940 
terms of what their carcass is gonna
look<00:04:44.490> like<00:04:44.700> from<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.750> grain<00:04:45.990> yield<00:04:46.350> standpoint

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
look like from a grain yield standpoint

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.740 
look like from a grain yield standpoint
but<00:04:47.430> we've<00:04:47.580> got<00:04:47.760> things<00:04:47.970> we<00:04:48.120> can<00:04:48.270> look<00:04:48.420> at<00:04:48.630> we

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
but we've got things we can look at we

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.270 
but we've got things we can look at we
can<00:04:48.780> look<00:04:49.050> at<00:04:49.170> muscle<00:04:49.530> shape<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.040> calves

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
can look at muscle shape and the calves

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.220 
can look at muscle shape and the calves
and<00:04:51.150> they're<00:04:51.390> in<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.630> rear<00:04:51.840> end<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.140> the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
and they're in the rear end and the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.440 
and they're in the rear end and the
quarter<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:53.160> down<00:04:53.310> their<00:04:53.460> top<00:04:53.670> line<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:54.150> we

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
quarter and down their top line and we

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.030 
quarter and down their top line and we
can<00:04:54.600> handle<00:04:54.780> those<00:04:55.050> calves<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:55.560> feel<00:04:55.770> and

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
can handle those calves and feel and

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.920 
can handle those calves and feel and
look<00:04:56.520> at<00:04:56.640> visual<00:04:57.000> indicators<00:04:57.510> of<00:04:57.690> fat

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
look at visual indicators of fat

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.510 
look at visual indicators of fat
thickness<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.470> fat<00:04:58.650> deposition<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.370> that

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
thickness and fat deposition and that

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.370 
thickness and fat deposition and that
that<00:04:59.910> can<00:05:00.240> give<00:05:00.480> us<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.780> good<00:05:00.900> idea<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.290> how

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
that can give us a good idea of how

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.810 
that can give us a good idea of how
those<00:05:01.620> calves<00:05:01.890> are<00:05:02.040> going<00:05:02.190> to<00:05:02.280> do<00:05:02.400> on<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.640> rail

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
those calves are going to do on the rail

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.300 
those calves are going to do on the rail
in<00:05:02.940> terms<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.330> grade<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.050> yield<00:05:04.290> and<00:05:04.470> then<00:05:04.890> you

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
in terms of grade and yield and then you

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.770 
in terms of grade and yield and then you
know<00:05:05.430> from<00:05:05.610> my<00:05:05.730> perspective<00:05:05.790> when<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.420> put<00:05:06.690> an

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
know from my perspective when I put an

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.900 
know from my perspective when I put an
emphasis<00:05:06.930> on<00:05:07.550> structural<00:05:08.550> correctness

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
emphasis on structural correctness

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.720 
emphasis on structural correctness
that's<00:05:09.210> that's<00:05:09.630> just<00:05:09.870> going<00:05:10.050> back<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.320> saying

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
that's that's just going back and saying

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.430 
that's that's just going back and saying
even<00:05:11.730> though<00:05:11.850> we<00:05:12.050> realize<00:05:13.050> that<00:05:13.230> the<00:05:13.320> most

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
even though we realize that the most

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.230 
even though we realize that the most
important<00:05:13.890> thing<00:05:14.040> here<00:05:14.220> probably<00:05:14.460> is<00:05:14.850> carcass

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
important thing here probably is carcass

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.500 
important thing here probably is carcass
quality<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:16.410> credibility<00:05:17.030> we<00:05:18.030> still<00:05:18.270> need<00:05:18.420> to

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
quality and credibility we still need to

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.090 
quality and credibility we still need to
put<00:05:18.660> some<00:05:18.840> emphasis<00:05:19.020> on<00:05:19.350> having<00:05:19.500> these<00:05:19.740> cattle

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
put some emphasis on having these cattle

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.250 
put some emphasis on having these cattle
be<00:05:20.250> functional<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:20.880> sound<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.600> fur<00:05:22.020> not

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
be functional and sound and and fur not

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.110 
be functional and sound and and fur not
only<00:05:22.500> for<00:05:22.680> their<00:05:22.770> own<00:05:22.800> welfare<00:05:23.100> for<00:05:23.580> but<00:05:23.940> for

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
only for their own welfare for but for

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.940 
only for their own welfare for but for
their<00:05:24.240> ability<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:24.600> perform<00:05:24.870> correctly<00:05:25.410> and

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
their ability to perform correctly and

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.800 
their ability to perform correctly and
so<00:05:26.220> basically<00:05:26.670> what<00:05:26.940> we're<00:05:27.120> saying<00:05:27.150> when<00:05:27.660> we

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
so basically what we're saying when we
