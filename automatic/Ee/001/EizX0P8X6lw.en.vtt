00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.440
 in this video we are going to make a powder of 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:16.279
 rice and let's clear up the doubts that 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.580
 have arisen around its elaboration and 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.849
 let's start at once good what 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.619
 first that we're going to need I already 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.660
 I'm going to jump a few steps because I already have 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.109
 the video here I'll leave the link 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.230
 how it is prepared is that you are going to need 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:36.260
 rice be organic whether commercial 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.620
 you have to your reach and this one you are going to 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.870
 move to toast in a bowl and 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.590
 preference uses a wooden spoon 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.860
 to be stirring and that this is not 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.320
 burn and there according to the tone that you 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.780
 choose your skin color because 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.989
 Turn off the stove and let it cool down. 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.310
 little and then you pass to grind it good 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.600
 in this song I already be 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.910
 here it is 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.840
 I 'm not too much because if they can 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.850
 appreciate in my skin is clear and I do not occupy 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.090
 is this is a lot 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:18.490
 but yes but if you are a brunette or you compare 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.490
 cost a little more but good 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.010
 but yes 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.260
 but if you are a brunette, you will toast it 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.050
 a little kinder other doubts 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.950
 What I am going to answer is that many have 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:37.000
 said that the powder does not like like 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.630
 it smells but that is going to depend on me 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 advice that I give them always for my 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.510
 cossio to make my products 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.600
 home and I have my containers for 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.410
 that end nothing else I do not use those that 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.680
 used to cook or something like that not me 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.380
 I only continue for my products as 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.190
 I tell them for that I have those utensils 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.550
 and nothing else why not grab a smell 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.190
 unpleasant because suppose that in 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.830
 this pan I put koshetz and them and 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.170
 then I make the rice powder as it goes 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.230
 to impregnate is not the aroma or if I 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.320
 meat or something else because that's what I say 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.540
 better use a container for that 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.690
 end nothing more I know that sometimes you can 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.960
 cost us a little bit but it's worth it 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.460
 well the other can crush their rice and 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.940
 in this case I'm going to use a mill 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.970
 coffee or can use the liquidator and the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.630
 sieve preferably having the 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:45.400
 eyes very small so that the dust 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:49.140
 be much finer, I proceed and 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.140
 Horita showed them how it is 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.430
 strain 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:13.120
 can be fixed I was pretty finite 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.500
 and if in any case there are small groups 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.930
 you do not have to crush it again 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.650
 problem why we dismiss it as 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.650
 you want 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.890
 look are quite finite is another 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.630
 the questions that asked me what 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.239
 because sometimes it is a little thicker 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.610
 will depend a lot on where they crush it 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.520
 and also of the colander that does not leave 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:41.170
 escape those big groups 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.240
 good since we see it does not come out anymore here 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.170
 is here it stayed thick but here is 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.170
 quite finite 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.550
 I will keep the rest here 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.440
 and then I'm going to return to moles 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:02.130
 and next to continue this straining my dust 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.310
 of rice is that they ask me 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:09.360
 if all types of skins are used to everything 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.520
 type of foot from dry to fat in 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.100
 Special helps a lot to oily skin 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.489
 Adherence use it alone so that 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.530
 get the benefits of good rice 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.950
 It's almost over and right now I'm going to 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.950
 package 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.129
 another one of the doubts is that she 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.870
 they said about the aroma and I told him that 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.330
 Well, it's important to have a 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.990
 special container but if you 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.520
 you want to give a touch to your rice powder 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.210
 What I recommend is that you can use 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.020
 a drop of some essential oil that 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.250
 have nothing more than a small droplet 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.340
 you add to the container you are not going to 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.430
 save with a mask and what we're going to 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.740
 to do is that drop we're going to 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.020
 in the bottom of the container we're going to 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.220
 spread 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:04.430
 or you can wet a concitÃ³ and thus a 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.300
 around and it's all and then and 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.539
 mba argued 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.210
 your rice powder and this one is impregnated 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.270
 with the essential oil that is passed here 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.900
 I will not go throwing 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:21.920
 as I tell you the finite will depend 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:25.130
 how it grinds and how light 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.740
 col is so it's not impossible girls 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.540
 it can be pretty finite like that 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.040
 like me 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.450
 two 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.220
 3 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.500
 finite 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.640
 and no longer is it for that is the 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.640
 next video bay
