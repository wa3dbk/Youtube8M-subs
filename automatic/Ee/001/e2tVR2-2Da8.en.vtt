below<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.939> first<00:00:21.180> thing<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.510> be<00:00:21.539> aware<00:00:21.720> of

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
below the first thing to be aware of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.570 
below the first thing to be aware of
about<00:00:22.109> fossils<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.220> they<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
about fossils is that they are the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.580 
about fossils is that they are the
remains<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:24.210> living<00:00:24.570> organisms<00:00:25.230> from

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
remains of living organisms from

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.130 
remains of living organisms from
millions<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.369> years<00:00:26.820> ago<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.480> makes

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
millions of years ago and that makes

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.810 
millions of years ago and that makes
them<00:00:28.320> pretty<00:00:28.470> important<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.250> scientists

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
them pretty important to scientists

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.669 
them pretty important to scientists
because<00:00:30.359> they<00:00:30.539> allow<00:00:30.779> us<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.080> start<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.470> figure

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
because they allow us to start to figure

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860 
because they allow us to start to figure
out<00:00:31.890> how<00:00:32.189> different<00:00:32.550> species<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.329> changed

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
out how different species have changed

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.100 
out how different species have changed
over<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> course<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:35.219> time<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.850> how<00:00:36.780> much

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
over the course of time and how much

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.630 
over the course of time and how much
they've<00:00:37.380> changed<00:00:37.410> over<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.129> course<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.430> time

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
they've changed over the course of time

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.639 
they've changed over the course of time
and<00:00:38.820> how<00:00:38.969> quickly<00:00:39.329> they've<00:00:39.660> changed<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.290> how

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and how quickly they've changed and how

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.830 
and how quickly they've changed and how
they<00:00:40.800> developed<00:00:41.250> into<00:00:41.399> other<00:00:41.640> species<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
they developed into other species and it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080 
they developed into other species and it
also<00:00:43.020> lets<00:00:43.440> us<00:00:43.590> start<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.010> understand<00:00:44.550> where

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
also lets us start to understand where

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.630 
also lets us start to understand where
life<00:00:45.390> came<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.170> first<00:00:46.289> place<00:00:46.860> most

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
life came from in the first place most

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.190 
life came from in the first place most
of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> time<00:00:48.059> when<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.329> think<00:00:48.480> about<00:00:48.629> fossils

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
of the time when we think about fossils

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.319 
of the time when we think about fossils
we're<00:00:49.620> thinking<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.489> particular<00:00:50.670> type

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
we're thinking about one particular type

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
we're thinking about one particular type
of<00:00:51.360> fossil<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> type<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:52.980> fossil

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
of fossil and that's the type of fossil

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.880 
of fossil and that's the type of fossil
which<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.059> formed<00:00:54.449> from<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> hard<00:00:55.110> parts<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
which is formed from the hard parts of

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430 
which is formed from the hard parts of
an<00:00:56.100> organism's<00:00:56.730> body<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.629> things<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.050> shells

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
an organism's body so things like shells

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.479 
an organism's body so things like shells
bones<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.579> wood<00:01:00.440> this<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.680> an<00:01:01.829> important<00:01:02.309> type

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
bones and wood this is an important type

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.450 
bones and wood this is an important type
of<00:01:02.520> fossil<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> only<00:01:04.409> type<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
of fossil but it's not the only type the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.280 
of fossil but it's not the only type the
reason<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.479> very<00:01:06.659> common<00:01:06.990> type

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
reason that it's a very common type

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.800 
reason that it's a very common type
though<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:08.490> these<00:01:08.820> hard<00:01:09.180> parts<00:01:09.659> are

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
though is because these hard parts are

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
though is because these hard parts are
so<00:01:09.960> much<00:01:10.140> more<00:01:10.350> resistant<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.010> wear<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> tear

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
so much more resistant to wear and tear

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.460 
so much more resistant to wear and tear
they're<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> parts<00:01:12.900> which<00:01:13.080> tend<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> be

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
they're the parts which tend to be

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.800 
they're the parts which tend to be
preserved<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.250> longer<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:15.180> tend<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.540> stick

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
preserved for longer they tend to stick

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.990 
preserved for longer they tend to stick
around<00:01:15.930> much<00:01:16.439> longer<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.729> possible

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
around much longer and so it's possible

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.929 
around much longer and so it's possible
for<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.869> fossilized<00:01:19.610> simply<00:01:20.610> because

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
for them to be fossilized simply because

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.080 
for them to be fossilized simply because
they<00:01:21.689> last<00:01:21.990> through<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> process<00:01:23.090> softer

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
they last through the process softer

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.149 
they last through the process softer
body<00:01:24.270> parts<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.840> skin<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.439> muscle<00:01:25.979> tissue

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
body parts like skin and muscle tissue

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.030 
body parts like skin and muscle tissue
or<00:01:26.689> organisms<00:01:27.689> which<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.900> softer<00:01:28.470> bodies<00:01:28.770> so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
or organisms which have softer bodies so

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.280 
or organisms which have softer bodies so
for<00:01:29.250> example<00:01:29.670> jellyfish<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.540> thinking<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
for example jellyfish or thinking on a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.620 
for example jellyfish or thinking on a
smaller<00:01:31.619> scale<00:01:31.890> things<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.400> bacteria<00:01:33.090> it's

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
smaller scale things like bacteria it's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
smaller scale things like bacteria it's
much<00:01:34.020> more<00:01:34.259> difficult<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.860> these<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.340> be

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
much more difficult for these to be

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.319 
much more difficult for these to be
preserved

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
preserved

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.960 
preserved
that<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.409> decay<00:01:37.979> will<00:01:38.369> start<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that is because decay will start to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.999 
that is because decay will start to
break<00:01:39.210> down<00:01:39.479> their<00:01:39.689> bodies<00:01:39.990> long<00:01:40.560> before

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
break down their bodies long before

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.950 
break down their bodies long before
fossilization<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:42.119> start<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> take<00:01:42.720> place

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
fossilization can start to take place

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.200 
fossilization can start to take place
fossilization<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> fairly<00:01:44.369> slow<00:01:44.700> process

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
fossilization is a fairly slow process

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.770 
fossilization is a fairly slow process
and<00:01:45.420> decays<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> lot<00:01:46.500> faster<00:01:47.630> occasionally<00:01:48.630> we

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and decays a lot faster occasionally we

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.410 
and decays a lot faster occasionally we
get<00:01:48.960> lucky<00:01:49.310> sometimes<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.850> conditions

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
get lucky sometimes the conditions

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.340 
get lucky sometimes the conditions

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
example this is because prior to that

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.300 
example this is because prior to that
date<00:04:35.420> South<00:04:36.020> America<00:04:36.500> was<00:04:36.650> connected<00:04:37.190> to

date South America was connected to

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.640 
date South America was connected to
Africa<00:04:37.760> and<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.510> these<00:04:38.720> species<00:04:39.200> could<00:04:39.380> walk

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
Africa and so these species could walk

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.620 
Africa and so these species could walk
from<00:04:39.950> one<00:04:40.160> place<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.640> the<00:04:40.730> next<00:04:40.850> they<00:04:41.450> could

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
from one place to the next they could

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.580 
from one place to the next they could
walk<00:04:41.870> between<00:04:42.170> these<00:04:42.920> two<00:04:43.250> continents<00:04:44.590> after

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
walk between these two continents after

walk between these two continents after
that<00:04:45.740> date<00:04:45.980> all<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.940> sudden<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.570> fossil

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
that date all of a sudden the fossil

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.980 
that date all of a sudden the fossil

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
records don't match the two continents

became<00:04:51.380> separated<00:04:51.980> by<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.700> sea<00:04:53.000> which<00:04:53.300> then

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
became separated by a sea which then

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.720 
became separated by a sea which then
became<00:04:53.810> an<00:04:53.990> ocean<00:04:54.440> as<00:04:54.590> steadily<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.580> two

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
became an ocean as steadily the two

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.630 
became an ocean as steadily the two
continents<00:04:56.240> moved<00:04:56.540> apart<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:58.250> we<00:04:58.460> can

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
continents moved apart and so we can

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.810 
continents moved apart and so we can
pinpoint<00:04:58.910> when<00:04:59.840> it<00:04:59.990> was<00:05:00.320> that<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.310> continents

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
pinpoint when it was that the continents

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.540 
pinpoint when it was that the continents
start<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.210> move<00:05:02.360> apart<00:05:02.750> it's<00:05:03.650> most<00:05:03.890> obvious<00:05:04.040> if

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
start to move apart it's most obvious if

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.920 
start to move apart it's most obvious if
we're<00:05:04.760> looking<00:05:05.030> at<00:05:05.150> Africa<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:05.720> South

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
we're looking at Africa and South

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.750 
we're looking at Africa and South
America<00:05:06.020> because<00:05:06.740> we<00:05:06.890> can<00:05:07.040> see<00:05:07.220> such<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.490> good

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
America because we can see such a good

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.240 
America because we can see such a good
joint<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:08.720> that's<00:05:09.020> usually<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.650> example

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
joint and so that's usually the example

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.760 
joint and so that's usually the example
which<00:05:10.430> you'll<00:05:10.610> look<00:05:10.820> at<00:05:11.030> but<00:05:11.750> it's<00:05:11.990> true<00:05:12.290> for

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
which you'll look at but it's true for

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.920 
which you'll look at but it's true for
the<00:05:12.860> entire<00:05:13.190> history<00:05:13.550> of<00:05:13.820> how<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.270> continents

the entire history of how the continents

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.350 
the entire history of how the continents

have moved around and changed the fossil
record<00:05:17.780> is<00:05:17.990> a<00:05:18.050> crucial<00:05:18.890> piece<00:05:19.160> of<00:05:19.340> evidence

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490
