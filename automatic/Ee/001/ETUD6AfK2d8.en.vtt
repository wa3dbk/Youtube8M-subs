it with the wine emulator
and<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.880> runs<00:00:27.119> fine

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.460 

let's<00:00:33.290> get<00:00:33.470> started<00:00:37.840> unfortunately<00:00:38.840> we've

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
let's get started unfortunately we've

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.420 
let's get started unfortunately we've
got<00:00:40.240> artificial<00:00:41.240> light<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.320> you<00:00:42.950> see<00:00:43.160> a<00:00:43.190> lot<00:00:43.370> of

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
got artificial light so you see a lot of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.980 
got artificial light so you see a lot of
60<00:00:43.910> Hertz<00:00:44.120> from<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.140> AC<00:00:45.320> voltage<00:00:45.650> running<00:00:46.370> our

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
60 Hertz from the AC voltage running our

60 Hertz from the AC voltage running our
fluorescent<00:00:47.990> light<00:00:48.140> tubes<00:00:49.000> it's<00:00:50.000> better<00:00:50.270> if

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
fluorescent light tubes it's better if

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.210 
fluorescent light tubes it's better if
you<00:00:50.690> can<00:00:50.840> do<00:00:50.989> this<00:00:51.200> in<00:00:51.380> a<00:00:51.440> natural<00:00:51.890> light<00:00:52.040> in

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
you can do this in a natural light in

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.850 
you can do this in a natural light in
your<00:00:52.340> own<00:00:52.460> garage<00:00:52.660> outside<00:00:53.660> whatever<00:00:53.960> we<00:00:54.710> do

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
your own garage outside whatever we do

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.820 
your own garage outside whatever we do
the<00:00:55.100> horizontal<00:00:55.850> or<00:00:56.510> forward<00:00:57.110> cylinder<00:00:57.530> first

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
the horizontal or forward cylinder first

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.030 
the horizontal or forward cylinder first
because<00:00:58.370> it's<00:00:58.550> at<00:00:58.700> top<00:00:58.910> dead<00:00:59.180> center<00:00:59.540> the<00:01:03.040> cam

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
because it's at top dead center the cam

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.460 
because it's at top dead center the cam
is<00:01:04.250> not<00:01:04.430> under<00:01:04.820> tension<00:01:05.089> therefore<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.110> won't

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
is not under tension therefore it won't

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.999 
is not under tension therefore it won't
in<00:01:06.619> theory<00:01:07.520> affect<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.270> belt<00:01:08.479> tension<00:01:08.930> or<00:01:09.650> as

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
in theory affect the belt tension or as

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.640 
in theory affect the belt tension or as
the<00:01:10.400> vertical<00:01:10.850> cylinder<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.570> cam<00:01:11.840> could

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
the vertical cylinder the cam could

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.880 
the vertical cylinder the cam could
apply<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:13.009> force<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:14.600> sprocket<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:15.800> in

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
apply a force to the sprocket and in

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.130 
apply a force to the sprocket and in
that<00:01:16.070> might<00:01:16.280> affected<00:01:16.880> reading<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:17.869> I<00:01:17.899> always

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
that might affected reading so I always

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.890 
that might affected reading so I always
suggest<00:01:18.350> doing<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.160> top<00:01:19.460> dead<00:01:19.700> center

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.260 

so<00:01:25.440> we<00:01:25.620> thump<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> belt<00:01:26.370> and<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.760> look<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
so we thump the belt and we look at the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:38.340 
so we thump the belt and we look at the
frequency

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.500 

we<00:01:38.860> try<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.100> few<00:01:39.370> different<00:01:39.430> positions<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.210> see

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
we try a few different positions to see

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:51.249 
we try a few different positions to see
if<00:01:41.140> that<00:01:41.409> affects<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.830> quality

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.200 

now<00:01:51.829> maybe<00:01:52.189> coming<00:01:52.610> straight<00:01:52.850> in<00:01:53.000> from<00:01:53.180> the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
now maybe coming straight in from the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:03.029 
now maybe coming straight in from the
bottom<00:01:53.450> is<00:01:53.689> about<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.079> best

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.350 

looks<00:02:03.579> like<00:02:03.729> it's<00:02:03.909> about<00:02:04.890> 125<00:02:05.890> or<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:07.180> we're

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
looks like it's about 125 or so so we're

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.619 
looks like it's about 125 or so so we're
a<00:02:07.390> little<00:02:07.719> too<00:02:07.930> tight<00:02:08.369> alright<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:09.759> we<00:02:10.000> very

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
a little too tight alright so we very

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.770 
a little too tight alright so we very
gently<00:02:11.550> back<00:02:12.550> off<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.940> little<00:02:13.209> bit<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.690> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
gently back off a little bit of the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.759 
gently back off a little bit of the
pressure<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.790> bolts

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
pressure on the bolts

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.170 
pressure on the bolts
while<00:02:17.769> I<00:02:17.800> was<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.099> there<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.519> use<00:02:18.910> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
while I was in there I use the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.040 
while I was in there I use the
screwdriver<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.349> cooling<00:02:20.709> pin<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:22.450> lever

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
screwdriver in a cooling pin to lever

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.670 
screwdriver in a cooling pin to lever
against<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.830> tensioning<00:02:24.310> plate<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:26.019> loosen

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
against the tensioning plate to loosen

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.170 
against the tensioning plate to loosen
up<00:02:26.769> on<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.010> valve<00:02:27.310> just<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.940> little<00:02:28.209> bit<00:02:30.180> now

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
up on the valve just a little bit now

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.149 
up on the valve just a little bit now
let's<00:02:31.510> see<00:02:31.720> how<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.019> affects<00:02:32.640> frequency

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:43.030 

as<00:02:38.159> you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.459> see<00:02:38.640> with<00:02:38.819> our<00:02:39.590> trial<00:02:40.590> here

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
as you can see with our trial here

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.130 
as you can see with our trial here
the<00:02:43.400> lights<00:02:43.640> are<00:02:43.849> competing<00:02:44.510> with<00:02:44.540> us<00:02:44.810> for

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
the lights are competing with us for

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.430 
the lights are competing with us for
attention<00:02:45.860> on<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.190> guitar<00:02:46.670> tuner<00:02:47.379> so<00:02:48.379> you

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
attention on the guitar tuner so you

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.180 
attention on the guitar tuner so you
have<00:02:49.069> to<00:02:49.280> catch<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:50.440> frequency<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.590> create

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
have to catch the frequency you create

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.320 
have to catch the frequency you create
and<00:02:53.520> kind<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.760> average<00:02:54.180> those

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
and kind of average those

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.370 
and kind of average those
and<00:02:56.420> I've<00:02:56.870> been<00:02:57.170> seeing<00:02:57.880> hi<00:02:58.880> one<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.720> something

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
and I've been seeing hi one of something

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.740 
and I've been seeing hi one of something
and<00:03:00.740> then

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
and then

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.990 
and then
we're<00:03:03.750> probably<00:03:03.959> very<00:03:04.560> close<00:03:04.799> it's<00:03:05.220> all<00:03:05.400> 109<00:03:05.970> a

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
we're probably very close it's all 109 a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.030 
we're probably very close it's all 109 a
bunch<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.450> times<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.049> I'm<00:03:07.680> going<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.860> call<00:03:08.010> that

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
bunch of times so I'm going to call that

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:17.270 
bunch of times so I'm going to call that
good<00:03:08.250> for<00:03:08.790> one

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.700 

well<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.120> crankshaft<00:03:18.510> turning<00:03:19.110> tool<00:03:19.350> and

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
well the crankshaft turning tool and

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.040 
well the crankshaft turning tool and
will<00:03:20.190> actually<00:03:20.550> turn<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.000> engine<00:03:21.420> backwards

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
will actually turn the engine backwards

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.340 
will actually turn the engine backwards
90<00:03:22.410> degrees<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:23.390> get<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.540> rear<00:03:24.720> cylinder<00:03:25.110> top

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
90 degrees and get the rear cylinder top

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.890 
90 degrees and get the rear cylinder top
dead<00:03:25.590> center<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.250> we<00:03:26.400> can<00:03:26.750> tension<00:03:27.750> that

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
dead center so that we can tension that

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.080 
dead center so that we can tension that
belt<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.680> tabs<00:03:28.950> on<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.340> crankshaft<00:03:29.640> Turing

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
belt the tabs on the crankshaft Turing

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.720 
belt the tabs on the crankshaft Turing
tool<00:03:30.330> engage<00:03:31.260> in<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.590> notches<00:03:31.800> in<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.460> end<00:03:32.610> of

tool engage in the notches in the end of
the<00:03:32.820> crankshaft<00:03:33.290> line<00:03:34.290> those<00:03:34.560> up

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.319 

and<00:03:40.329> now<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.510> tighten<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:41.170> bolt<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.879> purpose

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
and now you tighten the bolt the purpose

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.550 
and now you tighten the bolt the purpose
of<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.540> bolt<00:03:43.749> is<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:44.019> give<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.379> lot<00:03:44.530> of

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
of the bolt is to give you a lot of

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.869 
of the bolt is to give you a lot of
tension<00:03:45.099> against<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.609> end<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:45.819> the

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
tension against the end of the

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.239 
tension against the end of the
crankshaft<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:47.319> want<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.650> make<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:47.950> bolt

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:48.249 
crankshaft you want to make this bolt

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.239 
crankshaft you want to make this bolt
tight<00:03:48.689> if<00:03:49.689> it's<00:03:49.989> too<00:03:50.230> loose<00:03:50.499> you're<00:03:50.889> actually

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:51.249 
tight if it's too loose you're actually

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:53.929 
tight if it's too loose you're actually
using<00:03:51.400> those<00:03:51.819> two<00:03:52.030> tabs<00:03:52.389> to<00:03:52.749> turn<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.139> engine

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
using those two tabs to turn the engine

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.729 
using those two tabs to turn the engine
instead<00:03:54.939> of<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.480> force<00:03:55.780> of<00:03:56.079> this<00:03:56.439> shaft

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
instead of the force of this shaft

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.660 
instead of the force of this shaft
against<00:03:57.129> the<00:03:57.280> end<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.549> crankshaft

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
against the end of the crankshaft

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.000 
against the end of the crankshaft
so<00:04:00.840> that's<00:04:01.840> decently<00:04:02.349> tight<00:04:03.389> we<00:04:04.389> go<00:04:04.569> back<00:04:05.010> 90

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
so that's decently tight we go back 90

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.149 
so that's decently tight we go back 90
degrees<00:04:06.400> which<00:04:06.909> would<00:04:07.030> be<00:04:07.120> just<00:04:07.359> more<00:04:07.569> than

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
degrees which would be just more than

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:19.000 
degrees which would be just more than
vertical

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.800 

conveniently<00:04:19.910> there's<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.210> mark<00:04:20.480> on<00:04:20.660> the

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
conveniently there's a mark on the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.870 
conveniently there's a mark on the
flywheel<00:04:20.930> -<00:04:21.470> all<00:04:22.010> right<00:04:22.160> you<00:04:22.340> see<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.640> mark

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
flywheel - all right you see the mark

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.180 
flywheel - all right you see the mark
lining<00:04:23.300> up<00:04:23.420> with<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.950> pointer<00:04:24.950> on<00:04:25.160> the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
lining up with the pointer on the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.120 
lining up with the pointer on the
flywheel<00:04:25.490> so<00:04:25.940> we<00:04:26.060> just<00:04:26.240> went<00:04:26.390> back<00:04:26.480> forward<00:04:27.130> so

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
flywheel so we just went back forward so

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.860 
flywheel so we just went back forward so
we<00:04:28.250> just<00:04:28.430> went<00:04:28.580> back<00:04:28.700> 90<00:04:29.180> degrees<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:29.720> get

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
we just went back 90 degrees to get

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.909 
we just went back 90 degrees to get
those<00:04:30.020> lined<00:04:30.290> up

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.589 

additionally<00:04:35.789> you<00:04:35.909> can<00:04:36.060> look<00:04:36.300> through<00:04:36.479> the

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
additionally you can look through the

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.429 
additionally you can look through the
spark<00:04:36.960> plug<00:04:37.229> hole<00:04:37.469> and<00:04:37.770> see<00:04:38.129> piston<00:04:39.080> all<00:04:40.080> right

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
spark plug hole and see piston all right

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.619 
spark plug hole and see piston all right
now<00:04:40.889> let's<00:04:41.490> try<00:04:41.819> to<00:04:41.939> get<00:04:42.389> some<00:04:42.629> readings<00:04:43.110> on

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:44.629 
now let's try to get some readings on

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:50.890 
now let's try to get some readings on
the<00:04:45.629> vertical<00:04:46.020> cylinder

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:58.880 

oh<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:51.470> see<00:04:51.890> that's<00:04:52.040> like<00:04:52.190> 114<00:04:53.030> 118

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.299 

like<00:04:59.250> 17

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:04.309 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:06.129 

pay<00:05:04.759> attention<00:05:04.789> as<00:05:05.419> you're<00:05:05.599> loosening<00:05:05.929> the

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
pay attention as you're loosening the

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.829 
pay attention as you're loosening the
screws<00:05:06.439> in<00:05:06.709> case<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.359> tensioning<00:05:08.359> bracket

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:08.839 
screws in case the tensioning bracket

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:12.579 
screws in case the tensioning bracket
shifts<00:05:10.479> because<00:05:11.479> if<00:05:11.689> it<00:05:11.839> shifts<00:05:12.289> you<00:05:12.379> might

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:12.589 
shifts because if it shifts you might

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:24.920 
shifts because if it shifts you might
not<00:05:12.859> need<00:05:13.189> to<00:05:13.249> move<00:05:14.059> it<00:05:14.239> otherwise

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.770 

we<00:05:25.230> just<00:05:25.500> moved<00:05:25.740> it<00:05:25.920> about<00:05:26.040> oh<00:05:26.610> maybe<00:05:27.480> two

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
we just moved it about oh maybe two

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.290 
we just moved it about oh maybe two
millimeters<00:05:31.400> when<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.490> frequency<00:05:33.000> is<00:05:33.090> higher

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
millimeters when the frequency is higher

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.309 
millimeters when the frequency is higher
that<00:05:33.450> means<00:05:33.630> you're<00:05:33.990> tight

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
that means you're tight

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.790 
that means you're tight
when<00:05:35.830> it's<00:05:35.979> too<00:05:36.249> low<00:05:36.460> it<00:05:36.639> means<00:05:36.789> you're<00:05:37.059> loose

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.920 

take<00:05:41.800> us<00:05:41.979> all<00:05:42.189> 107<00:05:42.939> a<00:05:43.029> few<00:05:43.240> times<00:05:43.539> let's

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
take us all 107 a few times let's

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.239 
take us all 107 a few times let's
tighten<00:05:44.619> it<00:05:44.680> back<00:05:44.889> up<00:05:45.159> just<00:05:45.189> a<00:05:45.849> little<00:05:45.879> bit<00:05:47.249> so

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:48.249 
tighten it back up just a little bit so

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.129 
tighten it back up just a little bit so
you<00:05:48.309> do<00:05:48.490> have<00:05:48.520> to<00:05:48.789> have<00:05:48.969> some<00:05:49.270> patience<00:05:49.719> using

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
you do have to have some patience using

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.209 
you do have to have some patience using
this<00:05:50.319> very<00:05:50.680> sensitive<00:05:51.249> guitar<00:05:51.610> tuner<00:05:53.099> and<00:05:54.099> I

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
this very sensitive guitar tuner and I

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.079 
this very sensitive guitar tuner and I
believe<00:05:54.520> you'll<00:05:54.729> see<00:05:54.969> people<00:05:55.240> saying<00:05:55.779> as<00:05:55.990> much

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:57.089 
believe you'll see people saying as much

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.429 
believe you'll see people saying as much
you'll<00:05:58.089> see<00:05:58.330> people<00:05:58.509> saying<00:05:58.869> as<00:05:59.020> much<00:05:59.050> on<00:05:59.349> the

00:05:59.429 --> 00:05:59.439 
you'll see people saying as much on the

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:03.640 
you'll see people saying as much on the
internet<00:05:59.740> too

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.240 

so<00:06:04.190> again<00:06:04.490> normally<00:06:04.940> you're<00:06:05.090> going<00:06:05.120> to<00:06:05.270> hear<00:06:05.449> a

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
so again normally you're going to hear a

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.780 
so again normally you're going to hear a
thump<00:06:07.250> without<00:06:07.639> a<00:06:07.669> rattle<00:06:07.970> behind<00:06:08.449> it<00:06:08.630> and

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
thump without a rattle behind it and

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.670 
thump without a rattle behind it and
something<00:06:10.790> about<00:06:11.180> having<00:06:11.720> this<00:06:12.440> particular

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
something about having this particular

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.120 
something about having this particular
engine<00:06:13.780> at<00:06:14.780> top<00:06:15.080> dead<00:06:15.350> center<00:06:15.710> for<00:06:16.010> the

little bit that's the first time I've
seen<00:06:20.419> that<00:06:23.020> we<00:06:24.020> torque<00:06:24.320> the<00:06:24.440> tensioning

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
seen that we torque the tensioning

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:30.850 
seen that we torque the tensioning

screws to 18 foot pounds 18 to 20 that's
good<00:06:41.320> alright<00:06:42.320> so<00:06:42.380> there<00:06:42.830> we<00:06:42.860> have<00:06:43.220> it<00:06:43.430> wrapped

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
good alright so there we have it wrapped
