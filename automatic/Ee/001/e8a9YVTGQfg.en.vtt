00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.010
 not 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.300
 hello me it's like a teen spirit 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.219
 of art in the vikings I will you 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.110
 present with the help of sophie and dwan 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.480
 says all you need to know to do 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.620
 for perfect equipment during 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.960
 trainings and competitions is this 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.400
 that we must not wear 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.720
 start with the hair so in 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.210
 the ideal one must have the hair 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.040
 attached and not detached to avoid 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.930
 to hurt themselves on the doors and that 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.570
 embarrassed at the base of the spots that 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.529
 will help to carry so in the idea has 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.710
 hair tied 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.809
 we see here the cheer go that is portable 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.430
 but not necessary so in the United States 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.350
 wears it a lot but it's a 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.670
 accessory therefore during training 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.100
 of mass graves competitions it is 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.220
 totally forbidden to have bracelets 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.630
 jewelry watches in general for 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.710
 security issues 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.210
 earrings are forbidden 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.489
 whether it's bits of spill in 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.200
 even from the very last bit of bone remains 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.940
 removed in the same way as 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.440
 bracelets just before the chains are 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.180
 removed collar or others to avoid 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.720
 for security issues of 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.640
 hang on 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.350
 so here we see sophie who is nicely 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.630
 chewing his chewing gum so 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.579
 to avoid absolutely not to 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.320
 choke up so the shoes 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.270
 important point also about the equipment 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.400
 must absolutely avoid any shoes 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.290
 who does not weary and who does not hold the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.270
 ankle there we see sophie wearing 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.979
 shoes rising my shoelace to 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.360
 absolutely avoid it's shoes 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.280
 reports in town but not in the room 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.680
 sport so there we see where they say there is 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.270
 sneakers there is bath made to be 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.979
 in the gym is what it takes 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.659
 absolutely have at competitions 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.220
 and workouts I 'm also going 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.710
 to think of keeping his men alive so 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.970
 not hurt the partners so for that 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.490
 you have to have the nails relatively 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.960
 short and no of them so have the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.060
 last essential element 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.400
 pompons used in training 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.960
 on our choreographies in competition 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.260
 also on matches to encourage the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.510
 players 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.799

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.330

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.040
