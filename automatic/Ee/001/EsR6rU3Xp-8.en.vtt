00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.490
 we have several evidences for the 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.340
 manifestation of the prophetic gift in the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.119
 last few days but a fundamental question 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
 is to ask what the same Bible says 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.420
 about this 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.960
 especially at a time when some 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.059
 Christians say that the prophetic was Don 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.670
 extinguished with the death of the apostles 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.739
 after the apostle john never over 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.580
 prophetic tone would manifest itself 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.970
 other Christians say that the whole 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.650
 community can be a prophet 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.839
 the Bible does not say that all Christians 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.220
 they would be prophets 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:05.129
 she says that the prophetic owner would be in 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.040
 first and foremost a permanent gift of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.460
 church that can manifest itself when it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.780
 judge fit 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.270
 unfortunately many people today use 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.580
 the spiritual gifts with a form of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:24.020
 self-exaltation I have such a gift 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.060
 not the principal of the spirit, or 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.790
 main virtue of humility 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.880
 But God can grant the gift. 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.950
 when necessary it is not always that we 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.000
 we find in the bible texts such as 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:43.340
 example roman 12 6 first 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.880
 corinthians 12 10 and 28 Ephesians 4 11 to 14 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.270
 who speaks that mentions the gift of prophecy 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.360
 among the gifts of the spirit bestowed upon 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.550
 church when someone says so I do not 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.770
 I accept no manifestation of the gift of 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.590
 spirit because I have the bible 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.500
 the person may be accepting the whole 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.560
 except the texts that promote 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.330
 promise a manifestation of the gift of 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.390
 spirit as part of the gifts of the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.670
 secondly the bible also teaches 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.970
 that we should reject only the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.989
 false prophets but never the prophets 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.060
 real eg in first john 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:33.739
 Chapter 4 1 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.050
 the apostle John tells us to approve the 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.900
 spirits 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:43.190
 sometimes being the last of the products 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.459
 apostles of living Christ he could 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.890
 to say regent to everything that comes 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.160
 then because I am the last - even 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.769
 but when it says so continue 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.730
 testing it is saying that as well as 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.330
 can there be the false can have what ? 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.310
 know and beyond that we have 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.010
 both biblical book joel chapter 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.129
 2 verses 28 to 31 as in the self 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.650
 apocalypse 1217 that one of the 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:14.250
 characteristics of the true church of 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.250
 last days would be that of the prophetic 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.599
 therefore it should manifest itself before 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.599
 of the Second Coming of Christ
