00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
and its pretty long I'd say it takes

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.840 
and its pretty long I'd say it takes
about<00:02:40.700> six<00:02:41.660> hours<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.200> beat<00:02:42.380> maybe<00:02:42.800> but<00:02:43.670> the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
about six hours to beat maybe but the
