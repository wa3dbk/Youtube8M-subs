00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.339
 hello to mouth all so in the present life we ​​learned 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.149
 how e install alain ekra andersson hunted down 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.179
 we can and we will learn how installed turned a thesis and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.749
 not chic it allows to have all the sites all the items of the cauldron theme 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.150
 who can say more 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.220
 so why and all that of course 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.460
 free 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.560
 so you go on the link it's cute 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.800
 so alter 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.410
 point and it is true that I 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.390
 mik he also in building the video 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.640
 but we wanted them to surpass the heat 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 he admits to download the technique 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.940
 you have to open it imperatively with him for a rare archinard 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.010
 so if you do not have where will go also put a link to download or a 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.180
 rare 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.800
 which you will do 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.230
 the sapmer full of clichés 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.810
 so that's fine you put it aside 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.960
 and you will do as of Tuesday 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.420
 executed 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.360
 for that sense atp of reaching for his you will do otherwise 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.520
 and the soap 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.989
 the posted promises a crack 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.980
 why the place 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.600
 and in the binary file the one we are interested in is a model in June 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.390
 unless a dot fr lights you big 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 open with 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.200
 winrar archives 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.330
 so you have the taste 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.800
 which closer all the game's files still hit in width that's 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.110
 very simple you will take the whole file 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.290
 all the files 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.110
 heyer but moved 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.030
 so for you so all the files of all the Russian military the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.100
 moved in yes we 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.220
 mineral a clear hatch 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.570
 we can avoid it 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.520
 you must also deleted metal a fault otherwise it will not work 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.280
 there you have a record at the amm is very pity the state of what I have 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.480
 already deleted 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.480
 so this is the state and no longer the fact that the right click deleted 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.980
 now start writing 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.810
 when time is healing 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 come dance and pray 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.929
 so there when you are and hop e 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.749
 the surfer 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.559
 you click on 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.299
 so there you have 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.029
 ozitem that you want 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:25.209
 so no sense that I'm going to throw that big trail 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.399
 imagine play sto I support 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.229
 and his stone shop 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.680
 it's arras it's for all tried on his case because his case so it's 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.099
 really handy 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.500
 when we know what we want and when we can remove everything we want 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.499
 very easily so it's great 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.590
 and there you will tell me that linear in multi it works 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.750
 poutine it also works all those collected by the investigators in the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.119
 collective is just starting 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
 and so there you go and it's not going to work 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.489
 so you go click on 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.649
 worth it to go 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.139
 click on options 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.749
 that's it in fact you just have to click hit 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.719
 and we know good against the flu at the edge 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.159
 and here 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.870
 nor students of all colors and everything from the few things but 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.019
 you still have the main 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.349
 and there is a small 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.680
 a politeness later m now that the guide if you want wool 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.579
 black 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.969
 so that you will notice that time there is not a stranger she is normal 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:28.339
 so at 35 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:30.699
 you have you carthage level 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.229
 your name 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.309
 thirty-five bears number wool two heavyweights and the number 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.579
 present red green yellow blue 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.139
 besides 15 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.430
 64 is the lucky number cuckoo leg and here it is so it's done 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.529
 described manipulation to be done 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:46.430
 like a hen 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.430
 more compact with all the mittens finally multiplayer 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.650
 so here I hope I helped you to install 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.579
 every weekend 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.599
