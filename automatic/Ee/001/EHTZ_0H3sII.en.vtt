 friends of chalaca point as one more time 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.940
 we are here where football calls us and 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.200
 this time in this season closing in 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.320
 the last football game of the year 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.290
 Peruvian I'm with Iván Carpio here 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.910
 in puno more than 3800 meters high 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.890
 I have not been shocked you wanted the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.420
 team crash but also of sight 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.060
 grabbing a little on the head how about 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.130
 has received you this beautiful city yes 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.359
 pretty good roberto as he said yes 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.859
 we are in fist we are closing 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.420
 practically a coverage campaign 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.140
 of what has been of chalaca puntocom 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.360
 peru cup in some way to be able 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.860
 accompany this final we have not already been 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.140
 in the final one way and in Cajamarca and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.660
 now we are here present where already 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.370
 you see more or less a final climate not 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.510
 people are already a little bit hooked on 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.010
 what is this party 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.320
 he worked there are promises that they are going to 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.610
 fill the stadium and above all 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.310
 things we hope that tomorrow there will be no 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.960
 no good drawback this is this 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.240
 a beautiful city ​​is a very 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.190
 quiet and also this has received us 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.980
 wait a little more cold with a sun 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.210
 radiant and if this weather tomorrow is 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.520
 replicate the time of the match will have 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.800
 a perfect space to play soccer 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.230
 and the truth is that people are very 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.760
 quiet and has a very noble spirit 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.950
 As some people said, we talked 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.600
 here in the square then sometimes it costs 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.050
 believe a little that there is also is all 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.690
 these fears of rioting facts or 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.430
 problems in the stadium but certainly 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.729
 it's a hot match yes effectively 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.590
 but good we saw a detail not in the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.430
 airport when it reached the people of 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.860
 utc for there the feeling is a bit 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.390
 different the same taxi drivers that 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.460
 they found in the harbor a little 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.660
 they tried to make you feel but not in 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.430
 large number but they tried to do 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.270
 feel the visiting team in that 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.640
 condition so it is normal of all 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.100
 ways but we see here people put is 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.740
 a little quieter 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.900
 and we must point out that for example 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.700
 talks about the background of unicachi 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.500
 with union trade in 2010 had some 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.299
 acts of violence with a problem but 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.570
 that match was in juliaca this match 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.189
 it's in fist we talk about two cities that 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.690
 although they are very close and belong to 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.250
 the same region have some rivalry 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.000
 each other and also have encouragement 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.640
 distinct yes of course this anyway 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.620
 it's a match in another city 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.970
 normally in fist very few times already 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.280
 gives some kind of these problems not 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.350
 mostly it has been in juliaca like you 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.750
 you point out I think tomorrow of a match 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.150
 be calm that yes this is going to be 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.400
 a pressure on alfonso ugarte because 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.800
 remember that you have to flip a 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.540
 score from 2 to 0 not against then 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.819
 is 3 to 0 classifies it directly 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.489
 not then there comes a little what is 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.610
 this the approach that is going to be 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.739
 chalaca gonzales in the sense that no 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.260
 come out pressed not to go out to be a 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.840
 party where you can find those 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.180
 of suddenly a goal or two quick goals 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.680
 in the first time but you have to have 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.420
 be very careful with you that you do not 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.890
 he says this is not a team that is aligned 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.670
 throw back is a team that has pulled out 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.490
 results 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.920
 positive in visiting condition and that 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.510
 it also somehow not painted 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.430
 as a team that is going to come to close 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.739
 back how they made that mistake 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.720
 some others who arrived earlier by 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.920
 example the hurricane case what I had 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.690
 a difference assured practically 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.220
 in Arequipa and he was wrong in the way 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.530
 face the game here on point and 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.540
 he lost the match and the other teams 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.819
 that also fell here not if there 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.010
 confidence of the puna fan that is here 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.489
 we can always flip it is blunt 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.720
 It's not hard at home and I think that 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.459
 is going to be the brand so it's finally 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.769
 when conjugating achieve the title of the cup 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.610
 Peru is not going to equal a brand 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.890
 that in 1998 he did and neither of talara not that 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.519
 was the only team so far in the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.010
 editions of this national stage in which 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.959
 could flip markers at home but 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.870
 always lost out champion not without 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.360
 make a single point out home and here in 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.549
 one as we told you has arrived 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.900
 utc has also arrived with us by 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.230
 the morning 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.989
 quiet flight that juliaca puno juliaca 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.180
 and there he moved to cap 1 is already 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.239
 the team then of rafa castle 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.040
 also and rather here the expectation 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.629
 you have to see the environment of the place you 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.030
 that has to do with moses condori no 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.729
 on the front pages of newspapers is the 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.550
 icon here the idol the puneño symbol of 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.970
 this art the replacement of magallanes 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.100
 obviously obvious natural and that is something 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.259
 quite commented in absence that goes to 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.900
 regret but they are already face to face 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.240
 two forces pairs one seeks to return to 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.880
 first after 21 years instead of 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.530
 you are after 19 years are two 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.760
 teams that have had stories 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.669
 similar have reached cup 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.039
 liberators in the few years of 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.660
 validity have had times of crisis and 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.400
 Today, there is an impulse 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.260
 business political enterprise 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.539
 important that it seeks to return to the 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.370
 exact close- ups anyway 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.810
 they have enough similar stories in 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.479
 what is the financing of 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.330
 your campaign two people like you say 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.240
 be out there mixed with the field 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.980
 politically and surely this morning then 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.840
 we are definitely going 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.790
 which of them is the last member of 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.830
 what will be the decentralized 2013 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.470
 with Ivan here traveling good 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.240
 course and talking to people we 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.740
