00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.440
 that it is for the bergischen lions one 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.080
 more than hard work against the 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.730
 gaulier from the alb would get 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.580
 the team of thc cheftrainer 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.840
 sebastian hinze just off the attack 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.960
 clearly felt 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.689
 the hbw went extremely robust to works 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.699
 but apparently too physical for 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.860
 the impartial the same 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.110
 energetically intervened for the second minute of play 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.809
 and kai häfner after a supposed one 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.809
 elbow check against fabian gutbrod with 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.640
 directed to the red card of the field 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.829
 only one attack later it hit then 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.430
 wolfgang strobel with a time penalty 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.700
 after being bac captain viktor szilagyi 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.129
 struck down 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.899
 the appearance of the guests in the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.629
 followed by the Bergisch first 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.550
 lions after customers the homeowners from the 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.860
 double overpayment situation no 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.170
 countable capital also beat in the 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.039
 defensive was the bhc neat 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.850
 demanded was hbw coach Rolf Brack 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.250
 as expected with the seventh 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.920
 Field players act and that almost 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.240
 Perfect for the Bergisch 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.700
 until shortly before the semester siren 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.319
 actually no clear chance for one 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.869
 hit in the empty guest gate 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:26.380
 an intermediate 2-door tour 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.729
 to the 8 to 6 could the bhc in the further 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.190
 do not hold gameplay 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.950
 Balingen made up for the 9 9 and left 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.229
 do not loose almost every success of the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.840
 Bergischen Löwen needed a huge 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.729
 For example , led kraftaktes 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.489
 christian height before a looming 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.500
 timeless play from the outside 

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:46.920
 bullet to the 9 to 7 in the mesh 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.209
 a few minutes later it is a circle runner 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.950
 stankovic following a rebound 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.840
 Trying by christian rose 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.520
 quickly recording and themselves 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.090
 equal to three opponent players 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.560
 for 11 to 10 interspersed 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.390
 with the last two hits before 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.069
 semester siren got the Bergisch 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.340
 For the first time, lions will be realistic 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.170
 chance to meet the orphaned goal of the hbw 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.390
 to be able to 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.550
 I do not forbid anyone to the empty gate 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.099
 throw but then wait a 100 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.590
 bhc coach had a percentage rate 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.959
 sebastian hinze before the part the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.840
 Devise spent with care the 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.220
 supposedly easy goals to achieve 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.350
 and his crew captain viktor 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.420
 szilagyi sank two balls 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.610
 thought fast and fantastically safe in the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.950
 enemy housing 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.080
 now the solinger lion cage with 15 was 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.810
 to 11 half-time out of the house 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.400
 Baden Württemberger has four gates 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.050
 residue apparently in the approach 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.510
 emotionally struck 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.920
 but the bergischen lions could this 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.269
 with the re-whistle not before 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.180
 make the most of it 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.549
 on the 16 to eleven followed a 3 goals 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.220
 series of the balinger are not there 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.760
 Invited by inaccurate BHC play 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.549
 again brought in the party with the 23 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.780
 23 by florian billek resembled the 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.549
 Gallier out with the draw of 27 27 went 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.830
 the game is now in the decisive phase 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.290
 in the home crowd the fans again 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.150
 provided an absolute handball thriller 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.040
 but before the time came 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.959
 freak of the game christoph 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.329
 theu purchase of the compensation 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.799
 kristian nippes fell to the ground 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.780
 so unhappy on the hand 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.970
 that he equals a finger 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.459
 several times distended and for a few minutes 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.970
 supported by bhc physiotherapist 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.780
 carsten balance and oliver riemann 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.940
 team doctor of the bergische lions 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.070
 had to be treated balingen came 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.140
 better off the break and he lays 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.930
 on 27 29 ago 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.700
 but the bhc kept like over the whole 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.070
 energetic against it 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.170
 It really was not a game of handball 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.600
 aesthetes and friends beautiful moves 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.799
 but the final spurt of the Bergisch 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.690
 lions to one in the end 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.019
 fair and deserved 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.730
 The 2713 spectators voted in favor of the point 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.650
 in the fourth time in a row 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.530
 sold out klingenhalle quite 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.389
 satisfied 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.519
 the decisive proportion was bhc goalkeeper 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.530
 mario chicken stick of the few 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.120
 minutes almost uninterrupted between the 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.440
 post stood and with two 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.120
 sensational couple 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.890
 have one in the crunchtime 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.290
 Outstanding performance the crown 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.120
 put on and the bergischen lions the 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.500
 Tenth point in the fight for the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.500
 kept the class
