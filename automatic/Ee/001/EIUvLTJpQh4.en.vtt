00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:19.320
 bio profit also for the fat ones yes 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:22.230
 based on protein compounds fat burning 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.460
 polyunsaturated fatty acids vitamins and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.430
 minerals 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.890
 here the function is with elements 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.169
 Fat Burning like the Malabar Tamarind 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 which is a fruit before called line 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.390
 garcía campoy to gain field and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.699
 has promotes weight loss has 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.800
 a component that is hydroxy acid 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.140
 citrus that accelerates the mechanisms 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.000
 thermogenic in the body and this is 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.180
 we have added a component too 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.680
 patented that is called but 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.950
 pound-for-pound does not make them pro life 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.350
 we have a provider like that 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.910
 high biotechnology 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.700
 that manufactures this free pro that is a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.610
 combination 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.340
 and protects itself and this project what 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.380
 does is inhibit the deposition of fat and 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.720
 rather burn the fat break the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.370
 deposits of fat without damaging these 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.190
 made with clinical tests of but 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.020
 pounds if there are changes in the composition 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.600
 of the body effectively reduces the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.850
 fat but if not affect the more cameras 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.920
 well muscle mass without kata because the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.479
 well goes without losing weight people by 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.610
 example that do not eat do not lose weight 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.180
 because because the organism starts to 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.050
 use the muscle to generate energy 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.760
 let me do weights this sentence the idea is 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.620
 lose weight eye is not going to the bathroom go down 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.990
 of weight do not tell the bathroom to lose weight 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.590
 it's not losing muscle mass losing weight 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.720
 is to eliminate fatty tissue and that's what 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.630
 does with elements that more fat like 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 but pound and other elements that 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.750
 we had seen how the tamarind itself 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.790
 help you lose weight others there 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.880
 components like amino acids 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.890
 the linen cited taurine carnitine 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.330
 etcetera are combinations of 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.820
 amino acids that also help 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.070
 eliminate fat and in fact we have 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.390
 incorporated here we have amino acids 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.540
 burn until the combination of 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.239
 carnitine and taurine the girls forums in 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.010
 the carnitine because creams that provide 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.900
 carnitine that are recommended by 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.489
 example for cellulite by the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.450
 carnitine can be used topically 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.209
 or you can be like a nutrient and 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.950
 it also provides calcium and iron and zinc and 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.410
 is again sweetened with 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.569
 then you will lose weight but without 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.489
 francis but on the contrary toning 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.349
 ok muscles 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.000
 look at modifying the muscles because 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:47.519
 Each serving has 17.1 grams of 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.080
 proteins how wonderful this 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.810
 product 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.690
 is a protein agent that produces a 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.060
 feeling of satiety and the appetite of 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.470
 a natural and excellent way 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.170
 nutrition 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.580
 there are people to lose weight what 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.970
 they do is stop eating is the most 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.270
 easy but it's not the healthiest way not 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.520
 you have to stop eating you have to eat more 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:16.500
 but more intelligent min 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:21.480
 there's the key, it only gives you 90 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.150
 calories per serving do not see care 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.210
 to tell you that he gained weight taking 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.090
 own video what happens is something 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.310
 good human beings we are incredible 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.940
 There are people who say I'm going to take 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.330
 ok but firm tomato does not whistle me because 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.330
 taking 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.030
 take care the body keeps counting the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.460
 calories keeps counting the calories 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.490
 but nobody is going to gain weight with 90 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.810
 calories and look at this is a comparison 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.790
 that I do in my country 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.170
 this is a very famous chocolate is called 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:05.220
 doña pepa if doña pepa has to contribute 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:07.830
 and for every 100 grams 480 calories yes and 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.460
 in the ratio of three chocolates of 20 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.820
 grams 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.440
 we are talking about 120 calories if 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.180
 this product brings you 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.400
 three quarters of the calorie 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.700
 from chocolatito so famous in my country 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.830
 you always have to look at the calories 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.190
 there are people who are addicted to chocolates 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.580
 for example comical or eat me there you see 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.020
 that's just a lot so that the organism 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.940
 not interested neither the size nor the 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.210
 appearance of the food what 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.410
 interesting is the caloric content that is 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.200
 what interests the body is what 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.680
 the agency counts 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.210
 a salad bowl for example after 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.860
 less than 100 calories 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.639
 unlike a doritos bag that 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.960
 had so many calories 8 100 800 the 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.639
 hamburger you eat with gemma bigmat 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.920
 1200 calories 1000 1200 calories 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.830
 depending on the sauce that milk 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.030
 be very careful those do not fool yourself with the 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.030
 appearance of food
