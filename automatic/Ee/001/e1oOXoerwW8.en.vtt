00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.799
 in this video we will see 5 errors that 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:07.109
 we commit to make- up and 5 solutions 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.330
 easy the first error is using the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.490
 makeup sometimes we think that while 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.889
 more makeup we have more beautiful we go 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.139
 to show off however this is not quite 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.880
 true since in the case of makeup 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.789
 especially for the newspaper 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.710
 - is more remember that one of the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.840
 most important rules to achieve a 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.029
 balanced look is that if we make up 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.780
 much the eyes the lips should go what 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.510
 as natural as possible and no cds 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.610
 the second is to apply makeup on 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.560
 dry skin this is another mistake that is 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.300
 commits frequently since of this 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.710
 way we will not have a good effect if 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.840
 we apply the base on the skin 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.790
 dehydrated after cleaning and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.860
 tone the face look for the cream 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.559
 moisturizer that feels best to you before 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.090
 use the makeup we apply it for everything 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.680
 the face imparting it until it 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.650
 absorb and just at that moment 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.600
 we apply the base you will see that the face 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.700
 makeup is much more attractive with 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.129
 the previously hydrated skin of the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.960
 otherwise it may look quartered 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.559
 flaky and accentuate the lines of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.559
 expression and wrinkles 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.690
 the third is to use the wrong base 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.700
 to buy the correct base 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.770
 try several options either in the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.230
 nose that the most prominent part of 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.360
 face or on the border between the face and 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.000
 the neck to have uniformity between 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.430
 them the one that is best founded with the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.440
 Your skin color will be correct if 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.170
 you have a very clear base and a very 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.000
 dark do not discard them test mixing 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.520
 each other until it gives a tone 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.290
 similar to that of your skin the function of 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.900
 base as its name implies is to give 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.640
 uniformity and cover imperfections 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.400
 that's why the tone should be as close as 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.200
 possible to the color of your skin if you want 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.780
 a tanned skin tone or have 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.390
 better coverage the solution is not a 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.820
 darker or lighter base look good 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.970
 in the color that you apply 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.580
 the fourth design pray the tile for a 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.979
 complete and successful look you must have very 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.690
 consider your eyebrows since they are the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.520
 frame of the eyes and when they are 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.440
 arranged the look stands out a lot 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.320
 more for this we have several options 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.660
 like the epilator the blade and my 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.550
 favorite the wax because with these the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.209
 eyebrows are much more defined and 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.610
 clean 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.620
 tests and the fifth is to use the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.080
 lip liner different to lipstick 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.440
 this is another one is not very common if you notice 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.600
 better does not look good the pencil helps 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.700
 that last much longer the labials but if 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.890
 you do not have both similar is better than 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.480
 apply only the lipstick or we can use 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.820
 the pencil in several ways the first 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.040
 option is to delineate the outline of the 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.000
 lips and fill a little leaving 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.000
 the center without color 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.079
 immediately we apply a shine that can 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.939
 be clearer by mixing together and 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.060
 we will give a volume effect in the 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.190
 lips 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.760
 the second option is to delineate the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.760
 contour 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.629
 completely fill the lips 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.610
 and apply a similar shadow to free 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.610
 leaving a very matt effect 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.990
 or it is simply much better than 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.570
 let's define the outline we fill 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.940
 completely lips and so we can 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.580
 use any lip color or shine 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.010
 On this base 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.780
 this will give us changes of shades that 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.850
 will look great without leaving the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.819
 outlined a color and fill 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.969
 other 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.889
 and so we ended up as I read there 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.439
 Use of makeup is an art that is going 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.239
 learning with practice with knowing 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.799
 the products that we feel better and 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.749
 discard those that we feel worse 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.629
 We can solve and avoid any 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:55.200
 inconvenient I hope you like it 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.200
 Thank you
