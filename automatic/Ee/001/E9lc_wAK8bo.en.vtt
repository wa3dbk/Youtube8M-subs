 Today's video I'm going to say a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.650

 the ie8 in one it has the protection factor 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.439
 solar and 30 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.439
 it also has a bi protection 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.160
 antioxidant an intelligent hydration 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.530
 and leaves the velvety skin of toppings 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.230
 uniforms must be completed and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.010
 fight free radicals and disguises 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.040
 poor 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.200
 so it's basically good cream with a 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.469
 body and a protector a sun protection 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.829
 as functions there is more like the function of 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.289
 primer protect and moisturize the skin 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.370
 My color is beige medium beige had 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.559
 light and dark 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.140
 op is where is the network Shishindo 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.680
 new the cosmetics that is the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.979
 Sabrina Sato on the cover release not 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.470
 advice when it launched but 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.320
 without these three colors here look a clear 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.570
 the middle and the dark I experienced the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.729
 picture was very clear and look I'm not 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.860
 well white and I got the middle I guess 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.240
 That was cool on my skin. 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.630
 he's 39.90 for promotion because 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.829
 but its normal price of 49 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.259
 90 and I thought it was cool , that's when I just launched 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.020
 a spout in mainly for having a 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.970
 sun protection factor 30 which is very 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.659
 important I say this in all 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.420
 videos is always very important 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.880
 treat skin to care from early to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.810
 To warn because when I 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.270
 front 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.790
 do not go ahead so much money you have 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.619
 make the botox that makes the appearance of 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.350
 skin sometimes does not get better 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.230
 the idea of this video is very quick on 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.420
 some products 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.970
 so I'll talk about some aspects 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.420
 I think all aspects are important. 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.050
 This bwila is the 30 factor solar protection 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.790
 and it is co uk family foot is not there 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.850
 need you to use a very basic 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.790
 care it leaves a natural look 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:27.340
 then it comes in packaging so 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:31.510
 rotate spin comes 50 grams of product has 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.780
 a half liquid aspect it is medium 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.210
 creamy is the liquid, but it is not 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.400
 thick a museum base 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.710
 I'll go over details of the face only 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.900
 to give us a break in question 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.820
 coverage 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.400
 I have a lot of blemish and only a lot of it. 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.010
 red then probably any 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.570
 The thing that I pass will make a difference. 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.060
 but we will still evaluate others 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.720
 aspects I put a little here 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.230
 in my hand o climate so free so he 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.540
 Do not choose so much, I'll spend 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.540
 face with a tongue cap brush 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:15.519
 Now, father, I 'm going to punish you. 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.070
 not to stay the mark of the brush you 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.650
 You can also swipe with a sponge or 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.579
 with a big band with anything 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.430
 like this 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.310
 I'm back to drinking, I better enjoy with 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.060
 the big band did not find one of the china I 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.060
 waiting for you, it has not arrived yet 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.060
 excited 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.310
 now I stopped having a drink of my 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.500
 part I'm going to touch a little more oily 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.330
 so sometimes some products are 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.780
 much more valuable it is important to take 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.910
 careful about it 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.830
 looking in the mirror you can see that this 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.590
 side is actually a bit more 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.410
 uniform that because if I continue 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.950
 red I do not have anything but here 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.160
 there is no uniformity in my dark circles 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.350
 more or less did not even touch the way 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.590
 nothing a corrective does not solve 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.539
 passed before but the video proposal is 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:17.910
 actually show only the product 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:26.169
 increase bwila and it 's drier oh 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:27.789
 did not stay inside what I found this 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.470
 so cool 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.389
 Maybe there it's a little bit 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.030
 Chosen for me because I'm very 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.010
 white but you get much whiter 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.090
 so I thought this color was over 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.729
 getting better 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.970
 I really liked the product, I think. 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.849
 that by a factor of sun protection 30 and 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.090
 by price is on promotion being 39 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:53.590
 90 super worth the price yes 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.639
 I think it's really good, I like it, I like it 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.280
 enough of the idea is to have products 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.590
 very cool and not only I like several 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.930
 boys several bloggers and comment on 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.650
