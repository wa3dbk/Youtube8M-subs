00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 U 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.419
 on 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.419
 on 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.680
 Oo 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.520
 222 5 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.350
 we go 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.960
 I thought it might be easy to play a fellow game at first. 3 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:40.010
 If you lower your level and see the level 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:43.100
 There are so many different ways to make it so cash 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.850
 I also want to buy items that I think 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.850
 I think there's such a charm to pull an egg . 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.490
 on 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.490
 yet 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.320
 Courtesy Unlike this site but try to play a little episode simple 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:06.580
 So tell me 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:12.550
 Er Blade actually rises up the stage like this and the lesson 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:16.300
 Raising such fun, but something in between the user and the one cut 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:22.450
 Uh eventually married dadeunji deoraguyo presented many such things 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:25.030
 I've been close to one of those 10 consecutive wins. 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.890
 Anyway , 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:34.630
 It is rattling pro gamer controls now that things are a little 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.579
 I think that is a little dotji downed more than others, so you have fun preferable 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:43.240
 Well 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:48.600
 There are techniques to defend, not just attack. 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:53.049
 When your opponent attacks you press a defensive key, there is a counterattack . 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.110
 If I mix them well, 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.530
 Before the opponent has a character 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:05.229
 The basic stats, these things are not good, the item is bad. 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:09.160
 I could cover those things, so it was fun. 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:15.400
 Uh getting to break the rock stage 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:20.620
 Post deoraguyo not easy even if only the easiest difficulty level, the short hand 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:27.930
 That's a bit of a game, 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.930
 I have to go to sleep, but the shepherd keeps on listening, 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.120
 on 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.120
 we were 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.870
 lee 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.870
 wire 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:57.190
