00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
I'll show you the blade first we'll go

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.660 
I'll show you the blade first we'll go
over<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.410> specs<00:02:45.950> as<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.160> can<00:02:47.280> see<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.519> has<00:02:47.610> a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
over the specs as you can see it has a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.390 
over the specs as you can see it has a
really<00:02:47.940> big<00:02:48.180> front<00:02:48.599> end<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.349> has<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> lot

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
really big front end to it it has a lot

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.039 
really big front end to it it has a lot
of<00:02:50.430> maps<00:02:50.670> right<00:02:50.970> there<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.720> that's<00:02:51.810> what

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
of maps right there and that's what

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.539 
of maps right there and that's what
gives<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.440> really<00:02:52.769> good<00:02:52.890> chopping<00:02:53.250> is

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
gives it the really good chopping is

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.729 
gives it the really good chopping is
it's<00:02:53.760> really<00:02:54.090> front<00:02:54.569> heavy<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:55.500> not<00:02:55.620> the

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
it's really front heavy it's not the

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.250 
it's really front heavy it's not the
best<00:02:55.890> balance<00:02:56.370> knife<00:02:56.579> in<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.849> world<00:02:57.030> as<00:02:57.329> you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
best balance knife in the world as you

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.350 
best balance knife in the world as you
can<00:02:58.379> see<00:02:59.150> but<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.829> this<00:03:01.829> it's<00:03:02.760> really<00:03:03.030> front

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
can see but it's this it's really front

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.850 
can see but it's this it's really front
heavy<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.840> makes<00:03:04.079> it<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.349> lot<00:03:04.470> better<00:03:04.530> at

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
heavy so it makes it a lot better at

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.170 
heavy so it makes it a lot better at
chopping<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.560> kind<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.829> has<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> heavy<00:03:08.400> it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
chopping so it kind of has a heavy it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.050 
chopping so it kind of has a heavy it
kind<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.420> feels<00:03:09.480> heavy<00:03:10.280> like<00:03:11.280> from<00:03:11.549> word<00:03:11.790> in

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
kind of feels heavy like from word in

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.210 
kind of feels heavy like from word in
your<00:03:12.239> hand<00:03:12.480> but<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:13.440> makes<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.890> for<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.069> and

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
how that is it chopped in it comes with

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
pretty nice in your hand this could be

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.360 
pretty nice in your hand this could be
used<00:03:48.299> as<00:03:48.419> a<00:03:48.450> fighting<00:03:48.870> knife<00:03:49.019> too<00:03:49.560> probably

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
used as a fighting knife too probably

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.670 
used as a fighting knife too probably
just<00:03:50.639> as<00:03:50.819> good<00:03:51.030> as<00:03:51.329> it<00:03:52.019> would<00:03:52.109> be<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.290> survival

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
just as good as it would be a survival

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.099 
just as good as it would be a survival
knife<00:03:52.950> but<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:54.329> seems<00:03:54.630> like<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.810> would<00:03:54.959> be<00:03:55.019> a

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
knife but it seems like it would be a

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.809 
knife but it seems like it would be a
little<00:03:55.290> bit<00:03:55.500> too<00:03:55.680> heavy<00:03:56.040> for<00:03:56.250> me<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.430> would

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
little bit too heavy for me I would

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.129 
little bit too heavy for me I would
rather<00:03:57.239> have<00:03:57.510> something<00:03:57.720> that's<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.019> little

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
rather have something that's a little

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.629 
rather have something that's a little
bit<00:03:58.290> lighter<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:58.980> little<00:03:59.459> more

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
bit lighter this little more

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:06.170 
bit lighter this little more
maneuverable<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.780> know<00:04:01.160> so<00:04:02.480> yeah<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:05.220> the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
blade is covered in black epoxy so that

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.390 
blade is covered in black epoxy so that
after<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.720> while<00:04:12.780> they'll<00:04:13.079> come<00:04:13.319> off<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.919> kind<00:04:14.220> of
