Smackdown one as you can see it's

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.750 
Smackdown one as you can see it's
already<00:00:18.330> been<00:00:18.600> completed<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.350> did<00:00:20.039> record<00:00:20.490> that

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
already been completed I did record that

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.200 
already been completed I did record that
one<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> quality<00:00:22.410> ended<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.949> acting<00:00:23.580> up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
one but the quality ended up acting up

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.179 
one but the quality ended up acting up
and<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:24.990> glitched<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.859> end<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and it like glitched the end of the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.490 
and it like glitched the end of the
video<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.420> wouldn't<00:00:27.630> process<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> file

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
video and it wouldn't process the file

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.870 
video and it wouldn't process the file
so<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.010> wouldn't<00:00:29.400> get<00:00:29.490> upload<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.029> YouTube<00:00:30.410> so

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
so it wouldn't get upload to YouTube so

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.670 
so it wouldn't get upload to YouTube so
that's<00:00:32.880> why<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.390> one's<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.440> would

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
that's why that one's not up it would

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.750 
that's why that one's not up it would
not<00:00:34.800> allow<00:00:34.920> me<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.219> upload<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.820> YouTube<00:00:36.140> so

not allow me to upload it to YouTube so

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.400

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
how I've been doing I could probably do

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
how I've been doing I could probably do
that<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:48.240> make<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.539> non<00:01:48.750> live<00:01:49.020> commentary

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that to make it a non live commentary

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.950 
that to make it a non live commentary
but<00:01:49.710> other<00:01:49.920> than<00:01:50.069> that<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.550> don't<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.600> miss

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
but other than that I don't really miss

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.929 
but other than that I don't really miss
I<00:01:52.170> don't<00:01:52.440> really<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.280> could

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
I don't really think I could

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.459 
I don't really think I could
it's<00:01:55.090> like<00:01:55.240> commentate<00:01:55.810> a<00:01:55.840> match<00:01:56.140> like<00:01:56.380> oh

most<00:04:09.159> is<00:04:09.459> maybe<00:04:09.670> been<00:04:09.909> virtually<00:04:11.640> disappeared

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
most is maybe been virtually disappeared

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.000 
most is maybe been virtually disappeared
there's<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.599> clothesline<00:04:13.780> connects<00:04:14.769> black

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
there's the clothesline connects black

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.159 
there's the clothesline connects black
but<00:04:15.909> I<00:04:15.939> hit<00:04:16.120> their<00:04:16.239> own<00:04:16.329> buttons<00:04:16.720> stood<00:04:16.930> up

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
but I hit their own buttons stood up

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.930 
but I hit their own buttons stood up
it's<00:04:18.010> time<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.250> take<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.880> stand<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:21.519> yeah<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:21.820> had

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
it's time to take a stand so yeah I had

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.120 
it's time to take a stand so yeah I had
to<00:04:22.030> be<00:04:22.210> him<00:04:22.330> down<00:04:22.510> some<00:04:22.750> more<00:04:22.870> drop<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.740> elbows

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
to be him down some more drop the elbows

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.080 
to be him down some more drop the elbows
under<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.430> shoulders<00:04:25.530> but<00:04:26.530> yeah<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:27.090> I

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
actually am doing this commentary about

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.379 
actually am doing this commentary about

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
a day or two after I played this game

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.790 
a day or two after I played this game
was<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.419> death<00:04:34.810> so

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800

but working with my Roxy I seen or tried
to<00:04:39.740> try<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.520> get<00:04:40.849> the<00:04:40.970> universe<00:04:41.419> mode<00:04:41.889> able<00:04:42.889> to

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
to try to get the universe mode able to

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.640 
to try to get the universe mode able to
get<00:04:43.069> that<00:04:43.220> up<00:04:43.690> get<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.780> ready<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.319> record

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
get that up get it ready to record

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.430 
get that up get it ready to record
actually<00:04:46.520> get<00:04:46.639> some<00:04:46.759> gameplay<00:04:47.270> but<00:04:48.110> right<00:04:48.289> now

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.020 
actually get some gameplay but right now
I'm<00:04:48.560> just<00:04:48.620> trying<00:04:48.949> to<00:04:49.039> sort<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.460> show<00:04:49.849> you<00:04:49.879> the

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
I'm just trying to sort of show you the

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.689 
I'm just trying to sort of show you the
process<00:04:50.270> of<00:04:50.659> how<00:04:50.750> I<00:04:50.780> said<00:04:51.139> it<00:04:51.169> up<00:04:51.470> and<00:04:52.150> I'm<00:04:53.650> I

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
process of how I said it up and I'm I

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.879 
process of how I said it up and I'm I
just<00:04:55.699> sort<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.319> tried<00:04:57.319> to<00:04:57.349> figure<00:04:57.440> out<00:04:57.740> which

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
just sort of tried to figure out which

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.640 
just sort of tried to figure out which
setup<00:04:58.580> would<00:04:58.639> be<00:04:58.759> better<00:04:58.940> if<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.240> use<00:04:59.389> the

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
setup would be better if I use the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.499 
setup would be better if I use the
component<00:05:00.650> composite<00:05:01.099> cables<00:05:01.490> sort<00:05:02.449> of

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
component composite cables sort of

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.379 
component composite cables sort of
input/output<00:05:03.110> system<00:05:03.319> or<00:05:04.069> if<00:05:04.789> I<00:05:04.940> use<00:05:05.150> the

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
input/output system or if I use the

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.999 
input/output system or if I use the
component<00:05:05.900> cables<00:05:06.169> for<00:05:06.289> the<00:05:06.379> input<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:06.889> then

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
component cables for the input and then

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.459 
component cables for the input and then
I<00:05:07.039> used<00:05:07.250> a<00:05:07.490> semi<00:05:07.909> for<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.150> output<00:05:08.569> I<00:05:08.780> did

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
I used a semi for the output I did

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.140 
I used a semi for the output I did
change<00:05:09.650> that<00:05:09.979> around

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.840 

it<00:05:13.390> appeared<00:05:13.720> with<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.950> reporting<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.670> make

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
it appeared with the reporting to make

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.410 
it appeared with the reporting to make
it<00:05:15.970> all<00:05:16.090> glitchy<00:05:16.420> and<00:05:16.690> stuff<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.940> did<00:05:18.940> change<00:05:19.300> it

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
it all glitchy and stuff I did change it

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.240 
it all glitchy and stuff I did change it
to<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:19.630> HDMI<00:05:20.170> but<00:05:20.380> it<00:05:20.470> was<00:05:20.560> still<00:05:20.800> acting<00:05:21.160> up

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
to the HDMI but it was still acting up

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.070 
to the HDMI but it was still acting up
so<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.090> changed<00:05:22.630> them

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
so I changed them

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.840 
so I changed them
I<00:05:23.110> don't<00:05:23.650> know<00:05:23.770> why<00:05:23.980> I<00:05:24.010> was<00:05:24.220> just<00:05:24.430> gonna<00:05:24.610> test

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
I don't know why I was just gonna test

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.360 
I don't know why I was just gonna test
away<00:05:25.090> but<00:05:25.690> I<00:05:25.720> changed<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.230> bits<00:05:26.440> per<00:05:26.920> second

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
away but I changed the bits per second

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.540 
away but I changed the bits per second
capture<00:05:27.850> rate<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.900> was<00:05:29.110> still<00:05:29.290> in<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.470> HD<00:05:29.920> 720p

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
capture rate it was still in the HD 720p

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.890 
capture rate it was still in the HD 720p
but<00:05:31.540> I<00:05:31.570> changed<00:05:31.840> my<00:05:32.080> capture<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.740> down<00:05:33.070> for

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
but I changed my capture a down for

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.200 
but I changed my capture a down for
7,000<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:34.960> 1000<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:35.890> it<00:05:36.340> actually<00:05:36.550> was<00:05:36.940> able<00:05:37.060> to

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
7,000 a 1000 and it actually was able to

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.600 
7,000 a 1000 and it actually was able to
afford<00:05:37.510> for<00:05:37.780> 11

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
afford for 11

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.659 
afford for 11
here<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.300> problem<00:05:39.539> is<00:05:39.719> equality

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.479 

it's<00:05:44.669> not<00:05:44.849> very<00:05:44.879> good<00:05:45.269> five<00:05:45.539> it<00:05:45.949> in<00:05:46.949> my<00:05:47.129> opinion

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:47.489 
it's not very good five it in my opinion

00:05:47.489 --> 00:05:49.909 
it's not very good five it in my opinion
I<00:05:47.519> mean<00:05:47.699> it<00:05:48.330> looks<00:05:48.959> something<00:05:49.289> like<00:05:49.469> what<00:05:49.769> you

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
I mean it looks something like what you

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.189 
I mean it looks something like what you
would<00:05:50.009> see<00:05:50.069> at<00:05:50.550> like<00:05:50.819> a<00:05:50.909> dazzle<00:05:51.569> or<00:05:51.749> something

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
would see at like a dazzle or something

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.469 
would see at like a dazzle or something
they're<00:05:53.099> a<00:05:53.129> really<00:05:53.699> low<00:05:54.029> quality<00:05:54.269> Roxy<00:05:56.269> it<00:05:57.269> was

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
they're a really low quality Roxy it was

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.050 
they're a really low quality Roxy it was
a<00:05:57.509> pretty<00:05:58.229> bad<00:05:58.529> quality

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
a pretty bad quality

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.860 
a pretty bad quality
I<00:06:00.150> was<00:06:00.690> able<00:06:00.810> to<00:06:00.990> afford

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
I was able to afford

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.680 
I was able to afford
but<00:06:02.870> if<00:06:03.170> it's<00:06:03.350> not<00:06:03.500> gonna<00:06:03.620> be<00:06:03.710> fun

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
but if it's not gonna be fun

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.300 
but if it's not gonna be fun
but<00:06:06.690> I<00:06:06.720> want<00:06:06.900> to<00:06:06.990> be<00:06:07.050> able<00:06:07.139> to<00:06:07.289> get<00:06:07.500> HD<00:06:07.740> content

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
but I want to be able to get HD content

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.850 
but I want to be able to get HD content
up<00:06:08.729> I<00:06:09.030> don't<00:06:09.240> want<00:06:09.419> to<00:06:09.539> be<00:06:10.229> limited<00:06:10.620> to<00:06:10.680> this

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
up I don't want to be limited to this

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.469

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
480p out of Iraq Co HD which gets you

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.809 
480p out of Iraq Co HD which gets you
the<00:06:15.629> HD<00:06:16.050> gameplay<00:06:16.289> but<00:06:16.530> it<00:06:16.740> won't<00:06:16.860> let<00:06:17.069> me<00:06:17.220> so

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
the HD gameplay but it won't let me so

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.249 
the HD gameplay but it won't let me so
