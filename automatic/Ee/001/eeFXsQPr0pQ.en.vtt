out of a driveway or having reversed out
a<00:02:21.500> parking<00:02:21.799> spot<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:21.980> shift<00:02:22.370> into<00:02:22.610> first

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
a parking spot you shift into first

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.240 
a parking spot you shift into first
you'll<00:02:22.940> hear<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.090> nice<00:02:23.239> big<00:02:23.510> clunk<00:02:24.250> that's

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
you'll hear a nice big clunk that's

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.690 
you'll hear a nice big clunk that's
because<00:02:25.580> you're<00:02:25.970> missing<00:02:27.250> some<00:02:28.250> nuts<00:02:28.489> the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
because you're missing some nuts the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.070 
because you're missing some nuts the
mount<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> transmission<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.780> see<00:02:29.959> that

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
mount the transmission to the see that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.240 
mount the transmission to the see that
hole<00:02:30.260> right<00:02:30.410> there<00:02:30.470> supposed<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:30.950> be<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.069> bolt

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
hole right there supposed to be a bolt

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.050 
hole right there supposed to be a bolt
through<00:02:31.400> there<00:02:31.610> right<00:02:31.760> into<00:02:31.880> this

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
through there right into this

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.789 
through there right into this
transmission<00:02:32.690> mount<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.470> missing

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
transmission mount it's missing

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.250 
transmission mount it's missing
completely<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.370> there's<00:02:34.549> one<00:02:34.760> up<00:02:34.880> higher

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
completely and there's one up higher

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.479 
completely and there's one up higher
it's<00:02:36.260> missing<00:02:36.560> as<00:02:36.650> well<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:37.040> basically<00:02:37.130> this

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
it's missing as well so basically this

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.020 
it's missing as well so basically this
transmission<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.860> shifting<00:02:39.860> back<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.430> back

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
transmission is shifting back and back

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.430 
transmission is shifting back and back
and<00:02:41.060> forth<00:02:41.860> when<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:42.890> shift<00:02:43.989> from<00:02:44.989> forward<00:02:45.410> to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and forth when you shift from forward to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.789 
and forth when you shift from forward to
reverse<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:50.239> this<00:02:50.570> is<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.870> piece<00:02:51.079> over<00:02:51.410> here

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
reverse so this is the piece over here

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:52.930 
reverse so this is the piece over here
the<00:02:52.070> broken<00:02:52.370> piece<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.760> we're<00:02:52.880> getting

the broken piece that we're getting

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.319 
the broken piece that we're getting

phone<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.530> mean<00:03:24.890> there's<00:03:25.069> not<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.220> whole<00:03:25.340> lot<00:03:25.640> I

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
phone I mean there's not a whole lot I

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.550 
phone I mean there's not a whole lot I
mean<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:26.239> little<00:03:26.600> bit<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.810> surface<00:03:27.019> rust<00:03:27.319> here

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
mean a little bit of surface rust here

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.900 
mean a little bit of surface rust here
but<00:03:27.769> not<00:03:28.069> a<00:03:28.100> whole<00:03:28.310> lot<00:03:28.459> of<00:03:28.489> rust<00:03:28.700> in<00:03:28.790> this

but not a whole lot of rust in this

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.150 
but not a whole lot of rust in this
frame<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.590> definitely<00:03:30.590> worth<00:03:30.709> fixing

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.910 

I'm<00:03:35.150> not<00:03:35.300> sure<00:03:35.540> about<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.930> gas<00:03:36.140> smell<00:03:36.470> yet<00:03:36.710> I

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
I'm not sure about the gas smell yet I

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.650 
I'm not sure about the gas smell yet I
smell<00:03:37.520> it<00:03:37.640> when<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.850> car<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.060> running<00:03:38.270> I<00:03:38.510> can

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
smell it when the car is running I can

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.090 
smell it when the car is running I can
even<00:03:38.900> let<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.170> car<00:03:39.380> sit<00:03:39.650> here<00:03:39.830> in<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.010> garage

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
even let the car sit here in the garage

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.920 
even let the car sit here in the garage
and<00:03:40.970> idle<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.960> I<00:03:42.260> smell<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:43.570> smell<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:44.600> gas

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
and idle and I smell the smell of gas

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.900 
and idle and I smell the smell of gas
but<00:03:45.290> hopefully<00:03:46.100> it's<00:03:46.190> nothing<00:03:46.490> serious<00:03:46.670> it

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
but hopefully it's nothing serious it

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.610 
but hopefully it's nothing serious it
doesn't<00:03:47.180> doesn't<00:03:47.780> smell<00:03:48.110> it's<00:03:48.260> been<00:03:48.350> sitting

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
doesn't doesn't smell it's been sitting

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.050 
doesn't doesn't smell it's been sitting
in<00:03:48.710> here<00:03:48.860> for<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.100> day<00:03:49.250> now<00:03:49.460> it<00:03:49.580> hasn't<00:03:49.730> been<00:03:49.880> run

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
in here for a day now it hasn't been run

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.240 
in here for a day now it hasn't been run
I<00:03:50.090> can't<00:03:50.420> smell<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.720> gas<00:03:50.900> anymore<00:03:51.380> so<00:03:52.160> I<00:03:52.220> don't

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
I can't smell the gas anymore so I don't

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.400 
I can't smell the gas anymore so I don't
I<00:03:52.610> don't<00:03:53.000> think<00:03:53.210> it's<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.480> tank<00:03:53.750> leaking<00:03:54.290> I

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
I don't think it's the tank leaking I

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.220 
I don't think it's the tank leaking I
think<00:03:55.210> somewhere<00:03:56.210> in<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.450> line<00:03:56.660> it's<00:03:56.930> leaking

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
think somewhere in the line it's leaking

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.450 
think somewhere in the line it's leaking
a<00:03:57.320> little<00:03:57.410> bit<00:03:57.680> when<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:57.950> system<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.340> under

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
a little bit when the system is under

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.300 
a little bit when the system is under
pressure<00:03:58.790> so<00:03:59.240> I<00:03:59.620> will<00:04:00.620> investigate<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.280> a

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
pressure so I will investigate that a

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.720 
pressure so I will investigate that a
little<00:04:01.520> further<00:04:01.640> today<00:04:02.800> but<00:04:03.800> I<00:04:04.160> think<00:04:04.490> if<00:04:04.580> we

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
little further today but I think if we

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.000 
little further today but I think if we
can<00:04:04.880> obviously<00:04:05.630> get<00:04:06.020> this<00:04:06.170> broken<00:04:06.530> piece

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.380 

repaired<00:04:10.010> or<00:04:10.370> replaced<00:04:10.820> and<00:04:11.620> these<00:04:12.620> missing

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.360 
repaired or replaced and these missing
missing<00:04:14.390> bolts<00:04:14.570> in<00:04:14.750> your<00:04:14.870> transmission<00:04:15.370> it's

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
missing bolts in your transmission it's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.410 
missing bolts in your transmission it's
going<00:04:16.580> to<00:04:16.640> feel<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:16.910> lot<00:04:17.060> different<00:04:17.450> to<00:04:17.540> drive

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
going to feel a lot different to drive

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.520 
going to feel a lot different to drive
alright<00:04:20.420> just<00:04:20.570> want<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.840> let<00:04:20.930> give<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.440> an
