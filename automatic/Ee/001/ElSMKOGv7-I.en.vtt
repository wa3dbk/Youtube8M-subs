00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.079
 refuse officials shorten fairytale suits 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.249
 9 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:29.049
 there are therefore very happy to drive a new video again today 

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:32.329

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.420
 continue as possible 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.600
 without officially being miter once I have you with extra and I thought 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.960
 Know your Einstein glue is so fun to actually do the testing longer 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.390
 I'm going to be a bit quick of the race it seems like fun to see how 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.700
 but I can catch myself that we are doing this I am really looking forward to the session 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.130
 good luck how 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.460
 for the eu 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
 mcclaren mua 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.540
 off the water start these are transported by the way also profit 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.570
 is appreciated we look 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.910
 chester look poorer 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.020
 he replaces construction worker so much 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.500
 Mechelen's better world but it is just for a while 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.720
 to get started 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.830
 first course that will be let go 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.940
 I would have come to eat more than to play for something 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.300
 that's a bit unusual 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.050
 also the first two points were achieved, it is also further here too 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.550
 important 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.860
 that is according to count 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.969
 is full of sorry for the audience that it doesn't matter anymore 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.969
 through the polder and 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.030
 I want people 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.030
 I kept myself and we only did not get angry now 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.550
 what i would mean does not interest me i have to buy also in the life state 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.580
 stand still the holly 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.660
 this last jump 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.409
 slovakia became Christmas Day alone with this percentage 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.340
 so it's the first to be on the market too 6 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.930
 jett 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.250
 that we are already on his statements his victory also be there becomes 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.330
 You don't find staff logical for people to jump on it 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
 after she got the voice 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.129
 that didn't make fun 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.379
 it goes well 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.829
 in this these penalties 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.919
 go back looking back at no 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.139
 in one go 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.009
 I can get in 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.229
 I can get in 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.579
 that if you pick up 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.579
 because I won't be in the lava yet or I was leaving again 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.079
 Open 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.320
 not the prince 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.069
 with this letter not already entered there with me 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.519
 storm 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.519
 it is possible 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.149
 No 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.389
 stay calm 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.629
 stay calm 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.049
 the intention is this is what he wants 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.010
 this is what he wants if you like it if you say never to have it I enjoy 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.149
 these brands and so much fun 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:10.409
 what do you readers letter store once with there really is a ton in the mix 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.659
 working against a house 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.780
 good choice 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.409
 That 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.559
 on 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.559
 it really hard because i need me 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.609
 drink i'm advancing not just talking 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.509
 have warned over time that there are problems I think 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.399
 sandd is still unknown castle come there also the silence afterwards it turned out m 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:43.639
 also come on it's impossible it's impossible 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.899
 and then I get it twice, the man jumps from it is always like that 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:49.289
 predictability 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.010
 so predictable i'm not going anymore i can't 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.669
 also parole 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.479
 I am 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.329
 I can't do anything with angry mother they were looking for 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.020
 I jumped before I hit the lava 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.050
 I am a little 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.459
 flammable 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.349
 we already had media 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.359
 it's just not possible either 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.069
 I just can't do it and it is hard for me to stay in the mood and stay in the demo 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.069
 tries to slash it in at that point 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.900
 once why does it work now 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.220
 it's just now it is striking now the crowds you know so the pressure off 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.009
 tan 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.419
 then pick it up once 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.999
 yes okay 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.999
 we have determined that then we can return to the mood 0 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.400
 where to go home 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.740
 arriva 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.830
 just a little bit of stomachache had manchester in need 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.669
 until they put on the kids here too, they clearly tell something 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:44.520
 different 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.529
 level 3 performance let's do that hit this bullshit again 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:52.719
 so I can't stand that 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.889
 which the eu lands leads to fixed 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.889
 the bell I am just so wonderful mother of course 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.009
 9 I thought so 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.659
 and what if that 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:03.669
 No 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.050
 there are two sides to it 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.440
 la la la la 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.110
 as per 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.210
 then they had it too 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.169
 maybe they just have to be at a turning point 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.189
 I jump too late 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:18.449
 I never jumped again 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:19.450
 a 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.120
 kpn also notes 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.189
 easy center of all 9 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.189
 attractive by another store 7 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:34.569
 meal we are not there yet we are not there yet but also already on 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.639
 the prognosis comes close 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.419
 with it 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.419
 Crown 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.669
 technically I have already been in principle I am already finished but no I do 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.720

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:08.409
 Kerry tried the twitter again with I have already been so 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.990

 I just want to continue but I already have gore's the tribe 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.770
 the Hague

 I have never made such strange noises as one of them 

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:24.300
 yes 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.900

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:31.469
 you want to make 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:32.990
 also a start to work 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.800
 after this i make myself stay that easy percent in demo 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.960
 and that is also not the intention natural they like but from now on 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.330
 just a demo to banish this demo duel 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.860
 nine may also be 0 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.630
 and then do without demo of the game it is not constitutional back again 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:51.380
 and that goddamn player 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.740
 mistakes with which it is difficult to build 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.259
 I still don't come up with this 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.709
