there called ukitake and we did include

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.230 
there called ukitake and we did include
anywhere<00:01:47.970> near<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.509> comet<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:50.130> hope<00:01:50.429> to<00:01:50.789> our

anywhere near that comet but hope to our
great<00:01:51.479> surprise<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.049> had<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> passing<00:01:52.619> through

the tail the comet but nobody

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
anticipated how long they could be they

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.149 
anticipated how long they could be they
stretched<00:01:58.799> from<00:01:59.460> out<00:02:00.740> further<00:02:01.740> than<00:02:01.920> the
