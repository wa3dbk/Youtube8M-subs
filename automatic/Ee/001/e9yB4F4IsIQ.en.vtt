 in the courtyards can no 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.830
 hubsteiger be used therefore 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.010
 Today, state-of-the-art technology is used 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.010
 commitment

 the beneficial spezialisten.de michael 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.040
 Eisner climbers can also do theirs 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.800
 Office out for documentation or 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.120

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.450
 but today michael eisner becomes the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.450
 Façades directly at the reception station 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.450
 survey 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.930
 Raffel checks whether the camera image 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 error-free transfer to the computer 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.830
 becomes 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.790
 an unfamiliar comfort for the 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.530
 I do not need a reviewer in his 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.470
 Being close I can do that from here 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.659
 from the desk to watch and have 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.810
 then the possibilities for the camera 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.270
 to follow all this 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.700
 then the climbers went to the roof 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.159
 the descent the routine work what in 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.159
 anchor points looking for ropes fasten 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.630
 in this bag is the 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.030
 complete communication and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.909
 transmitting technology organ field checks the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.909
 connection to the reviewer all right 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.289
 there is now the transmission technology in there 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.590
 the transmitter the camera so the 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.619
 video camera bare the camera then 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.409
 I have funkgerät again handy 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:08.259
 to communicate and to measure something else 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.080
 before the descent the fine adjustment 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.720
 helmet camera as eye of the expert 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.610
 look optimally furnished 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.540
 all preparations are completed 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.939
 the reviewer 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.420
 linking industrial climber to his 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:24.400
 prepared plans over the facades 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.590
 the first descent on this day as 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.659
 industrial climber has holger apple the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.569
 experience and the routine for everyone 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.560
 upcoming craft and 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.840
 documentation works the 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.530
 Voice over is umts 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.500
 manufactured 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.030
 then the check starts as would 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.189
 he himself is hanging there sees the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.260
 expert every smallest pore in 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.319
 the facade gives its concrete 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.709
 remove instructions for touching and 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.709
 measure up 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.209
 here is a sensitive question that can 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.989
 do not afford a drone 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:11.909
 they can keep such a plan 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.909
 solve is removable 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.410
 Yes 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.969
 again take pictures now meter 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.400
 for meters, the courtyard facade per 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.890
 video live broadcast from the reviewer 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.079
 inspected fragments are removed 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.450
 and created photos for the review 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.280
 Michael Eisner knows that he has this 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:57.129
 Inspection actually from home 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:59.919
 could perform concretely on this 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.319
 nobody has to sit at the receiving station 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:05.079
 Video images are available everywhere 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.629
 repairs can be guided live 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.389
 and be accepted immediately binding 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.219
 Facades aimlessly bridges towers or 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.409
 Shafts are quick and easy 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.449
 environmentally friendly judge these 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.030
 technology turns the climbers off the rope 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:22.680
 stuck him to the eyes and the poor and 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.680
