00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.400
 hello everyone welcome to letter crisis 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.950
 today we are going to make a tutorial very easy 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.780
 how to make some homemade darts 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.710
 simple that I have seen them as a dart 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.480
 it kills zombies but hey 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.450
 simply darts and you that your 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.270
 They waited for you to want some of them 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.910
 weird because I've never done it for 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.700
 moment a gun is to say that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.220
 specifically be for darts and less 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.169
 of this kind but good one day what 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.329
 I will do and even if I do not make it sure 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.690
 one has one that serves him well 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.310
 be that is perfect for you 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350
 then I'm going to do the meego that we're going to 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.730
 need is going to be a stick of these 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.200
 with lack of plastic although this one 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.200
 it's a little bent 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.970
 and a round stick 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.100
 what we are going to have to do 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.880
 is going to be warm up the head about 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.880
 seconds and quickly stick the stick 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.080
 quickly 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.080
 Oh 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.500
 Now we just have to keep some 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.030
 seconds squeezing normal that is 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.890
 folded the pin but hey if the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.159
 rent a straight picked coat that 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.439
 I would be much better 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.470
 and the best thing about these data is that 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.720
 You can do so many 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.920
 but nothing in a few minutes you'll have 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.740
 very many for your pistols and good 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.950
 also on this side they go through 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.979
 and for this and then imagine any 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.979
 thing against which you do it is a 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.979
 pin will go through 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.150
 what you want a pin is going to 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.240
 go through 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.250
 whatever it is 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.840
 so these arches sure some 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.069
 they come in handy because they are also 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.579
 easy peasy 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.579
 so 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.880
 I stay here doing some more with 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.880
 some history 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.230
 in the country
