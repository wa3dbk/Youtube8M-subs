we<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.009> always<00:01:23.360> had<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> policy<00:01:24.690> of<00:01:24.990> reducing

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
we have always had a policy of reducing

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.620 
we have always had a policy of reducing
sail<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:25.950> dark<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> Sun<00:01:27.000> Goes<00:01:27.149> Down<00:01:27.360> we

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.149 
sail at dark when the Sun Goes Down we
reduce<00:01:28.350> sail<00:01:30.049> under<00:01:31.049> these<00:01:31.259> conditions<00:01:31.890> what

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
reduce sail under these conditions what

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.109 
reduce sail under these conditions what
we're<00:01:32.340> doing<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.979> dropping<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.939> main

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
we're doing is just dropping the main

we're doing is just dropping the main
and<00:01:36.570> putting<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.110> our<00:01:37.259> number-3<00:01:37.590> jib<00:01:39.020> that

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and putting up our number-3 jib that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.890 
and putting up our number-3 jib that
allows<00:01:40.350> us<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.180> ready<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.659> winds

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
allows us to you know be ready for winds

up to 30 knots if they should happen to
arrive<00:01:51.320> also<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.560> number<00:01:52.829> 3<00:01:53.040> jib<00:01:53.310> sails<00:01:55.369> very

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
arrive also the number 3 jib sails very

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.580 
arrive also the number 3 jib sails very
nicely<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.780> rubber<00:01:57.960> band<00:01:58.170> steering

but<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.040> died<00:02:30.250> off<00:02:30.459> now<00:02:30.670> we're<00:02:31.060> getting<00:02:31.890> ten

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
but it's died off now we're getting ten

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.500 
but it's died off now we're getting ten
right<00:02:34.930> now<00:02:34.959> less<00:02:35.859> now<00:02:36.569> eight<00:02:37.569> knots<00:02:37.900> or<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.430> and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
right now less now eight knots or so and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.399 
right now less now eight knots or so and
our<00:02:40.510> progress<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.200> slow<00:02:41.469> -<00:02:41.890> yes<00:02:42.959> GPS<00:02:43.959> on<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:44.319> it

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
our progress is slow - yes GPS on but it

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.679 
our progress is slow - yes GPS on but it
looks<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:45.370> me<00:02:45.489> like<00:02:45.519> three<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.239> half<00:02:46.359> to

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
looks to me like three and a half to

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:53.849 
looks to me like three and a half to
four<00:02:46.900> knots<00:02:47.200> three<00:02:48.129> and<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> half<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:53.319> less<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
four knots three and a half the less the

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.520 
four knots three and a half the less the
wind<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.909> more<00:02:55.120> velocity<00:02:55.450> wind<00:02:55.989> order<00:02:56.439> it

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
wind is the more velocity wind order it

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.240 
wind is the more velocity wind order it
is<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.829> be<00:02:56.980> damn<00:02:57.189> fours<00:02:58.500> if<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.620> get<00:02:59.859> it<00:02:59.950> on

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
is to be damn fours if I get it on

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.539 
is to be damn fours if I get it on
course<00:03:00.730> it'll<00:03:01.030> stay<00:03:01.329> there<00:03:01.599> for<00:03:05.129> so<00:03:06.129> anyway<00:03:06.430> at

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
course it'll stay there for so anyway at

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.869 
course it'll stay there for so anyway at
night<00:03:07.290> once<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.409> Sun<00:03:08.620> Goes<00:03:08.769> Down<00:03:08.829> we<00:03:09.099> reduced

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
night once the Sun Goes Down we reduced

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.610 
night once the Sun Goes Down we reduced
sail<00:03:10.180> we<00:03:10.480> usually<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:10.810> retired<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.530> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
sail we usually just retired to the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.800 
sail we usually just retired to the
cabin<00:03:12.040> one<00:03:12.879> of<00:03:12.970> us<00:03:13.060> goes<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.359> sleep<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.599> other

better<00:04:42.800> we've<00:04:43.520> been<00:04:43.640> doing<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:43.910> for<00:04:43.970> a

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
better we've been doing that for a

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.510 
better we've been doing that for a
couple<00:04:44.180> of<00:04:44.360> days<00:04:44.510> now<00:04:44.750> it's<00:04:44.990> getting<00:04:45.200> better

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
couple of days now it's getting better

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
if we were to get worse we have some

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.360 
if we were to get worse we have some
antibiotics<00:04:48.440> I<00:04:48.560> could<00:04:48.710> start<00:04:48.920> taking<00:04:49.250> some

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
antibiotics I could start taking some

antibiotics I could start taking some
broad-spectrum<00:04:49.870> antibiotics<00:04:53.200> because<00:04:54.200> we're

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
broad-spectrum antibiotics because we're

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.590 
broad-spectrum antibiotics because we're
two<00:04:55.190> weeks<00:04:55.370> in<00:04:55.640> either<00:04:55.790> direction<00:04:56.150> from<00:04:56.450> the
