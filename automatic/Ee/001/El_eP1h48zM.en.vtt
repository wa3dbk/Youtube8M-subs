pretty fascinating to see how

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.330 
pretty fascinating to see how

appropriate time or is it too late or
too<00:01:49.899> early<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:51.100> I<00:01:51.130> told<00:01:51.429> him<00:01:51.579> okay<00:01:52.060> try<00:01:52.240> to

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
too early so I told him okay try to

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.809 
too early so I told him okay try to
avoid<00:01:52.740> after<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:53.829> hear<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.130> warning<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.729> he

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
avoid after you hear the warning and he

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.880 
avoid after you hear the warning and he
did<00:01:55.179> excellent<00:01:55.960> steering<00:01:56.140> maneuver<00:01:56.380> very
