00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello everyone today as I promised we 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.610
 talk about how to learn to play 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.889
 stunning battle 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.250
 for this we take the easiest view 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.940
 combat which is also the most 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:29.250
 common first we repeat 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:30.929
 option without killing and now I immediately 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.700
 I show you how to play his agreement and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.700
 then we will look at how i do 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:46.640
 and so does our right hand 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:50.719
 which performs the main work in this 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.089
 At the beginning, we simply remove 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.659
 strings as we do it in the usual 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.659
 option fight 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.760
 then 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:05.470
 in the second we hit the strings and 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:10.260
 right there we are deafening and then when we go 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.260
 up we just beat built up 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.960
 there is obtained the first part of this fight 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.960
 looks like this 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.510
 meeting with the fight looks like 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.510
 again, we repeat the blow up 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.820
 and then the next road down we also 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:36.500
 pear and then follows upward again 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.500
 which we did not eat 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:45.880
 looks like this is the second part of the fight so 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.880
 way 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.540
 if we combine it all together will 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.540
 it is like this 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:05.280
 that is, we jam the strings twice 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.280
 second strike and last but one strike 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.040
 blows that we suppress I marked 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.040
 in the following way 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.989
 and this will look like the whole scheme 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.410
 Good luck to everyone in mastering this technique and to 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.410
 next time
