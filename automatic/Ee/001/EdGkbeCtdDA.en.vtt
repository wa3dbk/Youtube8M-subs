00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.160 

first<00:00:11.730> let's<00:00:12.059> see<00:00:12.269> how<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.509> game<00:00:12.719> runs<00:00:12.990> on

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
first let's see how the game runs on

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.029 
first let's see how the game runs on
1280<00:00:13.679> by<00:00:13.889> 800<00:00:14.070> resolution<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:16.080> low<00:00:16.379> detail

level everything set to low and off yes
we<00:00:23.580> get<00:00:23.670> around<00:00:23.910> 45<00:00:24.600> frames<00:00:24.779> per<00:00:25.050> sec<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.590> for

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
we get around 45 frames per sec for for

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.950 
we get around 45 frames per sec for for
a<00:00:26.189> moment<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.060> as<00:00:27.240> soon<00:00:27.480> as<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.750> little

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
a moment but as soon as this little

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.500 
a moment but as soon as this little
annoying<00:00:28.619> extra<00:00:29.250> viewport<00:00:29.849> appears<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
annoying extra viewport appears in the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.990 
annoying extra viewport appears in the
upper<00:00:30.630> left<00:00:31.019> corner<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.949> framerate<00:00:32.250> drops<00:00:32.820> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
upper left corner the framerate drops a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.319 
upper left corner the framerate drops a
lot<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.899> get<00:00:34.050> around<00:00:34.520> 30<00:00:35.520> frames<00:00:35.850> per<00:00:36.059> sec

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
lot we get around 30 frames per sec

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.530 
lot we get around 30 frames per sec
pretty<00:00:36.989> stable<00:00:37.610> which<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.760> still<00:00:38.940> okay<00:00:39.270> but

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
pretty stable which is still okay but

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600 
pretty stable which is still okay but
don't<00:00:39.690> forget<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.920> low<00:00:41.070> settings

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
don't forget that we are on low settings

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.959 
don't forget that we are on low settings
so<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.780> wish<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.200> extra<00:00:43.950> viewport<00:00:44.489> which

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
so I wish this extra viewport which

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.299 
so I wish this extra viewport which
shows<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.450> stupid<00:00:45.960> ship<00:00:46.289> could<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:46.980> turned

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
shows this stupid ship could be turned

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.580 
shows this stupid ship could be turned
off<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.690> has<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> huge<00:00:49.200> performance

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
off because it has a huge performance

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.150 
off because it has a huge performance
impact<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:51.110> unfortunately<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.140> didn't<00:00:52.800> find<00:00:52.860> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
impact but unfortunately I didn't find a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
impact but unfortunately I didn't find a
way<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:57.079> if<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.140> move<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.430> test

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
way to do that if we move on and test

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.319 
way to do that if we move on and test
the<00:01:00.329> game<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.780> medium<00:01:01.710> settings<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the game on medium settings and with the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.039 
the game on medium settings and with the
same<00:01:03.510> resolution<00:01:04.159> then<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:06.000> around<00:01:07.610> 15<00:01:08.610> or

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
same resolution then we get around 15 or

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.920 
same resolution then we get around 15 or
20<00:01:10.049> frames<00:01:10.290> per<00:01:10.500> sec<00:01:10.770> which<00:01:11.360> is<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> bit<00:01:12.570> slow

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
20 frames per sec which is a bit slow

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.230 
20 frames per sec which is a bit slow
but<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.619> okay<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.280> kind<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.610> game<00:01:14.850> so

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
but it's okay for this kind of game so

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.570 
but it's okay for this kind of game so
it's<00:01:15.630> still<00:01:15.869> enjoyable<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.189> game<00:01:17.369> looks

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it's still enjoyable and the game looks

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.649 
it's still enjoyable and the game looks
much<00:01:17.790> better<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.960> medium<00:01:19.380> settings<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:21.420> just

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
much better on medium settings but just

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.499 
much better on medium settings but just
wait<00:01:21.869> until<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.790> little<00:01:23.790> extra<00:01:24.090> viewport

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
wait until this little extra viewport

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.350 
wait until this little extra viewport
appears<00:01:24.810> again<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.759> frame<00:01:27.000> rate<00:01:27.030> will

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
appears again and the frame rate will

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.840 
appears again and the frame rate will
drop<00:01:27.509> around<00:01:27.900> 12<00:01:28.650> frames<00:01:29.130> per<00:01:29.400> sec<00:01:29.640> or

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
drop around 12 frames per sec or

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.300 
drop around 12 frames per sec or
something<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.270> that

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
something like that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.670 
something like that
yep<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:34.079> got<00:01:34.259> 14<00:01:35.030> 15<00:01:37.100> 12<00:01:38.630> so

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
yep there is it and we got 14 15 12 so

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:54.660 
yep there is it and we got 14 15 12 so
yeah<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.950> bit<00:01:41.100> slow

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.910 

now<00:01:55.240> let's<00:01:55.570> see<00:01:55.750> how<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:55.960> game<00:01:56.200> runs<00:01:56.470> on<00:01:56.680> high

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
now let's see how the game runs on high

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.969 
now let's see how the game runs on high
settings<00:01:59.850> don't<00:02:00.850> expect<00:02:01.270> miracles<00:02:01.830> we<00:02:02.830> get

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
settings don't expect miracles we get

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.859 
settings don't expect miracles we get
the<00:02:03.159> same<00:02:03.479> 14<00:02:04.479> 12<00:02:05.140> frames<00:02:05.619> per<00:02:05.890> sec<00:02:06.869> sometimes

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
the same 14 12 frames per sec sometimes

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.060 
the same 14 12 frames per sec sometimes
as<00:02:08.140> low<00:02:08.319> as<00:02:08.530> 10<00:02:09.220> or<00:02:09.490> 11<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.440> it's<00:02:11.770> it's<00:02:11.980> pretty

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
as low as 10 or 11 so it's it's pretty

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:22.600 
as low as 10 or 11 so it's it's pretty
unplayable<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:13.030> would<00:02:13.270> say

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.850 

and<00:02:22.930> finally<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.080> we<00:02:24.230> crank<00:02:24.500> up<00:02:24.710> the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
and finally if we crank up the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.100 
and finally if we crank up the
resolution<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> retinal<00:02:26.180> resolution

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
resolution to the retinal resolution

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.670 
resolution to the retinal resolution
then<00:02:28.030> suddenly<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.210> text<00:02:29.540> becomes<00:02:30.020> smaller

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
then suddenly the text becomes smaller

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.760 
then suddenly the text becomes smaller
all<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:31.790> menu<00:02:32.210> items<00:02:32.240> everything<00:02:32.960> gets<00:02:33.320> gets

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
all the menu items everything gets gets

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.180 
all the menu items everything gets gets
much<00:02:33.950> smaller<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:36.410> get<00:02:36.590> around<00:02:36.860> five

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
much smaller and we get around five

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.980 
much smaller and we get around five
frames<00:02:37.520> per<00:02:37.760> sec<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:39.560> just<00:02:40.600> too<00:02:41.600> slow

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
frames per sec so this is just too slow

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.150 
frames per sec so this is just too slow
way<00:02:42.260> too<00:02:42.320> slow

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160
