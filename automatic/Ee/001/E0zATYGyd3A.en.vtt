accomplish faster tempos we got to have
a<00:02:01.940> smooth<00:02:02.650> motion<00:02:09.729> triple<00:02:10.729> paradiddle<00:02:14.379> so

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
a smooth motion triple paradiddle so

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.349 
a smooth motion triple paradiddle so
just<00:02:15.620> like<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.980> double<00:02:16.430> paradiddle<00:02:16.700> or<00:02:17.060> the

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
just like the double paradiddle or the

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.479 
just like the double paradiddle or the
single<00:02:17.689> paradiddle<00:02:17.989> it's<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.709> same<00:02:18.980> motion

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
single paradiddle it's the same motion

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.619 
single paradiddle it's the same motion
at<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.090> slow<00:02:20.359> two

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
at the slow two

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.380 
at the slow two
as<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.650> at<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.890> fast<00:02:22.159> tempos<00:02:22.640> I'm<00:02:23.180> gonna

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
as it is at the fast tempos I'm gonna

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.349 
as it is at the fast tempos I'm gonna
play<00:02:23.629> this<00:02:23.870> just<00:02:24.109> slow<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:25.219> fast<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:25.939> you're

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
play this just slow to fast and you're

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.479 
play this just slow to fast and you're
going<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.540> see<00:02:26.749> the<00:02:26.989> nice<00:02:27.200> fluid<00:02:27.829> motion<00:02:28.129> of

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
going to see the nice fluid motion of

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.580 
going to see the nice fluid motion of
the<00:02:28.639> upstroke<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.359> then<00:02:29.749> the<00:02:29.870> control<00:02:30.260> stroke

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
the upstroke and then the control stroke

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.369 
the upstroke and then the control stroke
and<00:02:30.829> then<00:02:31.159> all<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.430> my<00:02:31.730> tats<00:02:32.120> are<00:02:32.510> going<00:02:33.109> to<00:02:33.260> be

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:11.479 
triple paradiddle but remember where it

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.240
