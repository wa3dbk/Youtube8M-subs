this<00:01:04.619> particular<00:01:04.829> bear<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.460> radio<00:01:05.850> collared

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
this particular bear was radio collared

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.980 
this particular bear was radio collared
Isis<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.840> September<00:01:07.259> 11<00:01:07.590> 2001<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.609> so<00:01:09.600> she<00:01:09.689> has

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
Isis on September 11 2001 and so she has

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.289 
Isis on September 11 2001 and so she has
been<00:01:10.229> wearing<00:01:10.469> a<00:01:10.619> radio<00:01:10.889> collar<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.850> almost

been wearing a radio collar for almost

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.830 
been wearing a radio collar for almost
14<00:01:12.899> years<00:01:12.929> and<00:01:13.819> we<00:01:14.819> have<00:01:14.939> been<00:01:15.149> to<00:01:15.270> her<00:01:15.420> den<00:01:15.630> now

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
14 years and we have been to her den now

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
14 years and we have been to her den now
14<00:01:16.289> consecutive<00:01:16.469> winners<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.639> same

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
14 consecutive winners to do the same

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.239 
14 consecutive winners to do the same
type<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.149> monitoring<00:01:18.889> so<00:01:19.889> this<00:01:20.039> particular

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
type of monitoring so this particular

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:23.550 
type of monitoring so this particular
bear<00:01:20.609> we<00:01:21.569> saw<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.959> year<00:01:22.170> ago<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.679> a<00:01:22.770> Dan

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
bear we saw a year ago in a Dan

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.430 
bear we saw a year ago in a Dan
in<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.040> similar<00:01:24.430> areas<00:01:25.030> here<00:01:25.450> she<00:01:26.080> had<00:01:26.170> three

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
in the similar areas here she had three

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.110 
in the similar areas here she had three
cubs<00:01:26.680> last<00:01:26.950> year<00:01:27.160> we<00:01:27.280> ear<00:01:27.430> tagged<00:01:27.670> all<00:01:27.880> three

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
cubs last year we ear tagged all three

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.120 
cubs last year we ear tagged all three
cubs<00:01:28.360> but<00:01:29.050> she's<00:01:29.200> 18<00:01:29.560> years<00:01:29.590> old<00:01:29.860> at<00:01:30.040> the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
cubs but she's 18 years old at the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.150 
cubs but she's 18 years old at the
moment<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:31.420> she's<00:01:32.080> one<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.410> our<00:01:32.620> longest

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
moment so she's one of our longest

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.520 
moment so she's one of our longest
running<00:01:33.400> bears<00:01:33.910> we've<00:01:34.270> had<00:01:34.480> on<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.870> air<00:01:35.020> so

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
running bears we've had on the air so

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.200 
running bears we've had on the air so
he's<00:01:35.740> kind<00:01:35.920> of<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:36.040> unique<00:01:36.280> bear<00:01:36.520> in<00:01:37.030> that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
he's kind of a unique bear in that

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
he's kind of a unique bear in that
regard

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
regard

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.100 
regard
but<00:01:39.070> in<00:01:39.160> this<00:01:39.250> particular<00:01:39.400> case<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.690> den<00:01:40.870> was

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
but in this particular case the den was

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.620 
but in this particular case the den was
open<00:01:41.920> enough<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:42.160> we<00:01:42.430> could<00:01:42.670> actually<00:01:42.970> count

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
open enough that we could actually count

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.880 
open enough that we could actually count
the<00:01:43.780> number<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.050> yearlings<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.620> were<00:01:44.710> there

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
the number of yearlings that were there

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.130 
the number of yearlings that were there
verify<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.850> none<00:01:46.000> were<00:01:46.150> missing<00:01:46.540> we<00:01:46.990> could

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
verify that none were missing we could

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.260 
verify that none were missing we could
see<00:01:47.290> that<00:01:47.410> they<00:01:47.560> all<00:01:47.710> had<00:01:47.890> ear<00:01:48.010> tags<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:49.150> there

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
see that they all had ear tags so there

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.880 
see that they all had ear tags so there
was<00:01:49.360> no<00:01:49.480> reason<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:49.900> really<00:01:50.170> handle<00:01:50.710> those

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
was no reason to really handle those

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.680 
was no reason to really handle those
