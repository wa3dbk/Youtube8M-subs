00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
technology now with LED is just amazing

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.369 
technology now with LED is just amazing
and<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:50.060> doesn't<00:03:50.360> draw<00:03:50.540> on<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.750> lot<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:50.959> battery

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
and it doesn't draw on a lot of battery

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.710 
and it doesn't draw on a lot of battery
and<00:03:52.040> you've<00:03:52.159> got<00:03:52.340> two<00:03:53.000> big<00:03:53.209> batteries<00:03:53.569> how

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
and you've got two big batteries how

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.509 
and you've got two big batteries how
much<00:03:54.049> power<00:03:54.409> have<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.590> got<00:03:54.739> there<00:03:54.920> there's

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
much power have you got there there's

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.210 
much power have you got there there's
160<00:03:55.970> MPs<00:03:56.629> in<00:03:56.900> there<00:03:57.079> they're<00:03:57.560> two<00:03:57.769> AGM

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
160 MPs in there they're two AGM

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.890 
160 MPs in there they're two AGM
batteries<00:03:58.640> that's<00:03:59.090> plenty<00:03:59.299> for<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.540> fridge<00:03:59.720> for

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
batteries that's plenty for a fridge for

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
there no you said to me before that this

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.670 
there no you said to me before that this
tent<00:04:16.729> basically<00:04:17.630> it's<00:04:18.079> a<00:04:18.169> little<00:04:18.380> shorter

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
tent basically it's a little shorter

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.039 
tent basically it's a little shorter
this<00:04:19.489> way<00:04:19.699> but<00:04:20.180> you<00:04:20.329> guys<00:04:20.449> have<00:04:20.600> another<00:04:20.780> room

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
this way but you guys have another room

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.560 
this way but you guys have another room
that<00:04:21.380> goes<00:04:21.530> on<00:04:21.709> here<00:04:21.739> as<00:04:22.010> well<00:04:22.120> yeah<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.449> whole

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
that goes on here as well yeah the whole

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.330 
that goes on here as well yeah the whole
thing<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:24.050> guess<00:04:24.410> freestanding<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:25.070> little

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
thing I guess freestanding a little

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.219 
thing I guess freestanding a little
simpler<00:04:25.639> to<00:04:25.699> put<00:04:25.760> up<00:04:26.000> exactly<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.050> that's

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
simpler to put up exactly and that's

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.219 
simpler to put up exactly and that's
what<00:04:27.380> we've<00:04:27.830> sort<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.100> identified<00:04:28.669> that<00:04:29.229> to

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
what we've sort of identified that to

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.689 
what we've sort of identified that to
stick<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.740> nine-foot<00:04:31.130> tent<00:04:31.400> which<00:04:31.550> is

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
stick to the nine-foot tent which is

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.969 
stick to the nine-foot tent which is
really<00:04:32.090> simple<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:32.510> set<00:04:32.720> up<00:04:32.750> for<00:04:33.650> an<00:04:33.710> overnight

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
really simple to set up for an overnight

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.180 
really simple to set up for an overnight
stop<00:04:34.460> you're<00:04:35.270> still<00:04:35.479> lacking<00:04:35.720> in<00:04:36.470> that<00:04:36.500> family

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
stop you're still lacking in that family

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.650 
stop you're still lacking in that family
tent<00:04:37.430> size<00:04:37.669> so<00:04:37.970> what<00:04:38.090> we've<00:04:38.240> done<00:04:38.360> is<00:04:38.419> we've

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
tent size so what we've done is we've

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.180 
tent size so what we've done is we've
gone<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:39.020> another<00:04:39.229> room<00:04:39.410> that<00:04:39.470> just<00:04:39.770> attaches

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
gone to another room that just attaches

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.219 
gone to another room that just attaches
off<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.490> side<00:04:40.699> that's<00:04:41.419> pretty<00:04:41.660> cool<00:04:41.840> cuz<00:04:42.110> it

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
off the side that's pretty cool cuz it

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.050 
off the side that's pretty cool cuz it
makes<00:04:42.380> it<00:04:42.740> really<00:04:42.830> adaptable<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.789> thing<00:04:43.940> is

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
makes it really adaptable the thing is

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.460 
makes it really adaptable the thing is

always have to open up all 16 feet when

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.600 
always have to open up all 16 feet when
you<00:04:47.389> absolutely<00:04:47.930> absolutely<00:04:48.860> no<00:04:49.190> that's<00:04:49.370> cool

you absolutely absolutely no that's cool
and<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.360> guys<00:04:50.510> use<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:51.080> wax<00:04:51.410> convertors

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
and you guys use the wax convertors

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.010 
and you guys use the wax convertors
canvas<00:04:52.250> as<00:04:52.400> well<00:04:52.430> absolutely<00:04:52.940> we<00:04:53.630> use<00:04:53.780> nothing

canvas as well absolutely we use nothing

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.629 
canvas as well absolutely we use nothing
but<00:04:54.199> the<00:04:54.440> wax<00:04:54.620> convertors<00:04:55.070> canvas<00:04:55.400> in<00:04:55.550> our

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
but the wax convertors canvas in our

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.980 
but the wax convertors canvas in our
opinion<00:04:56.030> it's<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.210> best<00:04:56.270> cameras<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.870> can
