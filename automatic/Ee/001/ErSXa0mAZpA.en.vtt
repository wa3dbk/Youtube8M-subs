00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.380
 kalidou it is the reference of the heating 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.809
 electric 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.840
 these two ultra-efficient radiators 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.570
 united in a single ally to a true 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.030
 intelligence is first the facade 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.400
 radiant and its surface resistance 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.260
 a set that radiates from the first 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.760
 needs and diffuses to radiation 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.760
 regular and homogeneous 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.090
 it's then the quiet power of 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.820
 cast iron heater that 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.370
 combines inertia conduction and radiation 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.760
 natural to create a real cocoon of 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.450
 softness 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.550
 dynamic inertia is finally the leader 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.700
 conductor of the whole regulation 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.470
 which are subtly dosing the two 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.800
 elements independently is 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.540
 complementary is the guarantee of a 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.640
 true integral sweet heat 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.320
 perfectly adapted to the needs of the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.739
 human body throughout the season 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.739
 heating 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.090
 in 2000 season it is the facade that 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.550
 ensures a constant hot spot and a 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.560
 second soft radiation and when it's 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.920
 needed by the power of wildlife 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.920
 active 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.690
 as soon as the cold arrives it's the fauna 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.230
 what envelops us in its heat 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.090
 creamy and associated with the facade done 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.880
 kalidou the hot spot around which 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.200
 we like to meet 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.330
 the aesthetics of the kalidou which combines 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.840
 modernity and tradition is the fruit of 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840
 its technology 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.900
 available in two colors, white and beige 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.000
 kelly doua available in three models 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.690
 horizontal and vertical ba and 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.690
 many powers 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.140
 to answer 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.140
 planning 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.290
 its regulation ultra no 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.020
 6 to temperature display 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.420
 desired is very simple to use it 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.160
 just adjust the temperature and the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.080
 regulation deals with the whole 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.540
 regulation offers very 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.030
 practices like for example the 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.180
 child lock or detection 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.160
 automatic open windows that 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.820
 detects a sharp drop in 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.010
 temperature 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.870
 when a window remains 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.010
 accidentally open 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.650
 the radiator cuts itself then 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.810
 automatically which avoids any 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.760
 overconsumption and guarantee of 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.530
 real energy savings for 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.530
 even more kalidou savings 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.400
 carrier current or radiofrequency
