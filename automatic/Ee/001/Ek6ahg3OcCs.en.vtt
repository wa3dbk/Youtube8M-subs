00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.880 
out and so basically what you can do is
you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.050> put<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.860> either<00:01:11.570> portrait<00:01:12.570> mode

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
like this and you can also see when you

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.499 
like this and you can also see when you
put<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> back<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:17.910> also<00:01:18.180> change

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
put it on the back you can also change

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.260 
put it on the back you can also change
the<00:01:18.660> angle<00:01:19.410> of<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.009> are<00:01:20.190> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.460> keep

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the angle of what you are going to keep

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.570 
the angle of what you are going to keep
it<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.810> example<00:01:21.869> if<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> want<00:01:22.440> to<00:01:22.680> let<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it so for example if you want to let it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300 
it so for example if you want to let it
go<00:01:23.670> much<00:01:23.850> further<00:01:24.180> down<00:01:24.649> you<00:01:25.649> can<00:01:25.890> lay<00:01:26.160> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
go much further down you can lay it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.450 
go much further down you can lay it
really<00:01:26.640> far<00:01:26.820> down<00:01:26.850> or<00:01:27.800> if<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.890> want<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.190> could
