00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
probably have a tolls Wharton and the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.560 
probably have a tolls Wharton and the
reason<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> dual<00:01:23.970> sport<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.479> you

reason you have a dual sport so you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.359

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
can't ride it and that's why I have a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.050 
can't ride it and that's why I have a
dual<00:01:26.610> sport

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
dual sport

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.069 
dual sport
I<00:01:27.240> actually<00:01:28.110> ride<00:01:28.650> every<00:01:29.220> day<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:30.210> ride<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.689> work

it<00:01:34.120> doesn't<00:01:34.450> matter<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.690> actually<00:01:35.470> do<00:01:35.950> not

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
it doesn't matter I actually do not

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.240

enjoy<00:01:36.520> driving<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.420> car<00:01:37.660> and<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:40.060> idea<00:01:40.510> of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
enjoy driving a car and so the idea of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.040 
enjoy driving a car and so the idea of
trailering<00:01:42.250> out<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.910> riding<00:01:43.300> area<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.660> not<00:01:43.900> at

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
all appealing to me which is why I've

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.760 
all appealing to me which is why I've
got<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.140> dual<00:01:47.800> sport<00:01:48.070> bikes<00:01:49.620> and<00:01:50.620> if<00:01:50.680> you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
negatives right now as most trailer and

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.580 
negatives right now as most trailer and
it's<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.970> rainy<00:01:58.510> day<00:01:58.660> you're<00:01:59.080> gonna<00:01:59.140> get<00:01:59.380> wet

riding off-road you're already wet and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.170 
riding off-road you're already wet and
then<00:02:05.290> of<00:02:05.410> course<00:02:05.440> if<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:05.860> get<00:02:06.040> muddy<00:02:06.369> or

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
pull all the way home so that's kind of

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.800 
pull all the way home so that's kind of
a<00:02:14.680> negative<00:02:14.940> but<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.060> course<00:02:16.239> you<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.630> see

one<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.780> problems<00:02:40.230> with<00:02:40.470> another<00:02:41.250> problem

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
one of the problems with another problem

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.130 
one of the problems with another problem
with<00:02:41.670> right<00:02:41.880> now<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:42.420> if<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.810> break<00:02:43.110> something

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
with right now is if you break something

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.600 
with right now is if you break something
you're<00:02:43.890> gonna<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.220> tough<00:02:44.400> time<00:02:44.550> getting

there's<00:02:48.300> no<00:02:48.480> cell<00:02:48.750> coverage<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.290> it's<00:02:49.440> going

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
there's no cell coverage so it's going

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.229 
there's no cell coverage so it's going
to<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.769> real<00:02:50.040> problem<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:50.519> me<00:02:50.700> getting<00:02:51.030> home

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.580 

about<00:03:06.880> ten<00:03:07.270> years<00:03:07.450> ago<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.810> used<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.140> road<00:03:08.319> race

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
about ten years ago I used to road race

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.220 
about ten years ago I used to road race
motorcycles<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.819> when<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.630> road<00:03:10.810> race<00:03:11.020> and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
motorcycles and when you road race and

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.520 
motorcycles and when you road race and
you<00:03:11.290> have<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.590> trailer<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.310> track<00:03:13.530> there's

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
you have to trailer to the track there's

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.050 
you have to trailer to the track there's
just<00:03:14.739> no<00:03:14.890> way<00:03:15.099> that<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.520> could<00:03:15.790> race

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
just no way that you could race

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.390 
just no way that you could race
competitively<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:17.590> even<00:03:18.040> think<00:03:18.220> about

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
competitively and even think about

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.430 
competitively and even think about
writing<00:03:18.640> your<00:03:18.819> bike<00:03:18.970> out<00:03:19.209> because<00:03:19.690> you're

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
writing your bike out because you're

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.040 
writing your bike out because you're
just<00:03:20.680> pushing<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:21.340> hard<00:03:21.730> your<00:03:22.450> odds<00:03:22.750> of

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
just pushing it so hard your odds of

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.070 
just pushing it so hard your odds of
being<00:03:23.530> able<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.239> get<00:03:25.239> on<00:03:25.300> some<00:03:25.599> crashing

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
being able to get on some crashing

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.589 
being able to get on some crashing
pretty<00:03:26.830> good<00:03:27.069> so<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:27.940> can<00:03:28.120> really<00:03:28.420> have<00:03:28.569> fun

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599

you know when I'm when I'm in the twisty
sections<00:04:07.299> I<00:04:07.420> kind<00:04:07.659> of<00:04:07.720> break<00:04:07.900> pretty<00:04:08.140> hard<00:04:08.409> up

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
sections I kind of break pretty hard up

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.530 
sections I kind of break pretty hard up
there<00:04:08.860> goes<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.069> guy<00:04:09.280> on<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.489> bike<00:04:09.730> tend<00:04:10.329> to<00:04:10.390> break

nabis and I think they got like
when<00:04:16.539> the<00:04:16.690> end<00:04:16.810> up<00:04:17.079> kind<00:04:17.380> of<00:04:17.530> end<00:04:17.739> up<00:04:17.829> shaped

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
when the end up kind of end up shaped

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.509 
when the end up kind of end up shaped
like<00:04:18.310> little<00:04:18.870> wedges<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.500> I'm<00:04:21.039> just<00:04:21.280> going

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
like little wedges and I'm just going

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.540 
like little wedges and I'm just going
through<00:04:21.609> front<00:04:21.940> tires<00:04:22.770> about<00:04:23.770> twice<00:04:24.100> as<00:04:24.310> fast

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
through front tires about twice as fast

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.050 
through front tires about twice as fast
as<00:04:24.759> I<00:04:24.850> go<00:04:25.000> through<00:04:25.060> my<00:04:25.300> rear<00:04:25.600> tire<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:27.550> I

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
as I go through my rear tire and so I

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.439 
as I go through my rear tire and so I
just<00:04:28.630> get<00:04:28.810> tired<00:04:29.080> of<00:04:29.850> getting<00:04:30.850> tired<00:04:31.120> of

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
just get tired of getting tired of

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.230 
just get tired of getting tired of
having<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:32.020> deal<00:04:32.229> with<00:04:32.580> more<00:04:33.580> traction<00:04:33.910> when

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
having to deal with more traction when

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.090 
having to deal with more traction when
I'm<00:04:34.360> off-road<00:04:34.840> or<00:04:35.199> you<00:04:35.530> don't<00:04:35.590> need<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:35.979> buy

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
I'm off-road or you don't need to buy

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.159 
I'm off-road or you don't need to buy
new<00:04:36.130> tires<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:37.660> that's<00:04:37.840> kind<00:04:38.080> of

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
new tires and so that's kind of

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.100 
new tires and so that's kind of
motivated<00:04:38.770> me<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:39.009> start<00:04:39.789> thinking<00:04:40.210> at<00:04:40.900> least

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
motivated me to start thinking at least

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.810 
motivated me to start thinking at least
about<00:04:41.320> getting<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.830> trailer

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
and would not even consider trailering

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.200

it out we're with the DRC which is a

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.110 
it out we're with the DRC which is a
more<00:07:08.539> dirt<00:07:08.810> oriented<00:07:09.439> bike<00:07:09.680> it<00:07:10.610> starts<00:07:10.939> to

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
more dirt oriented bike it starts to

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.779 
more dirt oriented bike it starts to
make<00:07:11.240> a<00:07:11.300> little<00:07:11.599> bit<00:07:11.840> more<00:07:12.080> sense<00:07:12.349> to<00:07:12.699> you<00:07:13.699> know

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:13.789 
make a little bit more sense to you know
