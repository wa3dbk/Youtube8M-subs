00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
of all I only have one combo + equipped

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.320 
of all I only have one combo + equipped
not<00:00:15.900> both<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.379> them<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.100> also<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.609> both<00:00:18.090> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
not both of them and I also have both of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.970 
not both of them and I also have both of
my<00:00:18.480> finishing<00:00:18.930> plusses<00:00:19.380> equipped

my finishing plusses equipped

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.040 
my finishing plusses equipped
those<00:00:20.310> aren't<00:00:20.640> entirely<00:00:20.970> necessary<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.900> have

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
those aren't entirely necessary to have

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.120 
those aren't entirely necessary to have
like<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.650> thought<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.949> would<00:00:23.070> be

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
like that but I thought it would be

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.990 
like that but I thought it would be
important<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.490> show<00:00:23.699> you

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
important to show you

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.580 
important to show you
because<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.689> feel<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.170> will<00:00:25.260> help<00:00:25.380> to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
because I feel like that will help to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.859 
because I feel like that will help to
loop<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.550> lingering<00:00:27.060> will<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.630> little

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
loop the lingering will just a little

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.330 
loop the lingering will just a little
bit<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.529> we're<00:00:28.680> gonna<00:00:28.769> go<00:00:28.920> ahead<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.220> enter

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
bit but we're gonna go ahead and enter

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.519 
bit but we're gonna go ahead and enter
these<00:00:29.670> strange<00:00:30.119> energy<00:00:30.390> portal<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.260> get

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
these strange energy portal here and get

00:00:31.529 --> 00:02:19.940 
these strange energy portal here and get
a<00:00:31.560> cutscene

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.780 

now<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.069> first<00:02:21.280> thing<00:02:21.430> you're<00:02:21.550> going<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.730> want

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
now the first thing you're going to want

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.820 
now the first thing you're going to want
to<00:02:21.970> do<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.209> block<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.840> Di's<00:02:23.080> this<00:02:23.410> fight<00:02:23.620> is

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
to do is block and Di's this fight is

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.470 
to do is block and Di's this fight is
pretty<00:02:24.040> much<00:02:24.190> over<00:02:24.610> because<00:02:24.880> if<00:02:25.000> he<00:02:25.120> starts

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
pretty much over because if he starts

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.940 
pretty much over because if he starts
off<00:02:25.630> with<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.990> little<00:02:26.050> attack<00:02:26.590> right<00:02:26.890> there

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
off with that little attack right there

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.180 
off with that little attack right there
I<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.970> perfect<00:02:28.569> strategy<00:02:28.950> where<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:29.980> hate

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
I have a perfect strategy where I hate

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.500 
I have a perfect strategy where I hate
to<00:02:30.340> say<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.610> actions<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.000> sounds<00:02:31.270> getting

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
to say the actions the sounds getting

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.880 
to say the actions the sounds getting
weird<00:02:31.720> but<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.959> have<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.110> pretty<00:02:32.350> much<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> perfect

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
weird but I have a pretty much a perfect

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.130 
weird but I have a pretty much a perfect
strategy<00:02:33.280> for<00:02:34.150> defeating<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.630> littering

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
strategy for defeating the littering

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.170 
strategy for defeating the littering
will<00:02:35.350> there<00:02:35.830> are<00:02:35.980> some<00:02:36.250> other<00:02:36.430> attack<00:02:36.819> so<00:02:37.060> you

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
will there are some other attack so you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.360 
will there are some other attack so you
can<00:02:37.300> start<00:02:37.510> off<00:02:37.660> with<00:02:37.989> such<00:02:38.350> as<00:02:38.620> one<00:02:39.069> that<00:02:39.220> like

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
can start off with such as one that like

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.220 
can start off with such as one that like
locks<00:02:39.700> your<00:02:39.910> attack<00:02:40.239> or<00:02:40.510> magic<00:02:40.930> or<00:02:41.020> even

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
locks your attack or magic or even

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.500 
locks your attack or magic or even
driver<00:02:41.500> Ivan<00:02:41.980> commands<00:02:42.430> if<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:43.030> happens

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
driver Ivan commands if that happens

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.540 
driver Ivan commands if that happens
usually<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.440> let<00:02:44.800> him<00:02:44.890> kill<00:02:45.100> me<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.340> start

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
usually I just let him kill me and start

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.949 
usually I just let him kill me and start
over<00:02:45.670> but<00:02:46.060> if<00:02:46.209> he<00:02:46.300> starts<00:02:46.600> off<00:02:46.690> with<00:02:46.810> that

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
over but if he starts off with that

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.380 
over but if he starts off with that
dashing<00:02:47.380> attack<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:48.250> have<00:02:48.489> pretty<00:02:48.819> much<00:02:48.910> won

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
dashing attack you have pretty much won

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.360 
dashing attack you have pretty much won
the<00:02:49.540> fight<00:02:49.810> but<00:02:50.080> my<00:02:50.260> combos<00:02:50.739> as<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.130> can<00:02:51.220> see

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
the fight but my combos as you can see

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.310 
the fight but my combos as you can see
are<00:02:51.550> doing<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.910> tremendous<00:02:52.180> amount<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.840> damage

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
are doing a tremendous amount of damage

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.140 
are doing a tremendous amount of damage
which<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:54.220> result<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.730> these<00:02:54.910> decisive

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
which is a result of these decisive

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.520 
which is a result of these decisive
pumpkin<00:02:55.660> Keyblade<00:02:55.989> which<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.290> really

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
pumpkin Keyblade which I really

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.840 
pumpkin Keyblade which I really
recommend<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:56.980> use<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:57.459> he<00:02:57.550> just

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
recommend you use but he just

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.370 
recommend you use but he just
disappeared<00:02:58.480> which<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> really<00:02:59.140> good<00:02:59.320> thing

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.259 
disappeared which is a really good thing
what<00:03:00.070> is<00:03:00.220> not<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.459> good<00:03:00.610> thing<00:03:00.940> though<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.209> just

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
Disney Castle which I've always liked

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.200 
Disney Castle which I've always liked
the<00:04:20.680> fact<00:04:20.889> that<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.190> portal<00:04:21.699> to<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:21.970> bite

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.629 
the fact that the portal to that bite
was<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.320> Disney<00:04:23.650> Castle<00:04:23.889> in<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.220> actual

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
battleground we just fought and I just

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.290 
battleground we just fought and I just
remembered<00:04:26.740> is<00:04:26.919> kind<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:27.699> spoiler<00:04:28.030> in<00:04:28.180> and

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300
