and then you do that first part i showed
you<00:04:20.590> twice<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.650> then<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.310> just<00:04:24.490> repeats

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
you twice so and then that just repeats

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.030 
you twice so and then that just repeats
over<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.210> over<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.680> hardest<00:04:26.860> part

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
over and over that is the hardest part

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.530 
over and over that is the hardest part
don't<00:04:27.400> don't<00:04:27.760> worry<00:04:27.910> about<00:04:28.060> if<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.240> can't<00:04:28.270> get
