character<00:00:53.489> models<00:00:53.879> instead<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.539> whatever<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
character models instead of whatever the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.680 
character models instead of whatever the
original<00:00:55.320> starting<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.219> was<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:57.180> ability<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
original starting one was the ability to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.630 
original starting one was the ability to
summon<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> eternal<00:00:58.590> dragon<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.340> they<00:00:59.460> put

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
summon the eternal dragon so they put

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.080 
summon the eternal dragon so they put
dragon<00:00:59.850> ball<00:01:00.180> scattered<00:01:00.629> around<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.260> other

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
dragon ball scattered around and other

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.799 
dragon ball scattered around and other
transformations<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.210> weren't<00:01:03.570> previously

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
transformations that weren't previously

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.700 
transformations that weren't previously
in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.630> one-point-two<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:07.110> added<00:01:07.439> those

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
in the one-point-two they added those

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.340 
in the one-point-two they added those
also<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:09.000> only<00:01:09.180> problem<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.930> with

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
also the only problem that I have with

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.310 
also the only problem that I have with
the<00:01:10.560> add-ons<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.540> moon<00:01:13.049> doesn't

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the add-ons are that the moon doesn't

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.440 
the add-ons are that the moon doesn't
work<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.830> can't<00:01:14.189> actually<00:01:14.640> transform<00:01:15.240> into

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
work so I can't actually transform into

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.780 
work so I can't actually transform into
Super<00:01:15.750> Saiyan<00:01:16.110> 4<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.100> doesn't<00:01:17.430> work<00:01:17.520> for

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790

Super<00:03:34.650> Saiyan<00:03:34.920> 2<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.750> don't<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:36.870> what<00:03:37.140> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
Super Saiyan 2 I don't know what the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.290 
Super Saiyan 2 I don't know what the
requirement<00:03:38.040> level<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.550> for<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.060> believe

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
requirement level is for that I believe

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.690 
requirement level is for that I believe
when<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.870> select<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.980> character<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.459> shows

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
when you select the character it shows

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.670 
when you select the character it shows
you<00:03:41.940> what<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.300> is<00:03:42.450> at<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.780> beginning<00:03:43.050> screen

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
you what it is at the beginning screen

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.860 
you what it is at the beginning screen
and<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:44.610> course<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:45.000> can<00:03:45.209> go<00:03:45.300> into<00:03:45.450> Super

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
and of course you can go into Super

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.949 
and of course you can go into Super
Saiyan<00:03:46.080> 3<00:03:46.610> now<00:03:47.610> each<00:03:47.820> character<00:03:48.360> transform

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
Saiyan 3 now each character transform

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.110 
Saiyan 3 now each character transform
different<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:50.010> if<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.280> play<00:03:50.489> as<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.970> course

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
different so if you play as of course

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.240 
different so if you play as of course
like<00:03:51.330> Vegeta<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:52.080> can<00:03:52.230> only<00:03:52.350> do<00:03:52.590> one<00:03:52.860> in<00:03:53.040> two

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
like Vegeta you can only do one in two

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.300 
like Vegeta you can only do one in two
depending<00:03:53.970> on<00:03:54.090> what<00:03:54.269> model<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.660> fit<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:56.130> can

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
depending on what model you fit you can

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.090 
depending on what model you fit you can
transform<00:03:56.910> into<00:03:57.180> Super<00:03:57.510> Saiyan<00:03:57.989> one<00:03:58.200> or<00:03:58.590> the

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
the muscles and stuff just various

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.600 
the muscles and stuff just various
various<00:04:06.810> transformations<00:04:07.650> depends<00:04:08.190> on<00:04:08.340> the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
various transformations depends on the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.509 
various transformations depends on the
character<00:04:09.180> models<00:04:09.600> itself<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:10.799> trunks<00:04:11.310> can

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
character models itself so trunks can

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.250 
character models itself so trunks can
actually<00:04:11.910> only<00:04:12.030> transform<00:04:12.630> once<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.110> his

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
actually only transform once in his

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.449 
actually only transform once in his
future<00:04:13.680> form<00:04:14.010> but<00:04:14.430> if<00:04:14.900> he<00:04:15.900> if<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.890> select<00:04:17.310> the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
future form but if he if you select the

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.789 
future form but if he if you select the
character<00:04:17.910> when<00:04:18.510> he<00:04:18.539> was<00:04:18.810> training<00:04:19.080> in<00:04:19.410> the

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
character when he was training in the

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.099 
character when he was training in the
hyperbolic<00:04:20.489> time<00:04:20.820> chamber<00:04:20.850> then<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.930> can

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
hyperbolic time chamber then you can

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.129 
hyperbolic time chamber then you can
transform<00:04:22.710> to

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
transform to

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.369 
transform to
times<00:04:24.030> into<00:04:25.030> like<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.509> regular<00:04:25.659> Super<00:04:26.169> Saiyan

do let's just do the moon for the hell
of<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.610> just<00:05:28.270> transforming<00:05:28.779> that's<00:05:28.960> saying

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
of it just transforming that's saying
