00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.500 

okay<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:01.949> want<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.190> do<00:00:02.340> one<00:00:02.610> more<00:00:02.639> pentapeptide

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
okay I want to do one more pentapeptide

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.720 
okay I want to do one more pentapeptide
problem<00:00:04.020> because<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.740> feel<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.069> these<00:00:05.670> are

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
problem because I feel that these are

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.230 
problem because I feel that these are
important<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:06.930> on<00:00:07.560> my<00:00:07.890> exam<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.639> wound<00:00:09.030> up

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
important and on my exam this wound up

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.879 
important and on my exam this wound up
being<00:00:09.420> about<00:00:09.750> 20<00:00:10.290> points

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
being about 20 points

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.940 
being about 20 points
so<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.460> mean<00:00:11.880> 20<00:00:12.150> points<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:13.200> significant

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
so I mean 20 points is a significant

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.160 
so I mean 20 points is a significant
number<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.370> points<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:14.910> any<00:00:15.059> exam<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.960> I

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
number of points on any exam so I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.890 
number of points on any exam so I
figured<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.430> one<00:00:17.609> more<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.880> these<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> little

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
figured we do one more of these a little

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.439 
figured we do one more of these a little
different<00:00:19.230> than<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> last<00:00:19.619> couple<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.789> what<00:00:21.420> I

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
different than the last couple so what I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.929 
different than the last couple so what I
drew<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.740> pentapeptide<00:00:23.369> leucine

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
drew here was the pentapeptide leucine

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.960 
drew here was the pentapeptide leucine
lysine<00:00:24.320> methionine<00:00:25.460> valine<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.670> histidine

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
lysine methionine valine and histidine

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.839 
lysine methionine valine and histidine
and<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:28.140> drew<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.560> fully<00:00:28.890> protonated<00:00:29.189> because

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
and I drew it fully protonated because

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.189 
and I drew it fully protonated because
that's<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.119> point<00:00:30.449> I've<00:00:30.539> been<00:00:30.599> making<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.050> all

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that's a point I've been making in all

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.659 
that's a point I've been making in all
these<00:00:31.349> videos<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.859> they<00:00:31.980> should<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.279> fully

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
these videos that they should be fully

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.310 
these videos that they should be fully
you<00:00:33.030> should<00:00:33.180> draw<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.390> fully<00:00:33.660> protonated<00:00:33.899> so

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
you should draw it fully protonated so

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.530 
you should draw it fully protonated so
you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> overall<00:00:35.100> charge<00:00:35.670> for

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you can see with the overall charge for

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.910 
you can see with the overall charge for
the<00:00:37.430> protein<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.530> pentapeptide<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.739> in

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the protein for the pentapeptide it's in

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.340 
the protein for the pentapeptide it's in
this<00:00:41.129> case<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:42.329> look<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> positive

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this case we look we get a positive

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.319 
this case we look we get a positive
charge<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:43.680> get<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> positive<00:00:44.670> charge<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
charge here get a positive charge on the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
charge here get a positive charge on the
lysine<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.219> another<00:00:47.460> positive

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
lysine and we have another positive

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.940 
lysine and we have another positive
charge<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.120> histidine<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> overall

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
charge on histidine so the overall

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.119 
charge on histidine so the overall
charge<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.550> +3<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:54.379> now<00:00:55.379> what<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> want<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> do

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
charge is +3 and now what you want to do

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.700 
charge is +3 and now what you want to do
is<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.520> back<00:00:56.660> look<00:00:57.660> at<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:57.960> chart<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.410> see

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
is go back look at your chart and see

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.849 
is go back look at your chart and see
which<00:00:58.980> values<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.210> each<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.350> these<00:01:01.440> side

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
which values the each of these side

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.690 
which values the each of these side
chains<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:03.690> course<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.260> amine<00:01:05.220> group<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
chains and of course the amine group and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.440 
chains and of course the amine group and
the<00:01:06.180> carboxyl<00:01:06.720> group<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.490> backbone<00:01:08.490> lose

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the carboxyl group in the backbone lose

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.370 
the carboxyl group in the backbone lose
their<00:01:09.630> protons<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.939> one<00:01:12.200> loses<00:01:13.200> its

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
their protons at so this one loses its

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.670 
their protons at so this one loses its
proton<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> pH<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.030> 8.5<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:18.869> carboxyl<00:01:19.439> group

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
proton at a pH of 8.5 the carboxyl group

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.130 
proton at a pH of 8.5 the carboxyl group
loses<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> proton<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.909> pH<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.500> 3.5

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
loses the proton at a pH of 3.5

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.710 
loses the proton at a pH of 3.5
histidine<00:01:25.140> loses<00:01:25.590> its<00:01:25.770> proton<00:01:26.280> at<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> pH<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.180> 6

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
histidine loses its proton at a pH of 6

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.130 
histidine loses its proton at a pH of 6
and<00:01:28.909> lysine<00:01:30.259> loses<00:01:31.259> its<00:01:31.439> proton<00:01:31.979> at<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> pH<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
and lysine loses its proton at a pH of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.569 
and lysine loses its proton at a pH of
10.5<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> those<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> groups<00:01:38.070> right<00:01:38.340> there

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
10.5 so those are the groups right there

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.600 
10.5 so those are the groups right there
and<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.960> first<00:01:40.170> thing<00:01:40.350> we'll<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and the first thing we'll do then and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.920 
and the first thing we'll do then and
and<00:01:41.880> maybe<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.210> haven't<00:01:42.360> done<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and maybe I haven't done this in the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.719 
and maybe I haven't done this in the
past<00:01:43.170> videos<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.710> I'll<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.250> because<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
past videos but I'll do it now because I

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.310 
past videos but I'll do it now because I
think<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.119> good<00:01:45.240> way<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> working<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
think it's a good way of working the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.889 
think it's a good way of working the
problem<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.430> say<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.880> which<00:01:48.390> one<00:01:48.570> loses

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
problem is to say that which one loses

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.929 
problem is to say that which one loses
its<00:01:49.049> proton<00:01:49.380> first<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.189> see<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.670> as

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
its proton first so we can see that as

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.359 
its proton first so we can see that as
we're<00:01:51.479> adding<00:01:51.630> equivalents<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> NaOH<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.189> this

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
we're adding equivalents of NaOH to this

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.969 
we're adding equivalents of NaOH to this
solution<00:01:53.700> we're<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.049> lose<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
solution we're going to lose the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.830 
solution we're going to lose the
carboxyl<00:01:56.520> proton<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> corner

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
carboxyl proton over here in the corner

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.280 
carboxyl proton over here in the corner
first<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.100> at<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> pH<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.520> 3.5<00:02:00.290> so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
first because that's at a pH of 3.5 so

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.319 
first because that's at a pH of 3.5 so
we're<00:02:01.649> starting<00:02:01.799> at<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> very<00:02:02.100> very<00:02:02.399> low<00:02:02.520> pH<00:02:02.909> say

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
we're starting at a very very low pH say

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.139 
we're starting at a very very low pH say
pH<00:02:03.719> 1<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.409> we're<00:02:04.590> adding<00:02:04.799> NaOH<00:02:05.460> adding<00:02:05.969> more

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
pH 1 and we're adding NaOH adding more

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.290 
pH 1 and we're adding NaOH adding more
and<00:02:06.299> more<00:02:06.390> NaOH<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.140> raising<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> pH<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and more NaOH and raising the pH so the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.760 
and more NaOH and raising the pH so the
first<00:02:09.509> one<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.869> come<00:02:10.020> off<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
first one to come off is going to be the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.110 
first one to come off is going to be the
carboxyl<00:02:11.250> group<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.610> we're<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.970> call

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
carboxyl group so we're going to call

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.880 
carboxyl group so we're going to call
that<00:02:12.150> peak

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
that peak

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.070 
that peak
one<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.490> maybe<00:02:14.240> this<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.660> what<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.840> haven't

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
one and maybe this is what I haven't

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.949 
one and maybe this is what I haven't
been<00:02:15.350> doing<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.680> labeling<00:02:16.160> this<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:17.360> PK<00:02:17.720> one

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
been doing is labeling this so PK one

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.210 
been doing is labeling this so PK one
and<00:02:18.260> then<00:02:19.010> from<00:02:19.250> here<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.670> say<00:02:19.970> okay

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
and then from here I say okay

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.820 
and then from here I say okay
PK<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.000> then<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.930> gives<00:02:24.080> us<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.410> plus<00:02:24.590> two

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
PK one and then that gives us a plus two

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.680 
PK one and then that gives us a plus two
overall<00:02:25.160> charge<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.850> molecule<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:28.660> then<00:02:29.660> I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
overall charge on the molecule so then I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.090 
overall charge on the molecule so then I
look<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.200> say<00:02:30.350> okay<00:02:30.560> what's<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.830> next<00:02:30.950> one

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
look and I say okay what's the next one

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.410 
look and I say okay what's the next one
to<00:02:31.220> come<00:02:31.370> off<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.730> that's<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:32.000> histidine

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
to come off and that's this histidine

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.520 
to come off and that's this histidine
here<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.680> could<00:02:33.860> be<00:02:34.040> PK<00:02:34.520> 2<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:36.260> then<00:02:36.410> I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
here and this could be PK 2 so then I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.290 
here and this could be PK 2 so then I
say<00:02:36.680> okay<00:02:37.959> label<00:02:38.959> that<00:02:39.140> PK<00:02:39.770> 2<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.910> gives<00:02:41.090> us<00:02:41.209> a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
say okay label that PK 2 that gives us a

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.870 
say okay label that PK 2 that gives us a
plus<00:02:41.480> 1<00:02:41.750> charge

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
plus 1 charge

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.400 
plus 1 charge
and<00:02:44.230> PK<00:02:45.230> 3<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.030> that's<00:02:47.030> going<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.600> be<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.230> next

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
and PK 3 and that's going to be the next

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.110 
and PK 3 and that's going to be the next
one<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.650> loser<00:02:48.830> proton<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.640> going<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.940> be<00:02:50.000> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
one the loser proton is going to be the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.000

eight<00:02:50.209> point<00:02:50.450> five<00:02:50.630> pH<00:02:51.200> eight<00:02:51.380> point<00:02:51.590> five<00:02:51.739> for

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
eight point five pH eight point five for

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.920 
eight point five pH eight point five for
this<00:02:52.130> an<00:02:52.280> amine<00:02:52.459> group<00:02:52.519> so<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.540> ends<00:02:53.840> up

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
this an amine group so that ends up

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.610 
this an amine group so that ends up
being<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.290> zero<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.640> last<00:02:55.850> one<00:02:56.470> which<00:02:57.470> will

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
being a zero and the last one which will

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.530 
being a zero and the last one which will
be<00:02:57.650> PK<00:02:59.140> for<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:01.700> last<00:03:01.940> one<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.209> lose<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
be PK for the last one to lose the

be PK for the last one to lose the
proton<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:02.930> going<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.110> be<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.320> lysine<00:03:03.709> over

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
proton is going to be the lysine over

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.170 
proton is going to be the lysine over
here<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.870> that's<00:03:05.870> going<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.580> lose<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.760> lose<00:03:08.120> it

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
here and that's going to lose it lose it

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.300 
here and that's going to lose it lose it
at<00:03:08.360> ten<00:03:08.510> point<00:03:08.750> five<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.350> it's<00:03:09.920> going<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.190> give

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
at ten point five and it's going to give

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.740 
at ten point five and it's going to give
us<00:03:10.459> an<00:03:10.610> overall<00:03:11.030> charge<00:03:11.330> of<00:03:11.450> negative<00:03:11.720> one<00:03:13.750> so

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
us an overall charge of negative one so

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.590 
us an overall charge of negative one so
I<00:03:15.200> think<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:16.580> about<00:03:16.850> covers<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.420> will<00:03:17.510> have

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
I think that about covers it will have

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.569 
I think that about covers it will have
an<00:03:17.690> overall<00:03:17.900> charge<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.320> negative<00:03:18.500> one<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:19.070> we

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
an overall charge of negative one so we

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.280 
an overall charge of negative one so we
have<00:03:19.670> everything<00:03:19.940> we<00:03:20.090> need<00:03:20.329> now<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.510> begin

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
have everything we need now to begin

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.960 
have everything we need now to begin
just<00:03:21.320> drawing<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.950> titration<00:03:22.489> curve<00:03:22.670> and

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
just drawing the titration curve and

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.870 
just drawing the titration curve and
then<00:03:23.060> calculating<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.690> P<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.170> such<00:03:24.880> so

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
then calculating the P I and such so

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.330 
then calculating the P I and such so
I'll<00:03:26.570> begin<00:03:26.870> drawing<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.620> titration<00:03:27.950> curve

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
I'll begin drawing the titration curve

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.400 
I'll begin drawing the titration curve
just<00:03:28.670> remember<00:03:29.090> your<00:03:29.209> axis<00:03:29.690> labels

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
just remember your axis labels

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.830 
just remember your axis labels
so<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.910> down<00:03:32.120> here<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:33.880> equivalence<00:03:34.880> of<00:03:35.209> NaOH

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
so this down here is equivalence of NaOH

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.600 
so this down here is equivalence of NaOH
equivalents<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.900> NaOH<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.829> this<00:03:40.160> one<00:03:40.310> over

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
equivalents of NaOH and this one over

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.120 
equivalents of NaOH and this one over
here<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.420> pH<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:44.170> on<00:03:45.170> this<00:03:45.470> chart<00:03:45.860> I'm

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
here is the pH and on this chart I'm

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.370 
here is the pH and on this chart I'm
going<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.670> say<00:03:47.140> three<00:03:48.140> point<00:03:48.410> five<00:03:50.260> then<00:03:51.260> I'm

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
going to say three point five then I'm

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.750 
going to say three point five then I'm
going<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.560> go<00:03:51.709> up<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:51.980> six

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
going to go up to six

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.460 
going to go up to six
and<00:03:53.720> go<00:03:53.870> up<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.110> eight<00:03:54.230> point<00:03:54.500> five<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:56.470> finish

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
and go up to eight point five and finish

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.110 
and go up to eight point five and finish
off<00:03:57.620> somewhere<00:03:58.040> up<00:03:58.160> here<00:03:58.340> around<00:03:58.459> ten<00:03:58.910> point

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
off somewhere up here around ten point

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.680 
off somewhere up here around ten point
five<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:01.220> I'm<00:04:01.549> going<00:04:01.700> to<00:04:01.760> start<00:04:01.970> drawing<00:04:02.120> my

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
five so I'm going to start drawing my

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.990 
five so I'm going to start drawing my
curve<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.410> it's<00:04:03.799> going<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.040> flatten<00:04:04.310> remember

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
curve and it's going to flatten remember

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.520 
curve and it's going to flatten remember
just<00:04:05.239> make<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:05.540> flat<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:05.840> know<00:04:06.079> flatten<00:04:06.470> it

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
just make it flat you know flatten it

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.500 
just make it flat you know flatten it
out<00:04:06.650> at<00:04:06.890> three<00:04:07.220> point<00:04:07.430> five<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:08.000> got<00:04:08.480> a

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
out at three point five I got a

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.240 
out at three point five I got a
different<00:04:08.870> color<00:04:09.049> marker<00:04:09.500> here<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:11.769> mark<00:04:12.769> the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
different color marker here to mark the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.680

point<00:04:13.519> there<00:04:14.500> which<00:04:15.500> is<00:04:15.680> PK<00:04:15.980> one<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:17.329> that

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
point there which is PK one and that

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.520 
point there which is PK one and that
corresponds<00:04:18.289> to<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.620> carboxyl<00:04:19.190> group<00:04:20.530> let's

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
corresponds to the carboxyl group let's

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.970 
corresponds to the carboxyl group let's
be<00:04:21.650> k1

and<00:04:23.100> we<00:04:23.190> continue<00:04:23.670> up<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:24.060> six<00:04:24.450> flatten<00:04:25.230> out

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
and we continue up to six flatten out

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.220 
and we continue up to six flatten out
around<00:04:25.650> six<00:04:27.860> mark<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:29.070> spot<00:04:29.250> there<00:04:29.730> and

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
around six mark that spot there and

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.360 
around six mark that spot there and
that's<00:04:31.230> PK<00:04:31.890> -<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.590> corresponds<00:04:35.160> to<00:04:35.190> the

that's PK - and that corresponds to the
histidine<00:04:35.790> proton<00:04:36.620> will<00:04:37.620> keep<00:04:37.800> going<00:04:38.100> up<00:04:38.250> to

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
histidine proton will keep going up to

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.030 
histidine proton will keep going up to
8.5<00:04:39.110> flatten<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.170> graph<00:04:40.380> out<00:04:40.590> up<00:04:40.800> there

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
8.5 flatten the graph out up there

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.820 
8.5 flatten the graph out up there
around<00:04:41.730> eight<00:04:41.910> point<00:04:42.150> five<00:04:42.680> that's<00:04:43.680> PK<00:04:44.100> three

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
around eight point five that's PK three

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.510 
around eight point five that's PK three
and<00:04:47.840> then<00:04:48.840> we'll<00:04:49.140> go<00:04:49.290> up<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.560> ten<00:04:50.010> point<00:04:50.280> five

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
and then we'll go up to ten point five

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.040 
and then we'll go up to ten point five
flatten<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.300> graph<00:04:51.480> out<00:04:51.720> up<00:04:51.930> there<00:04:52.460> and

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
flatten the graph out up there and

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.510 
flatten the graph out up there and
that's<00:04:55.050> going<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.560> correspond<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:58.230> lysine

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.640 

so<00:05:02.520> PK<00:05:02.880> four

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
so PK four

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.990 
so PK four
all<00:05:04.650> right<00:05:04.830> now<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.460> other<00:05:05.610> things<00:05:05.880> that

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
all right now the other things that

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.430 
all right now the other things that
we've<00:05:06.240> been<00:05:06.360> discussing<00:05:06.690> in<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.050> lot<00:05:07.230> of<00:05:07.350> these

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
we've been discussing in a lot of these

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.990 
we've been discussing in a lot of these
videos<00:05:07.830> that<00:05:07.860> I<00:05:08.130> said<00:05:08.370> you<00:05:08.670> know<00:05:08.790> they're

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
videos that I said you know they're

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.400 
videos that I said you know they're
going<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.180> probably<00:05:09.330> want<00:05:09.660> you<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.930> do<00:05:10.110> is

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
going to probably want you to do is

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.360 
going to probably want you to do is
they're<00:05:10.560> probably<00:05:10.710> gonna<00:05:10.890> want<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.190> label

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
they're probably gonna want you to label

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.950 
they're probably gonna want you to label
the<00:05:11.520> buffer<00:05:11.850> regions<00:05:12.240> there's<00:05:12.570> several<00:05:12.810> ways

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
the buffer regions there's several ways

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.140 
the buffer regions there's several ways
you<00:05:13.140> can<00:05:13.350> do<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:13.890> I've<00:05:14.490> been<00:05:14.730> using<00:05:14.940> a

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
you can do that I've been using a

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.640 
you can do that I've been using a
squiggly<00:05:15.420> line<00:05:15.570> but<00:05:15.930> another<00:05:16.140> way<00:05:16.290> I've<00:05:16.440> seen

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
squiggly line but another way I've seen

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.560 
squiggly line but another way I've seen
it<00:05:16.710> done<00:05:16.830> which<00:05:17.370> which<00:05:17.610> is<00:05:17.730> equally<00:05:18.090> good<00:05:18.390> is

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
it done which which is equally good is

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.440 
it done which which is equally good is
to<00:05:18.690> actually<00:05:18.990> kind<00:05:19.170> of<00:05:19.320> put<00:05:19.440> a<00:05:19.470> little<00:05:19.740> square

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
to actually kind of put a little square

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.750 
to actually kind of put a little square
around<00:05:21.450> this<00:05:21.720> whole<00:05:22.410> region<00:05:22.710> here<00:05:23.220> just<00:05:23.640> like

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
around this whole region here just like

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.810 
around this whole region here just like
that<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:24.770> then<00:05:25.770> just<00:05:26.010> kind<00:05:26.310> of<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.670> know

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
that and then just kind of you know

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.770 
that and then just kind of you know
shade<00:05:27.660> it<00:05:27.840> in<00:05:27.990> or<00:05:28.170> whatever<00:05:29.300> just<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:30.480> indicate

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
shade it in or whatever just to indicate

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.120 
shade it in or whatever just to indicate
that<00:05:30.960> that's<00:05:31.230> sort<00:05:31.500> of<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.710> buffering<00:05:32.010> region

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
that that's sort of the buffering region

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.340 
that that's sort of the buffering region
again<00:05:32.820> remembering<00:05:33.330> that<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.690> maximum

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
again remembering that the maximum

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.020 
again remembering that the maximum
buffering<00:05:34.650> capacity<00:05:34.800> is<00:05:35.310> when<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.610> pH<00:05:35.880> is

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
buffering capacity is when the pH is

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.370 
buffering capacity is when the pH is
equal<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.450> pKa<00:05:36.690> so<00:05:37.650> exactly<00:05:38.100> add<00:05:38.250> 3.5<00:05:39.380> but

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
equal to the pKa so exactly add 3.5 but

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.400 
equal to the pKa so exactly add 3.5 but
it<00:05:41.220> can<00:05:41.580> extend<00:05:41.910> from<00:05:42.150> plus<00:05:42.420> or<00:05:42.570> minus<00:05:42.930> one

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
it can extend from plus or minus one

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.770 
it can extend from plus or minus one
peak<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:43.800> unit<00:05:44.250> is<00:05:44.400> just<00:05:44.850> a<00:05:44.940> good<00:05:45.420> rule<00:05:45.630> of<00:05:45.660> thumb

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
peak a unit is just a good rule of thumb

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.490 
peak a unit is just a good rule of thumb
to<00:05:46.200> follow<00:05:46.800> for<00:05:47.040> these<00:05:47.190> problems<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:49.050> again

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
to follow for these problems and again

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.040 
to follow for these problems and again
I'll<00:05:49.710> do<00:05:49.950> that<00:05:50.130> up<00:05:50.340> here<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:50.940> show<00:05:51.930> the

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
I'll do that up here and show the

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.680 
I'll do that up here and show the
buffering<00:05:52.440> region<00:05:52.470> up<00:05:52.890> here<00:05:53.420> I'll<00:05:54.420> do<00:05:54.570> the

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
buffering region up here I'll do the

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.320 
buffering region up here I'll do the
same<00:05:54.870> thing<00:05:54.930> on<00:05:55.260> this<00:05:55.410> one<00:05:56.060> kind<00:05:57.060> of<00:05:57.150> show<00:05:57.300> that

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
same thing on this one kind of show that

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.820 
same thing on this one kind of show that
buffering<00:05:57.960> region<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.940> same<00:06:00.150> thing<00:06:00.360> up<00:06:00.480> here

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
buffering region the same thing up here

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.070 
buffering region the same thing up here
I'll<00:06:01.830> show<00:06:01.980> that<00:06:02.190> buffering<00:06:02.580> region<00:06:03.080> so

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
I'll show that buffering region so

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.480 
I'll show that buffering region so
there's<00:06:04.260> the<00:06:04.410> buffering<00:06:04.710> regions<00:06:05.190> they're

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
there's the buffering regions they're

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.240 
there's the buffering regions they're
shaded<00:06:05.940> in<00:06:06.120> it's<00:06:06.960> a<00:06:07.050> little<00:06:07.320> messy<00:06:07.470> but<00:06:07.920> this

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
shaded in it's a little messy but this

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.740 
shaded in it's a little messy but this
is<00:06:08.430> another<00:06:08.700> way<00:06:08.850> of<00:06:08.880> doing<00:06:09.120> it<00:06:09.390> it<00:06:09.570> looks

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
is another way of doing it it looks

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.120 
is another way of doing it it looks
better<00:06:09.930> when<00:06:10.110> you<00:06:10.230> do<00:06:10.380> it<00:06:10.410> with<00:06:10.620> pencil<00:06:10.890> um<00:06:11.570> and

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
better when you do it with pencil um and

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.020 
better when you do it with pencil um and
the<00:06:14.130> last<00:06:14.160> thing<00:06:14.520> we<00:06:14.580> have<00:06:14.670> to<00:06:14.730> do<00:06:14.850> is

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
the last thing we have to do is

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.510 
the last thing we have to do is
calculate<00:06:15.240> and<00:06:15.630> Mark<00:06:15.810> the<00:06:15.960> PI<00:06:16.250> so<00:06:17.250> again

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
calculate and Mark the PI so again

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.630 
calculate and Mark the PI so again
remember<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.120> PI's<00:06:18.390> isoelectric<00:06:19.260> point<00:06:19.640> and

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
remember the PI's isoelectric point and

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.590 
remember the PI's isoelectric point and
it's<00:06:20.820> equal<00:06:21.180> to<00:06:21.330> 1/2<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:22.350> value<00:06:22.920> at<00:06:23.100> which

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
it's equal to 1/2 the value at which

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.040 
it's equal to 1/2 the value at which
piqué<00:06:24.600> piqué<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.800> value<00:06:26.520> of<00:06:26.610> which<00:06:27.050> the

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
piqué piqué the value of which the

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.800 
piqué piqué the value of which the
pentapeptide<00:06:28.710> has<00:06:28.920> no<00:06:29.100> net<00:06:29.370> charge<00:06:29.610> so<00:06:30.300> that's

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
pentapeptide has no net charge so that's

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.630 
pentapeptide has no net charge so that's
going<00:06:31.020> to<00:06:31.080> be<00:06:31.230> right<00:06:31.470> between<00:06:31.710> where<00:06:32.310> it<00:06:32.520> has<00:06:32.610> a

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
going to be right between where it has a

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.500 
going to be right between where it has a
plus<00:06:32.940> 1<00:06:33.120> charge

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
plus 1 charge

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.630 
plus 1 charge
and<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:33.900> minus<00:06:34.350> 1<00:06:34.530> charge<00:06:34.560> so<00:06:35.220> it's<00:06:35.310> going<00:06:35.400> to<00:06:35.460> be

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
and a minus 1 charge so it's going to be

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.350 
and a minus 1 charge so it's going to be
Q<00:06:35.820> between

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
Q between

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.080 
Q between
k3<00:06:36.930> mpk<00:06:37.590> 4<00:06:38.330> so<00:06:39.330> if<00:06:39.900> we<00:06:40.620> recall<00:06:40.949> from<00:06:41.550> our<00:06:41.699> labels

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
k3 mpk 4 so if we recall from our labels

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:50.140 
k3 mpk 4 so if we recall from our labels
at<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:42.360> top<00:06:42.569> up<00:06:42.780> here<00:06:45.710> PK<00:06:46.710> 3<00:06:47.280> is<00:06:47.729> going<00:06:48.719> to<00:06:48.900> be

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
at the top up here PK 3 is going to be

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:59.749 
at the top up here PK 3 is going to be
8.5<00:06:52.219> and<00:06:54.949> PK<00:06:55.949> 4<00:06:56.280> it's<00:06:56.430> going<00:06:56.580> to<00:06:56.639> be<00:06:56.729> 10.5<00:06:58.759> so

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
8.5 and PK 4 it's going to be 10.5 so

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:01.790 
8.5 and PK 4 it's going to be 10.5 so
this<00:06:59.939> is<00:07:00.120> going<00:07:00.240> to<00:07:00.300> be<00:07:00.479> 1/2<00:07:00.930> a<00:07:01.110> point<00:07:01.319> 5<00:07:01.590> plus

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
this is going to be 1/2 a point 5 plus

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.100 
this is going to be 1/2 a point 5 plus
10<00:07:02.129> point<00:07:02.400> 5<00:07:02.639> so<00:07:03.090> the<00:07:03.180> isoelectric<00:07:03.509> point

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
10 point 5 so the isoelectric point

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.469 
10 point 5 so the isoelectric point
where<00:07:04.439> it<00:07:04.530> has<00:07:04.650> zero<00:07:05.039> negative<00:07:05.280> charge<00:07:05.759> its

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 
where it has zero negative charge its

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:12.559 
where it has zero negative charge its
equal<00:07:06.810> to<00:07:06.840> nine<00:07:07.110> point<00:07:07.379> five<00:07:09.259> um<00:07:10.759> and<00:07:11.759> we<00:07:12.389> can

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:12.569 
equal to nine point five um and we can

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:14.480 
equal to nine point five um and we can
mark<00:07:12.750> that<00:07:12.810> on<00:07:13.110> here<00:07:13.379> so<00:07:13.560> to<00:07:13.620> say<00:07:13.830> something

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
mark that on here so to say something

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.779 
mark that on here so to say something
like<00:07:15.199> and<00:07:16.199> try<00:07:16.439> and<00:07:16.620> do<00:07:16.770> it<00:07:16.919> in<00:07:17.039> some<00:07:17.610> other

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:17.789 
like and try and do it in some other

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:20.749 
like and try and do it in some other
color<00:07:18.090> but<00:07:18.590> basically<00:07:19.590> something<00:07:20.009> right

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 
color but basically something right

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:26.409 
color but basically something right
around<00:07:20.909> here<00:07:21.740> that<00:07:22.740> will<00:07:22.949> be<00:07:23.159> your<00:07:24.090> P<00:07:24.330> I<00:07:24.360> so

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419 
around here that will be your P I so

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.629 
around here that will be your P I so
right<00:07:27.419> along<00:07:27.900> that<00:07:28.379> spot<00:07:28.919> will<00:07:29.129> be<00:07:29.159> the<00:07:29.340> P<00:07:29.490> I<00:07:29.520> so

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 
right along that spot will be the P I so

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.399 
right along that spot will be the P I so
that<00:07:30.029> that's<00:07:30.389> about<00:07:30.509> it<00:07:30.870> that's<00:07:31.020> about<00:07:31.139> all

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:31.409 
that that's about it that's about all

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.850 
that that's about it that's about all
you<00:07:31.529> have<00:07:31.620> to<00:07:31.710> calculate<00:07:31.889> on<00:07:32.279> this<00:07:32.430> problem<00:07:33.419> to

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
you have to calculate on this problem to

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.219 
you have to calculate on this problem to
get<00:07:34.860> it<00:07:34.979> all<00:07:35.099> correct<00:07:35.460> but<00:07:35.580> again<00:07:35.909> this<00:07:36.509> was<00:07:37.169> a

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:37.229 
get it all correct but again this was a

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:38.929 
get it all correct but again this was a
problem<00:07:37.590> that<00:07:37.620> was<00:07:37.740> worth<00:07:37.949> significant

00:07:38.929 --> 00:07:38.939 
problem that was worth significant

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:40.790 
problem that was worth significant
number<00:07:39.150> of<00:07:39.180> points<00:07:39.479> on<00:07:39.569> the<00:07:39.689> exam<00:07:39.810> so<00:07:40.020> I<00:07:40.409> just

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 
number of points on the exam so I just

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.529 
number of points on the exam so I just
want<00:07:40.949> to<00:07:41.009> make<00:07:41.099> sure<00:07:41.159> that<00:07:42.029> we<00:07:42.180> do<00:07:42.300> enough

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 
want to make sure that we do enough

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:44.450 
want to make sure that we do enough
examples<00:07:42.690> of<00:07:43.289> these<00:07:43.409> so<00:07:43.680> people<00:07:43.979> can<00:07:44.099> see<00:07:44.310> a

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460 
examples of these so people can see a

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.620 
examples of these so people can see a
couple<00:07:45.060> of<00:07:45.120> different<00:07:45.419> versions<00:07:45.629> Thanks
