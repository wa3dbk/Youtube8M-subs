stepping so here we go folks it's a good
step<00:00:17.699> one<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> basic<00:00:18.720> cross<00:00:19.050> step<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.680> nollie

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
step one is a basic cross step to nollie

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.189 
step one is a basic cross step to nollie
pivot<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.699> style<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.810> we're<00:00:21.930> going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.109> do<00:00:22.170> a

pivot the style so we're going to do a
basic<00:00:22.410> cross<00:00:22.920> step<00:00:23.340> it's<00:00:24.330> an<00:00:24.449> ollie<00:00:24.720> pit<00:00:25.490> so

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
basic cross step it's an ollie pit so

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.160 
basic cross step it's an ollie pit so
get<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.880> move<00:00:27.119> down<00:00:27.420> smooth

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
get that move down smooth

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.770 
get that move down smooth

switch cross step in to fakie pivot you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:11.249 
switch cross step in to fakie pivot you
keep<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.359> going

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.080 

okay<00:01:12.259> in<00:01:12.530> step<00:01:13.009> three<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:13.340> did<00:01:13.609> the<00:01:13.729> motions

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
okay in step three I did the motions

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.240 
okay in step three I did the motions
really<00:01:14.240> slow<00:01:14.719> you<00:01:15.409> want<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.649> do<00:01:15.770> your<00:01:15.950> cross

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
really slow you want to do your cross

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
step swing getting out of your switch

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.260 
step swing getting out of your switch
get<00:01:19.009> your<00:01:19.159> balance<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.670> then<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.880> your<00:01:20.000> switch

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270

get your balance and then to your switch
cross<00:01:20.600> I'm<00:01:20.810> going<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.990> fake<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:21.319> pivot<00:01:21.500> around

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
cross I'm going to fake you pivot around

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.279 
cross I'm going to fake you pivot around
once<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:22.819> get<00:01:22.969> that<00:01:23.119> down<00:01:23.390> comfortable<00:01:23.929> then

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
once you get that down comfortable then

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:25.690 
once you get that down comfortable then
you<00:01:24.409> want<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.619> combine<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.039> move<00:01:25.219> so<00:01:25.429> it<00:01:25.520> flows

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
you want to combine the move so it flows

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:37.270 
you want to combine the move so it flows
the<00:01:25.850> other<00:01:25.880> quicker<00:01:26.270> I'll<00:01:27.259> show<00:01:27.439> you

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
right now I'm going to talk about the

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.410 
right now I'm going to talk about the
fine<00:01:39.920> details<00:01:40.370> to<00:01:40.550> make<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:40.790> movie<00:01:41.030> super

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
fine details to make this movie super

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.830 
fine details to make this movie super
awesome<00:01:41.810> so<00:01:42.740> at<00:01:43.130> first<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:44.210> can<00:01:44.390> either<00:01:44.540> do

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
awesome so at first you can either do

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.900 
awesome so at first you can either do
your<00:01:45.080> nollie<00:01:45.350> pivot<00:01:45.740> by<00:01:45.830> picking<00:01:46.490> up<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.729> back

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
your nollie pivot by picking up the back

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.420 
your nollie pivot by picking up the back
end<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.300> slamming<00:01:47.720> it<00:01:47.840> down<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:49.130> make<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.340> look

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
end and slamming it down to make it look

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.710 
end and slamming it down to make it look
a<00:01:49.490> little<00:01:49.580> smoother<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.060> personally<00:01:50.570> like<00:01:50.690> to

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
a little smoother I personally like to

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.680 
a little smoother I personally like to
drag<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.860> back<00:01:52.070> end<00:01:52.340> around<00:01:52.550> almost<00:01:53.330> like<00:01:53.570> a

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
drag the back end around almost like a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.350 
drag the back end around almost like a
slide<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.830> version<00:01:55.369> one<00:01:55.550> is<00:01:55.729> picking<00:01:56.000> up<00:01:56.240> the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
slide so version one is picking up the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.160 
slide so version one is picking up the
back<00:01:56.540> ends<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.680> as<00:01:57.770> we<00:01:57.920> go<00:01:58.780> pick<00:01:59.780> up<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.020> back

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
back ends so as we go pick up the back

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.550 
back ends so as we go pick up the back
end<00:02:00.200> push<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.100> down<00:02:01.360> cross<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.630> switch<00:02:02.990> pick

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
end push it down cross that switch pick

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.609 
end push it down cross that switch pick
up<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.770> back<00:02:03.920> end<00:02:03.950> place<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:05.030> down

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
up the back end place it down

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.290 
up the back end place it down
okay<00:02:06.619> in<00:02:07.010> version<00:02:07.369> two<00:02:07.520> which<00:02:07.550> I<00:02:07.910> think<00:02:08.149> looks

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
okay in version two which I think looks

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.699 
okay in version two which I think looks
a<00:02:08.390> little<00:02:08.479> better<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:09.200> you're<00:02:09.380> actually<00:02:09.619> going

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
a little better is you're actually going

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:10.840 
a little better is you're actually going
to<00:02:09.770> start<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:09.979> pick<00:02:10.220> up<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.459> border<00:02:10.729> then

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
to start to pick up the border then

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.440 
to start to pick up the border then
you're<00:02:10.940> going<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.120> slide<00:02:11.600> it<00:02:11.630> around<00:02:12.130> watch

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
you're going to slide it around watch

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.350

judge definite there when you do your
pivot<00:02:53.860> around<00:02:53.950> it's<00:02:54.640> best<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.180> pair<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.930> board

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
pivot around it's best to pair the board

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.940 
pivot around it's best to pair the board
around<00:02:56.230> more<00:02:56.740> than<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:57.100> 180<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:59.110> allows<00:02:59.770> you

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
around more than a 180 this allows you

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.260 
around more than a 180 this allows you
then<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.130> cross<00:03:00.490> up<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:00.970> side<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.180> the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
then to cross up on that side of the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.510 
then to cross up on that side of the
board<00:03:01.420> have<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.630> board<00:03:01.840> room<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.320> turn<00:03:02.530> like

board have the board room to turn like

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.060 
board have the board room to turn like
this<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.959> don't<00:03:05.140> cross<00:03:05.800> them<00:03:06.100> over<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:07.180> board

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
this so don't cross them over the board

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.600 
this so don't cross them over the board
180<00:03:09.180> drive<00:03:10.180> step<00:03:10.540> give<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.350> board<00:03:11.590> more<00:03:12.340> than

180 drive step give the board more than
a<00:03:12.700> 180<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.450> have<00:03:13.540> room<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.930> cross<00:03:14.260> at<00:03:14.560> the

a 180 so you have room to cross at the
car<00:03:15.360> more<00:03:16.360> than<00:03:16.630> 180<00:03:17.110> let's<00:03:17.620> cross<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.100> street
