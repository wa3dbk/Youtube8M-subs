00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.890 
McManaman the new signing again I
thought<00:01:32.700> showed<00:01:32.939> glimpses<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> first

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
thought showed glimpses in the first

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.530 
thought showed glimpses in the first
half<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.350> heavy<00:01:34.920> skills<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.430> I'm<00:01:35.790> sure<00:01:35.970> he'd

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
half of heavy skills and I'm sure he'd

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.730 
half of heavy skills and I'm sure he'd
only<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.810> better<00:01:36.930> when<00:01:37.170> he<00:01:37.229> when<00:01:37.650> he<00:01:37.710> gets

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
only get better when he when he gets

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.590 
only get better when he when he gets
another<00:01:38.009> team<00:01:38.220> apparently<00:01:38.520> he's<00:01:38.670> been<00:01:38.790> ill<00:01:38.970> so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
another team apparently he's been ill so

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.350 
another team apparently he's been ill so
he<00:01:39.990> won<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> ideal<00:01:40.979> situation<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
he won the ideal situation is going to

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.210 
he won the ideal situation is going to
but<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.720> think<00:01:43.290> when<00:01:43.470> they<00:01:43.619> now<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> be

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
but I think when they now going to be

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.370 
but I think when they now going to be
very<00:01:44.579> important<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.299> any<00:01:45.720> piercing<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.170> going

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
very important to any piercing is going

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.020 
very important to any piercing is going
to<00:01:46.439> want<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.799> think<00:01:47.250> at<00:01:47.340> least<00:01:47.460> two<00:01:47.729> more<00:01:47.880> new

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to want I think at least two more new

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.020 
to want I think at least two more new
faces<00:01:48.420> ideally<00:01:49.259> three<00:01:49.729> assessing<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
faces ideally three assessing on the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.050 
faces ideally three assessing on the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
bench Julian lescott at left-back is it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.359

was<00:01:54.180> quite<00:01:54.960> disjointed<00:01:55.590> won<00:01:55.740> t<00:01:55.860> really<00:01:56.040> yeah

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
was quite disjointed won t really yeah

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.440 
was quite disjointed won t really yeah
it<00:01:56.549> was<00:01:56.670> almost<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.030> mean<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.360> mysterious

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it was almost I mean the more mysterious

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.270 
it was almost I mean the more mysterious
person<00:01:57.990> could<00:01:58.110> think<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.320> he<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:59.070> trying<00:01:59.250> to
