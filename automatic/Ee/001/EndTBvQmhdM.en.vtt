00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.480
 for a long time the samples regretted 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.360
 now the last premiere of this season takes place in the lower city 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.360
 Now I'm sitting here with the broom right now 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.359
 the members of the dance theater not in sight 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.550
 surely there is always 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550
 again, St's movements are visible 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.400
 A piece of time is meant as well, the piece shows the puppet theater spends 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.570
 that's about an hour's practice time 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.000
 and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 the time is processed differently so 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.760
 we work with delays the accelerations with canons 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.250
 around in every scene is like that 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.310
 then decided to jerk it off if it does not 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.050
 it is not a scientific treatise and neither is it any 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.830
 Philosophy over Sun is only ca Stotel no longer a guide 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.370
 that this is an issue for you to be able to do with this many music 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.620
 that the dancers dance 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.020
 around and 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.510
 The dancers are also the time measurement with which I want to play 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.240
 I hope that communicates too 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.670
 is also the web the movements of dancers differently perceive 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 depending on what time background they run to his car 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.530
 the COR 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.729
 she has with her colors opponents occupied to the stud to 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.880
 should reach 60 cents time 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.130
 Sheen had no one suspected against each other 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.130
 to make Dres look different 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.809
 So, who the music is very diverse is all IKG actually today 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:22.499
 what about me 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.509
 and she is irritated with pieces of music that they are different in part 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:28.479
 the army regular 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:31.039
 that fits very strict 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.179
 almost at the same time Suresh 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:37.549
 how do you say like a 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.029
 A metronome, actually, is not nearly the metronome with music 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:42.709
 expires 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.709
 Parnassus is then again a victory that is very free 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.239
 to its rhythm 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.309
 and not these opposites 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.309
 more is required 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.799
 where children to keep the balance between Rheine and dance and theater 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.259
 print 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.769
 Openness is 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.889
 Draghi by Johan Inger 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.929
 he had invited to come to Mr. 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.019
 And that's a frighteningly high hurdle 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.449
 Red for polishing sources 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.449
 and there is a piece of Arvo PÃ¤rt inside too 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.469
 it's a crazy story 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.329
 no more 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.169
 after that it acts 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.089
 it is a tough one 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:33.469
 Swedish bogs 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.579
 really beautifull 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.259
 committed to the law 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.219
 several stages 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.459
 I am very proud it is also third 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.690
 the new ballet of the State Opera 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.620
 demanding but also in the tunnel
