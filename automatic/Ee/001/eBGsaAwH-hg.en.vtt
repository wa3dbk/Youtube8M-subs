00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.690

that's<00:07:01.030> how<00:07:01.210> that<00:07:01.270> would<00:07:01.540> work<00:07:01.600> I<00:07:02.700> would

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
that's how that would work I would

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.720 
that's how that would work I would
prefer<00:07:04.030> it<00:07:04.270> to<00:07:04.480> happen<00:07:04.660> that<00:07:04.990> way<00:07:05.110> next<00:07:05.320> time

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
prefer it to happen that way next time

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.150 
prefer it to happen that way next time

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
assuming there is more evil wizards to

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.240 
assuming there is more evil wizards to
