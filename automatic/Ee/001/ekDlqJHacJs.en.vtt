one of my favorite parts about this is

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.979 
one of my favorite parts about this is
how<00:03:11.310> many<00:03:11.579> figures<00:03:11.939> you<00:03:12.090> can<00:03:12.180> fit<00:03:12.569> in<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
how many figures you can fit in the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.750 
how many figures you can fit in the
actual<00:03:13.560> vehicle<00:03:14.099> you<00:03:14.159> can<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.489> can<00:03:14.609> fit

both<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.970> characters<00:03:15.510> are<00:03:15.629> getting<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.930> set

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
both the characters are getting this set

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.259 
both the characters are getting this set
very<00:03:16.829> easily<00:03:17.129> but<00:03:17.459> they<00:03:17.549> didn't<00:03:17.729> have<00:03:17.879> such<00:03:18.180> as

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
very easily but they didn't have such as

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.539 
very easily but they didn't have such as
so<00:03:18.629> much<00:03:18.780> armor<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.530> accessories<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:20.370> them

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
you could probably fit maybe three or

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.140 
you could probably fit maybe three or
four<00:03:22.229> more<00:03:22.829> nindroids<00:03:23.430> inside<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:23.940> thing

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
over here is pretty simple and design it

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.990 
over here is pretty simple and design it
has<00:03:31.530> some<00:03:31.739> nice<00:03:31.889> articulations<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.760> two

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
points right there you have a kind of

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.319 
points right there you have a kind of
shield<00:03:35.099> looking<00:03:35.400> piece<00:03:35.609> of<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.879> hero<00:03:36.150> factory

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
brick being used as a sword right there

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.740 
brick being used as a sword right there
which<00:03:38.069> is<00:03:38.220> pretty<00:03:38.430> cool<00:03:38.699> but<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.239> second<00:03:39.599> arm

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
which is pretty cool but the second arm

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.030 
which is pretty cool but the second arm
here<00:03:40.019> definitely<00:03:40.229> seems<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> little<00:03:40.709> bit<00:03:40.889> more

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
here definitely seems a little bit more

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.770 
here definitely seems a little bit more
effective<00:03:41.489> in<00:03:41.639> my<00:03:41.760> opinion<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:42.269> has<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.510> same

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
effective in my opinion it has the same

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.149 
effective in my opinion it has the same
amount<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.019> articulation<00:03:43.769> if<00:03:43.859> you<00:03:43.979> have<00:03:44.129> a

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
amount of articulation if you have a

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.649 
amount of articulation if you have a
really<00:03:44.639> cool<00:03:44.790> saw<00:03:45.000> blade<00:03:45.269> with<00:03:45.389> a<00:03:45.419> nice

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
really cool saw blade with a nice

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.390 
really cool saw blade with a nice
spinning<00:03:46.169> feature<00:03:46.379> right<00:03:46.620> there<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.340> don't

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
spinning feature right there and I don't

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.649 
spinning feature right there and I don't
know<00:03:47.549> if<00:03:47.609> there's<00:03:47.729> an<00:03:47.819> intentional<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.419> Lycos

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
know if there's an intentional and Lycos

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.539 
know if there's an intentional and Lycos
part<00:03:48.900> but<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.109> can<00:03:49.290> adjust<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:50.040> length<00:03:50.340> of

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
part but you can adjust the length of

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:51.979 
part but you can adjust the length of

talk<00:04:00.840> about<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.260> basically<00:04:01.470> when<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.400> roll

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
talk about is basically when you roll

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.439 
talk about is basically when you roll
this<00:04:02.669> thing<00:04:02.849> on<00:04:02.939> the<00:04:03.060> ground

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
this thing on the ground

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.030

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
look at those blades they just move up

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.740 
look at those blades they just move up
and<00:04:05.159> down<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.579> really<00:04:05.909> simple<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:06.540> works

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
and down it's really simple but it works

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.809

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
well and there's no problems with that

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.429 
well and there's no problems with that
feature<00:04:09.000> unlike<00:04:09.629> some<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:10.049> these<00:04:10.139> new<00:04:10.319> new

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
feature unlike some of these new new

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.469 
feature unlike some of these new new
jackets<00:04:10.829> it's<00:04:11.069> our<00:04:11.489> second<00:04:12.000> play<00:04:12.150> features

you pay close attention to those bricks

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.140 
you pay close attention to those bricks
right<00:04:16.500> there<00:04:16.799> basically<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.519> can<00:04:17.820> see<00:04:17.970> them
