00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello comrades tankers with you 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.580
 flum killed the cargo house and why 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.500
 you sad you ask me i will say and i 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.160
 opened itself bought a royal tiger 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.220
 And what's wrong with that as if you so 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.289
 say so without a pure Russian 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.320
 select 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.630
 so without knowing what I did 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.199
 such a small thread and video such 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 small video so you understand that I 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.850
 I want to show and what will be indecent 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.850
 talk on the air 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.450
 if suddenly someone did not guess what I 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.040
 hinting let's show you one picture 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.710
 that's exactly how I imagine 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.690
 royal now this 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.940
 this heaps of dynamite a bunch of explosives on 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.770
 caterpillars right now as it was in this 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.070
 my little video ends 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.680
 absolutely every fight for every hit 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.259
 into a tiger in almost any part of it 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.350
 probably except for the upper frontal part 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.590
 there is 150 millimeters at an angle it will 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.630
 detonate i tried experimenting 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.880
 there to reduce the amount of ammunition he 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.200
 still explodes the best he 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.060
 just burns and so just a blast of a bull 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.610
 Well, of course the main problem is that 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.530
 he is very badly armored tower 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.630
 there are only 100 millimeters of armor 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.640
 Of course there is nothing that is, the opponents 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.190
 breakdown 100 millimeters and above have 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.080
 is always 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.060
 I really hope that the situation is dramatic 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.270
 change on the next king tiger 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.039
 because there are already 180 in the forehead of the tower 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.590
 millimeters 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.890
 of course not so much but I really hope 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.780
 that he stops exploding it's just 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.950
 disaster mate i don't see any 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.590
 sense to play this tank would be shorter 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.019
 10 what's next is better, but here itâ€™s just 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.250
 the trouble is utterly impossible on it there 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.250
 to trade pasha 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.840
 put the stick out shoot if 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.470
 to you in the area it became you 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.489
 will explode 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.760
 and you play this sadness full just in 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.700
 shocked by this royal tiger i'm not 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.700
 I know why he is needed 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.569
 but in general I would say 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.390
 it yourself saw it sadness with you was 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.390
 house don't play tiger yet
