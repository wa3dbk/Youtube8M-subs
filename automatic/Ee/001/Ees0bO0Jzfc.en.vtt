00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
so I've got some of the data from the

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.070 
so I've got some of the data from the
Irish<00:00:01.709> giant<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.220> show<00:00:02.370> you<00:00:02.429> and<00:00:02.939> there's<00:00:03.899> the

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
Irish giant to show you and there's the

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.950 
Irish giant to show you and there's the
image<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.560> skull

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.420 

Wow<00:00:10.469> it's<00:00:11.469> really<00:00:11.740> beautiful<00:00:12.129> scandalous

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
Wow it's really beautiful scandalous

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.130 
Wow it's really beautiful scandalous
here<00:00:15.430> Martha<00:00:15.820> we<00:00:15.910> have<00:00:16.090> some<00:00:16.420> close-up

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
here Martha we have some close-up

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.650 
here Martha we have some close-up
cross-sections<00:00:18.039> through<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:18.910> normal<00:00:19.359> skull

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
cross-sections through the normal skull

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.349 
cross-sections through the normal skull
and<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.439> Irish<00:00:20.949> giant<00:00:21.340> skull<00:00:21.609> so<00:00:22.119> that<00:00:22.270> you

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
and the Irish giant skull so that you

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.150 
and the Irish giant skull so that you
can<00:00:22.539> see<00:00:22.689> the<00:00:22.810> differences<00:00:23.410> in<00:00:23.619> shape<00:00:23.919> and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
can see the differences in shape and

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.569 
can see the differences in shape and
size<00:00:25.079> yes<00:00:26.079> you<00:00:26.289> see<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:26.710> enormous<00:00:27.160> difference

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
size yes you see the enormous difference

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.120 
size yes you see the enormous difference
not<00:00:28.300> just<00:00:28.359> in<00:00:28.749> the<00:00:28.869> size<00:00:29.140> which<00:00:29.800> is<00:00:29.949> quite

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
not just in the size which is quite

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.700 
not just in the size which is quite
obvious<00:00:30.579> but<00:00:31.060> for<00:00:31.570> example<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.140> sickness<00:00:32.380> of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
obvious but for example the sickness of

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.890 
obvious but for example the sickness of
the<00:00:32.739> bone<00:00:33.010> if<00:00:33.280> you<00:00:33.430> look<00:00:33.610> at<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.910> bone<00:00:34.329> here

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
the bone if you look at the bone here

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.900 
the bone if you look at the bone here
and<00:00:35.020> then<00:00:35.560> the<00:00:35.680> sickness<00:00:36.040> of<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.220> bone<00:00:36.489> here

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
and then the sickness of the bone here

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.910 
and then the sickness of the bone here
you<00:00:37.300> see<00:00:38.039> the<00:00:39.039> great<00:00:39.609> difference<00:00:39.930> also<00:00:40.930> the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
you see the great difference also the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.369 
you see the great difference also the
size<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.579> frontal<00:00:42.969> sinuses<00:00:43.570> these<00:00:44.079> two

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
size of the frontal sinuses these two

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.099 
size of the frontal sinuses these two
holes<00:00:44.680> here<00:00:44.859> are<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.910> frontal<00:00:46.300> sinuses<00:00:46.899> of

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
holes here are the frontal sinuses of

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.790 
holes here are the frontal sinuses of
the<00:00:47.649> normal<00:00:48.609> scar<00:00:48.910> while<00:00:49.510> this<00:00:50.050> area<00:00:50.620> which

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
the normal scar while this area which

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.029 
the normal scar while this area which
I'm<00:00:51.010> just<00:00:51.390> showing<00:00:52.390> you<00:00:52.570> now<00:00:52.780> all<00:00:53.289> this<00:00:53.800> big

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
I'm just showing you now all this big

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.490 
I'm just showing you now all this big
area<00:00:54.550> this<00:00:54.730> is<00:00:54.789> all<00:00:55.179> the<00:00:55.390> frontal<00:00:55.809> sinus<00:00:55.840> so

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
area this is all the frontal sinus so

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.490 
area this is all the frontal sinus so
compared<00:00:57.129> that<00:00:57.489> size<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.660> this<00:00:58.809> size<00:00:58.870> you<00:00:59.289> see

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
compared that size to this size you see

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.530 
compared that size to this size you see
the<00:00:59.679> enormous<00:01:00.579> difference<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:02.079> then<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:04.300> the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
the enormous difference and then of the

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.240 
the enormous difference and then of the
medical<00:01:04.870> point<00:01:05.050> of<00:01:05.230> view<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.470> most<00:01:05.710> important

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
medical point of view the most important

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.070 
medical point of view the most important
difference<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.850> size<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.900> pituitary

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
difference is the size of the pituitary

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.320 
difference is the size of the pituitary
fossa<00:01:08.500> so<00:01:09.010> you<00:01:09.070> see<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.610> pituitary<00:01:09.820> fossa

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
fossa so you see the pituitary fossa

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.280 
fossa so you see the pituitary fossa
here<00:01:10.960> which<00:01:11.680> is<00:01:11.860> like<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:13.630> pocket<00:01:13.900> and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
here which is like a little pocket and

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.340 
here which is like a little pocket and
inside<00:01:15.070> this<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.570> pituitary<00:01:16.750> gland<00:01:17.200> is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
inside this as the pituitary gland is

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.499 
inside this as the pituitary gland is
sitting<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.009> then<00:01:18.310> you<00:01:18.460> see<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:19.030> on<00:01:19.299> this

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
sitting and then you see that on this

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.770 
sitting and then you see that on this
skull<00:01:20.439> the<00:01:20.710> PT<00:01:20.890> tree<00:01:21.189> face<00:01:21.430> is<00:01:21.759> much<00:01:22.090> larger

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
skull the PT tree face is much larger

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.039 
skull the PT tree face is much larger
it's<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.320> wider<00:01:23.590> it's<00:01:24.100> longer<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.570> it<00:01:25.810> looks

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
it's a wider it's longer and it looks

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.090 
it's a wider it's longer and it looks
actually<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.009> bit<00:01:27.340> shallow<00:01:28.770> shallower<00:01:29.770> but

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
actually a bit shallow shallower but

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.950 
actually a bit shallow shallower but
that's<00:01:30.280> because<00:01:30.490> we<00:01:30.820> don't<00:01:31.119> see<00:01:31.390> these<00:01:31.600> two

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
that's because we don't see these two

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.050 
that's because we don't see these two
bits<00:01:32.229> of<00:01:32.409> bones<00:01:32.680> here<00:01:33.070> it's<00:01:33.490> actually<00:01:33.640> missing

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
bits of bones here it's actually missing

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.780 
bits of bones here it's actually missing
but<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:34.990> see<00:01:35.229> that<00:01:35.469> there<00:01:35.920> is<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:36.100> quite<00:01:36.759> a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
but you see that there is a quite a

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.100 
but you see that there is a quite a
large<00:01:37.320> object<00:01:38.320> was<00:01:39.040> sitting<00:01:39.430> here<00:01:39.820> at<00:01:40.509> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
large object was sitting here at the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.800 
large object was sitting here at the
time<00:01:41.380> when<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.009> patient<00:01:42.189> was<00:01:42.520> alive<00:01:42.790> so<00:01:43.149> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
time when the patient was alive so the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.709 
time when the patient was alive so the
the<00:01:44.259> enlarged<00:01:44.590> sinuses<00:01:45.310> probably<00:01:45.790> gave<00:01:46.329> him<00:01:46.360> a

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
the enlarged sinuses probably gave him a

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.789 
the enlarged sinuses probably gave him a
very<00:01:46.899> very<00:01:47.619> deep<00:01:47.860> voice<00:01:48.719> he<00:01:49.719> he<00:01:50.170> may<00:01:50.409> have<00:01:50.439> had

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
very very deep voice he he may have had

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.770 
very very deep voice he he may have had
some<00:01:50.860> problems<00:01:51.280> with<00:01:51.670> infections<00:01:52.479> in<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
some problems with infections in the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.529 
some problems with infections in the
sinuses<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.219> very<00:01:54.460> possible<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:55.000> he<00:01:55.180> died

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
sinuses it is very possible that he died

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.109 
sinuses it is very possible that he died
of<00:01:55.570> TB<00:01:56.159> however<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:58.479> he<00:01:58.539> had<00:01:58.869> TB<00:01:59.140> his<00:02:00.119> ability

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
of TB however if he had TB his ability

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.090 
of TB however if he had TB his ability
to<00:02:01.149> cope<00:02:01.570> with<00:02:01.780> an<00:02:01.899> infection<00:02:02.530> would<00:02:02.920> have

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
to cope with an infection would have

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.870 
to cope with an infection would have
been<00:02:03.340> affected<00:02:04.030> by<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.710> lack<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.670> other

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
been affected by the lack of the other

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.760 
been affected by the lack of the other
pituitary<00:02:07.450> hormones<00:02:07.899> but<00:02:08.500> what<00:02:08.649> is

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
pituitary hormones but what is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.170 
pituitary hormones but what is
interesting<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:10.650> if<00:02:11.650> John<00:02:12.580> Hunter<00:02:13.030> would

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
interesting that if John Hunter would

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.430 
interesting that if John Hunter would
have<00:02:13.360> opened<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.900> skull<00:02:14.200> and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
have opened the skull and

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.350 
have opened the skull and
would<00:02:14.500> have<00:02:14.650> recognized<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.880> there<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.210> an

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
would have recognized that there is an
