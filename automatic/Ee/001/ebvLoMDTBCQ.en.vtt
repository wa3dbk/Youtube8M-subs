how to multiply 2-digit numbers by a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.430 
how to multiply 2-digit numbers by a
single<00:00:11.099> digit<00:00:11.519> number<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.750> not<00:00:13.259> as

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
single digit number this is not as

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.440 
single digit number this is not as
difficult<00:00:13.469> as<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.130> sounds<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.639> can<00:00:15.000> do<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.330> in

your head ah there's some basic

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.970 
your head ah there's some basic
multiplication<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.710> do<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
multiplication you have to do and you

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.609 
multiplication you have to do and you
have<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.369> some<00:00:20.520> addition<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.060> your<00:00:21.180> head

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
have to do some addition in your head

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.279 
have to do some addition in your head
you<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.949> do<00:00:23.189> these<00:00:23.369> quickly<00:00:23.850> though<00:00:24.140> let's<00:00:25.140> go

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
you can do these quickly though let's go

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.480 
you can do these quickly though let's go
ahead<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.500> get<00:00:25.680> started<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.130> simple

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
ahead and get started with simple

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.990 
ahead and get started with simple
example<00:00:27.060> let's<00:00:27.630> say<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.869> had<00:00:27.990> 23<00:00:28.470> times<00:00:28.710> 3<00:00:29.099> you

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
example let's say we had 23 times 3 you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.759 
example let's say we had 23 times 3 you
do<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> same<00:00:30.630> way<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.109> was<00:00:31.349> doing<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
do it the same way that I was doing the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.200 
do it the same way that I was doing the
addition<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.520> before<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.540> start<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> left

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
addition it before you start at the left

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.490 
addition it before you start at the left
so<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.350> 2<00:00:38.250> times<00:00:38.550> 3<00:00:38.969> which<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.329> six<00:00:39.809> now

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
so you have a 2 times 3 which is six now

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.170 
so you have a 2 times 3 which is six now
where<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.710> place<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.610> ones<00:00:41.850> digit

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
where you place this the ones digit

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.250 
where you place this the ones digit
needs<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> for<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:43.890> answer<00:00:44.309> ah<00:00:45.260> which

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
needs to go to for your answer ah which

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.950 
needs to go to for your answer ah which
we<00:00:46.500> only<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.190> adds<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:48.059> number<00:00:48.420> six

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
we only have one adds one number six

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.260 
we only have one adds one number six
that's<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> ones<00:00:49.920> digit<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.850> needs<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> go

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that's the ones digit it needs to go

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.270 
that's the ones digit it needs to go
directly<00:00:51.750> beneath<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.590> tens<00:00:52.980> digit<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.989> the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
directly beneath the tens digit on the

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
directly beneath the tens digit on the
two-digit<00:00:56.280> number<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.809> place<00:00:58.170> our<00:00:58.379> six

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
two-digit number so we place our six

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.900 
two-digit number so we place our six
there<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.160> then<00:00:59.520> we<00:01:00.109> carry<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.280> three

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
there and then we carry on we have three

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.899 
there and then we carry on we have three
times<00:01:03.270> three<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.320> nine<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.729> gives

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
times three which is nine and that gives

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.600 
times three which is nine and that gives
us<00:01:06.060> our<00:01:06.240> answer<00:01:06.270> 69<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> simple<00:01:08.340> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
us our answer 69 that was a simple that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.899 
us our answer 69 that was a simple that
example<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:09.990> let's<00:01:10.369> boost<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.790> little

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
example now let's boost it up a little

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.190 
example now let's boost it up a little
bit<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.290> three<00:01:13.560> times<00:01:13.770> 41<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
bit we have three times 41 so we do the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
bit we have three times 41 so we do the
same<00:01:16.380> thing<00:01:16.680> three<00:01:16.890> times<00:01:17.009> four<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.460> twelve

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
same thing three times four is twelve

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.179 
same thing three times four is twelve
now<00:01:18.659> remember<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> ones<00:01:19.470> digit<00:01:19.680> needs<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> be

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
now remember the ones digit needs to be

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.770 
now remember the ones digit needs to be
straight<00:01:20.460> down<00:01:20.640> below<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.630> go<00:01:21.750> ahead

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
straight down below here so we go ahead

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.800 
straight down below here so we go ahead
and<00:01:22.020> put<00:01:22.350> 12<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.390> mind<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.780> always

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and put 12 there and in my mind I always

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960 
and put 12 there and in my mind I always
leave<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.409> blank<00:01:25.830> spot<00:01:26.130> there<00:01:26.369> yeah<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.700> hard

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
leave a blank spot there yeah it's hard

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.960 
leave a blank spot there yeah it's hard
to<00:01:27.090> describe<00:01:27.380> it's<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.710> empty<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.189> know<00:01:29.369> where

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
to describe it's just empty I know where

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.700 
to describe it's just empty I know where
the<00:01:30.090> numbers<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.570> supposed<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> go<00:01:31.049> when<00:01:31.680> you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the numbers are supposed to go when you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
the numbers are supposed to go when you
practice<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.790> practice<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.420> in

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
practice this and practice this in

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.069 
practice this and practice this in
practice<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.229> eventually<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.100> clicks

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
practice this eventually it clicks

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.990 
practice this eventually it clicks
hopefully<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.799> does<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.369> guys<00:01:38.579> too<00:01:38.790> ah

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
hopefully it does with you guys too ah

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.620 
hopefully it does with you guys too ah
and<00:01:39.840> then<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.470> move<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.280> next<00:01:41.630> section

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and then we move on to the next section

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
and then we move on to the next section
of<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.530> our<00:01:43.680> 12<00:01:43.890> there<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.130> our<00:01:44.250> blank

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
of it we have our 12 there in our blank

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.149 
of it we have our 12 there in our blank
spot<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.570> 1<00:01:45.750> times<00:01:45.930> 3<00:01:46.380> which<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.710> three

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
spot so we have 1 times 3 which is three

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.450 
spot so we have 1 times 3 which is three
and<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:48.090> gives<00:01:48.270> us<00:01:48.420> our<00:01:48.600> answer<00:01:48.630> 41<00:01:49.470> times<00:01:49.890> 3

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and that gives us our answer 41 times 3

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.609 
and that gives us our answer 41 times 3
is<00:01:51.140> 123<00:01:52.140> ah<00:01:53.299> now<00:01:54.299> here's<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.409> little

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
is 123 ah now here's one that's a little

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.630 
is 123 ah now here's one that's a little
bit<00:01:55.799> harder<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.159> you'll<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.520> I'm

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
bit harder and you'll see what I'm

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 
bit harder and you'll see what I'm
talking<00:01:56.670> about<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.450> addition<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.649> not

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
talking about with addition this is not

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.639 
talking about with addition this is not
as<00:01:59.189> scary<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.909> sounds<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.350> to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
as scary as it sounds but you have to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.780 
as scary as it sounds but you have to
practice<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.930> we<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.530> 5<00:02:05.130> times<00:02:05.399> 7<00:02:05.579> which

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
practice this we have a 5 times 7 which

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.280 
practice this we have a 5 times 7 which
is<00:02:06.000> 35

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
is 35

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.190 
is 35
so<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.369> go<00:02:08.460> ahead<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.790> put<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.509> we

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
so we go ahead and put that there and we

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.910 
so we go ahead and put that there and we
leave<00:02:10.440> our<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.310> blank<00:02:11.520> spot<00:02:11.760> there<00:02:11.970> and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
leave our little blank spot there and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.820 
leave our little blank spot there and
then<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.190> have<00:02:14.460> 6<00:02:14.850> times<00:02:15.060> 7<00:02:15.330> which<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.750> 42<00:02:16.500> and

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
then we have 6 times 7 which is 42 and

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.630 
then we have 6 times 7 which is 42 and
how<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:17.700> works<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.120> my<00:02:18.240> brain<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:19.490> I<00:02:20.490> just

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
how this works in my brain is I just

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.580 
how this works in my brain is I just
think<00:02:21.120> 35<00:02:22.880> let<00:02:23.880> me<00:02:24.000> write<00:02:24.180> my<00:02:24.210> 42<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.200> we<00:02:25.440> have

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
think 35 let me write my 42 here we have

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.830 
think 35 let me write my 42 here we have
40<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.700> I'm<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.210> put<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.450> two<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
40 and I'm going to put the two in the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.450 
40 and I'm going to put the two in the
blank<00:02:28.110> spot<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:29.190> think<00:02:29.340> 35<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.690> plus<00:02:31.590> 4<00:02:32.010> 39

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
blank spot I just think 35 of plus 4 39

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.610 
blank spot I just think 35 of plus 4 39
and<00:02:33.210> then<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.320> stick<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> two<00:02:35.460> at<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.640> end<00:02:36.620> but

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
and then I stick the two at the end but

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.860 
and then I stick the two at the end but
what's<00:02:37.890> actually<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.240> you've<00:02:39.660> got

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
what's actually going on is you've got

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.580 
what's actually going on is you've got
350<00:02:40.620> plus<00:02:41.160> 42<00:02:41.660> it's<00:02:42.660> just<00:02:43.020> in<00:02:43.230> my<00:02:43.260> brain<00:02:43.560> that

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
350 plus 42 it's just in my brain that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.910 
350 plus 42 it's just in my brain that
works<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:45.350> 35<00:02:47.900> 4235<00:02:48.900> plus<00:02:49.470> fours<00:02:49.950> 39

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
works like that 35 4235 plus fours 39

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.910 
works like that 35 4235 plus fours 39
and<00:02:52.940> then<00:02:53.940> stick<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.780> attend<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.320> that

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
and then stick the to attend and that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.350 
and then stick the to attend and that
gives<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.310> answer<00:02:56.610> that's<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:57.000> really

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
gives you the answer that's a really

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.330 
gives you the answer that's a really
strange<00:02:57.720> looking<00:02:58.170> three<00:02:58.500> i<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:58.890> drew<00:02:59.070> there

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
strange looking three i just drew there

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.949 
strange looking three i just drew there
i<00:02:59.550> just<00:02:59.970> want<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.209> point<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.540> out<00:03:00.600> for

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
i just want to point that out for

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.979 
i just want to point that out for
everyone<00:03:01.140> ah<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.090> hardest<00:03:03.239> example<00:03:03.870> you

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
everyone ah and the hardest example you

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.510 
everyone ah and the hardest example you
can<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.350> on<00:03:04.590> something<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.310> and

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
can have on something like this and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.890 
can have on something like this and
actually<00:03:05.730> there's<00:03:06.180> tricks<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.630> make<00:03:06.750> this

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
actually there's tricks to make this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.550 
actually there's tricks to make this
even<00:03:07.110> easier<00:03:07.380> than<00:03:08.130> then<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.270> but<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.959> just

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
even easier than then it is but I just

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.900 
even easier than then it is but I just
want<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.830> make<00:03:10.920> sure<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.100> showed<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.610> something

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
want to make sure I showed you something

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.380 
want to make sure I showed you something
that<00:03:12.090> looks<00:03:12.570> supremely<00:03:12.959> difficult<00:03:13.550> 9<00:03:14.550> x<00:03:14.880> 99

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
that looks supremely difficult 9 x 99

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.810 
that looks supremely difficult 9 x 99
obviously<00:03:16.350> there's<00:03:16.590> no<00:03:16.650> numbers<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.700> are

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
obviously there's no numbers that are

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.330 
obviously there's no numbers that are
higher<00:03:18.060> than<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.739> while<00:03:19.739> keeping<00:03:20.010> with<00:03:20.310> our

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
higher than that while keeping with our

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.720 
higher than that while keeping with our
rules<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:21.000> single-digit<00:03:22.459> times<00:03:23.459> at

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
rules of single-digit times at

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.979 
rules of single-digit times at
double-digit<00:03:24.739> so<00:03:25.739> nine<00:03:26.100> times<00:03:26.130> nine<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.989> 81

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
double-digit so nine times nine is 81

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.100 
double-digit so nine times nine is 81
and<00:03:28.560> we<00:03:29.130> leave<00:03:29.340> our<00:03:29.489> blank<00:03:29.760> spot<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.330> then

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
and we leave our blank spot and then

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.940 
and we leave our blank spot and then
nine<00:03:31.440> times<00:03:31.680> nine<00:03:31.860> again<00:03:32.220> is<00:03:32.600> also<00:03:33.600> 81<00:03:34.200> we

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
nine times nine again is also 81 we

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.160 
nine times nine again is also 81 we
leave<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.340> blank<00:03:35.580> spot<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.780> gives<00:03:36.959> us

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
leave the blank spot and that gives us

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.320 
leave the blank spot and that gives us
the<00:03:37.350> answer<00:03:38.330> 891<00:03:39.330> ah<00:03:40.459> that's<00:03:41.459> all<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.000> have<00:03:42.180> to

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
the answer 891 ah that's all you have to

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.680 
the answer 891 ah that's all you have to
do<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:44.030> but<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.150> need<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.450> practice

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
do for that but you need to practice

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.620 
do for that but you need to practice
practice<00:03:46.290> practice<00:03:47.000> until<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.090> can<00:03:48.180> do<00:03:48.450> these

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
practice practice until you can do these

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.620 
practice practice until you can do these
in<00:03:48.810> your<00:03:48.900> sleep<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.040> not<00:03:50.400> hard<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:51.000> multiply

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
in your sleep it is not hard to multiply

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.080 
in your sleep it is not hard to multiply
these<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:52.140> your<00:03:52.590> head<00:03:52.860> but<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.280> need<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.940> be

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
these in your head but you need to be

these in your head but you need to be
able<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.570> do<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.080> move<00:03:55.320> on<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:56.430> more

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
able to do it to move on to more

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.020 
able to do it to move on to more
