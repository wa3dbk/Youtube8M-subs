but that's not what it's about today

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.660 
but that's not what it's about today
we're<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.199> talk<00:00:16.379> about<00:00:16.590> documentary<00:00:17.520> I

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
we're going to talk about documentary I

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.080 
we're going to talk about documentary I
saw<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:18.300> not<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.619> weight<00:00:19.949> loss<00:00:20.279> or<00:00:20.670> weight

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
saw on not really weight loss or weight

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.429 
saw on not really weight loss or weight
gain<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.869> about<00:00:22.199> how<00:00:22.800> why<00:00:23.189> why<00:00:23.580> some<00:00:24.000> people

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
gain it's about how why why some people

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.429 
gain it's about how why why some people
who<00:00:25.439> are<00:00:25.619> offend<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:26.699> whatever<00:00:27.480> height<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
who are offend or whatever height and

who are offend or whatever height and
weight<00:00:28.710> they<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.130> how<00:00:29.730> come<00:00:30.060> they<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.300> do

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
weight they are how come they just do

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.530 
weight they are how come they just do
not<00:00:31.109> no<00:00:31.679> matter<00:00:31.830> what<00:00:32.219> they<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.460> they<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.149> do

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
not no matter what they do they just do

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.130 
not no matter what they do they just do
not<00:00:33.570> gain<00:00:34.079> weight<00:00:34.730> now<00:00:35.730> some<00:00:36.690> people<00:00:36.809> who<00:00:37.079> are

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
not gain weight now some people who are

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410 
not gain weight now some people who are
watching<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.620> probably<00:00:38.160> can't<00:00:39.120> gain<00:00:39.390> weight

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
watching this probably can't gain weight

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.590 
watching this probably can't gain weight
very<00:00:39.899> easily<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:41.670> they're<00:00:42.420> probably

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
very easily and they're probably

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
very easily and they're probably
wondering<00:00:42.870> well<00:00:43.200> house<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.739> possible<00:00:44.309> i'm

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
wondering well house is possible i'm

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.440 
wondering well house is possible i'm
going<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> break<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.820> down<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.180> at<00:00:45.300> least

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
going to break it down to you at least

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.479 
going to break it down to you at least
from<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.840> i<00:00:45.899> saw<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> BBC<00:00:46.620> documentary

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
from what i saw in the BBC documentary

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.529 
from what i saw in the BBC documentary
the<00:00:47.850> other<00:00:48.000> night<00:00:48.800> what<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> found<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:51.510> be

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the other night what I found to be

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.290 
the other night what I found to be
extremely<00:00:51.870> interesting<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.010> there<00:00:53.550> seems<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
extremely interesting is there seems to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.319 
extremely interesting is there seems to
be<00:00:54.539> two<00:00:54.899> things<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.879> those<00:00:57.000> who

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
be two things going on for those who

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.360 
be two things going on for those who
just<00:00:57.750> cannot<00:00:58.199> put<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.590> any<00:00:58.739> pounds<00:00:59.100> no<00:00:59.219> matter

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
just cannot put on any pounds no matter

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.030 
just cannot put on any pounds no matter
how<00:00:59.609> much<00:00:59.820> they<00:01:00.000> try<00:01:00.739> one<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:02.219> genetics<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
how much they try one is genetics and

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.000 
how much they try one is genetics and
the<00:01:05.040> other<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:06.320> actually<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.560> touch<00:01:07.799> upon

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the other is actually they touch upon

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.010 
the other is actually they touch upon
environment<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.479> don't<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:09.810> know

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
environment and I don't really know

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
environment and I don't really know
enough<00:01:10.260> about<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> kind<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> recap

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
enough about it to kind of do the recap

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.510 
enough about it to kind of do the recap
but<00:01:12.060> I'll<00:01:12.150> talk<00:01:12.360> about<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> genetic<00:01:13.140> side

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
but I'll talk about the genetic side

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.100 
but I'll talk about the genetic side
there<00:01:14.520> seems<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.060> special<00:01:15.720> gene<00:01:15.930> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
there seems to be this special gene that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
there seems to be this special gene that
we<00:01:16.170> either<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:17.189> more<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.970> or<00:01:18.330> less<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:19.259> okay

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
we either have more of or less of okay

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
we either have more of or less of okay
and<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.520> forgot<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.119> name<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.810> look

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and I forgot the name of it you can look

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
and I forgot the name of it you can look
it<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:23.220> particular<00:01:23.640> gene<00:01:24.060> gives

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it up but this particular gene gives

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.359 
it up but this particular gene gives
people<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:24.930> myself<00:01:25.140> who<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.619> thin<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.070> have

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
people like myself who are thin and have

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.090 
people like myself who are thin and have
always<00:01:26.670> been<00:01:26.880> thin<00:01:27.409> for<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> last<00:01:28.650> 45<00:01:28.950> years

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
always been thin for the last 45 years

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.160 
always been thin for the last 45 years
I've<00:01:29.579> been<00:01:29.729> pretty<00:01:29.909> much<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> same<00:01:30.420> way<00:01:30.659> we

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
I've been pretty much the same way we

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.819 
I've been pretty much the same way we
have<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.590> gene<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.750> stops<00:01:33.750> us<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.140> eating

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
have this gene that stops us from eating

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.109 
have this gene that stops us from eating
especially<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:36.320> reach<00:01:37.320> our<00:01:37.530> limit<00:01:38.119> okay

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
especially when we reach our limit okay

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.630 
especially when we reach our limit okay
and<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:40.320> sold<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.890> or<00:01:40.950> less<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.310> it's

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
and it's sold more or less it's it's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.520 
and it's sold more or less it's it's
kind<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.509> jeans<00:01:42.750> sends<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> signal<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
kind of like the jeans sends a signal to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.679 
kind of like the jeans sends a signal to
their<00:01:43.740> brains<00:01:43.979> basically<00:01:44.579> saying<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:45.090> full

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
their brains basically saying I'm full

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.319 
their brains basically saying I'm full
please<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.200> give<00:01:46.530> me<00:01:46.740> any<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:47.189> food<00:01:47.490> but

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
please do not give me any more food but

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.260 
please do not give me any more food but
for<00:01:48.570> those<00:01:48.720> who<00:01:48.780> continue<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.950> eat<00:01:50.430> they<00:01:50.970> lack

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
for those who continue to eat they lack

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.460 
for those who continue to eat they lack
in<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.720> particular<00:01:51.960> gene<00:01:53.570> okay<00:01:54.570> they<00:01:55.170> lack

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
in that particular gene okay they lack

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.550 
in that particular gene okay they lack
of<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.860> gene<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.899> even<00:01:57.899> though<00:01:57.930> their<00:01:58.290> body

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
of that gene so even though their body

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.069 
of that gene so even though their body
is<00:01:58.799> full<00:01:59.100> they've<00:01:59.880> eaten<00:02:00.149> quote-unquote

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
is full they've eaten quote-unquote

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.950 
is full they've eaten quote-unquote
enough<00:02:01.469> food<00:02:02.119> they<00:02:03.119> don't<00:02:03.390> have<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> mechanism

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
enough food they don't have a mechanism
