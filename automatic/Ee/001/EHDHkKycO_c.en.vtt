for<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:56.860> motherboard<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:58.869> I'm<00:01:58.929> going<00:01:59.140> to

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
for the motherboard now I'm going to

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.350 
for the motherboard now I'm going to
install<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.649> H<00:01:59.739> 100<00:02:00.220> cooler<00:02:00.549> it'll<00:02:01.270> be<00:02:01.329> a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
install the H 100 cooler it'll be a

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.760 
install the H 100 cooler it'll be a
little<00:02:01.630> bit<00:02:01.720> easier<00:02:01.959> to<00:02:02.110> install<00:02:02.229> with<00:02:02.739> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
little bit easier to install with the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.109 
little bit easier to install with the
case<00:02:03.009> laying<00:02:03.280> on<00:02:03.399> its<00:02:03.549> side<00:02:03.640> since<00:02:03.970> we're

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
case laying on its side since we're

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.300 
case laying on its side since we're
going<00:02:04.209> to<00:02:04.270> do<00:02:04.390> a<00:02:04.420> push-pull<00:02:04.929> configuration

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
going to do a push-pull configuration

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.649 
going to do a push-pull configuration
I've<00:02:06.310> already<00:02:06.670> installed<00:02:06.970> two<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.450> fans

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
I've already installed two of the fans

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.389 
I've already installed two of the fans
on<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.929> H<00:02:08.049> 100<00:02:08.500> unit<00:02:08.739> which<00:02:08.890> make<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.130> little

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
on the H 100 unit which make a little

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.220 
on the H 100 unit which make a little
bit<00:02:09.519> easier<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.789> install<00:02:10.239> now<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:10.899> need<00:02:11.170> to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
bit easier to install now I just need to

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.720 
bit easier to install now I just need to
line<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.650> up<00:02:11.709> with<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.010> installation<00:02:12.549> holes

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
line it up with the installation holes

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.520 
line it up with the installation holes
on<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:12.970> top<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.299> case<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.750> tack<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.410> into

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
on the top of the case and tack it into

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.699

place<00:02:14.799> with<00:02:14.829> two<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.400> screws<00:02:16.590> we'll<00:02:17.590> do

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
place with two of the screws we'll do

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.259 
place with two of the screws we'll do
the<00:02:17.799> same<00:02:17.980> thing<00:02:18.220> with<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.459> second<00:02:18.790> fan<00:02:19.000> and

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
the same thing with the second fan and

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.390 
the same thing with the second fan and
once<00:02:20.049> it's<00:02:20.200> aligned<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.829> tacked<00:02:21.130> into<00:02:21.310> place

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
once it's aligned and tacked into place

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.520 
once it's aligned and tacked into place
we'll<00:02:22.299> finish<00:02:22.480> screwing<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.140> rest<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.440> the

our power for the fans since we have

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.729 
our power for the fans since we have
four<00:02:28.269> fans<00:02:28.540> we'll<00:02:28.810> need<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.019> use<00:02:29.049> both<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.380> Y

multiple<00:03:57.189> cards<00:04:00.659> so<00:04:01.659> all<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.840> components

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
multiple cards so all the components

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.020 
multiple cards so all the components
have<00:04:02.379> been<00:04:02.560> installed<00:04:02.889> in<00:04:03.010> our<00:04:03.069> 760<00:04:03.669> T<00:04:03.879> and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
have been installed in our 760 T and

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.479 
have been installed in our 760 T and
I've<00:04:04.090> replaced<00:04:04.719> the<00:04:04.840> side<00:04:05.079> panels<00:04:05.500> here<00:04:05.709> looks

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
I've replaced the side panels here looks

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.129 
I've replaced the side panels here looks
really<00:04:06.760> good<00:04:06.939> but<00:04:07.329> I<00:04:07.599> think<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:07.900> can<00:04:08.019> make<00:04:08.109> it

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
really good but I think we can make it

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.110 
really good but I think we can make it
look<00:04:08.319> a<00:04:08.379> lot<00:04:08.560> better<00:04:08.739> by<00:04:09.010> adding<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.549> coarser

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
look a lot better by adding a coarser

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.240 
look a lot better by adding a coarser
