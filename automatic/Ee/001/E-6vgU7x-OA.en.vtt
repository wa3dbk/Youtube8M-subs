00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.130 
it also comes with a Torx wrench here
which<00:03:07.459> has<00:03:07.670> two<00:03:07.880> different<00:03:08.209> sizes<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.930> is

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
which has two different sizes this is

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.050 
which has two different sizes this is
one<00:03:09.709> size<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.459> another<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:13.280> here

one size this is another this and here

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.280 
one size this is another this and here
is<00:03:14.269> for<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:16.690> pivot<00:03:17.690> pin<00:03:18.110> right<00:03:18.680> there<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:20.290> the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
is for the pivot pin right there and the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.500 
is for the pivot pin right there and the
smaller<00:03:21.680> end<00:03:22.040> here<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:23.230> for<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:25.209> thumb<00:03:26.209> studs

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
smaller end here is for the thumb studs

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.490 
smaller end here is for the thumb studs
if<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.890> should<00:03:28.820> decide<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.239> remove<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.320> dual

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
if you should decide to remove the dual

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.289 
if you should decide to remove the dual
thumb<00:03:30.799> studs<00:03:30.860> on<00:03:31.340> there<00:03:32.140> which<00:03:33.140> in<00:03:33.680> my<00:03:33.890> opinion

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
thumb studs on there which in my opinion

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.520 
thumb studs on there which in my opinion
that<00:03:35.299> wouldn't<00:03:35.630> be<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> good<00:03:35.840> idea<00:03:36.019> because

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
that wouldn't be a good idea because

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.710 
that wouldn't be a good idea because
you'd<00:03:36.950> have<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.130> one<00:03:37.910> heck<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.299> time<00:03:38.450> trying

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
you'd have a one heck of a time trying

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.360 
you'd have a one heck of a time trying
to<00:03:38.840> get<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.140> blade<00:03:39.440> open<00:03:41.350> now<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.410> block<00:03:43.130> up

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
to get that blade open now the block up

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.270 
to get that blade open now the block up
on<00:03:43.519> this<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:44.000> very<00:03:44.299> solid<00:03:44.660> there's<00:03:45.049> no<00:03:45.260> play<00:03:45.950> up

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
on this is very solid there's no play up

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.250 
on this is very solid there's no play up
and<00:03:46.489> down<00:03:46.670> back<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.030> forth<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:49.100> has<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> very

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
and down back and forth it has a very

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.060 
and down back and forth it has a very
solid<00:03:51.260> lock<00:03:51.709> up<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> liner<00:03:54.350> lock<00:03:54.709> with

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
solid lock up it is a liner lock with

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.789 
solid lock up it is a liner lock with
some<00:03:55.519> very<00:03:55.820> aggressive<00:03:56.359> gripping<00:03:57.200> serrations

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
some very aggressive gripping serrations

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.310 
some very aggressive gripping serrations
on<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.340> on<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:59.180> liner<00:03:59.420> lock<00:03:59.690> there<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:02.810> the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
on the on the liner lock there the the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.220 
on the on the liner lock there the the
line<00:04:03.620> up<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:05.060> centering<00:04:05.600> I<00:04:05.690> guess<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.019> should

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
line up the centering I guess I should

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.960 
line up the centering I guess I should
say<00:04:06.440> is<00:04:07.100> perfect<00:04:07.790> on<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:09.650> does<00:04:10.100> look<00:04:10.640> like

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
say is perfect on this it does look like

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.250 
say is perfect on this it does look like
it's<00:04:11.420> off<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:12.350> this<00:04:12.590> side<00:04:13.630> if<00:04:14.630> my<00:04:14.870> camera<00:04:15.200> is

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
it's off to this side if my camera is

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.710 
it's off to this side if my camera is
going<00:04:15.380> to<00:04:15.440> pick<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.769> up<00:04:15.970> but<00:04:16.970> that's<00:04:17.419> just

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
going to pick that up but that's just

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.729 
going to pick that up but that's just
the<00:04:17.959> way<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.579> blade<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.030> shaped<00:04:20.419> if<00:04:21.380> if

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
the way the the blade is shaped if if

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.430 
the way the the blade is shaped if if
you<00:04:22.039> look<00:04:22.430> at<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.669> blade<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:24.140> we<00:04:24.260> get<00:04:24.410> a

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
you look at the blade and we get a

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.730 
you look at the blade and we get a
contrasting<00:04:25.430> background<00:04:26.060> here<00:04:26.740> hopefully

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
contrasting background here hopefully

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.680 
contrasting background here hopefully
this<00:04:27.950> will<00:04:28.070> work<00:04:28.250> if<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:28.970> look<00:04:29.150> at<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.419> blade

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
this will work if you look at the blade

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.830 
this will work if you look at the blade
this<00:04:30.560> edge<00:04:31.010> is<00:04:31.370> short<00:04:31.820> our<00:04:32.090> excuse<00:04:32.720> me

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
this edge is short our excuse me

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.390 
this edge is short our excuse me
straight<00:04:33.229> this<00:04:33.919> is<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.220> straight<00:04:34.250> edge

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
straight this is a straight edge

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.730 
straight this is a straight edge
and<00:04:35.490> then<00:04:35.880> where<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.210> tapers<00:04:36.720> is<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.169> this<00:04:37.410> side

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
and then where it tapers is on this side

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.000 
and then where it tapers is on this side
in<00:04:38.070> an<00:04:38.370> angle<00:04:38.790> like<00:04:38.940> this<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.570> in<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.710> closed

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
in an angle like this so in the closed

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.310 
in an angle like this so in the closed
position<00:04:41.040> it<00:04:41.910> looks<00:04:42.270> like<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.690> centering<00:04:43.080> is

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
position it looks like the centering is

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.650 
position it looks like the centering is
off<00:04:43.530> but<00:04:43.889> it<00:04:44.010> actually<00:04:44.220> isn't<00:04:44.669> it's<00:04:45.330> just

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
off but it actually isn't it's just

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.210 
off but it actually isn't it's just
because<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:48.320> shape<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.710> blade<00:04:49.949> word

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
because of that shape of the blade word

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.040 
because of that shape of the blade word
or<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:50.820> know<00:04:50.910> that<00:04:51.150> there<00:04:51.300> were<00:04:51.419> tapers<00:04:51.930> on

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
or you know that there were tapers on

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.909 
or you know that there were tapers on
the<00:04:52.199> side<00:04:52.440> now<00:04:53.750> this<00:04:54.750> is<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.350> very<00:04:56.310> sharp<00:04:57.090> blade

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
the side now this is a very sharp blade

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.140 
the side now this is a very sharp blade
you<00:04:58.919> really<00:04:59.220> can't<00:05:00.169> you<00:05:01.169> know<00:05:01.199> cut<00:05:01.470> paper<00:05:02.150> like

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
you really can't you know cut paper like

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.969 
you really can't you know cut paper like
this<00:05:03.419> like<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:03.840> would<00:05:04.050> with<00:05:04.290> a<00:05:04.320> normal<00:05:04.380> knife

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
this like you would with a normal knife

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.830 
this like you would with a normal knife
this<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.540> basically<00:05:07.940> kind<00:05:08.940> of<00:05:09.000> like<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.180> hobby

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
this is basically kind of like a hobby

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.170 
this is basically kind of like a hobby
style<00:05:10.410> knife<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.919> guess<00:05:11.220> that's<00:05:11.580> what<00:05:11.729> I<00:05:11.760> would

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
style knife I guess that's what I would

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.409 
style knife I guess that's what I would
use<00:05:12.360> it<00:05:12.539> for<00:05:12.740> then<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:13.889> is<00:05:14.039> very<00:05:14.610> sharp<00:05:15.060> does

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
use it for then it is very sharp does

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:23.860 
use it for then it is very sharp does
have<00:05:15.630> a<00:05:15.660> great<00:05:16.199> tip<00:05:16.860> on<00:05:17.100> it<00:05:19.910> cuts<00:05:20.910> no<00:05:21.330> problem

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
have a great tip on it cuts no problem

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.719 
have a great tip on it cuts no problem
just<00:05:24.870> a<00:05:25.020> very<00:05:25.260> very<00:05:25.740> sharp<00:05:26.070> blade<00:05:26.310> oh<00:05:26.699> I

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
just a very very sharp blade oh I

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.600 
just a very very sharp blade oh I
shouldn't<00:05:27.510> say<00:05:27.570> very<00:05:28.320> sharp<00:05:28.770> but<00:05:28.949> it's<00:05:29.370> got<00:05:29.580> a

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
shouldn't say very sharp but it's got a

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.469 
shouldn't say very sharp but it's got a
good<00:05:30.090> sharpness<00:05:30.449> to<00:05:30.780> it<00:05:30.810> you<00:05:31.590> know<00:05:31.650> I<00:05:31.680> did<00:05:32.479> I've

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
good sharpness to it you know I did I've

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.300 
good sharpness to it you know I did I've
had<00:05:33.690> other<00:05:33.870> blades<00:05:34.260> that<00:05:34.440> are<00:05:34.500> much<00:05:35.070> more
