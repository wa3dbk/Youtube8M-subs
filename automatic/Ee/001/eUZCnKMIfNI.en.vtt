00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
in certain areas so hopefully hopefully

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.399 
in certain areas so hopefully hopefully
that<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:14.909> come<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:16.140> next

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that you know will come in the next

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.310 
that you know will come in the next
couple<00:01:16.560> weeks<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.720> besides<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.810> training

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
couple weeks but besides that training

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.170 
couple weeks but besides that training
is<00:01:19.500> still<00:01:19.860> doing<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> same<00:01:20.159> thing<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.640> going

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
is still doing the same thing so going

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.499 
is still doing the same thing so going
heavy<00:01:22.340> again<00:01:23.340> last<00:01:23.729> year<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.030> tried<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.330> go

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
heavy again last year I tried to go

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
light waist high reps and to be honest I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.620 
light waist high reps and to be honest I
don't<00:01:29.970> think<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> best<00:01:31.100> rank<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
don't think it was the best rank for it
