the movement of the car will be very
imperceptible<00:01:07.659> this<00:01:08.659> is<00:01:08.870> also<00:01:09.050> because<00:01:09.620> I

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
imperceptible this is also because I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.440 
imperceptible this is also because I
move<00:01:10.190> very<00:01:10.460> slowly<00:01:12.580> but<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:13.760> will<00:01:13.909> still<00:01:14.240> be

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
now you saw the big movement the big

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.899 
now you saw the big movement the big
jump<00:01:34.159> when<00:01:35.119> I<00:01:35.240> moved<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:35.719> from<00:01:35.899> pop<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:37.700> is

as<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:14.310> can<00:02:14.490> see<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.760> have<00:02:15.030> trouble<00:02:15.600> when<00:02:16.319> I'm

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
as you can see I have trouble when I'm

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.800 
as you can see I have trouble when I'm
looking<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.890> move<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.340> from<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.450> parked

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
looking to move it from the parked

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.970 
looking to move it from the parked
position

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.580 

now<00:02:23.550> when<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.940> utilize<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.870> parking<00:02:25.349> brake

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
now when you utilize the parking brake

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.160 
now when you utilize the parking brake
it<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.610> much<00:02:27.150> easier<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:28.590> move<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:29.489> smoother

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
it is much easier to move the smoother

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.000 
it is much easier to move the smoother
and<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.349> apply<00:02:31.769> them<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.480> for<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.720> shift<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
and you apply them up for you shift the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.910 
and you apply them up for you shift the
selector<00:02:35.730> into<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.360> park<00:02:36.690> position<00:02:37.110> like

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
selector into the park position like

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.210 
selector into the park position like
this

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.360 

when<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:42.970> do<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:44.200> avoid<00:02:44.740> putting<00:02:45.070> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
when you do that you avoid putting the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.550 
when you do that you avoid putting the
weight<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.300> vehicle<00:02:46.480> against<00:02:47.320> the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
weight of the vehicle against the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.430 
weight of the vehicle against the
parking<00:02:48.070> pawl<00:02:48.660> when<00:02:49.660> you're<00:02:49.840> going<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.230> move

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
parking pawl when you're going to move

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.320 
parking pawl when you're going to move
it<00:02:50.670> see<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.820> difference

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
it see the difference
