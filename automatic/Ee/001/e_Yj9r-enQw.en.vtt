00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.320
 Wood is a natural renewable 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.870
 raw material from the forests of the region 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.450
 that's good but that 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.700
 manages such a forest in the 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.340
 harvested not only valuable 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.470
 wood for the wood industry but also 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.080
 a part that is not suitable 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.330
 Foliage and rootstocks remain in the forest 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.440
 but the rest can be chopped up and 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.779
 be dried 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.359
 the result is a special one 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.119
 inexpensive fuel wood chips 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.960
 or hackgut in a so-called 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.839
 Hacken heating be recycled replaced 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.489
 This example, an oil heater 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.050
 It also offers the comfort of a 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.719
 fully automatically controlled 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.719
 heating system connected with their 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.579
 cheap fuel costs you have 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.620
 enough space to store the 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.319
 Chips are such a hackgut 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.510
 heating to the best possibilities with 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.069
 to heat wood 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.709
 that makes you the first choice 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:04.510
 Buildings with high heat demand and 

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:07.420
 adequate space in the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.300
 Gardening choice is one 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.120
 Production operation more heat the 5000 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.730
 square meters of greenhouses with biomass 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.870
 1000 square meters have so right 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:23.920
 center and ticker 1000 square meters 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.830
 private houses we refer our wood 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.760
 the region or the surrounding area 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.380
 farmers 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.190
 it then while on a 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.660
 wood storage will then be two three 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.360
 In 2007 we had one 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:45.670
 Heating oil consumption of about 70,000 liters 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 converted to today 70,000 euros now 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.080
 we consume about 15,000 hackgut 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.400
 this is a value of 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:00.110
 about 25,000 euros and until today 2014 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.510
 we have not regretted that 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.910
 Particularly suitable is the use in the 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.790
 performance range of over 20 kilowatts 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.470
 So at big land and 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.700
 forestry 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.660
 building complex with shared heating 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.610
 the schools municipal offices 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.350
 sports centers or old buildings such as 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:24.260
 cabs or under monument protection 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.900
 standing buildings so much heat around 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.050
 little money and all comfort 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.850
 that's the hack partly one 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.610
 Information of the Austrian 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.459
 biomass association good werner grows 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.489
 for more on heat from wood point at 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.600
 with the support of the Ministry of Life 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.600
 countries and european union
