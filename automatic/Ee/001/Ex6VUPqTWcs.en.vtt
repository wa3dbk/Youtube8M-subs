it<00:03:32.040> was<00:03:32.190> too<00:03:32.370> on<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.670> other<00:03:32.700> side<00:03:33.060> who<00:03:33.180> could

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
it was too on the other side who could

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.570 
it was too on the other side who could
do<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> running<00:03:33.690> yeah<00:03:34.080> he<00:03:34.379> gets<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.680> huge<00:03:34.950> gain

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
do the running yeah he gets a huge gain

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.949 
do the running yeah he gets a huge gain
