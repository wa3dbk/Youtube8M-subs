the layout is 36 foot long
the<00:01:54.979> main<00:01:55.280> reason<00:01:55.729> for<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:56.000> being<00:01:56.509> is<00:01:56.810> we

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
the main reason for that being is we

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.630 
the main reason for that being is we
wanted<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.709> run<00:01:57.890> eight<00:01:58.490> coach<00:01:58.940> p.m.<00:01:59.869> use

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
wanted to run eight coach p.m. use

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.839 
wanted to run eight coach p.m. use
that's<00:02:01.640> why<00:02:01.970> it<00:02:02.030> was<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:02.599> big<00:02:02.899> in<00:02:03.349> the<00:02:03.649> end

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
that's why it was so big in the end

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.130 
that's why it was so big in the end
we've<00:02:04.849> actually<00:02:05.090> achieved<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.780> we<00:02:05.929> can

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
we've actually achieved that we can

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.330 
we've actually achieved that we can
actually<00:02:06.349> run<00:02:06.649> eight<00:02:06.950> car<00:02:07.250> units<00:02:08.979> most<00:02:09.979> people

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
actually run eight car units most people

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.460 
actually run eight car units most people
are<00:02:10.429> pleased<00:02:10.640> when<00:02:10.849> you<00:02:10.910> see<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.569> about<00:02:11.810> he

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
are pleased when you see and about he

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.670 
are pleased when you see and about he
does<00:02:12.680> run<00:02:12.890> well<00:02:13.099> it's<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.730> pleasure<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.120> operate

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
does run well it's a pleasure to operate

putting over hate into the lower yard so
we<00:02:34.550> can<00:02:34.760> use<00:02:35.830> class<00:02:36.830> 70<00:02:37.250> ones<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.660> a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
we can use class 70 ones that is a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.340 
we can use class 70 ones that is a
