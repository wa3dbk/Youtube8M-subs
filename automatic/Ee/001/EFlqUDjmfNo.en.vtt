00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
through it so obviously the eyes have

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.599 
through it so obviously the eyes have
changed<00:00:27.689> which<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.320> me<00:00:28.470> indicate<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.010> spring

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
changed which to me indicate that spring

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.120 
changed which to me indicate that spring
trap<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.480> control<00:00:30.810> something<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:32.009> me

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
trap is in control something to me

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.590 
trap is in control something to me
that's<00:00:32.219> backed<00:00:32.489> up<00:00:32.669> by<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.880> message<00:00:33.300> guess

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that's backed up by the message guess

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.330 
that's backed up by the message guess
who<00:00:33.840> now<00:00:34.140> at<00:00:34.320> first<00:00:34.500> glance<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.890> think<00:00:35.190> it

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
who now at first glance you think it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.459 
who now at first glance you think it
means<00:00:35.550> guess<00:00:35.790> who<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> shows<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.989> bloom<00:00:37.260> boy

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
means guess who and shows you bloom boy

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.139 
means guess who and shows you bloom boy
so<00:00:37.739> you'd<00:00:37.890> naturally<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.879> just

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
so you'd naturally think it's just

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.970 
so you'd naturally think it's just
showing<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.570> bloom<00:00:39.989> boy<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.500> back<00:00:40.770> in

showing you that bloom boy is back in
the<00:00:41.100> next<00:00:41.280> game<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:42.090> i<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.239> instead<00:00:42.690> he's

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the next game but i think instead he's

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
the next game but i think instead he's
saying<00:00:43.079> look<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.860> me<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.219> phone<00:00:44.430> guy<00:00:44.640> who
