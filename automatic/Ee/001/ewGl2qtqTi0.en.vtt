00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.720
 last week of November so 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.160
 last few weeks of mustache if you 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.240
 have not yet understood the mustache 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.370
 it's not for the look huh it's just 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.019
 to support the movember movement all 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.519
 the details on fr point bad mood 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.080
 points like hello to all we are 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.789
 Monday, November 24, 2014 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:24.689
 and it's the frÃ©chou of the day with a 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:26.189
 mustache and his care that unlike 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.660
 to its direct competitors the iphone 6 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.669
 do not offer the possibility of films in 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.750
 four boxes it's a shame but that does not 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.430
 do not prevent it from this world as 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 rolls on the other hand he just been 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.640
 proved that he is quite capable of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.720
 play encoded videos in a 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640
 4k resolution 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.200
 this performance requires a processor 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.060
 at the height and the a8 that team 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.500
 iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus they are 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.150
 come out very very well it's the team of 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.770
 developers of the walter app that 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.240
 just demonstrated it 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.520
 this software allows you to transfer 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.740
 audio and video content on iphone without 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.990
 go through itunes as an example shown in 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.520
 this video of files encoded at 50 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.590
 mega bits and 100 megabits time four 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.970
 cars have been transferred to an iphone 6 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.740
 and we see that both are elected from 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.450
 perfectly fluid way even if 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.949
 some artefacts afraid to appear on 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.659
 the nation encodes 100 mega bits 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.700
 if the iphone if it is not either 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.170
 equipped with a screen 4 cases it is necessary 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.729
 however think about the future maybe 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.140
 that the fourth version of the apple tv 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.659
 could be announced next year 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.369
 and the chip at age 8 would probably have the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.990
 main engine for this time 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.609
 4k broadcast on screens 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.409
 obviously compatible 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.729
 the screens manufacturer corning makes us 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.079
 the blow to each version but this 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.700
 time it seems that the screen 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.999
 almost unbreakable maybe for 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.710
 tomorrow 

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.630
 corning has just unveiled the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.060
 gorilla glass 4 the next generation 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 screen protection glass that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 some already use the front and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.280
 the back of their smartphone is the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.530
 case of sony xperia z2 you are 3 or 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 of a phoenix 0 for example corning 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.159
 announces resistance 3 times higher 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.450
 to shocks and scratches but does not 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.100
 still not guaranteeing protection to 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.020
 100% and if we thought that sapphire 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.579
 synthetic was the next topic 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.619
 magic to protect our smartphones 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.329
 loved the production still cost very 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.590
 dear and corning gorilla glass 4 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.329
 so should be a lot more 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.100
 popular corning has besides announced 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.270
 have signed a partnership with apple and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.759
 other manufacturers for a delivery 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.619
 as of 2015 we should be able to count 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.819
 on thinner screens 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.280
 lighter and more resistant 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.960
 d 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.729
 the next you probably know 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.260
 December 1st is next Monday 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.819

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.080
 fight against AIDS the principle is to 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.819
 able to raise funds for the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.380
 search and apple is for eight years 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.040
 a very active player in this fight for 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.900
 defeat the disease 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.459
 remember the ipod producers is 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.209
 to launch in collaboration with all 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.069
 few years ago 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.959
 this year apple is coming back with the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.130

 cover for ipad 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.400
 but for the first time also passes 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.760
 the message the apps sold on 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.410

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.890
 profits will be fully repaid to 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.750
 the fight against AIDS 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.519
 this is the case of cut the rope 2 angry 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.730

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.239
 good deed 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.500
 the product campaign deals with apple is 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.030
 also accompanied by two days 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.130
 during which apple will donate a 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.959
 part of the profits generated by 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.580
 apple store from around the world of 28 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.230
 november black friday day and the 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.860
 December 1st World Day of struggle 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.080
 against AIDS 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.519
 so the question of the day comes from 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.500
 goni who asks us when does 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.090
 the penalty scribble will be available thank you 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.560
 for this interesting question 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.850
 and for those who do not know him 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.180
 we must remember what is the scribble 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.040
 trouble 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.690
 it is a pen that acts as the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.010
 photoshop pipette just him 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.989
 stick the back on any 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.250
 surface in recovers the color and you 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.049
 allows you to write or draw with 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.700
 scribble breakdown was launched on 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.380
 kickstarter before me you were born the 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.329
 company was abruptly interrupted 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.160
 indeed kickstarter had big doubts 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.690
 on the feasibility of the project and by 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.950
 security measure requested that a 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.000
 new video either to claude and for 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.310
 prove that the product could 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.079
 actually be built the team the 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.010
 project strangely preferred to withdraw 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.060
 the funding platform 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.769
 participatory 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.570
 rather than providing a new video 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.070
 chose another platform of 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.260
 funding but here too the project 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.549
 raises a lot of questions in the end 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.019
 it would seem that this product does not 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.340
 is not possible to build and that the 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.170
 video is only showing a project 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.579
 a bit crazy unachievable wholesale 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.380
 may consider it a scam 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.060
 sorry ghonim and pen scribble is 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.230
 not ready to see the day 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.030
 fresh you're it's over for today 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.350

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.440
 but do not miss our shows 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.120
 today and tomorrow there will be some 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.140
