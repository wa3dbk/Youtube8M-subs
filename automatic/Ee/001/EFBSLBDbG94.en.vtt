00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.970 
case I could decide to turn around and
take<00:00:24.600> up<00:00:24.779> my<00:00:24.930> lights<00:00:25.140> again<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.560> least<00:00:25.710> I'll<00:00:25.830> be

able<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.189> sleep<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> fan<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.539> night<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:27.930> uh

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
able to sleep with a fan at night so uh

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:59.069 
able to sleep with a fan at night so uh
let's<00:00:28.560> go<00:00:28.680> ahead<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.070> take<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> out<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> box

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:07.500 

I<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:04.510> it<00:01:04.600> sees<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.940> outside<00:01:06.940> box<00:01:07.240> was

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
I think it sees that the outside box was

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.980 
I think it sees that the outside box was
not<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.840> real<00:01:08.050> box<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:09.640> have<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:11.369> lux

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
not the real box we have the lux

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:23.399 
not the real box we have the lux
packaging<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.860> website<00:01:22.259> staying<00:01:23.259> waste

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
packaging the website staying waste

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:40.950 
packaging the website staying waste
around<00:01:23.759> 40<00:01:24.759> pounds<00:01:25.119> so<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:26.380> not<00:01:26.500> that<00:01:26.560> bad

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.760 

yes

there<00:01:43.430> goes<00:01:43.609> our<00:01:43.759> washer

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.470 

have<00:01:50.600> the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
have the

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.710 
have the
reference<00:01:53.010> sheets<00:01:54.010> showing<00:01:54.490> us<00:01:54.670> all<00:01:55.240> kinds<00:01:55.660> of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
reference sheets showing us all kinds of

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.620 
reference sheets showing us all kinds of
things<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:57.030> sensational<00:01:58.030> generator

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:07.470 
things that the sensational generator
can<00:01:58.840> do

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.740 

I<00:02:08.550> hope<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:09.730> whatever<00:02:09.910> grew<00:02:10.210> out<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.540> box

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
I hope that whatever grew out of the box

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:21.180 
I hope that whatever grew out of the box
wasn't<00:02:10.960> too<00:02:11.430> valuable

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190
