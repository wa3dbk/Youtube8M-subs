00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello today we are in westhofen and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.500
 only happy winemakers see it 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.719
 We rains visiting Katharina Changer 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.860
 in the courtyard in the cellar and in the rain me 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.119
 was already a bit on the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.160
 looking for the sense yes what that one 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.519
 his life just what something all that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.470
 Good attitude and what you do with what 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.560
 can be satisfied and I think so 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.060
 I found such a cry what 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.619
 is different in comparison to earlier 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.469
 that you just do not feel that way anymore 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.840
 works alone and moves in 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.840
 networks exchange with other growers 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.050
 finds friends and and together ideas 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.480
 also had and that is also by it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.820
 maybe new wines are developing new ones 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 projects develops the winter life 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.030
 clearly takes place in the vineyard takes place in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.500
 cellar but luckily 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 We do not drink our wine 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.219
 only here in Rheinhessen but 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.270
 We sell it to hamburg 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:10.170
 berlin to new york to oslo and 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.000
 Of course you can also do this 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.670
 travel a bit and that is a whole 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 great aspect in any case 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.560
 I just happened even with colleagues from what 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.439
 not in vain has Rhinehessen this 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.570
 this development which are also made 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.390
 the last fifteen twenty years 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.150
 because people just did it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.210
 all of a sudden there was something changed 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.650
 and a whole region already 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.280
 have inspired so much and 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.840
 young winegrower yes just for the job 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 I'm excited about that, too 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.780
 is great if you are there if you want something 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.850
 may look what may learn and that 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.380
 but then maybe one 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.579
 own way then also implements 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.000
 but exchange with each other is belief 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.790
 I what what makes us what the younger 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.860
 winemaker generation makes it so strong 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.220
 So the Riesling 2013 is 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.740
 In any case, if it is with a human 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.980
 Comparing to say that is a human 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:23.140
 the current somehow out of the chair 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.760
 out and said hey tonight I'll go 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.310
 Now go around the houses and then 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.790
 you will be the whole arm all night 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.790
 on the road and does not get tired and is 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.860
 just have a good one 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.530
 making energy so wine is on everyone 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.000
 tell a case because wine tell a story too 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.760
 a story and or lead to it 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.820
 tell people stories everyone 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.410
 can its own interpretation from the 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.230
 pull out wine there is no 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.790
 right and no wrong one man 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.110
 does not just produce a product 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.390
 but you also put a lot 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.540
 even by yourself in these products 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.050
 and somehow it expresses itself 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.010
 out and I find that yourself 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.080
 express 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.030
 that does not make me happy 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.760
 I'm happy that I can do that 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.760
 I have the opportunity to do that
