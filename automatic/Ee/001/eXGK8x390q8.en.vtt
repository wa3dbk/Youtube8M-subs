his nose there I'm sure all right let's
be<00:01:22.320> scientific<00:01:22.770> about<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.580> pressing<00:01:23.970> Q

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
be scientific about this just pressing Q

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.920 
be scientific about this just pressing Q
what<00:01:24.990> does<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:26.090> alright<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.299> raises<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
what does that do alright it raises the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.950 
what does that do alright it raises the
right<00:01:28.049> leg<00:01:28.290> whis<00:01:28.619> pressing<00:01:29.100> W<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:29.960> raises

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
right leg whis pressing W you do raises

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.340 
right leg whis pressing W you do raises
the<00:01:31.049> left<00:01:31.259> leg<00:01:31.770> okay<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:34.110> does<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the left leg okay so we what does that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530 
the left leg okay so we what does that
would<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.770> makes<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.850> right<00:01:36.000> leg<00:01:36.150> go<00:01:36.299> back

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
would do it makes it right leg go back

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.020 
would do it makes it right leg go back
and<00:01:37.500> let<00:01:37.650> me<00:01:37.740> guess<00:01:37.890> p<00:01:38.189> makes<00:01:38.430> left<00:01:38.729> leg<00:01:38.909> go

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
