00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 because tomorrow you have to go to Montserrat 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.390
 from the wall that's a test of about 70 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.490
 kilometers we want to do a test 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.380
 autonomy and see if it can take us 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.000
 up to the top of monserrat we have already 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.040
 made an exit with it about 40 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.740
 45 kilometers and the battery has endured 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.840
 perfectly he has a 30 to 40 per 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.640
 hundred of its capacity with which 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.630
 I hope it takes us without problems in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.070
 this time we have done some 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.260
 modification on the bicycle to make 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.939
 such a long route we have incorporated a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.070
 much softer seat 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.660
 better to withstand the kilometers you 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.120
 we have incorporated a reparapinchazos kit 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.500
 in case of having a puncture despite 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.670
 It is very easy to disassemble the wheel 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.920
 nobody thinks that by having motor 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.510
 electrical is very difficult to disassemble 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.430
 note easily like any other 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.010
 bicycle is worth the battery we have 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 loaded top obviously is also worth 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.399
 We have also incorporated a handle one 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.110
 little bit higher in order to get 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.050
 a driving position a little bit 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.100
 more comfortable and more relaxed even though 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.449
 the original handlebar works 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.789
 perfectly but in this case we have 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.469
 opted to lift the moquitos also 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.090
 we have incorporated a light because to 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.390
 first thing in the morning will be six o'clock 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.699
 and a half in the morning when we leave 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.150
 there will be no light if then it stops 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.700
 enlighten us those first hours 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.960
 it is important to have when carrying lights the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.180
 rest of the bike is totally from 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.300
 battery series of 11 amps and a half 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.830
 250 watt brushless motor a 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.420
 motor that offers no resistance when 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.520
 the bicycle does not use the system 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.680
 electrical so we can combine 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.030
 electrical assistance with simply 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.390
 pedal like any other bicycle 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.910
 It's a 30-speed bicycle 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.760
 incorporates three dishes and ten opinions and 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.740
 well I hope that this report of 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.330
 tomorrow we will give you that great test and to 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.850
 see what you think 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.640
 ok come on hello friends we have half 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.229
 of the output we have for breakfast and 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.000
 here we have the super in iii 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.360
 electrical that is running with a 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.170
 champion we have for these have a lot 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.770
 mess with me but we have not stopped 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.450
 to have lunch 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.400
 we have used to charge the battery 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.410
 we have given a load hour and 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.390
 dating back to one hundred percent 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.280
 battery charge with which we are going to 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.710
 do the other half half of the stage 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.710
 that we have left and that 's it 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.100
 well when to climb by 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.010
 Oh 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.310
 my partner 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.349
 He external to mobile gasolines
