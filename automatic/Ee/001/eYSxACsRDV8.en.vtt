00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.099
 I called and it's me I'm a Caleffi 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.889
 and today I'm going to show you my 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:23.470
 top five assassin's creed codes 4 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:25.270
 black flag and read these codes they will 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.689
 being activated as you go. 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.359
 concluding the challenges abstain from you 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.389
 can look at as many challenges as 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:37.449
 code here in the challenges noted 

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:40.149
 codes are last and we elected 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.859
 five funniest or funniest 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.409
 We'll show you how to use 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.449
 each in situations can help you 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.850
 What you have to pay attention to is the 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.639
 the next time you start a 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.659
 mission progress the same during the 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:54.369
 game 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.429
 in fact from the moment you 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:01:00.010
 use either code to change the 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.379
 let the invincible let the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.129
 edward a speaker or anything 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.890
 like this 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.560
 The game stops recording so you have to 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.869
 stay alert and we advise you to use 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.820
 these codes actually only when you 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:18.100
 finish the game for you from amazon a 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:22.679
 dinha good then we will start with 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.679
 the second code is your friend 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.850
 this code will let adwords that 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.280
 will fulfill Fillon 's speech 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.940
 throws these nonsense straight and 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.610
 But it's cool that you leave it on then. 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.820
 explored in the city because it messes and 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.210
 loose some new pearl in the capsule and 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.210
 fat 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:58.200
 she barely hangs our code on the 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.960
 fourth place was the number code 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.930
 seven dead men do not tell stories 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.790
 this is the classic god mode nobody 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.280
 suffers damages 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.170
 You can sound like the shack you go. 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.270
 to fall but to hurt nothing denounces 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.180
 cheap coca cola average flag 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:24.790
 This code has people who like to leave 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.660
 scene behaved and carefree by the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.430
 simple pleasure to hit people found 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.690
 another utility for him that is the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.060
 following mainly that we will 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.670
 behind 100% of the game in the challenges 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.330
 Obstacles have missions that you will not 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.660
 able to look for things with 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.040
 then what you can use 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.080
 for example this first in the sequence 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.560
 11 has a goal that is to visit old 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.700
 friends there are 21 of them you have to give 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.880
 a little ball for a strong one that is 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.820
 It's not so difficult, you find the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.090
 face if you are one of the impatient 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.239
 You're not going to enjoy looking for the girl. 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.250
 you can use this code and exit 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.320
 jumping in the middle of the galley 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.380
 You're not going to take anything and you're still going. 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.210
 find the guy who is looking good 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.570
 the mission began and 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:25.720
 like I said it has to take no 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.720
 Part 4 was quietly in lap 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.270
 we hit it relieved after defeating it so 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.020
 all the best 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.920
 now 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:56.030
 our code in the third position is the 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:00.470
 loaded at the address instead of you 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.670
 stop at a bar to take a little 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.790
 hold on 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:10.130
 You leave it on and you're staying. 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:18.950
 perpetually stoned focused Picchu cane 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:21.430
 cute square silva Brendon have a 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.430
 look 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.950
 Funny it seems that one hour the effect 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.950
 passes to you beginning to take a motion sickness 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.520
 this is our second place and the 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.170
 the deceased crew must already 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.640
 idea to you of what happens 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.860
 it is the last code that you will 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.620
 To get released and to get you. 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.310
 will need 100% of the challenges 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.670
 completed abs 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.670
 so get to work that takes a 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.520
 little but let's get back to the boat 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.490
 obviously not everything could be silly 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.000
 then your barracks that was 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.060
 preserved with due taxes 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.430
 now the rest of the population 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:23.720
 It's in the damn famine of the Ram just a look 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:28.030
 now the musculature of my soldiers 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:32.350
 to get on an opponent's boat 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.350
 these guys are very good 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:45.860
 and let's go to the big winner of the contest 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.570
 world codes in-game assassins 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:53.870
 creed 4 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:55.880
 it is the code number 8 that the name 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.340
 also makes it very obvious monkeys will bite me 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:05.860
 this code turns all enemies 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.860
 on straw tails said nervously of straw 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:17.210
 I hate radio and good 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.310
 these are our top five codes 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.760
 assassin's creed 4 hope you guys 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.760
 have tanned look the straw tail 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.760
 shooter 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.220
 I hope you have enjoyed it and I hope it 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.990
 that you leave the joinha to know that 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.889
 You like our video short 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:41.990
 wrote on the channel and soon got more 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:47.199
 good boss fishing would suck and good 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.199
 piracy in the right direction is more
