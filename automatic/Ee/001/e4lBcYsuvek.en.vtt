bonuses<00:02:29.370> why<00:02:30.150> wouldn't<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.660> make<00:02:30.810> sense<00:02:30.870> to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
bonuses why wouldn't it make sense to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.770 
bonuses why wouldn't it make sense to
include<00:02:31.860> them<00:02:32.250> both<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.670> same<00:02:33.030> trailer

include them both in the same trailer

include them both in the same trailer
right<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.730> think<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.000> that's<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.360> way

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
right I just think that that's the way

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.800 
right I just think that that's the way
it<00:02:36.540> would<00:02:36.660> work<00:02:36.709> however<00:02:37.709> if<00:02:38.040> we<00:02:39.030> get<00:02:39.239> just<00:02:39.660> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
it would work however if we get just a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.870 
it would work however if we get just a
Harlequin<00:02:40.319> trailer<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:41.160> would<00:02:41.310> be<00:02:41.459> great<00:02:41.730> I

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
Harlequin trailer that would be great I

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.340 
Harlequin trailer that would be great I
can't<00:02:42.270> wait<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.450> see<00:02:42.720> what<00:02:42.840> her<00:02:42.930> gameplay

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
can't wait to see what her gameplay

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.380 
can't wait to see what her gameplay
looks<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.770> or<00:02:43.950> what<00:02:44.370> her<00:02:44.550> story<00:02:44.880> pack<00:02:45.209> is

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
looks like or what her story pack is

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.300 
looks like or what her story pack is
going<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.690> be<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:45.989> if<00:02:46.170> we<00:02:46.230> get<00:02:46.800> just<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.100> Red

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
going to be like if we get just a Red

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.479 
going to be like if we get just a Red
Hood<00:02:47.489> trailer<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.620> would<00:02:49.620> probably<00:02:49.860> go<00:02:50.310> insane

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
Hood trailer I would probably go insane

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.780 
Hood trailer I would probably go insane
from<00:02:50.760> excitement<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:52.110> think<00:02:52.430> not<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.610> say

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
from excitement so I think not to say

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.040 
from excitement so I think not to say
that<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.000> harlequin<00:02:54.390> trailer<00:02:54.660> would<00:02:54.840> be

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
that the harlequin trailer would be

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.930 
that the harlequin trailer would be
worse<00:02:55.650> than<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.950> Red<00:02:56.190> Hood<00:02:56.370> trailer<00:02:56.730> because

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
worse than a Red Hood trailer because

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.000 
worse than a Red Hood trailer because
there<00:02:57.810> would<00:02:58.050> eventually<00:02:58.140> be<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.709> red<00:02:58.890> her

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
there would eventually be a red her

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.670 
there would eventually be a red her
trailer<00:02:59.310> anyways<00:02:59.819> it's<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.260> would

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
trailer anyways it's just that it would

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.259 
trailer anyways it's just that it would
be<00:03:01.890> awesome<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.519> see<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> writer<00:03:02.970> trailer

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269
