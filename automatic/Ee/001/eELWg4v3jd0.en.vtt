00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 do you like luxury sports cars? 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.069
 blues 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.649
 then you can not lose this matter made 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.650
 by sheila singing at the ravi dealership 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.160
 was the representative of bmw in bush 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.160
 southern grosso 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.270
 more than a premium brand bmw ravi 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.680
 was able to go beyond sales of 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.170
 luxury cars 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.050
 this utility charges for the good 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.660
 relationship with your customers and 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.150
 much to keep and conquer those 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.720
 who enter this world of machines 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.720
 wonderful 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.329
 Today I always seek to integrate doing 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.130
 the breakfast is already 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.680
 at our dealer all over the world. 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.410
 Saturday, that brings a lot of customers here. 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.930
 to discuss to play to change 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.990
 ideas we put more equipment 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.460
 in the car at last is and interacts even with 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.530
 our customers and create new friends 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.979
 this idea every year it makes a surprise 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.960
 creates something and then the event happens 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.540
 in the mini dome was a mini parade is a 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.490
 event that has become a tradition and so this 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.720
 was the fourth year of the mine and the third 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.580
 large field 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.280
 it was very cool the event people 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.590
 came to prestige in the green river was a 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.100
 motorcycle meeting and that we do 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.130
 also creates these ideas of doing the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.380
 event to justify taking the bike on the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.750
 garage because otherwise the guy buys motorcycles 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.550
 motorcycle guard and in the year so it is always 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.619
 proposing or passing to rio verde the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.479
 ride to the beautiful ride to 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.240
 SidrolÃ¢ndia had breakfast with a 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.280
 cheese bread there but that's the idea 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.330
 always proposing bringing new friends 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.330
 to do the walks 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.649
 three years ago in a large field 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.310
 dealer works with a team of 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.680
 well-trained debtors are always 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.420
 available to present the cars 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.470
 luxuries filled with technology and 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:27.590
 equipment in the workshop time is 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.940
 optimized as our workshop works 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.730
 very lean 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.860
 customers come is when one thing 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.930
 quick quick service effect on time 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.800
 but when there's something that takes longer 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.380
 a longer review and would not be the 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.550
 I say this on the second or third 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.830
 third division over there 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.810
 a scheduling is necessary because 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.670
 requires more time from the mechanic on top 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.090
 but our market and shocked became 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.010
 in the factory both motorcycles and 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.319
