00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 who do not track calls of everyone 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.549
 human any activity in 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.400
 the internet 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.960
 thanks to this they get 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.120
 unlimited source of information which 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.780
 is a global tracking system for 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.030
 each 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.400
 and both of us batt composition about it 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.109
 it would seem, and so everyone knows the security services 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.930
 can easily view any transactions 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.029
 on our bank card or listen 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.039
 our phone what's the sensation 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.039
 facts that snowdon presented 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.760
 any radio electronic equipment 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.800
 directly or believed in the potential in their 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.960
 It brings us moments at or opportunity 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.380
 tracking and your spy you wear with 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.739
 by myself 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.310
 when i take pictures and post my own 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.290
 photos social networks then 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.900
 information about my location already 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.270
 sewn into this photo itself even if 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.520
 i will turn off my mobile device this 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.590
 does not mean that it is impossible to know 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.320
 where i'm already long possible 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.570
 listen to any cell phone even 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.699
 if it is turned off but if earlier it is possible 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.710
 be removed and the battery and the phone 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.310
 thus disappear from the monitors 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.310
 tracking 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.780
 then in the latest smartphone models 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.390
 designs changed so now 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.020
 pull out the battery without breaking the phone in 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.220
 1000 dollars is physically impossible 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.770
 I wonder what many rich people 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.869
 for example western billionaires david 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.390
 Rockefeller Nathan Rothschild and Warren 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.399
 Buffett Russians richer Mikhail Prokhorov 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.110
 Oleg Deripaska and Mikhail Friedman 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.110
 don't use mobiles at all 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.479
 telephones they know the specialists are open 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.119
 easy access not only to all calls and 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.460
 with a message to photos and personal 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.260
 correspondence but also to all routes 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.850
 which moves the owner 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.650
 phone 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.840
 computer security specialist 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.200
 Igor Kravchenko shows how simple 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.810
 follow man 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.430
 knowing his mobile number is enough 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.320
 just enter it in a special 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.820
 computer program at the correspondent 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.520
 the bell rang 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.039
 he tries to take the call but no answer 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.890
 our employee doesn't even know what 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:11.769
 From that moment on, Igor watches over 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.769
 call him take 3 my call 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.830
 let me tell you, I didn't turn it on 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.900
 said that I was already prepared and in this 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.080
 case, I follow you follow 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.180
 igor explains the camera in any phone 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.340
 person can be turned on at a distance 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.620
 whenever the invisible eye will 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.829
 for days to watch everything you do 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.959
 and you will never know about it 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.170
 simple focus can be done with any 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.420
 a phone that is connected to the internet 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.900
 you can spy on any we know so 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.579
 will turn off if you turn it off 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.150
 speak in the pocket of the common house became 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.280
 to bear a 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.140
 off and the fact is that in fact 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.459
 you turned it off and I didn't 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:02.950
 turned off and your signal goes to you hears 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.959
 yes absolutely igor explains it 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.420
 the program is one of the most primitive 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.700
 have special services with a budget in 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.980
 billions of dollars where opportunities 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.200
 more elementary just for example 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.300
 activate any devices embedded 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.130
 few people in your computer know what 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.530
 speakers through which you are used to 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.110
 listening to music can work not only 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.209
 on the transmission of sound signals but also on their 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.580
 reception that is can be used 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.680
 as a listening device also 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.340
 easy to turn on and your camera 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.760
 laptop 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.290
 this is why many people prefer 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.290
 stick it with malicious programs 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.060
 can use your webcam 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.050
 activate it transmit information about 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.030
 you also the owners of this program give 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.980
 take it is not a large rectangular field 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.350
 on your laptop which allows 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.540
 avoid using a computer mouse 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.610
 but not everyone knows that this 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.920
 touchscreen which perceives 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.170
 touching human skin also 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.959
 able to memorize fingerprints 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.299
 the host of the laptop special services are no longer 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.880
 you need to introduce you to the police 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.070
 the plot can be tracked what you 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.829
 do social networks even when you 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.829
 delete the profile and think it all 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:18.010
 it actually disappeared saved 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:20.049
 your profile is not deleted it remains in 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.660
 archive and even after several years 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.710
 pick up and examine all the information about you 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.360
 moreover, they infect 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.740
 through your computer other computers 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.509
 through these computers again others 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.400
 computers are creating a large network 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.990
 infected computers and through this we 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.720
 went nicknames can even transmit 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.750
 information you hard to believe but 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.669
 even the tv in the middle is watching us 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.069
 November 2013 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.490
 scandal to the whole world raised ordinary 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:48.349
 UK resident Jason Hunter he 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.979
 accidentally discovered that his fashion 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.210
 TV sends to the office 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.669
 information about him jason 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.889
 This technique was categorized as 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.500
 called smart tvs that is 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.169
 the device was able to connect independently 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.330
 to the internet could arbitrarily choose 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.940
 and install various programs and 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.220
 applications that modern technology 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.400
 arranged in such a way that it contains 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:17.389
 imagine the components 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.780
 spyware assignment is a fact which 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.210
 no one 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.760
 the developer then deals with this 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.550
 will not dispute its truth 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.380
 TV Jason found out by chance when 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.020
 decided to calculate how much money 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.419
 monthly spends on the Internet and got 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.760
 check connection protocols exactly 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.389
 then he found out that the TV is behind him 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.000
 spy on 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.250
 reports to the office of the company which programs 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.500
 how much time the owner prefers 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.870
 holds off the screen and even forwards 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.910
 copies of files located on flash drives 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.280
 which master connects to smart 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.650
 TV Jason told the office 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.600
 company threatened to sue 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.860
 but he was told that he may not 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.680
 use the TV 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.540
 if he doesn't like the model in many 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.460
 modern cars have built 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.770
 computer onboard computer which 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.440
 also already connected to the internet and through 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.270
 gps can be made any or through 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.580
 radio signal to introduce some 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.500
 additional changes are possible for example 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.960
 disable in information about when you eat 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.180
 you can turn on the gas and you can something 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.160
 windows haber ator let's say but these 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.200
 The possibilities of modern technology were 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.220
 known to specialists long before 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.320
 snowden 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.660
 what is so new told the world 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.760
 infamous geek that 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.250
 he was accused of disclosing data about 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.240
 US national defense and issuance 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.240
 state secrets
