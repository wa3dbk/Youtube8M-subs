00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.480
 shy first thing has to do to unpack 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.150
 the three parts 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.459

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.370
 is to create an iso file 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.530
 and then I'll show you how it's made facilities such action was 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.530
 They are simple and do not have much secret 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.030
