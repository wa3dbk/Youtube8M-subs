before beerus or small come to awaiting
people<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.040> only<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.430> much<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.910> with

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
people and only so much you can do with

people and only so much you can do with
18<00:00:42.300> people<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:43.050> terms<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.649> kind<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.160> outreach

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
18 people in terms of kind of outreach

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.729 
18 people in terms of kind of outreach
but<00:00:45.180> i<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.899> bow<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.170> satellites<00:00:46.620> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
but i think just bow the satellites in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.590 
but i think just bow the satellites in
scotland<00:00:47.070> could<00:00:47.219> really<00:00:47.700> make<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.910> big<00:00:47.940> big

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
scotland could really make a big big

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.470 
scotland could really make a big big
difference<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:49.340> Clyde<00:00:50.340> space<00:00:50.670> was<00:00:51.000> started

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
difference here Clyde space was started

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.930 
difference here Clyde space was started
five<00:00:51.780> years<00:00:51.809> ago<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.829> build<00:00:53.010> satellites<00:00:53.309> for

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
five years ago to build satellites for

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.330 
five years ago to build satellites for
other<00:00:54.149> companies<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> challenge<00:00:56.190> is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
other companies but now the challenge is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.779 
other companies but now the challenge is
to<00:00:56.699> send<00:00:56.940> their<00:00:57.059> own<00:00:57.270> into<00:00:57.899> space<00:00:58.489> it's<00:00:59.489> hoped

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
to send their own into space it's hoped

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.459 
to send their own into space it's hoped
that<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.180> used<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.510> look<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.930> bushfires

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that can be used to look for bushfires

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.050 
that can be used to look for bushfires

around the globe each one costs 400,000

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.120 
around the globe each one costs 400,000
pounds<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.750> build<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> potential

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
pounds to build that the potential

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.800 
pounds to build that the potential
profit<00:01:08.700> could<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.299> worth<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.689> investment

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
profit could be worth the investment

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.170 
profit could be worth the investment
there's<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.890> many<00:01:11.070> things<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.090> be

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
there's so many things that we can be

there's so many things that we can be
doing<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.650> help<00:01:13.799> us<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.100> grow<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.369> I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
doing that can help us to grow that I

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.060 
doing that can help us to grow that I
