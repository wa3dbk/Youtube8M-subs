00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.419
 just look at my cousin the tac Wandel and then as 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.100
 I can help you and then I him and beauty 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.930
 All right, I'm fine, I'm here. 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.910
 sitting thinking about what should be the 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.920
 My next video so might me 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.750
 help starting a collection of figures 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.460
 It's good what kind of help you need. 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.869
 looks at these shapes and can not find 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.179
 a way to sort 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 okay you have several ways to 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:26.999
 sort the first way would be 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.579
 think of the number of sides each 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.610
 one of these forms have this is a way 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.590
 to think about how much the sides they have 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 and how I'll figure it out 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.380
 Ok let's look at each one of them and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.940
 think how many sides have this first 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:49.620
 figure is one side we see it's straight 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.700
 right here is a straight between these two 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.530
 songs 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.530
 then it is one side two sides three sides and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.460
 four sides of this shape has four 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 sides 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.509
 Ok I think I got it but days and well. 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:12.420
 here is good this is the same idea and 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:16.109
 if it also seems to have a two three and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.740
 four sides four sides 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:24.390
 This is good, it's actually interesting. 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.520
 this one has no corners or sides not 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.399
 have straight edges 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.429
 this thing is all bent and since 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.409
 no corners it does not have sides either 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.840
 at least from my point of view I would say 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.090
 which has zero sides 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.270
 I will not even write in a more 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.479
 That's clear, I really do like you to write 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.179
 things very clearly or sides and 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.630
 0 corners I'll actually write to 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.630
 they all have four sides and give 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.139
 also to tell the songs that have a 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 is one of the two sides meet a two 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:04.499
 three and four corners in this way too 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.829
 there are four sides 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:11.489
 We already count and she has one two three 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.830
 four corners four sides and four 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:18.870
 corners actually defines the two 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:23.370
 this has zero sides 10 corners and green 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.940
 okay let's see one side two sides three 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.260
 sides and four sides and also has a 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.890
 two three four corners also have 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.910
 four sides and four corners and is also 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.680
 in that category 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.260
 all figures on four sides in 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.390
 four corners does not absolutely have this 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.030
 090 corners and indeed the latter 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.670
 figure does not appear to have four sides or 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.170
 four corners if we tell, we'll have 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:56.730
 one two three sides 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:02.670
 This one has three sides if you count the corners 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:05.220
 Let's have one two three corners long ago. 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.740
 Thank you so much, I always stay 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.290
 confused about being my prize the 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.040
 my uncle but I'm going to love you job in 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.350
 He gave 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.230
 I read in the magazine of the figures that have 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.660
 other ways of classifying, I can 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.730
 to classify using the criterion of fact 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.800
 the sides are the same size 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.420
 Which of these has all sides of the same 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.400
 It's okay, calm down, let's look. 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.910
 if you look at this you will see that there are four 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.840
 sides but we see that this side of the side 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.840
 green is clearly shorter than the side 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.150
 not all four sides are from the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.510
 same size but if you look at this 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.150
 figure on this side at least seems to have 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.950
 the same size as this side that looks 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.900
 have the same size as this side 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.910
 seems to be the same size as that 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.130
 side it seems that the four sides here 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.200
 are the same size and also worth to 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.420
 this figure on this side seems to have the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.010
 same size as that side that looks 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.140
 have the same size as that side that 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.269
 seems to be the same size as that 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.160
 is also true for this figure of 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.989
 three sides this side seems to have the same 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.810
 size of that side that is the same 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.070
 size than that thank you prize I 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.109
 I'm ready to rate my 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.280
 collection of figures this is awesome 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.280
 I'm happy to be able to help
