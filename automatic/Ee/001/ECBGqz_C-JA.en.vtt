well as you can imagine you know taking
something<00:01:54.720> from<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.229> 3ds<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.700> know<00:01:56.790> it's<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
something from the 3ds you know it's a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.530 
something from the 3ds you know it's a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
examination of that size was a big

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.859 
examination of that size was a big
challenge<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.159> also<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.360> lighting<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.810> the

filters and effects like that we're

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.559 
filters and effects like that we're
already<00:02:08.610> designed<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.300> 3d<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.360 
already designed for the 3d I
specifically<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.770> when<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.950> take<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
specifically so when you take it to a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.610 
specifically so when you take it to a
television<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.970> really<00:02:12.150> have

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
television you really have

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.320 
television you really have
soon<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.099> we<00:02:13.190> design<00:02:13.519> all<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.879> stuff<00:02:14.090> and

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
soon and we design all that stuff and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.940 
soon and we design all that stuff and
that<00:02:15.019> was<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> challenge<00:02:15.349> although<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.830> was<00:02:15.920> a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
that was a challenge although it was a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.039 
that was a challenge although it was a
very<00:02:16.099> fun<00:02:16.340> one<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.640> take<00:02:16.819> on<00:02:17.030> what<00:02:17.599> do<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.840> plan

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
very fun one to take on what do you plan

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.140

so<00:04:29.780> theoretically<00:04:30.780> if<00:04:31.200> you<00:04:31.470> had<00:04:31.620> your<00:04:31.740> Wii<00:04:31.860> U

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
so theoretically if you had your Wii U

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.640 
so theoretically if you had your Wii U
gamepad<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.690> power<00:04:33.930> outlet<00:04:34.320> you<00:04:34.530> could

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
gamepad and the power outlet you could

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.350 
gamepad and the power outlet you could
play<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.890> game<00:04:35.040> anywhere<00:04:35.370> well<00:04:36.210> I'm

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360
