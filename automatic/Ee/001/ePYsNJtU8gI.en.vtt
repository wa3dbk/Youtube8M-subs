00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and what you still want to do now on the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.020 
and what you still want to do now on the
8th<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.640> new<00:00:41.879> moon<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.510> cancer<00:00:43.489> which<00:00:44.489> we

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
8th with the new moon in cancer which we

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.529 
8th with the new moon in cancer which we
also<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.870> saturn<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:47.430> direct<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.239> same

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
also have saturn going direct that same

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.650 
also have saturn going direct that same
day<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.829> big<00:00:50.160> shift<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.850> energy<00:00:51.449> at

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
day so it's a big shift of energy at

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.770 
day so it's a big shift of energy at
that<00:00:52.020> time<00:00:52.610> jupiter<00:00:53.610> has<00:00:53.640> gone<00:00:54.000> into<00:00:54.180> cancer

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that time jupiter has gone into cancer

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.689 
that time jupiter has gone into cancer
it's<00:00:54.989> now<00:00:55.199> opposite<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.100> sign<00:00:56.370> that

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.920 
little bit on the contentious side so
somebody<00:02:19.349> in<00:02:19.620> your<00:02:20.250> world<00:02:20.489> might<00:02:21.450> want<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.810> do

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
somebody in your world might want to do

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.420 
somebody in your world might want to do
something<00:02:22.200> different<00:02:22.440> than<00:02:22.980> what<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.220> want

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
something different than what you want

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.860 
something different than what you want
to<00:02:23.519> do<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.090> there<00:02:24.239> could<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.510> little<00:02:24.690> bit

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
to do and so there could be a little bit

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.420 
to do and so there could be a little bit
of<00:02:24.989> tension<00:02:25.250> it's<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.640> about<00:02:27.000> speaking<00:02:27.420> from

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
of tension it's is about speaking from

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.100 
of tension it's is about speaking from
what<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.640> important<00:02:30.269> for<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.870> also

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
what is important for you and also

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.030 
what is important for you and also
speaking<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:32.040> clearly<00:02:32.519> as<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:34.040> terms

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
speaking as clearly as you can in terms

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.030 
speaking as clearly as you can in terms
of<00:02:35.459> especially<00:02:36.239> because<00:02:36.510> Neptune<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.409> your

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
of especially because Neptune is in your

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.460 
of especially because Neptune is in your
house<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.690> communication<00:02:39.690> which<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.140> blur

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
house of communication which can blur

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.759 
house of communication which can blur
boundaries<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:42.090> speaking<00:02:42.930> about<00:02:43.230> what<00:02:43.530> you

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
boundaries this speaking about what you

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.640 
boundaries this speaking about what you
how<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.700> feel<00:02:45.209> not<00:02:45.599> only<00:02:45.750> just<00:02:45.989> how<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.260> feel

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
how you feel not only just how you feel

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.130 
how you feel not only just how you feel
about<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:47.160> which<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.430> all<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:48.180> cancer<00:02:48.690> energy

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
about it which is all this cancer energy

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.729 
about it which is all this cancer energy
but<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.480> things<00:02:51.840> clear<00:02:52.440> about

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
but to have things clear about

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.680 
but to have things clear about
expectations<00:02:53.459> or<00:02:54.329> what<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.440> want<00:02:55.769> or<00:02:56.690> what

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
expectations or what you want or what

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.259 
expectations or what you want or what
you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.470> cannot<00:02:58.829> do<00:02:59.190> just<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.120> be<00:03:00.239> very

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
you can and cannot do just to be very

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.750 
you can and cannot do just to be very
clear<00:03:00.569> about<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.349> there's<00:03:01.530> no

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
clear about it so there's no

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.860 
clear about it so there's no
misunderstandings<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.659> don't

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
misunderstandings and so that you don't

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.789 
misunderstandings and so that you don't
end<00:03:04.019> up<00:03:04.530> regretting<00:03:05.390> something<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:07.230> you

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
end up regretting something that you

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.940 
end up regretting something that you
feel<00:03:08.069> pulled<00:03:08.549> in<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.870> doing<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.680> really

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
feel pulled in to doing that you really

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.250 
feel pulled in to doing that you really
don't<00:03:11.099> want<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.370> responsibility<00:03:11.670> for<00:03:12.420> your

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
don't want the responsibility for your

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.369 
don't want the responsibility for your
anus<00:03:13.680> moves<00:03:14.250> were<00:03:14.629> retrograde<00:03:15.629> so<00:03:15.989> whenever<00:03:16.170> a

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
anus moves were retrograde so whenever a

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.170 
anus moves were retrograde so whenever a
planet<00:03:16.769> is<00:03:16.950> shifting<00:03:17.400> retrograde<00:03:17.910> there's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
planet is shifting retrograde there's

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.080 
planet is shifting retrograde there's
that<00:03:18.389> it's<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:19.829> like<00:03:19.889> that<00:03:20.190> word<00:03:20.340> says<00:03:20.639> shift

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
that it's just like that word says shift

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.490 
that it's just like that word says shift
a<00:03:21.359> shift<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.959> energy<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.849> that<00:03:23.849> is<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.500> its

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
a shift in the energy and that is in its

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.390 
a shift in the energy and that is in its
square<00:03:25.919> your<00:03:26.190> energy<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.510> will<00:03:27.950> be<00:03:28.950> it

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
square your energy and it will be it

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.509 
square your energy and it will be it
does<00:03:29.970> show<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.720> show<00:03:31.349> up<00:03:31.650> around<00:03:31.919> it

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
does show that it can show up around it

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.190 
does show that it can show up around it
is<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.879> around<00:03:33.120> your<00:03:33.299> home<00:03:33.450> or<00:03:33.629> family<00:03:33.720> like<00:03:34.079> I
