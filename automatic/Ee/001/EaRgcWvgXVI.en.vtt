00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 the advice my mom sent of 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.410
 do things one hundred percent 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.610
 do it because you like doing it because of it 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.490
 love this sport 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.289
 when at the beginning do not like plus six 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.289
 free to choose another way 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.160
 caroline started skating because 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.340
 I used to go to the track because I already have it 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.360
 I loved so much and saw that too 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.240
 she started to love him but not 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.180
 had the chance to have those 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.670
 occasions I wanted to give the opportunity 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.510
 to the daughter who helped me so much 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.850
 make sacrifices and therefore for me 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.150
 invested the trust and we 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.239
 always given the strength to go on 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.860
 however it was not an obligation it was one 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.430
 immense joy to say 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.379
 girl who came to the top of the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.960
 participation in the Olympics for me is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.810
 always been a big dream a girl 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.900
 so young a responsibility like that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.010
 high go to him standing a pressure 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.030
 very little heavy on purpose by 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.790
 Media journalists interview the pension 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.860
 that that person when they are 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.620
 entered the track I remember the only thing 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.090
 what I really wanted was to go home 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.259
 But the emotion was very well prepared 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.000
 did his games was the night that 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.000
 we looked at the life program 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.560
 my husband I shut up we have 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.280
 watched now I don't even remember 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.150
 the more times I fell I didn't 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.800
 so 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:02.400
 and to his because I cried 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:06.750
 but not for the result the result is 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:14.120
 relative it was for the wood this girl 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:16.830
 put us and did not go as I thought 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.900
 well the titles at home that made so many 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.200
 years of sacrifice was a bad 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.200
 period 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.290
 it will be but it shows that he has had to 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.960
 pass that one too she came back from 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.330
 vancouver disappointed throughout the season

 disappointed with the Olympics he had 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.380
 quite 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.380
 the beauty is knowing that my mother 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.040
 then he said it as you will of the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.500
 skating 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.650
 the answer is simple because she likes it 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:54.250
 when your joy falls from doing it upstream 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.250
 pink unchanged but do it for joy 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.030
 from that point there 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.010
 results have always gone uphill 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.940
 I became world champion 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.350
