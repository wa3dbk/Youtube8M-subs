00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.966
 Peace be upon you and God 's mercy and blessings 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.830
 (Base Coat) Start with a layer of Bis Coot 

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:19.661
 Apply a layer of dark white paint 

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:41.550
 You need: Printing tools, special shapes as desired, a metal blade tool to remove excess paint 

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:46.505
 Using the desired color lay a layer of paint 

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:53.678
 Using the metal blade, remove the excess coat from the paint 

00:00:55.714 --> 00:01:00.869
 Then we use the shape-swipe tool 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.043
 Then we place it on the nail in the appropriate place 

00:01:12.047 --> 00:01:14.599
 Fill with a layer of Top Cut 

00:01:19.554 --> 00:01:20.405
 This is the final form 

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:21.740
 This is the final form hoping to be appreciated 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:31.950
 Peace, mercy and blessings of God
