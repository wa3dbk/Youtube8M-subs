00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
expecting at this time of day but it's

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.560 
expecting at this time of day but it's
stretching<00:01:03.280> almost<00:01:03.760> all<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.239> way<00:01:04.330> across

between<00:01:04.900> boy<00:01:05.290> it<00:01:06.040> looks<00:01:06.220> like<00:01:06.310> we<00:01:06.490> can<00:01:06.610> find

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
between boy it looks like we can find

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.820 
between boy it looks like we can find
the<00:01:06.909> channel<00:01:07.180> up<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:08.020> north<00:01:08.350> here<00:01:08.619> that<00:01:08.770> we

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
the channel up to the north here that we

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.160 
the channel up to the north here that we
can<00:01:08.920> go<00:01:09.040> through<00:01:09.369> but<00:01:09.940> this<00:01:10.720> is<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.869> lot<00:01:11.020> worse

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
can go through but this is a lot worse

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.020 
can go through but this is a lot worse
than<00:01:11.350> we<00:01:11.440> saw<00:01:11.590> in<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.770> Pentland<00:01:12.130> Firth<00:01:12.340> looks

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
than we saw in the Pentland Firth looks

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.350 
than we saw in the Pentland Firth looks
like<00:01:13.210> this<00:01:13.330> little<00:01:13.390> whirlpools<00:01:14.050> forming

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
like this little whirlpools forming

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.389 
like this little whirlpools forming
death<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.690> definite<00:01:17.110> serious<00:01:17.470> tide<00:01:17.740> race<00:01:18.009> I

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
death and a definite serious tide race I

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.910 
death and a definite serious tide race I
guess<00:01:19.180> we<00:01:19.330> just<00:01:19.360> timed<00:01:19.750> it<00:01:19.899> wrongly<00:01:20.140> we're

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
guess we just timed it wrongly we're

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.590 
guess we just timed it wrongly we're
thinking<00:01:21.250> more<00:01:21.430> about<00:01:21.580> getting<00:01:22.240> out<00:01:22.390> on<00:01:22.509> the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
thinking more about getting out on the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.290 
thinking more about getting out on the
whole<00:01:22.750> journey<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:24.220> just<00:01:24.729> getting<00:01:25.000> into<00:01:25.210> the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
whole journey just just getting into the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.850 
whole journey just just getting into the
first<00:01:25.450> bits<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:25.960> now<00:01:26.140> so<00:01:26.440> I'm<00:01:26.530> gonna<00:01:26.649> head

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
first bits that now so I'm gonna head

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.440 
first bits that now so I'm gonna head
north<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.250> see<00:01:27.399> if<00:01:27.460> I<00:01:27.490> can<00:01:27.640> avoid<00:01:27.729> it

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.719 

we<00:01:35.439> managed<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.920> miss<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.130> worst<00:01:36.490> of<00:01:36.670> the

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
we managed to miss the worst of the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.490 

we've<00:01:48.710> got<00:01:48.860> plenty<00:01:49.100> death

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
we've got plenty death

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.050 

you<00:01:51.860> get<00:01:52.100> right<00:01:52.370> in<00:01:52.580> underneath

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you get right in underneath

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.850 
you get right in underneath
but<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.720> probably<00:01:55.079> best<00:01:55.320> known<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.710> its

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
but it's probably best known for its

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.219 
but it's probably best known for its
impressive<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.549> famous<00:01:56.939> C<00:01:57.119> stack<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:58.079> old

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
impressive and famous C stack the old

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:13.540 
impressive and famous C stack the old
man<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.649> Hawaii

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.460 

from<00:02:14.120> there<00:02:14.300> we<00:02:14.540> took<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.810> direct<00:02:15.020> course<00:02:15.380> for

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
from there we took a direct course for

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.650 
from there we took a direct course for
mainland<00:02:16.070> Scotland's<00:02:16.640> most<00:02:16.700> northeasterly

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
mainland Scotland's most northeasterly

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.970 

so<00:02:23.640> we're<00:02:23.849> right<00:02:24.209> underneath<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.469> clips<00:02:25.799> and

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
so we're right underneath the clips and

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.559 
so we're right underneath the clips and
underneath<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.459> lighthouse<00:02:26.879> at<00:02:27.120> Cape<00:02:27.329> Wrath

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
underneath the lighthouse at Cape Wrath

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.550 
underneath the lighthouse at Cape Wrath
the<00:02:28.109> very<00:02:28.819> northwest<00:02:29.819> tip<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.209> Scotland<00:02:30.689> and

the very northwest tip of Scotland and

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.459 
the very northwest tip of Scotland and
this<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.129> probably<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.239> place<00:02:33.510> which<00:02:33.810> had

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
this is probably the place which had

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.949 
this is probably the place which had
worried<00:02:34.829> me<00:02:35.010> most<00:02:35.299> when<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:36.359> was<00:02:36.540> planning<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
worried me most when I was planning the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.050 
worried me most when I was planning the
trip<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.409> was<00:02:37.889> just<00:02:38.099> terrified<00:02:38.549> at<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.790> place

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
trip I was just terrified at this place

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.330 
trip I was just terrified at this place
thinking<00:02:39.329> just<00:02:39.659> how<00:02:39.840> remote<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.560> was<00:02:40.859> how<00:02:41.069> far

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
thinking just how remote it was how far

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.789 
thinking just how remote it was how far
from<00:02:41.519> any<00:02:41.639> fuel<00:02:42.060> how<00:02:42.900> bleak<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.469> was<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.739> to

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
from any fuel how bleak it was going to

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.369 
from any fuel how bleak it was going to
