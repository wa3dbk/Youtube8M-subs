00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.439 

okay<00:00:00.719> so<00:00:00.780> I<00:00:01.439> had<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.740> question<00:00:01.979> about<00:00:02.939> how<00:00:03.419> to

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
okay so I had a question about how to

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.930 
okay so I had a question about how to
record<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.140> mix<00:00:04.520> if<00:00:05.520> you're<00:00:05.730> playing

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
record a mix if you're playing

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.379 
record a mix if you're playing
externally<00:00:07.340> and<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.460> don't<00:00:08.700> have<00:00:08.880> an<00:00:09.059> extra

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
externally and you don't have an extra

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.089 
externally and you don't have an extra
output<00:00:09.599> on<00:00:10.050> your<00:00:10.230> mixer<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.800> there's<00:00:10.980> no

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
output on your mixer so there's no

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.259 
output on your mixer so there's no
record<00:00:11.309> out<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.840> mixer<00:00:13.429> and<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:14.849> I've<00:00:14.969> come

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
record out on the mixer and so I've come

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.970 
record out on the mixer and so I've come
up<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.570> little<00:00:15.839> way<00:00:15.990> here<00:00:16.320> how<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.800> it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
up with a little way here how to do it

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.560

straight up to the speaker so the reason

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.289 
straight up to the speaker so the reason
I'm<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.899> using<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:44.759> show<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.240> now

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
I'm just using one to show you right now

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.240 
I'm just using one to show you right now
is<00:01:46.040> just<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:48.329> channel

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
is just because this is one channel

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.999 
is just because this is one channel
speaker<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.350> once<00:01:52.560> you've<00:01:52.710> got<00:01:52.860> that

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
speaker so then once you've got that

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.910 
speaker so then once you've got that
wired<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.659> you<00:01:54.659> need<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.990> go<00:01:55.430> into<00:01:56.479> your

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
wired in you need to go into your

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.310 
wired in you need to go into your
computer<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.939> deck<00:02:00.180> D<00:02:00.450> let<00:02:00.810> me<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.110> close

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
computer and on deck D let me just close

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.300 
computer and on deck D let me just close
this<00:02:01.619> down<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:04.560> want<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.860> set<00:02:05.070> deck

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
this down here and you want to set deck

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.910 
this down here and you want to set deck
D<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.850> live<00:02:06.090> input<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.380> basically<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
D to live input so basically is a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.710 
D to live input so basically is a
through<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.270> live<00:02:09.509> input

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
through so you just like live input

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.170 
through so you just like live input
there<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.349> then

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
there and then

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.729 
there and then
anything<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.689> comes<00:02:11.900> through<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.290> deck<00:02:12.500> deal

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
anything that comes through a deck deal

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.979 
anything that comes through a deck deal
will<00:02:12.890> just<00:02:13.010> go<00:02:13.129> straight<00:02:13.159> through<00:02:13.870> which<00:02:14.870> is

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
will just go straight through which is

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.179 
will just go straight through which is
what<00:02:15.019> we<00:02:15.170> want<00:02:15.409> because<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.769> wanted<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.040> go

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189
