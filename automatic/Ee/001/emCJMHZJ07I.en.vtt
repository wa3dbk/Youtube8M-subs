like 110 now an explanation about how

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.210 
like 110 now an explanation about how
these<00:01:05.330> 60<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.200> close<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> human

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
these 60 will be close to what the human

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.469 
these 60 will be close to what the human
eye<00:01:08.310> sees<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> think<00:01:09.210> of

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
eye sees but what you have to think of

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.330 
eye sees but what you have to think of
it<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:10.740> was<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> window

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it as is is if there was like a window

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.690 
it as is is if there was like a window
in<00:01:11.460> front<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:13.490> obviously<00:01:14.490> your

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
in front of you and obviously your

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.070 
in front of you and obviously your
computer<00:01:15.090> monitor<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> very<00:01:15.630> small<00:01:15.869> window

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
computer monitor is a very small window

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.810 
computer monitor is a very small window
so<00:01:16.439> when<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> send<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.400> human<00:01:17.729> eye

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
so when you send it to what human eye

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.609 
so when you send it to what human eye
would<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.140> looking<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
would see it's like looking out of a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.780 
would see it's like looking out of a
very<00:01:19.770> small<00:01:20.009> window<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.400> you've<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:20.640> got

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
very small window that you've then got

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.670 
very small window that you've then got
to<00:01:20.909> look<00:01:21.030> push<00:01:21.450> around<00:01:21.630> although<00:01:22.049> all<00:01:22.470> in

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
to look push around although all in

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.950 
to look push around although all in
front<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.189> able<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.960> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
front of you to be able to see the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.390 
front of you to be able to see the
environment<00:01:25.409> around<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> said<00:01:26.100> it's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
environment around you so I said it's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.830 
environment around you so I said it's
hundred<00:01:26.670> ten<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:26.970> isn't<00:01:27.240> realistic<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
hundred ten which isn't realistic and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.910 
hundred ten which isn't realistic and
you<00:01:27.900> end<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> lot<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.320> distortion<00:01:28.799> it's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you end up with a lot of distortion it's

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
you end up with a lot of distortion it's
like<00:01:29.040> holding<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> magnifying<00:01:29.790> glass<00:01:29.880> or<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
like holding a magnifying glass or or a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.240 
like holding a magnifying glass or or a
Fresnel<00:01:31.229> lens<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.560> front<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.829> your<00:01:31.950> face<00:01:32.070> in

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
Fresnel lens in front of your face in

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.190 
Fresnel lens in front of your face in
real<00:01:32.340> life<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.360> what<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.600> does<00:01:33.750> mean<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
real life but what it does mean is that

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.690 
real life but what it does mean is that
when<00:01:34.439> you've<00:01:34.530> got<00:01:34.560> using<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.100> tiny<00:01:35.280> computer

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
when you've got using a tiny computer

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.090 
when you've got using a tiny computer
screen<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.479> larger<00:01:36.930> computer<00:01:37.259> screen<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
screen or a larger computer screen you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.920 
screen or a larger computer screen you
can<00:01:38.250> actually<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.640> what's<00:01:38.850> around<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.420> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
can actually see what's around you you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.899 
can actually see what's around you you
can<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.200> everything<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.650> cabin<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.340> it's

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
can see everything in the cabin and it's

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.749 
can see everything in the cabin and it's
far<00:01:42.479> more<00:01:42.509> immersive<00:01:42.960> at<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.890> compromise<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
far more immersive at a compromise to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.120 
far more immersive at a compromise to
some<00:01:44.970> aspects<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> realism<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.439> overall<00:01:47.040> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
some aspects of realism but overall I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.219 
some aspects of realism but overall I
find<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.729> more<00:01:47.880> realistic<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.899> it's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
find it more realistic but it's it's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.770 
find it more realistic but it's it's
just<00:01:49.470> up<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.210> might<00:01:51.360> want<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.600> try

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
just up to you and you might want to try

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.380 
just up to you and you might want to try
different<00:01:51.990> settings<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:52.829> 110<00:01:53.700> causes<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
little bit of camera clipping at the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.530 
little bit of camera clipping at the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you're in the in the the cockpit cabin

you're in the in the the cockpit cabin
and<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:03.000> conductor<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:04.079> know<00:02:04.170> what

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
and the conductor see I don't know what

and the conductor see I don't know what
you<00:02:04.380> call<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.799> driver's<00:02:05.189> seat<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.729> train

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
you call the driver's seat in a train

you call the driver's seat in a train
the<00:02:06.479> conductors<00:02:07.140> area<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.179> might<00:02:09.300> want<00:02:09.450> to

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the conductors area so you might want to

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.170 
the conductors area so you might want to
try<00:02:09.629> something<00:02:09.840> around<00:02:10.140> about<00:02:10.440> 90<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:11.550> 100<00:02:11.970> and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
try something around about 90 or 100 and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.449 
try something around about 90 or 100 and
see<00:02:12.330> what<00:02:12.450> see<00:02:12.660> what<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.840> like
