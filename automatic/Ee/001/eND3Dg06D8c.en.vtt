of<00:01:10.799> paper<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.310> something<00:01:11.760> similar<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> this

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
of paper but something similar to this

of paper but something similar to this
and<00:01:14.030> you'll<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.240> why<00:01:15.409> when<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.590> come<00:01:16.619> back

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and you'll see why when we come back

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.149 
and you'll see why when we come back

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
dollar bill now this one is a bit

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.090 
dollar bill now this one is a bit
crinkled<00:01:27.810> okay<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.150> might<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> bit

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
crinkled okay so it might be a bit

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.859 
crinkled okay so it might be a bit
difficult<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:33.600> show<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.579> but<00:01:35.579> first<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.780> all

it over and hold to the center lock that
to<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> edge<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.270> go<00:01:48.619> we're<00:01:49.619> going

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
to the edge so there we go we're going

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.899 
to the edge so there we go we're going
to<00:01:49.799> unfold<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.600> we're<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.140> fold<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.909> to

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
to unfold it we're going to fold it to

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.440 
to unfold it we're going to fold it to
that<00:01:54.149> line<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.200> crease<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.070> made

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
that line to that crease we just made

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.319 
that line to that crease we just made
you<00:01:57.450> see<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.950> climb<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.430> made<00:01:59.610> we<00:02:00.119> need<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.260 
okay but for mr. precedent when they
flip<00:02:34.660> him<00:02:34.810> back<00:02:34.990> over<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:36.220> have<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.490> fold<00:02:37.060> it

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
flip him back over you have to fold it

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.670 
flip him back over you have to fold it
like<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:38.940> George<00:02:39.940> Washington's<00:02:40.840> head<00:02:41.410> is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
like this George Washington's head is

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
like this George Washington's head is
split<00:02:42.070> right<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.340> half<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.900> there<00:02:44.050> we<00:02:44.200> go

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
split right in half so there we go

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.100 
split right in half so there we go
now<00:02:45.700> what<00:02:45.850> we<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.210> do<00:02:46.330> is<00:02:46.540> flip<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.900> over

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
now what we have to do is flip it over

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.210 
now what we have to do is flip it over
and<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.530> crease<00:02:50.800> we<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:50.980> made

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
and that to that crease we just made

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.670 
and that to that crease we just made
right<00:02:51.520> here<00:02:51.820> we<00:02:52.660> have<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.960> fold<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.790> up<00:02:55.680> okay

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
right here we have to fold this up okay

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.180 
right here we have to fold this up okay
see<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:59.800> fold<00:03:00.070> that<00:03:00.520> up<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.940> crease

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
see that you fold that up to the crease

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.660 
see that you fold that up to the crease
and<00:03:03.190> fold<00:03:03.490> this<00:03:04.120> up<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.600> crease<00:03:05.220> see<00:03:06.220> kind

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
and fold this up to the crease see kind

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.840 
and fold this up to the crease see kind
of<00:03:06.760> makes<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.060> Roman<00:03:07.420> numeral<00:03:07.750> one<00:03:08.760> kind<00:03:09.760> of

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
of makes the Roman numeral one kind of

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.150 
of makes the Roman numeral one kind of
funny<00:03:10.090> how<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.420> works<00:03:10.810> out<00:03:11.080> if<00:03:11.380> you<00:03:12.010> do<00:03:12.130> it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
funny how that works out if you do it

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.210 
funny how that works out if you do it
properly<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.960> two<00:03:14.290> edges<00:03:14.470> will<00:03:14.740> kind<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.040> line

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
properly the two edges will kind of line

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.790 
properly the two edges will kind of line
up<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:17.020> then<00:03:17.200> do<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.730> bottom<00:03:19.800> right

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
up and then do it to the bottom right

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.170 
up and then do it to the bottom right
here<00:03:22.140> it's<00:03:23.140> in<00:03:23.440> right<00:03:23.650> here<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.490> nothing

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
here it's in right here and nothing

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.150 
here it's in right here and nothing
really<00:03:25.360> lines<00:03:25.720> up<00:03:26.050> I<00:03:26.170> guess<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.590> something

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
really lines up I guess you something

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.030 
really lines up I guess you something
right<00:03:27.340> but<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:29.220> can't<00:03:30.220> really<00:03:30.550> so<00:03:31.300> there<00:03:31.510> we<00:03:31.600> go

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
right but I can't really so there we go

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.080 
right but I can't really so there we go
now<00:03:33.040> open<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.400> back<00:03:33.520> up<00:03:33.730> now<00:03:35.340> I'm<00:03:36.340> not<00:03:36.640> too<00:03:36.880> big

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
now open it back up now I'm not too big

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.030 
now open it back up now I'm not too big
with<00:03:38.040> precreasing<00:03:39.040> but<00:03:39.550> if<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.510> would<00:03:40.630> like

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
with precreasing but if you would like

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.880 
with precreasing but if you would like
you<00:03:42.040> can<00:03:42.430> it's<00:03:42.700> kind<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.180> hard<00:03:43.450> but<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.620> two

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
you can it's kind of hard but the two

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.770 
you can it's kind of hard but the two
things<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.730> edges<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.240> just<00:03:46.480> folded

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
things the edges that you just folded

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.830 
things the edges that you just folded
kinda<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.880> know<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.030> don't<00:03:49.330> know<00:03:49.600> how<00:03:49.780> to
