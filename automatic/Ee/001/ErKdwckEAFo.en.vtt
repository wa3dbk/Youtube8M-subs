00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.860 
what I guess it depends on who you might
think<00:02:13.620> this<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.860> made<00:02:14.010> by<00:02:14.190> Nelson<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.720> know

is but there are I noticed that there

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.870 
is but there are I noticed that there
are<00:02:19.320> two<00:02:19.380> different<00:02:19.830> kinds<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.400> market

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
are two different kinds on the market

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.580 
are two different kinds on the market
there's<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:21.360> that's<00:02:21.510> really<00:02:21.780> inexpensive

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
there's one that's really inexpensive

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.890 
there's one that's really inexpensive
doesn't<00:02:23.250> work<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:23.610> well<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.120> don't<00:02:24.630> honestly

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
doesn't work as well I don't honestly

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.570 
doesn't work as well I don't honestly
know<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.470> could<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.920> find<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.370> same

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
know you could like you find the same

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.880 
know you could like you find the same
ones<00:02:26.820> cuz<00:02:27.030> they<00:02:27.120> do<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.420> job<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.650> these

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
ones cuz they do the job so I like these

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.440 
ones cuz they do the job so I like these
because<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.400> doesn't<00:02:29.760> take<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.910> lot<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.239> water

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
because it doesn't take a lot of water

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.559 
because it doesn't take a lot of water
pressure<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.350> them<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.739> spray<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.400> they<00:02:33.060> they

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
pressure for them to spray and they they

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.729 
pressure for them to spray and they they
cover<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.260> area<00:02:34.620> pretty<00:02:34.770> well<00:02:35.070> now<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:36.739> put

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
cover this area pretty well now I put

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.650 
cover this area pretty well now I put
them<00:02:37.950> about<00:02:38.220> every<00:02:38.520> 12<00:02:38.820> feet<00:02:39.120> because<00:02:39.450> what<00:02:39.630> I

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
them about every 12 feet because what I

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.630 
them about every 12 feet because what I
did<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.200> we've<00:02:40.350> got<00:02:40.560> growers<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.160> over<00:02:41.430> here

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
this guy all probably 2000 future

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.000 
this guy all probably 2000 future
policies<00:02:47.550> let's<00:02:47.790> say<00:02:47.940> 40<00:02:48.300> by<00:02:48.450> 200<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.709> went

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
policies let's say 40 by 200 but I went

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.410 
policies let's say 40 by 200 but I went
and<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.250> looked<00:02:50.280> at<00:02:50.640> what<00:02:50.790> all<00:02:50.940> these<00:02:51.090> growers

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
and I looked at what all these growers

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.750 
and I looked at what all these growers
were<00:02:51.660> doing<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.350> what<00:02:52.530> they<00:02:52.709> do<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:53.459> they<00:02:53.730> they

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
were doing and what they do is they they

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.420 
were doing and what they do is they they
put<00:02:54.390> these<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:55.380> top<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.800> roof<00:02:55.950> and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
put these in the top of the roof and

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.770 
put these in the top of the roof and
then<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:58.800> they're<00:02:58.950> standing<00:02:59.310> up<00:02:59.459> like<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.880> so

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
then so they're standing up like this so

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.509 
then so they're standing up like this so
the<00:03:00.900> water<00:03:01.140> from<00:03:01.380> overhead<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.010> come<00:03:02.190> winter

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
the water from overhead and come winter

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.860 
the water from overhead and come winter
they<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.910> loosen<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.269> fitting<00:03:03.510> at<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.750> end

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
they just loosen the fitting at the end

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.330 
they just loosen the fitting at the end
turn<00:03:04.080> them<00:03:04.230> down<00:03:04.290> cover<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.860> roof<00:03:05.010> off<00:03:05.130> with

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
turn them down cover the roof off with

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.699 
turn them down cover the roof off with
plastic<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.060> then<00:03:06.630> when<00:03:06.810> they<00:03:06.959> when<00:03:07.590> they

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
plastic and then when they when they

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.259 
plastic and then when they when they
have<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.070> water<00:03:08.280> their<00:03:08.579> underwear<00:03:08.880> they<00:03:09.060> just

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
have to water their underwear they just

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.699 
have to water their underwear they just
let<00:03:09.420> them<00:03:09.510> run<00:03:09.600> upside<00:03:10.049> down<00:03:10.260> because<00:03:10.620> they

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
let them run upside down because they

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.090 
let them run upside down because they
only<00:03:10.860> do<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.160> once<00:03:11.370> or<00:03:11.519> twice<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.390> anyway

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
only do that once or twice but anyway

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.710 
only do that once or twice but anyway
these<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.370> put<00:03:14.730> them<00:03:14.850> every<00:03:15.090> 12<00:03:15.390> feet

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
these so I put them every 12 feet

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.449 
these so I put them every 12 feet
because<00:03:16.140> that's<00:03:16.290> what<00:03:16.590> they<00:03:16.769> were<00:03:16.829> doing<00:03:17.160> in

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
because that's what they were doing in

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.610 
because that's what they were doing in
there<00:03:17.610> who<00:03:17.730> pops<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.420> I've<00:03:18.870> got<00:03:19.110> them<00:03:19.290> twelve

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
there who pops so I've got them twelve

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.160 
there who pops so I've got them twelve
feet<00:03:19.799> in<00:03:19.860> here<00:03:20.370> but<00:03:20.940> these<00:03:21.269> things<00:03:21.600> will<00:03:21.870> water

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
feet in here but these things will water

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.729 
feet in here but these things will water
all<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.799> way<00:03:22.890> over<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:24.150> spring<00:03:24.540> water<00:03:24.870> all

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
all the way over to the spring water all

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.590 
all the way over to the spring water all
the<00:03:25.950> way<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.459> end<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.820> this<00:03:26.970> planning

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
the way to the end of this planning

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.300 
the way to the end of this planning
which<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.019> probably<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.680> gotta<00:03:28.829> tape<00:03:29.130> in<00:03:29.280> my

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
which is probably I gotta tape in my

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.490 
which is probably I gotta tape in my
hand<00:03:29.850> somewhere<00:03:30.120> trying<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.600> come<00:03:31.110> up<00:03:31.140> with<00:03:31.320> a

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
hand somewhere trying to come up with a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.890 
hand somewhere trying to come up with a
dimensions<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.549> number<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.360> but

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
dimensions but it's a number for you but

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.780 
dimensions but it's a number for you but
you<00:03:33.989> got<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.260> keep<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.620> mind<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.549> just

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
you got to keep in mind that just

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.090 
you got to keep in mind that just
because<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.360> phrase<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:37.019> far<00:03:37.320> it's<00:03:37.920> not

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
because it's phrase that far it's not

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
because it's phrase that far it's not
going<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.430> spray<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.730> far<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.480> corner<00:03:39.959> so

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
going to spray that far in the corner so

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.509 
going to spray that far in the corner so
right<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:42.900> tree<00:03:43.349> right<00:03:43.379> there<00:03:43.620> are<00:03:43.980> 16

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
right to that tree right there are 16

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:51.440 
right to that tree right there are 16
another<00:03:44.819> three<00:03:45.180> probably<00:03:45.650> 19<00:03:50.239> that<00:03:51.239> were

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
another three probably 19 that were

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.699 
another three probably 19 that were
Street<00:03:51.840> here<00:03:52.080> if<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.230> can<00:03:52.349> just<00:03:52.379> stuff<00:03:52.650> like

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
up in the ground does that mean here is

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.030 
up in the ground does that mean here is

back so you can see what you know how

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.009 
back so you can see what you know how
old<00:04:07.200> they<00:04:07.500> how<00:04:07.680> well<00:04:07.860> they<00:04:08.040> cover<00:04:08.810> right<00:04:09.810> now<00:04:09.989> I

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
old they how well they cover right now I

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.470 
old they how well they cover right now I
think<00:04:10.260> I've<00:04:10.500> got<00:04:10.739> about<00:04:10.860> eight<00:04:11.730> or<00:04:11.940> nine<00:04:11.970> I

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
think I've got about eight or nine I

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.539 
think I've got about eight or nine I
think<00:04:12.959> maybe<00:04:13.379> nine<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.980> them<00:04:14.099> down<00:04:14.310> through

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
think maybe nine of them down through

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.099 
think maybe nine of them down through
here<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:14.970> got<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.239> add<00:04:15.360> one<00:04:15.599> more<00:04:15.810> on<00:04:15.989> the

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
here and I got to add one more on the

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.039 
here and I got to add one more on the
end<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.590> can<00:04:17.160> run<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.400> nine<00:04:17.850> of<00:04:17.880> them<00:04:18.239> but<00:04:19.019> I

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
end I can run all nine of them but I

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.979 
end I can run all nine of them but I
lose<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.620> little<00:04:20.040> bit<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.340> distance<00:04:20.850> so<00:04:21.150> I<00:04:21.450> may

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
lose a little bit of distance so I may

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.810 
lose a little bit of distance so I may
because<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:22.650> want<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:22.950> water<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.400> stuff<00:04:23.639> in<00:04:23.760> the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
because I want to water the stuff in the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.760 
because I want to water the stuff in the
ground<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.389> may<00:04:24.810> turn<00:04:25.110> that's<00:04:25.380> why<00:04:25.530> it's

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
ground I may turn that's why it's

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.010 
ground I may turn that's why it's
important<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.490> put<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:26.940> shutoff<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.570> every<00:04:27.810> one

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
that way if you want to you can turn off

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.550 
that way if you want to you can turn off
the<00:04:29.820> ones<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.240> don't<00:04:30.330> want<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.690> run<00:04:30.900> turn

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
the ones that you don't want to run turn

those plants are about 25 feet wide
there's<00:05:11.970> another<00:05:12.270> five<00:05:12.960> feet<00:05:13.229> of<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.919> roadway

there's another five feet of the roadway

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.430 
there's another five feet of the roadway
there<00:05:14.849> we<00:05:15.030> made<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.240> path<00:05:15.539> for<00:05:15.750> driving<00:05:16.110> our<00:05:16.169> car

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440

the right hand side so these things you

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.159 
the right hand side so these things you
actually<00:05:23.070> cover<00:05:23.610> a<00:05:23.940> lot<00:05:24.240> of<00:05:24.270> distance<00:05:24.660> and

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.680 
had two in one bed three and the other I
had<00:06:05.350> a<00:06:05.380> really<00:06:05.950> weak<00:06:06.340> well<00:06:06.790> pump<00:06:07.150> so<00:06:07.360> I<00:06:07.420> didn't

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
had a really weak well pump so I didn't

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.120 
had a really weak well pump so I didn't
have<00:06:07.780> much<00:06:07.840> water<00:06:08.230> pressure<00:06:08.380> I<00:06:08.770> didn't<00:06:08.980> have<00:06:09.100> a

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
have much water pressure I didn't have a

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.010 
have much water pressure I didn't have a
lot<00:06:09.340> of<00:06:09.460> volume<00:06:09.760> but<00:06:10.150> they<00:06:10.540> did<00:06:10.720> a<00:06:10.750> great<00:06:10.990> job

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
lot of volume but they did a great job

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.090 
lot of volume but they did a great job
