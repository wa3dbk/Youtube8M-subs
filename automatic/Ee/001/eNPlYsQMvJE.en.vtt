00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.920
 hello everyone I'm sweet and salty n 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.200
 and today we are going to make a super recipe 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.660
 simple and it's like making a pineapple juice 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.250
 so they can enjoy all 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.949
 this summer and you can enjoy it with 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.960
 your favorite foods as always in the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.970
 sixth recipe is available at the end 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.420
 of the video and in the information box 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.550
 which is below the video 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.380
 to make this pineapple juice we are going to 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.810
 place the pieces of pineapple in the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.939
 blender and how my blender is not very 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.939
 big I'm going to do this in two runs 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.440
 now we add enough water too 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:51.879
 we add white sugar and liquefy 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.879
 everything is well liquefied 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.040
 and then let's strain the juice this is 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.150
 optional but I like to do it with 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.950
 all the juices that I make 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.809
 and if you have a strainer more 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.809
 big much faster is much better 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.320
 and as you can see this is the fiber of the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.280
 pineapple that's why we like to strain the juice 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.500
 but as I say it is optional 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.600
 and then we're going to refrigerate the juice 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.970
 at least one or two hours before serving 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.340
 or we can serve it in a glass with ice 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.490
 and so it's easy to prepare a juice of 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.490
 pineapple 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.810
