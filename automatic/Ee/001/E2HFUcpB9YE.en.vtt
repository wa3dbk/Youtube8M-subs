00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
sewing this you want to make sure that

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.260 
sewing this you want to make sure that
you<00:02:11.220> take<00:02:11.400> your<00:02:11.520> time<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:12.060> not<00:02:12.210> a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you take your time it's not a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.300 
you take your time it's not a
competition<00:02:12.630> but<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:13.800> don't<00:02:14.010> want<00:02:14.160> your

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
competition but you just don't want your

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.280 
competition but you just don't want your
fringe<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.850> slip<00:02:15.090> out<00:02:15.210> of<00:02:15.330> place<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.840> that's

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
fringe to slip out of place and that's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.590 
fringe to slip out of place and that's
why<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.650> even<00:02:17.220> feed<00:02:17.490> foot<00:02:17.520> really<00:02:18.270> helps

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
why this even feed foot really helps

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.730 
why this even feed foot really helps
with<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.320> make<00:02:19.470> sure<00:02:19.500> you're

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
with that so you can make sure you're

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.320 
with that so you can make sure you're
getting<00:02:19.950> an<00:02:20.070> accurate<00:02:20.400> stitch<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.270> your

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
getting an accurate stitch on your

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.800 
getting an accurate stitch on your
fringe<00:02:21.959> sleeves<00:02:22.760> at<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:24.209> point<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.600> also

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
fringe sleeves at this point I also

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.110 
fringe sleeves at this point I also
changed<00:02:25.350> my<00:02:25.560> needle<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.100> universal<00:02:26.850> needle

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
changed my needle to a universal needle

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.510 
changed my needle to a universal needle
because<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.420> didn't<00:02:27.870> want<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.470> fringe<00:02:28.830> to

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
because I didn't want the fringe to

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.130 
because I didn't want the fringe to
break<00:02:29.940> my<00:02:30.240> ballpoint<00:02:30.990> needle<00:02:31.290> i<00:02:32.720> hemmed<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
break my ballpoint needle i hemmed the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.530 
break my ballpoint needle i hemmed the
bottom<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.950> sleeves<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.730> neckline<00:02:36.209> and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
bottom of the sleeves the neckline and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.780 
bottom of the sleeves the neckline and
the<00:02:37.050> bottom<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.500> shirt<00:02:37.709> using<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.430> straight

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.690 
the bottom of the shirt using a straight
stitch<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.780> actually<00:02:39.959> used<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.830> clear<00:02:41.250> nylon

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
stitch and I actually used a clear nylon

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.550 
stitch and I actually used a clear nylon
thread<00:02:41.970> for<00:02:42.209> these<00:02:42.330> pieces<00:02:42.600> because<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.440> was

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
thread for these pieces because I was

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.650 
thread for these pieces because I was
actually<00:02:43.740> running<00:02:44.160> out<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.459> gray<00:02:44.940> thread<00:02:45.360> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
actually running out of gray thread and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.440 
actually running out of gray thread and
I<00:02:46.200> also<00:02:46.410> kind<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.100> pulled<00:02:47.520> them<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> little<00:02:48.330> bit

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
I also kind of pulled them a little bit

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.270 
I also kind of pulled them a little bit
as<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.989> sewed<00:02:49.290> them<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.860> they<00:02:49.980> would<00:02:50.070> have

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
as I sewed them so that they would have

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.610 
as I sewed them so that they would have
the<00:02:50.519> ability<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:51.090> stretch<00:02:51.420> once<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.230> put<00:02:52.470> them

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the ability to stretch once I put them

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.420 
the ability to stretch once I put them
on<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.180> now<00:02:57.540> what<00:02:57.989> I'm<00:02:58.110> doing<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.680> I'm<00:02:58.950> flipping

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
on so now what I'm doing is I'm flipping

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.910 
on so now what I'm doing is I'm flipping
my<00:02:59.459> sleeves<00:03:00.000> right<00:03:00.570> side<00:03:00.900> out<00:03:01.140> because<00:03:01.769> I'm

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
side out you're going to insert the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.580 
side out you're going to insert the
sleeve<00:03:13.709> into<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.880> armhole<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.019> shirt<00:03:16.320> and

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
sleeve into the armhole of the shirt and

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.770 
sleeve into the armhole of the shirt and
you<00:03:17.010> want<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.280> make<00:03:17.400> sure<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:18.000> all<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.540> seams

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
you want to make sure that all the seams

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.500 
you want to make sure that all the seams
match<00:03:19.050> up<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:20.010> seam<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.970> bottom<00:03:21.209> of

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
match up so the seam on the bottom of

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.090 
match up so the seam on the bottom of
the<00:03:21.630> sleeve<00:03:21.840> needs<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.320> match<00:03:22.500> with<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.860> side

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
the sleeve needs to match with the side

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.430 
the sleeve needs to match with the side
seam<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.760> shirt<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.450> after<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.140> have<00:03:25.290> I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
seam of the shirt and after you have I

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.930 
seam of the shirt and after you have I
would<00:03:25.530> suggest<00:03:25.769> pinning<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.370> first<00:03:26.640> and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
would suggest pinning that first and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.759 
would suggest pinning that first and
after<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.330> have<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.690> pinned<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:28.590> make

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
after you have that pinned you can make

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.770 
after you have that pinned you can make
sure<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.220> pin<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.549> all<00:03:29.760> evenly<00:03:30.209> around

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
sure that you pin it all evenly around

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.289 
sure that you pin it all evenly around
the<00:03:30.989> entire<00:03:31.470> armhole<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.549> then<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.180> just

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
the entire armhole and then you can just

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.660 
the entire armhole and then you can just
take<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.630> your<00:03:33.750> sewing<00:03:33.930> machine<00:03:34.290> and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
take it to your sewing machine and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.220 
take it to your sewing machine and
stitch<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.700> up<00:03:36.000> like<00:03:36.299> we<00:03:36.330> saw<00:03:36.630> everything<00:03:36.930> else

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
stitch it up like we saw everything else

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.560
