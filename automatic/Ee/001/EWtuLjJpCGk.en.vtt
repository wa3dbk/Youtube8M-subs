00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:24.859
 only one engine 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.390
 consumes 0 0 sometimes you hear that from 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.930
 friends or customers 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.350
 this is not a good sign because 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.090
 actually consumes every motor oil and 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.800
 if you cook in the manual 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.360
 in the guarantee conditions we will 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.120
 they actually think so for everyone 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.909
 engines a maximum oil consumption of 1 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.269
 liters per 1000 kilometers of the 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.570
 Car manufacturers accepted is allowed 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.430
 is 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.519
 I do not really want a car like that 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.989
 Everybody has 1 liter every 1000 kilometers 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.840
 nachkippen oil I've never 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.629
 because that's for sure too 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.429
 to hedge something from the manufacturer 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.630
 in fact, every motor consumes 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.800
 some oil as well as it is now 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.869
 combustion gases and therefore also 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.690
 Fuel parts to the between piston 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.640
 and cylinder past the comrie in the 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.619
 engine oil in the score citizen houses and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.350
 Motor height get so prosecuted too 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.420
 Engine oil on the same way from below 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.240
 up in the call letter, so to speak 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.649
 over in the combustion chamber and will be there 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.520
 with burnt therefore one should his 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.569
 Check oil level 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.300
 modern engines also have one there 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.470
 Sensor off a lamp lights up on you 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.810
 have to follow quickly 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.119
 nevertheless, it becomes the standard rule 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.630
 that one occasionally the oil level 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.819
 controlled and in older vehicles 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.140
 then it can be very dramatic 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.030
 go the oil consumption 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.390
 sometimes you see such vehicles 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.099
 the road the smoke behind something can 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.379
 a sign of wear and tear of all 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.289
 Cylinder can also be a sign 

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:02.539
 be for a broken piston rings 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.170
 And then a repair is essential 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.170
 necessary 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.520
 the height of 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.250
 of course, has a great importance for the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.890
 functionality of our school system 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.709
 she must not be too low because 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.599
 then not enough lubricant to 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.640
 the weak points may move 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.130
 but not too high to be 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.310
 For example, do not simmering apart 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.080
 to press 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.940
 An oil pressure test of the workshop will be 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.040
 not used very often 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.560
 usually when suspicion is also 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.810
 too little oil pressure when a lamp 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.239
 the pressure switch will flicker 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.670
 unscrewed that else for that too 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.660
 aha everything is green 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.640
 area the lamp goes out in the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.230
 thread of unscrewed oil pressure 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.660
 switch will be a hose with one 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.579
 attached manometer screwed and the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.239
 engine in run 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.260
 Of course, the works council must be 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.239
 We have already discussed how 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.709
 important that is for everyone 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.489
 Function checks and idle 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.109
 The pressure should be 0 5 to 1 bar and 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.690
 at certain speeds should rather 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.970
 rise and a maximum pressure of 3 4 bar 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.670
 here, the manufacturer is always in demand 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.600
 with his details 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.269
 Of course there is one 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.760
 connection between speed and altitude 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.819
 of pressure in idle field impression 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.190
 strong because we only have 700 800 left 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.130
 revolutions and at maximum speed 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.900
 then i have my maximum pressure of 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.480
 is then limited by a 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.480
 oil pressure limiters are songs valve 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.549
 so that he does not accept any excess 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.400
 Comparison of the determined values ​​with the 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.889
 Manufacturer information and you know that 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.370
 the engine or the game system is in 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.769
 order 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.769
 or it's just not okay 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.100
 but that was it and now again 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.650
 own thing if you mean mine 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.400
 executions for example to the whole 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.170
 have taken seriously 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.020
 then I would be glad if you to 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.560
 example, the license plate was okay nike 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.890
 that's why, of course, there would still be one 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.299
 comment will be synonymous other users 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.980
 but it may be worth it 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.240
 look in here and if you have something 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.920
 not so good 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.380
 I have no problem with that at all 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.680
 if they also write that in and 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.400
 okay, that was not so good today 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.620
 or 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.640
 I still have that connection 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.640
 not understood
