bought because I thought it was the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.940

in it and waiting ingredients so this

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.280 
in it and waiting ingredients so this
does<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.910> same<00:02:41.940> thing<00:02:42.390> as<00:02:42.600> like<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.900> crest<00:02:43.140> 3d

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290

this<00:03:48.690> honestly<00:03:49.170> um<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.829> was<00:03:50.010> not<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> facial<00:03:50.850> you

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
this honestly um it was not a facial you

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.880 
this honestly um it was not a facial you
it<00:03:51.329> was<00:03:51.480> just<00:03:51.630> like<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.810> cloth<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.709> just

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
it was just like a cloth and you just

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.190

kind<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.220> exfoliated<00:03:54.180> your<00:03:54.299> face<00:03:54.540> with<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.989> I

kind of exfoliated your face with it I

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.530

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
little fibers on it I did find that this

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.909 
little fibers on it I did find that this
is<00:04:45.330> nicer<00:04:45.720> separating<00:04:46.260> in<00:04:46.410> giving<00:04:46.800> your

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
is nicer separating in giving your

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.980 
is nicer separating in giving your
lashes<00:04:47.100> length<00:04:47.580> but<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.450> does<00:04:48.630> need<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.870> be

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
lashes length but it does need to be

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.770 
lashes length but it does need to be
layered<00:04:49.320> with<00:04:49.500> another<00:04:49.830> mascara<00:04:50.610> if<00:04:51.060> it's<00:04:51.630> not

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
layered with another mascara if it's not

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.420 
layered with another mascara if it's not
that<00:04:52.229> I<00:04:52.320> just<00:04:52.350> find<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:53.010> was<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.160> little

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
that I just find that it was a little

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.370 
that I just find that it was a little
too<00:04:53.580> thin<00:04:53.820> of<00:04:53.850> my<00:04:54.060> eyelashes<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:54.840> didn't

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
too thin of my eyelashes and didn't

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.930 
too thin of my eyelashes and didn't
