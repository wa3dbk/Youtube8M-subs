00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
awkward one of the things that I really
appreciated<00:01:21.299> watching<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> marathon<00:01:21.960> was

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
appreciated watching the marathon was

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
appreciated watching the marathon was
seeing<00:01:22.680> each<00:01:22.920> movie<00:01:23.310> progress<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.939> not<00:01:24.150> only

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
seeing each movie progress and not only

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.820 
seeing each movie progress and not only
seeing<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.840> movies<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.409> characters

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
seeing the movies and the characters

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.620 
seeing the movies and the characters
progressed<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.580> also<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.970> special<00:01:27.330> effects

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
progressed but also the special effects

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.120 
progressed but also the special effects
so<00:01:27.810> by<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> time<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> age<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.799> Ultron

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
so by the time we get to age of Ultron

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
so by the time we get to age of Ultron
it<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.000> blows<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.540> away<00:01:30.600> once<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.229> see

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it just it blows you away once you see

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.080 
it just it blows you away once you see
Ultron<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> vision<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.549> everything<00:01:32.700> that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
Ultron and vision and everything that

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.060 
Ultron and vision and everything that
they<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.170> fight<00:01:34.470> scenes<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.950> this

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
they can do and the fight scenes in this

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100
