00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.360
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.720
 Today's video tutorial is all about the subject 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.519
 Slot light meter 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.800
 why a sudden guys get better 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.170
 I can be a questioner in almost 95% of all my work on the studio 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.239
 and location 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.799
 or author is the EM percent ultimately cutting knife as long as I'm using mushrooms 

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:31.359
 Worker inserts 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.399
 that just has the big advantage for me that I have before me 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.630
 at all the first time pressed the shutter button on the camera 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.200
 Exactly how much also comes from the individual places out the streams 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.970
 Ratio are the individual places to each other 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.250
 and if everything is set correctly then I press the first time 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.160
 the trigger I look at the result percent of camera display and can 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.360
 then, if necessary, the seats 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.920
 again after corrected 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.690
 The whole thing is actually relatively fast 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.420
 if you have little practice in the whole thing and as always at one 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.940
 typical 6 4 I want to show you today 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.420
 A flash meter has basically two different ones 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.900
 tasks 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.150
 for one percent and indeed to find the magnificent lighting 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.850
 m and the other 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.840
 In order to determine the correct exposure time they are not 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.969
 then from Messe and later 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.560
 into the camera 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.650
 When does it start with finding the right one? 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.040
 Lighthouse strength of the individual places or places 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 among themselves in what proportion to stand by 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.390
 Beginning, we do not light our head with our leadership team 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.650
 and all first have to determine how much light comes to those who claimed 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.460
 but to do so called method measurement and based on this 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.250
 Method measurement 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 then we put the other places 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.270
 yes me the leadership is not around we now want to see how much 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.660
 Light comes out on her 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.690
 For this it is important that we from the side of our model, the measuring chamber of third parties 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.650
 Act in the direction of that 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.650
 for uv light it 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.759
 we now have exactly one aperture 16 here 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.729
 Volumes 16 that our father's limit must have that in mind 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.729
 because all the other places I'm on the set but we have here only one 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.799
 Places but that is also true in the event that he has several seats 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:33.880
 work 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.680
 have to depend on 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.680
 the wheel was Renz value here volumes 16 are measured 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.969
 would not work with other places but only with these 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:44.749
 one 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.749
 would result in the result 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.279
 will it cause that we only have not here also wonderful model page 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.769
 But here is absolutely black 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.349
 will appear 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.290
 Now let's bring a little bit of drawing in these shadows 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.199
 I need to be noticeable 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.580
 in our case Tinner small on box 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.889
 and in advance, of course, I should think about it 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.709
 how strong this contrast to the second strong 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.229
 to the drawing that is to come here in the States yet 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.120
 and should not have been in relation to our head because they 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.249
 here a panel 16 and can remember us 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:27.779
 that if we have only a relatively weak shadow here 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:32.669
 we want to have about one less aperture than the aperture 16 that we have 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:33.849
 an aperture 11 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.899
 but if we want to say these shadow games want more 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.220
 Be pronounced 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.379
 then you would have to turn here 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.379
 8 or go to an aperture 5 six 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.099
 that's what I mean now but ultimately better 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.879
 we want to say we want a relatively weak shadow 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.399
 to have 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.759
 say a percent contrast ratio of about one aperture 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.750
 we had aperture 16 here 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.079
 if like here 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.930
 and conspicuously here have an aperture make 11 last comeback man 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.099
 around 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.809
 We measure that directly with the fair we may have had in the direction of it 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:12.469
 noticeable that 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:14.730
 and cake and the result 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.859
 that is and alone plans something I've taken before is, however, open 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:18.809
 adjusted 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:20.370
 and a little faster 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.670
 and we now know exactly the contrast ratio between 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.669
 Leaders unremarkable is a blind 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.340
 here it is a blind weaker 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.039
 as here the main course 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.590
 and around 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.660
 we have our result without ever having to hit the trigger 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.820
 pressed 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.150
 already relatively clear in mind 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.600
 That was the first step 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.169
 what I can do with the flash meter 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.129
 Yes, finding the right lighting strength of each place 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.050
 and the single places with each other 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.610
 the second step 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.000
 what we give what we suddenly use a knife for 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.910
 Finding the right exposure 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.780
 find the right exposure value in it 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.720
 A little later, when I saw him with my kids we saw knives 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.720
 then manually transferred to the camera 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.310
 how do I go here 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.330
 in comparison to true to find the right number illuminance of the 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.780
 Blitzes where we have always measured with the FK Lotte in the clips Rhine 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.039
 both at the main path 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.370
 as well as the conspicuous 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.830
 m where to find the right light for us is worth us 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.529
 The fair calotte directly into the camera directly into the lens axis 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.529
 you could do it 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.199
 Both lights are on and we come here 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.199
 to a value of the lift comma 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:51.360
 11 point five means 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.520
 for a fade 11 and 15 degrees Glenton steps further dazzle steps to 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.620
 next plans that their plans are sixteen we move here 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.869
 in a range between 11 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:06.919
 Plendl 16 about exactly half 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.689
 This value can now be set according to manually at the camera what 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.470
 the exposure time 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.470
 we just have to move within the seats in the reason time 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.250
 so you're sure to go for example, 960 pieces so that you 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:26.699
 definitely on the safe side and after nearly tripping on the 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.830
 Camera looks at the result 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.010
 if you are still dissatisfied with what you say 'okay' 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.389
 The shadows may have something more or less pronounced but the 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.419
 Light percent can be corrected that conspicuously 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:40.589
 or but 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:44.629
 Accordingly, also for uv-light a little something to do 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.449
 but it's just not a 2 he was 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.699
 but it is one thing 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.789
 I'm going to take care of that, and I'll mess it up before I do 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.770
 ever pressed for trigger 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.139
 ever thought 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.669
 how the light should work at all with which contrast ratio the 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:03.729
 individual places must be set with each other thus the 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:05.889
 would like to have the desired result 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.580
 I wish you much fun copying CIS and see you next time
