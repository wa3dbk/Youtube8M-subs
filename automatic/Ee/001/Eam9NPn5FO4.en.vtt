00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hello 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:09.630
 It means that guitar course the first time for beginners 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.890
 The first times I think let's doing it with the bar code 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.000
 It is power saying oh 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:21.750
 The principle is strong and literally 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.220
 It's a powerful code, so how to play it 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.510
 There are some, but this time I will try to play the easiest way 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.680
 First of all 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.829
 Let's put a person's coffin on the sound 5 fret of 6 strings 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.270
 Hmm 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.910
 That should sound like this 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:43.150
 Yeah, but this is becoming especially of 0 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.660
 Next left with cats 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.440
 5 of sleep the little finger 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.440
 7th fret 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.460
 Hmm 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.460
 Yeah Yeah it this is alone the completion of the power cord 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:05.010
 If you remember this form 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:13.259
 Skip h fret does not receive the index finger 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:15.970
 My sister on 2 frets The next thing I think is that if you hold down with 6 language people and defensive, the pinky is the source of words 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.190
 During this time the location is open for frets 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:23.440
 Good 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:27.130
 Remember this shape and it's ok no matter where you move it 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.340
 That is the power this means now 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.280
 I'm holding 5 frets and frets but 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.210
 this 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 For example , facing the 1st fret from the index finger 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.030
 Little finger is increased by 3 from the fret digit to 3 fret 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.970
 Printer code f will come later 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.040
 It seems that you move the 2nd fret eye in this 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.250
 Don 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.040
 In a 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:07.820
 Now I use a six-string and 5-string but Neun called the etymology 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:12.830
 Gesture dates for all 5 and 4 goose fingers are code 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.930
 a 5 fret 3 frets 4 frets 5 frets each 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.930
 If you put your index finger on your finger 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.090
 This is c 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.300
 If you follow the action of Nadi 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.590
 p 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.720
 Me 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.010
 Something if'll put my next right hand movement is not givin is another tune-ish I chord progression 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.090
 Say 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.720
 ana 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.920
 me 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.360
 Nee in such Fu 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.490
 There is also a pattern that you can play the song girl level just by playing the power cord of 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.490
 That's right is something especially a punk 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.100
 Hmm 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.030
 Yeah and what do 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.720
 I only use questionable power cords 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.500
 It Masu talk meeting in the meet and bridge mute For next time 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.500
 It looks like now 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.819
 Buber Kobe 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:35.909
 And that was the story 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:39.440
 It is simple but is more than we are 8 Zu' Kai Monet fact, so we changed the head towards the blog there 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:45.770
 I think that understanding will deepen if you can see 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:48.030
 You as possible purchase decisions wrote feel free to to it the comments section if you have any after any questions, etc. 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.420
 I think you let me answer 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.800
 Thank you very much The first time was like this 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.800
