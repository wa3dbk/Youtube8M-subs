00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 who will be the bearer of this knowledge who 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.340
 will transfer this knowledge recently 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.840
 being on the hearts of the teachers conference 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.920
 the question was raised I asked the question at the hour 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.900
 what qualities should have 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.309
 teacher including educational 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.760
 who is working right now 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.289
 the idea of ​​education is brought in 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.550
 educational process at least 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.279
 try again to return to 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.680
 the educational function of the school itself but to 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.820
 Unfortunately, no one is a teacher 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.660
 who attended the audience not 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.730
 were able to give them 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.640
 what qualities should this 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.140
 teach the same good question then 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.940
 There is essentially you put the question as 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.730
 turn the tide that is she here 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.040
 rolling in some direction and what is it 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.629
 for strength how to make the grass break 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.100
 need to actually understand on 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.050
 imagine what should be 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.719
 the system that is what system then we 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.360
 should come well but I will bring you 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.800
 example of an hour know now very much 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.230
 the time in which we live 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.690
 it says that this time is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.579
 the junction of eras here everything will be very and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 Bystritsa all bad will be very much 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.809
 develop and all the good will be very 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.369
 strongly evolve that is any 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.200
 initiative she will get very 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.380
 strong support i.e. these are common 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.780
 historical periods when there is a tag of epochs 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.810
 then everything is very fast with great speed 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.909
 evolving here let's understand this 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.280
 simple fact we see that with a huge 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.930
 speed i degradation of society that is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.479
 if we remember what happened 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.670
 twenty thirty years ago what is what to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.619
 and morality was in people yes how are they 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.799
 went hiking as they sang to the guitar 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.140
 sitting by the fires of what they dreamed and 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.090
 let's see what people are now what they are talking about 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.540
 dreaming don't tell what the difference is very 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.290
 a big 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:45.750
 we see it well what I want to say 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:48.530
 now how can I understand the time as 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.380
 would each person's individual look 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.659
 what kind of person creates facebook and 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.579
 facebook in a matter of months becomes 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.829
 popular system for the whole world man 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.409
 earn millions of dollars that is 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.540
 we see these examples as concrete 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.490
 personality start doing something suddenly she 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.239
 gets huge 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.209
 authority is now a century of freedom now 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.160
 time is freedom therefore any 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.750
 the person who starts to do also 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.760
 right things if he's on it 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.500
 time itself will be focused 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.230
 intensify because now is the time 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.450
 works this way so when you 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.030
 ask a question where to take this power I 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.300
 would suggest starting yourself ie 1 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.390
 have my family have my children have my 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.019
 my wife or my husband is my surroundings 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.390
 so here let's change the situation here 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.150
 because it is power and you know how 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.459
 when the fire is burning and the wind is blowing fire and 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.299
 very time starts to swim very fast 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.120
 I will positively strengthen these changes 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.540
 I will give you an example of the show Alice we start our 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.940
 led 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.709
 I recently communicated with him the greatest 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.739
 the teacher behind whom dozens are now 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.810
 thousands of people around the world 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.500
 which does not support the government 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.269
 have he say so offers a system 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.700
 humane pedagogy on parenting 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.489
 he brings up parents bring up 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.220
 children is a completely independent person 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.380
 but look bigger and bigger 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.370
 the number of people goes after him including 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.390
 now authorities are interested in his systems 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.250
 now the state is starting 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.750
 interested in his experience but what is he 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.299
 started he started with his little 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.390
 the lab was nobody cylinders wife 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.730
 all here it was the beginning therefore I 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.739
 would still suggest taking 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.230
 responsibility for yourself ie 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.480
 teachers start parents themselves 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.269
 start yourself every man start here 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.400
 that is, if someone has a soul that hurts 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.190
 have unhappy families 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.690
 that from the family now almost nothing 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.510
 not left because we are with you 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.760
 Statistics know how much I know 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.030
 average statistics for Russia is to 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.000
 unfortunately sad let's call about 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.329
 80 percent of marriages break up at first 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.549
 year of existence is statistics 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.340
 mean why officially i want 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.470
 put some accent 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.900
 official statistics for some 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.099
 Russian regions 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.979
 marriages breaks more than 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.660
 is this something sad 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.490
 the situation that we have now 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.380
 that is, people have forgotten how 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.930
 just being close to each other why 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.300
 Well, let's disassemble now because 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.460
 that the whole system of modern society 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.010
 all modern culture it is built 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.880
 so it enhances our selfishness 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:43.870
 individualism you have the right to 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.210
 the whole network of egoists is growing 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.010
 quite active that is us 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.100
 bring up as individualists you 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.300
 you have the right to your personal happiness 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.930
 take everything from life and do not give yourself 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.720
 dry out 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.280
 here are the slogans of the modern world and here 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.160
 imagine when two such people 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.320
 comes to the family and how can they even 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.289
 keep close if every such 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.350
 the mood that you intended for my 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.500
 happiness and you must fulfill mine 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.450
 expectations we can all you want 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.700
 law enforcement system 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.539
 create a punishment system or 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.630
 encouragement 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.180
 but you need to change the mood of man 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.830
 that is, people need to pass an education 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.620
 look at what is being built 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.210
 happy family we are not going anywhere 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.580
 let's leave from the fact that a happy family 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.889
 built on the elementary things that 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.720
 everyday life is called love what is 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.990
 love and love this means that this 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.620
 man dear to me means love 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:45.130
 what his needs are his desires 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.780
 something very valuable to me but this one 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.130
 a thing is possible only when I have 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.620
 no selfishness when i don't have 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.320
 self-centeredness 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.000
 we will not restructure the education system 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.340
 so we brought up people who 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.139
 think of the nation 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.940
 who think about other people who 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.130
 want to do charity 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.650
 because they have them taste like 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:09.190
 would be good here until we start at 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.530
 society to open this energy 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.000
 this is a chest of problems that becomes 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.810
 more and more about 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.810
 he won't stop
