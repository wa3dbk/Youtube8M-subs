00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 legs to grow as is and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.410
 will be in the 1998 World Cup or lie 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.510
 affirm that madrid policy 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.219
 our team had fallen and I 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.500
 It mattered a lot to participate I was 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.880
 participating in the Brazilian national team 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.600
 following year was the world of 98 and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.560
 also of athletic interest is that of the 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.260
 the lookout 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.990
 I want to coach at the time he 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.099
 showed interest and for me is very 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.650
 important 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.750
 the team coach wanted me was not 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.430
 only the silvio club I think it is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.559
 now returning to be the third power 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.110
 but at the time it was the third power 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.710
 after the real madrid, barcelona is 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.930
 I just got a friend, it 's then 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.059
 so was a club is a very club 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.300
 really very prominent, right? 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.420
 people also welcomed 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.309
 wonderfully good was the club too 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.109
 that's what I have a lot of affection 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.090
 the viewpoint he had in it a 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.860
 way of playing is also similar to the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.080
 Brazil he liked to put the team 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.890
 to play liked technical players 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.010
 is 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.650
 it really is easy to read 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.240
 played by other half then 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.420
 he is one that he felt very keen 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.460
 played on his team and I also made a 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.010
 great partnership with christian and he already 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.470
 I had done with ravanelli, right? 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.480
 england and spain with the police 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:35.410
 he is also another phenomenal player 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:38.230
 in terms of finalization and there my 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.470
 the first six months in Spain were 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.480
 fantastic and chorused was a reference 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.570
 that this team 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.240
 was one of the players that is more 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.430
 talents from Spain of recent times 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.570
 and turkey in the bf 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.090
 in 1998 this dream of the world's flora and 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.200
 changed is a wonderful time where I 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.960
 I was living one of the best moments 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.020
 from my career to this entry 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.720
 disloyal that condemns the entries until today 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.230
 It's salty michel it was very bad 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.180
 in that entrance is the ball was already there in the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.490
 In front of him he could not 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.920
 the ball he gave a cart behind that 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.930
 is one to date is one of the most played 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.640
 violent football I think you have to 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.770
 be banned from the player giving a stand 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.130
 behind in the other I have seen some games 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.180
 he is a good player but he is a player 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.760
 violent 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.120
 so he always cultivated it so 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.579
 It really was very harmful to 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.019
 mine in my career this injury 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.200
 both non-athletic from Madrid 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.879
 practically ended mine. 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.159
 dating with madrid athletic 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.590
 there I was very bad at the selection that 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.540
 I was summoned to the world cup is 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.560
 when he actually spoke that he had 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.329
 broke the fibula and had ruptured 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.599
 practically all ligaments in the 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.609
 Ankle I cried a lot because I saw 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.280
 in the world cup although I saw that 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:08.489
 stage of my career though 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.010
 and it was was very painful for me 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.359
 from that moment it could not operate 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.879
 usually the player 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:19.489
 the apology is a very thankless word 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.489
 I do not think in our life, right? 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.180
 of course you may not yet have 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.520
 had the intention but after making the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.490
 The way he did come ask me 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.430
 sorry 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.310
 it's complicated and at that moment it was 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.230
 also very nervous I did not want to talk 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.230
 Minded I did not want the excuses. 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.960
 I did not accept his excuses for 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.780
 the region and manages to gather in new york 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.770
 the white river your pot looked like 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.310
 finished 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.920
 the only goal that had an idea of 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.410
 football very different from 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.890
 how do I know how people think I'm not 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.400
 Brazil 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:07.900
 she was very tactical and it's players 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.170
 light as I am of these attacking socks 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:15.879
 had a lot of space in the head of the arrigo 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.139
 he was a was a very very coach 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.919
 more 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.539
 Let's say so I think 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.690
 preserved the strength of the 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:29.350
 talent was then that two lines of 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.620
 four with two players is strong 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.199
 physically in front he did not like 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.669
 much technical talent was one 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.520
 a totally different game vision 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:44.380
 of the style and then I started to have many 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.729
 Problems with rice here? 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.820
 tactical issue 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.320
 I stayed for a year and I went back and 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.280
 athletic madrid no longer counted 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.990
 with me then he reminds me that in 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.990
 era was 11 raniere 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.140
 I do not know if it was the ranieri that 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.060
 I did not want to be the club since I did not 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.030
 I even wanted to take care of my 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.970
 very high contract 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.050
 and then the danielle from the beginning said 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.050
 that did not count on me
