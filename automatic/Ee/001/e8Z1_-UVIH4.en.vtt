exactly almost exactly what the next
Ford<00:00:11.429> Fiesta<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.540> look<00:00:12.719> like<00:00:13.250> as<00:00:14.250> you

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
Ford Fiesta is going to look like as you

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.970 
Ford Fiesta is going to look like as you
can<00:00:14.549> see<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.210> lot<00:00:15.480> lot<00:00:15.900> sexier<00:00:16.440> than<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
can see it's a lot lot sexier than the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.720 
can see it's a lot lot sexier than the
current<00:00:17.279> car<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.730> lot<00:00:18.060> curvier<00:00:19.490> looks<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.609> lot

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
current car a lot curvier looks a lot

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.370 
current car a lot curvier looks a lot
more<00:00:20.880> prone<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:21.750> about<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.109> pounce

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
more prone like it's about to pounce

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.019 
more prone like it's about to pounce
like<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:22.830> moving<00:00:23.100> while<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:23.699> standing

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
like it's moving while it's standing

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.019 
like it's moving while it's standing
still<00:00:24.269> even<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.619> because<00:00:26.039> Ford<00:00:26.730> spent<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
still even this is because Ford spent a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.939 
still even this is because Ford spent a
lot<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.240> time<00:00:27.480> doing<00:00:27.900> research<00:00:28.050> with<00:00:28.590> young

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
lot of time doing research with young

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.740 
lot of time doing research with young
Italian<00:00:29.429> ladies<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> they<00:00:30.240> said<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.660> they

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
Italian ladies and they said that they

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900 
Italian ladies and they said that they
wanted<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> car<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.380> looked<00:00:31.710> sprinty<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.610> I

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
wanted a car that looked sprinty and I

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.639 
wanted a car that looked sprinty and I
think<00:00:33.180> four<00:00:33.480> designers<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:34.170> given<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
think four designers are given them a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.910 
think four designers are given them a
car<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.010> looks<00:00:35.190> sprinty<00:00:36.440> if<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.559> go<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
car that looks sprinty if we go to the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.660 
car that looks sprinty if we go to the
front<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:39.239> grille<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:40.100> gaping<00:00:41.100> almost<00:00:41.520> like

like<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.360> grille<00:00:45.840> will<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.110> smaller

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
like that that grille will be smaller

the<00:00:47.340> grille<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> top<00:00:47.940> will<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.329> bigger

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
the grille at the top will be bigger
