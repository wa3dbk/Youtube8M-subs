reviewing the PlayStation 2 version of

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.090 
reviewing the PlayStation 2 version of
the<00:00:33.270> game<00:00:33.390> The<00:00:34.230> Sims<00:00:34.260> busting<00:00:34.860> out<00:00:34.980> was

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the game The Sims busting out was

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.240 
the game The Sims busting out was
released<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> year<00:00:36.170> 2003<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.160> has

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
released in the year 2003 so it has

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.910 
released in the year 2003 so it has
about<00:00:38.400> eight<00:00:38.670> years<00:00:38.970> old<00:00:39.180> now<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:40.739> game

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
about eight years old now and the game

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.440 
about eight years old now and the game
is<00:00:41.130> showing<00:00:41.400> it's<00:00:41.520> AIDS<00:00:41.760> definitely

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
is showing it's AIDS definitely

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.240 
is showing it's AIDS definitely
graphically<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.590> think<00:00:43.830> this<00:00:43.950> game<00:00:44.220> is

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
graphically but I think this game is

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.299 
graphically but I think this game is
mean<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.790> best<00:00:45.320> console<00:00:46.320> Sims<00:00:46.650> games<00:00:46.950> ever

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
mean the best console Sims games ever

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
mean the best console Sims games ever

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
there it was a simulation of real-life

considering you play video games to get

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.870 
considering you play video games to get
away<00:01:09.420> from<00:01:09.690> your<00:01:10.020> life<00:01:10.100> but<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.580> not<00:01:11.760> that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it out for yourself

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.570 
it out for yourself
the<00:01:16.140> amount<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.440> stuff<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:17.010> do<00:01:17.190> that<00:01:17.490> you

the amount of stuff you can do that you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.070 
the amount of stuff you can do that you
can<00:01:17.730> build<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.300> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.540> make<00:01:18.690> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.960> do

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
can build that you can make you can do

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.670 
can build that you can make you can do
with<00:01:19.200> your<00:01:19.290> sims

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
with your sims

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.060 
with your sims
I<00:01:20.720> haven't<00:01:21.720> played<00:01:21.840> The<00:01:22.050> Sims<00:01:22.290> 3<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.650> consoles

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
I haven't played The Sims 3 on consoles

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.950 
I haven't played The Sims 3 on consoles
so<00:01:23.370> I<00:01:23.400> can't<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:23.820> compare<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> but

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
so I can't really compare this to it but

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.140 
so I can't really compare this to it but
I<00:01:25.020> love<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.350> since<00:01:25.710> passing<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.610> uses<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
I love to since passing out it uses a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
I love to since passing out it uses a
courser<00:01:27.420> system<00:01:27.870> instead<00:01:28.230> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.470> 3d<00:01:29.100> feel

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
courser system instead of the 3d feel

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.360 
courser system instead of the 3d feel
that<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.570> sims<00:01:30.810> 2<00:01:31.080> uses<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.620> consoles<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.220> it

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
that the sims 2 uses on consoles and it

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.430 
that the sims 2 uses on consoles and it
works<00:01:32.550> really<00:01:32.760> well<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.450> course<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.230> game

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
works really well of course this game

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.830 
works really well of course this game
was<00:01:34.650> made<00:01:34.890> using<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.640> mouse<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.150> keyboard<00:01:36.330> so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
was made using a mouse and keyboard so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.450 
was made using a mouse and keyboard so
it<00:01:37.200> doesn't<00:01:37.470> feel<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.740> natural<00:01:37.950> when<00:01:38.370> you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it doesn't feel as natural when you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.310 
it doesn't feel as natural when you
using<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> mouse<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.420> overall<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> controls

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
using the mouse but overall the controls

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.290 
using the mouse but overall the controls
for<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.740> great<00:01:41.190> use<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.790> directional<00:01:42.240> buttons

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
for a great use the directional buttons

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.690 
for a great use the directional buttons
through<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.200> menus<00:01:43.410> if<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.800> moods<00:01:44.070> your
