00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:11.090
 there's your little friend from the middle of the 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.030
 half 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.779
 that the worst of all was the little grace 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.779
 of the previous 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.680
 he does television very little because he wants 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.870
 show one thing a public had 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.230
 painted the jury on each side my life 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.230
 no way 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.860
 I'll tell you when she came this is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.140
 the show sooo great I do not want to talk 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 of past issues I want to see what you do 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.010
 on the track your previous and your dance and there 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.620
 if you want we discuss as with all 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.190
 participants at the same time 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:17.380
 but other parts do not have is the same 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:17.380
 command on the coasts 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.610
 What I do want to tell you is that here 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.640
 begins a new contest here is where 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.320
 you really see that fame costs and is 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.560
 here with sweat where you start to achieve 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:45.190
 what had not told me 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.190
 good previous 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.979
 forgiveness regardless of the previous 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.979
 If it was loose, it was not loose if it danced 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.470
 we have a note competing 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.399
 Well, Miss Sarabia, has there been 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.170
 a big fan of uruguay how 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.980
 you felt the debut how are you getting 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.750
 it seems the score good nothing the debut 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.000
 well I would have liked to be a little 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.430
 quieter as it was quite the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.230
 my straps not beyond the nerves 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.550
 it's like before we left that we left 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.870
 We did not go out We did not go out 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.580
 we went out we did not go out 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.950
 jumping me the extreme because there was 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.270
 lowered and the bug came out had run 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.519
 everything and really does not give us the time 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.800
 fixed as I said sorry to go up 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.180
 suddenly not if we go down as we go down 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:47.140
 the guys put the pose and advance the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:50.180
 feline mine so 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.950
 pique this all have waited and have 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.120
 had to go home I do not go to 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.750
 to complain about why they made me 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.180
 wait 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.680
 it was not the fact that that run on 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.540
 that previous also what you did with 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.269
 marcelo as this sense and good not in 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.769
 the beach like I think it was missing 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.989
 I had a lot more prepared things 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.580
 but there was no time I felt that or 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.580
 that Marcelo wanted to tell them anything 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.020
 I do not know anything or I think the days 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.550
 that there is time the bank said 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.170
 solita was left, we gave him to approach 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.970
 the cookies after I'm in the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.780
 same place that avis and then the same 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.220
 place 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:34.680
 no no no I do not want to have time to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:39.240
 feel like tara and what he means 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.240
 has some little things vicky crouches 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.480
 very funny losses that all 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.460
 we love 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.790
 we are fans of vicky xipolitakis and 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.790
 everyone 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.730
 polino the sentence put him a 1 so 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.280
 She is very pretty, but that is 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.370
 very nice expressions of any 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.500
 way 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.739
 I think I recommend you do not do the neil 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:26.060
 art because it does not come up on camera is the same 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:28.889
 he's telling the girls how good 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.300
 children equal more than a month and a half not 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:36.260
 I will stay because they insisted a lot 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.260
 they're dancing but he did not say that 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:48.030
 with an injury the long weekend to 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:57.740
 Although he did not leave 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:57.740
 and it's a lot because the one that breaks a spear 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.960
