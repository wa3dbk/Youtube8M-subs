00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 and therefore a warm welcome too 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.600
 this fourth year to the fourth and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.670
 actually most exciting sneak peek that 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 we just got and you can 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.030
 not much in this picture here 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.580
 but what should be able to recognize that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.509
 represent a new dark entity 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.090
 you can see it is very clear here 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.039
 something made of stone with red lights 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.590
 eyes and down iceman 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.420
 fireworks so i can not now 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.680
 imagine that it has something to do with 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.240
 laura to do as many drive 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.650
 she suspected me she is not after me 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.179
 a flight unit because she was swinging 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.320
 hattstein I can not 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.270
 imagine from this a flight unit 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.440
 We can read 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.930
 what else they wrote 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.140
 ward is mysterious create share this big 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.059
 five heitz in the shadows so what is 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 this mysterious big creature with 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.420
 fiery eyes what i am in the shade 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.860
 hidden they do not have more going 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
 no one does not know that they are mine 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.250
 a little bit after a big brother 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.210
 from golem but I can not 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.530
 Imagine it again 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.379
 slow content gives because we have yes 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.480
 Almost a golem 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.680
 I could imagine that it is 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.149
 difficult to say in any case 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.920
 there are still these stones in the background 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.260
 we are not able to see what 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.810
 Another really great one 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 can now take troops from the clan 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.700
 burgundy from the camp ami this must 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.110
 that means you can kick them out 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.840
 if they are not we use the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.040
 means you do not have to be extra as you do 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.140
 that else has always made easy in 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 some singleplayer mission gone 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 and then there simply quasi 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.909
 jobbed so you do not use them 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.470
 but you just have the now 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.890
 possibility the troops over easily 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.750
 to put out a delicious one again 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.520
 I find really crass that is 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.070
 actually a really cool update I 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.670
 I'm curious how it will be then 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.990
 if you donate troops gets his 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.340
 clear castle and then out again 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.630
 delete because then you could yes 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.799
 permanently donate quasi troops 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.750
 we let donate troops donate 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.460
 extinguish donate extinguish 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.840
 but I can imagine that there 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.460
 also used in the limit is quite 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.810
 normal that when it is fully donated that 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.880
 It does not matter if the troops are out again 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.500
 I can not be put or not now 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.980
 but do not say exactly at the time 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.090
 I could imagine 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.720
 so and what this troupe will be 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.040
 I find myself just a bit 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.270
 difficult to suspect that looks 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.040
 each time a stone creature out 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.230
 you see any with a creature with 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.520
 what has to do with lava like you have since 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.710
 I believe you are the mass you 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.150
 can give me much more ideas just in the 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.640
 comments clap if you something 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.990
 I've found something ahead of you 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.510
 knows yes super sail is indeed my father 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.910
 but you do not know it maybe 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.950
 someone of you with him together 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.970
 love mens super sell and write 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.230
 me your opinion in the comments so 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.400
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.080
 By the way, the unit was still there 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.940
 may get it that's not to 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.070
 100 percent confirms this unit 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.500
 to be available for city hall 9 that is 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.720
 the dark barak baracke on level 6 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.400
 it is mentioned that 9 can be available 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.380
 I do not imagine but supposedly 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.820
 should that be so 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.020
 again one or the other maybe already 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.430
 you notice the other updates 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.630
 you have seen in other videos if 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.650
 Do not tell her the other update videos 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.550
 I've seen linked correctly 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.900
 just below in the description 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.310
 otherwise I would say that to me one 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.550
 Thumbs up there little dark group 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.800
 just as cool for company so I think 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.330
 i like this lava this 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.320
 artikels already found in the dark 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.959
 studio 6 pretty cool so everyone likes 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.940
 once a level for the dark barracks 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.470
 and of course for the troupe 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.390
 then we get level 15,000 into it 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.470
 bed as I said now it's your turn me 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.470
 I'm good at it
