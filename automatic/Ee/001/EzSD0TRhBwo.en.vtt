00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it's in that movie if you recognize at

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.359 
it's in that movie if you recognize at
all<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.140> I'm<00:01:10.350> 1<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
all so this is what I'm 1 like this is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.280 
all so this is what I'm 1 like this is
the<00:01:11.430> look<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the look that I'm going for is the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
the look that I'm going for is the
reasoning<00:01:13.650> behind<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:14.280> I'm<00:01:14.460> picking<00:01:14.700> on

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
reasoning behind what I'm picking on

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.120 
reasoning behind what I'm picking on
this<00:01:15.299> particular<00:01:15.689> car<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.650> go<00:01:16.770> straight

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
this particular car so if we go straight

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.950 
this particular car so if we go straight
in<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.729> look<00:01:17.880> at<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> front<00:01:18.299> bumpers<00:01:18.689> there's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
in and look at the front bumpers there's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.480 
in and look at the front bumpers there's
the<00:01:19.170> carbon<00:01:19.409> splitter<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.130> splitter

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the carbon splitter and the splitter

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.100 
the carbon splitter and the splitter
with<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> cannons<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.390> went<00:01:21.689> ahead<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> choose

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
with the cannons I went ahead and choose

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.300 
with the cannons I went ahead and choose
that<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> think<00:01:22.560> they<00:01:22.740> look<00:01:22.770> closest

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that because I think they look closest

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
that because I think they look closest

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.420 
the GT wing on now for the wheels I
probably<00:03:01.349> could<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.650> gotten<00:03:01.829> a<00:03:01.950> lot<00:03:01.980> closer

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
probably could have gotten a lot closer

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.979 
probably could have gotten a lot closer
to<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.790> actual<00:03:03.120> picture<00:03:03.480> but<00:03:03.659> I<00:03:03.720> ended<00:03:03.930> up

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
to the actual picture but I ended up

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.750 
to the actual picture but I ended up
choosing<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.409> endo<00:03:04.739> v2s<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:05.579> thought

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
choosing the endo v2s because I thought

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.740 
choosing the endo v2s because I thought
they'd<00:03:05.879> look<00:03:06.060> really<00:03:06.329> good<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.659> I<00:03:06.720> really

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
they'd look really good and I really

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.110 
they'd look really good and I really
like<00:03:07.139> these<00:03:07.319> wheels<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.700> went<00:03:08.879> ahead<00:03:08.970> and

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
like these wheels so I went ahead and

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.879 
like these wheels so I went ahead and
chose<00:03:09.359> them<00:03:09.629> so<00:03:09.959> for<00:03:10.139> both<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.500> primary<00:03:10.680> and

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
chose them so for both the primary and

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.099 
chose them so for both the primary and
secondary<00:03:11.129> color<00:03:11.760> ended<00:03:12.090> up<00:03:12.209> going<00:03:12.389> for<00:03:12.540> dark

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
secondary color ended up going for dark

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.780 
secondary color ended up going for dark
blue<00:03:13.379> with<00:03:13.590> both<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:14.069> thought<00:03:14.549> it<00:03:14.700> looked

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
blue with both I thought it looked

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.460 
blue with both I thought it looked
really<00:03:15.030> nice<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:15.720> probably<00:03:15.959> not<00:03:16.049> an<00:03:16.170> exact

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
really nice it's probably not an exact

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.960 
really nice it's probably not an exact
match<00:03:16.709> probably<00:03:17.129> I<00:03:17.189> think<00:03:17.549> it's<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.819> bit

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
match probably I think it's a bit

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.580 
match probably I think it's a bit
lighter<00:03:18.239> at<00:03:18.449> the<00:03:18.480> color<00:03:18.780> but<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.079> really<00:03:19.379> liked

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
lighter at the color but I really liked

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.559 
lighter at the color but I really liked
how<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.829> dark<00:03:20.099> blue<00:03:20.310> look<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.269> ended<00:03:21.480> up

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
how the dark blue look so I ended up

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.409 
how the dark blue look so I ended up
going<00:03:21.750> as<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.199> said<00:03:22.440> dark<00:03:23.190> blue<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:23.699> both<00:03:24.209> the

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
going as I said dark blue for both the

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.680 
going as I said dark blue for both the
secondary<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.340> primary<00:03:26.340> color<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:27.090> for<00:03:27.629> the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
secondary and primary color and for the

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.599 
secondary and primary color and for the
wheel<00:03:27.840> color<00:03:28.139> I<00:03:28.230> ended<00:03:28.560> up<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:28.829> for<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
wheel color I ended up going for the

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.030 
wheel color I ended up going for the
black<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.569> just<00:03:31.019> looked<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.409> nice<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.949> it's

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
black I just looked really nice and it's

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.409 
black I just looked really nice and it's
kind<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.489> same<00:03:32.669> and<00:03:32.879> how<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.090> looks<00:03:33.239> like

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
kind of the same and how it looks like

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.360
