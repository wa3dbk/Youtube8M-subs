we actually want a break prop which is a
different<00:02:39.250> T<00:02:39.340> conventional<00:02:39.879> prop<00:02:40.090> which

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
different T conventional prop which

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.089 
different T conventional prop which
means<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.629> we<00:02:40.720> can<00:02:40.870> come<00:02:41.079> into<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.590> corner

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
means that we can come into the corner

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.339 
means that we can come into the corner
really<00:02:42.489> hot<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.970> we<00:02:43.359> can<00:02:43.480> back<00:02:43.690> off<00:02:43.870> right<00:02:44.170> in

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
really hot and we can back off right in

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.160 
really hot and we can back off right in
the<00:02:44.410> last<00:02:44.620> but<00:02:44.950> second

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
the last but second

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.900 
the last but second
break<00:02:47.170> crops<00:02:47.440> will<00:02:48.190> cause<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.730> slow

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
break crops will cause just a slow

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.630 
break crops will cause just a slow
quicker<00:02:49.330> with<00:02:49.630> corner<00:02:49.930> quicker<00:02:50.140> as<00:02:50.290> well<00:02:50.640> so

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
quicker with corner quicker as well so

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.010 
quicker with corner quicker as well so
your<00:02:51.760> top<00:02:51.910> ends<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.180> bit<00:02:52.210> slower<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.840> right

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
your top ends a bit slower is that right

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.720 
your top ends a bit slower is that right
our<00:02:53.440> top<00:02:53.680> end<00:02:53.860> still<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.130> same<00:02:54.310> still<00:02:54.670> the
