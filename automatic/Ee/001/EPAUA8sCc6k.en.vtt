00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.349
 how strange that dog is lying 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.230
 in the grass of what breed it will soon be 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.200
 will raise and we will see it better but as it is 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.090
 raised and is always high equal if there 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.519
 happens to meet a dog to do 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.199
 this kind of considerations is very important 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.890
 you probably met 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.080
 with the wells corghi indeed with one of the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.300
 trouble you forget because this could 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.480
 seem like a single race and instead are 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.480
 all 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.430
 actually they are two related breeds with 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.830
 a lot of things in common the face of 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.560
 fox dachshund body expression 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.930
 but in color and shape the color can 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.780
 be different and the queue appears e 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.150
 disappears depending on the breed then a 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.340
 body is a Welsh dog capable of 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.380
 gather the cattle according to the area 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.980
 in which the two have developed 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.560
 races 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.230
 we then have the wed corghi cardigan 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.180
 originating from the cardigan cir and the wales 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.960
 punk rock corghi coming from 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.960
 county of pembrokeshire 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.899
 the cardigan is older than punk rock 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.240
 apparently he was already taken up by the Celts 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.119
 3,000 years ago and that we were right 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.119
 them to take him to the British Isles 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.700
 today after 65 years of selection well 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.630
 each race has a distinct appearance 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.399
 precise 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.799
 yet being very strong the similarity of 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.560
 base it is possible to distinguish a cardigan 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.229
 by a member who even without looking if 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.119
 the queue is there or there is no punk rock 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.789
 in fact it is a bit smaller than it is 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.500
 decidedly shorter than the cardigan a 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.259
 lighter head and pointed ears 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.340
 while those of the cardigan year the point 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.989
 rounded 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.420
 in theory there is also a difference 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.090
 character is generally the pen broke 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.610
 more lively and by-one while the cardigan 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.349
 and more wary of strangers in 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.140
 however, practice individual differences 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.180
 but no these nuances because the 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.069
 character depends largely on the way 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.500
 in which the dog is raised and educated 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.380
 in all cases they are dogs 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.480
 cheerful and friendly la 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.489
 most striking difference between the two horns 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.400
 in reality it is neither morphological nor 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.190
 character instead lies in popularity 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.590
 and in the diffusion that sees winning 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.500
 punk rock with a ratio of about 10 to 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.780
 1 because this huge difference 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.000
 the answer has nothing to do 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.880
 with the physical or mental qualities of the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.910
 dogs should be sought only in the fact that a 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.890
 certain gentleman in 1933 decided to 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.150
 give away a pembroke puppy 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.579
 to his little daughter 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.940
 how can it done so insignificant 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.709
 influence the history of a race 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.650
 simple enough that the gentleman in 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.930
 question is called giorgio sixth duke 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.359
 of york and that the baby is called 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.000
 elizabeth and is destined to go up a 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.920
 day on the throne of England 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.470
 cardigan and always been the most 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.560
 quiet of the two we would dare to say the most 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.420
 philosopher and his sly fox face 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.400
 makes us understand clearly that we are not 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.610
 feels inferior to the most noble 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.100
 cousin so far we talked about 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.740
 bovary sheepdogs of dogs from 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.959
 work but today all over the world the 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.430
 wolves corghi and above all a dog from 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.200
 exposure and pet 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.050
 despite not having all the features 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.350
 typical of apartment breeds is 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.570
 certainly little but not very small not 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.620
 is a pocket dog and despite the 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.660
 short legs need a lot of bike not 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.820
 it has a fluent coat is not much 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.250
 flashy and in all sincerity 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.800
 no one would ever call it chicken 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.690
 of dog breeds is difficult 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.630
 to fall in love with a rope and record holder 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.310
 you need to know it thoroughly but 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.980
 knowing it you discover a character 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.530
 so rich in qualities that half dogs 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.450
 the end seems everyone else is 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.480
 difficult to fall in love at first sight of 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.769
 an adult corghi is almost impossible not to 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.990
 fall in love with a worry 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.210
 how do you not lose your head for 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.770
 these ears disproportionate that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.520
 they still don't know which way 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.840
 to go 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.240
 and what about these eyes so much 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.650
 expressive that is sometimes expected to 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.290
 the good cartoon puppy 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.950
 start talking to us 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.640
 anyone who has owned 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.920
 no longer able to make weapons, perhaps 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.230
 do when they gave it to the inhabitants 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.820
 of the rooster were added a small one 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.980
 spell that tied in such a way 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.860
 their little desserts are indissoluble 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.840
 steeds then a new companion man 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.300
 perhaps because of this spell 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.310
 the thor of a never free a dog 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.880
 so few will ever be seen 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.920
 subjects 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.170
 but of high quality as always happens 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.680
 for carefully selected breeds e 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:11.150
 without commercial influence so you do it 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.150
 they will sleep soundly
