00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and they're gaining right and that's for

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.940 
and they're gaining right and that's for
the<00:00:44.940> first<00:00:45.149> half<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.780> year<00:00:45.840> uh<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.620> seven

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the first half of this year uh for seven

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.410 
the first half of this year uh for seven
and<00:00:47.010> fourth<00:00:47.280> well<00:00:47.489> over<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> previous<00:00:48.270> year

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
and fourth well over the previous year

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.979 
and fourth well over the previous year
when<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.289> sold<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.829> think<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> dozen<00:00:50.640> cars

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
when they sold for I think a dozen cars

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.720 
when they sold for I think a dozen cars
okay<00:00:51.989> yes<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.379> from<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.949> think<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
okay yes it's up from that I think the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610 
okay yes it's up from that I think the
percentage<00:00:54.149> increase<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
percentage increase you know it's not a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
percentage increase you know it's not a
fair<00:00:55.860> comparison<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.370> among<00:00:57.180> those<00:00:57.329> cars

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
fair comparison but among those cars

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
fair comparison but among those cars
that's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.859> how<00:00:58.980> much<00:00:59.100> does<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.460> matter

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that's a so how much does that matter

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.459 
that's a so how much does that matter
well<00:01:00.359> there<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.780> are<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> bunch<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
well there are there are a bunch of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.709 
well there are there are a bunch of
other<00:01:01.710> classes<00:01:02.160> right<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:02.910> are<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.270> think

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
other classes right there are I think

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.479 
other classes right there are I think
about<00:01:03.840> sixteen<00:01:04.379> different<00:01:04.619> classes<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
about sixteen different classes in the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.179 
about sixteen different classes in the
report<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.939> read<00:01:06.090> today<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:08.040> that's

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
report that I read today that and that's

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.800 
report that I read today that and that's
just<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> those<00:01:08.939> classes<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> look<00:01:09.720> at

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
just one of those classes if you look at

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.840 
just one of those classes if you look at
overall<00:01:10.409> vehicle<00:01:10.710> registrations<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
overall vehicle registrations for the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.149 
overall vehicle registrations for the
state<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.119> California<00:01:12.630> there's<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> percentage

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
state of California there's a percentage

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.850 
state of California there's a percentage
of<00:01:14.400> vehicles<00:01:14.600> Tesla<00:01:15.600> still<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.900> less<00:01:16.110> than<00:01:16.259> 1%

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
of vehicles Tesla still is less than 1%

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.719 
of vehicles Tesla still is less than 1%
it<00:01:16.950> has<00:01:17.070> 0.6%<00:01:17.880> by<00:01:18.659> point<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.990> comparison<00:01:19.729> BMW

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
it has 0.6% by point of comparison BMW

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.570 
it has 0.6% by point of comparison BMW
is<00:01:20.790> 4%<00:01:21.150> Honda<00:01:21.689> has<00:01:21.900> 5%<00:01:22.259> Toyota<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> leader<00:01:23.430> at

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
is 4% Honda has 5% Toyota is a leader at

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.960 
is 4% Honda has 5% Toyota is a leader at
19%<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.630> 0.6<00:01:25.619> percent<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.430> 1

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
19% so they have 0.6 percent or 1

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.789 
19% so they have 0.6 percent or 1
percent<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:27.869> maybe<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.439> day<00:01:28.560> it'll<00:01:28.710> be

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
percent it was maybe some day it'll be

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.530 
percent it was maybe some day it'll be
at<00:01:28.860> 1%<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.520> fantastic<00:01:29.729> gains<00:01:30.270> going

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
at 1% if they have fantastic gains going

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480
