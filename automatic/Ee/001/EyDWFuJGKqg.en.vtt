just<00:00:52.949> individual<00:00:54.739> live-fire<00:00:55.739> training<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
just individual live-fire training is a

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.770 
just individual live-fire training is a
very<00:00:56.570> necessary<00:00:57.570> step<00:00:58.280> towards<00:00:59.780> combat

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
very necessary step towards combat

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
very necessary step towards combat
readiness<00:01:01.079> because<00:01:01.500> every<00:01:02.399> member<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.760> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
readiness because every member of that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.780 
readiness because every member of that
squad<00:01:03.329> must<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.830> comfortable<00:01:05.550> very

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
squad must be very comfortable very

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.420 
squad must be very comfortable very
confident<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> very<00:01:06.870> competent<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.920> terms<00:01:08.190> of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
confident and very competent in terms of

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.970 
confident and very competent in terms of
engaging<00:01:08.730> targets<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:10.110> safe<00:01:10.410> manner

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
engaging targets in a safe manner

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.680 
engaging targets in a safe manner
so<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.580> live-fire<00:01:12.060> training<00:01:12.210> there's<00:01:12.570> no

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
so the live-fire training there's no

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.810 
so the live-fire training there's no
other<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> simulate<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.250> there's<00:01:14.460> no<00:01:14.640> way

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
other way to simulate it there's no way

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.730 
other way to simulate it there's no way
to<00:01:14.850> replicate<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.200> only<00:01:16.350> way

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
to replicate it but that is the only way

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.620 
to replicate it but that is the only way
that<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.010> soldier<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.550> gonna<00:01:17.760> be<00:01:17.910> confident<00:01:18.450> in

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that a soldier is gonna be confident in

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.050 
that a soldier is gonna be confident in
his<00:01:18.870> own<00:01:18.900> skills<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.670> live-fire

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
his own skills is to do the live-fire

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.280 
his own skills is to do the live-fire
training<00:01:21.320> we<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.530> approximately<00:01:23.370> 45%<00:01:24.300> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
