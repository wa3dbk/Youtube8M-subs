is hold on you're going to need lots and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.740 
is hold on you're going to need lots and
lots<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.509> cash<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.070> i<00:01:44.189> have

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
lots of cash now as you can see i have

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.090 
lots of cash now as you can see i have
91,000<00:01:45.750> goals<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.110> i<00:01:46.170> think<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.470> pretty

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
91,000 goals so i think that that pretty

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.490 
91,000 goals so i think that that pretty
much<00:01:47.250> covers<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.060> think<00:01:48.840> you're<00:01:49.200> gonna<00:01:49.320> need

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
much covers it I think you're gonna need

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.469 
much covers it I think you're gonna need
a<00:01:49.560> round<00:01:49.829> probably<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.390> 30,000<00:01:51.390> or

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
a round probably like 30,000 or

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.480 
a round probably like 30,000 or
something<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.899> buy<00:01:52.049> all<00:01:52.350> three<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:53.040> deeds<00:01:53.310> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
something to buy all three like deeds I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.010 
something to buy all three like deeds I
think<00:01:53.670> ten<00:01:53.880> thousands<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> pretty<00:01:54.600> fair<00:01:54.750> deed

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
think ten thousands a pretty fair deed

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.959 
think ten thousands a pretty fair deed
price<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.979> i<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.399> deeds<00:01:56.640> are<00:01:56.790> going<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
price so i think the deeds are going to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:57.950 
price so i think the deeds are going to
be<00:01:57.030> expensive<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> buy

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
be expensive then you have to buy

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.510 
be expensive then you have to buy
materials<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.740> stuff<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.100> that's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
materials and stuff like that that's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.609 
materials and stuff like that that's
gonna<00:01:59.729> add<00:01:59.820> up<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> cost<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:01.110> at<00:02:01.200> least<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
gonna add up to a cost but at least a

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.350 
gonna add up to a cost but at least a
hundred<00:02:01.770> thousand<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.490> seems<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.060> lot

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
hundred thousand that seems like a lot

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.120 
hundred thousand that seems like a lot
to<00:02:03.390> me<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:03.840> i'm<00:02:03.960> gonna<00:02:04.079> sell<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.590> my<00:02:04.619> extra

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
also gonna want some inventory space

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.190 
also gonna want some inventory space
because<00:02:47.970> you're<00:02:48.090> gonna<00:02:48.210> want<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.660> buy<00:02:48.840> all

because you're gonna want to buy all
these<00:02:49.350> materials<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.160> assuming<00:02:50.910> these<00:02:51.000> things

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
these materials on assuming these things

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.020 
these materials on assuming these things
like<00:02:51.390> glass<00:02:51.840> logs<00:02:52.500> hinges<00:02:53.340> things<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.850> that

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
like glass logs hinges things like that

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.640 
like glass logs hinges things like that
I<00:02:54.330> think<00:02:54.750> they're<00:02:54.840> going<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.990> be<00:02:55.110> pretty<00:02:55.260> heavy

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
I think they're going to be pretty heavy

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.720 
I think they're going to be pretty heavy
when<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.890> add<00:02:56.010> them<00:02:56.160> up<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.459> you're<00:02:56.580> going<00:02:56.670> to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
when you add them up so you're going to

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.490 
when you add them up so you're going to
want<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.120> your<00:02:57.240> inventory<00:02:57.720> nice<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.290> low

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
want to have your inventory nice and low

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.040 
want to have your inventory nice and low
for<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.220> start<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.700> hearth<00:03:00.000> fire<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.600> that's

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
for the start of hearth fire and that's

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.900 
for the start of hearth fire and that's
this<00:03:01.230> little<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:01.680> round<00:03:02.010> up<00:03:02.190> going<00:03:02.490> on<00:03:02.640> here

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
this little just round up going on here

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.160 
this little just round up going on here
there<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.180> going<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.390> be<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.510> ton<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.780> videos

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
there is going to be a ton of videos

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.890 
there is going to be a ton of videos
from<00:03:04.500> me<00:03:04.740> not<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> full<00:03:05.850> let's<00:03:06.150> play<00:03:06.390> because<00:03:06.720> i

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
from me not a full let's play because i

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.540 
from me not a full let's play because i
don't<00:03:07.080> think<00:03:07.290> it's<00:03:07.380> warranting<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.100> let's<00:03:08.340> play

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
don't think it's warranting a let's play
