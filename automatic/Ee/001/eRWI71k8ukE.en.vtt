00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello everyone, but I took this 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.240
 computer and got one processor 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.160
 which we will test very straight 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.950
 I was worried about such a question to what extent 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.950
 overclock fx 8300 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.830
 eight core processor fx frequency 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.720
 33 gigahertz my personal opinion 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.699
 regardless of overclocking like this 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.119
 overclock this overclock processor 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.649
 which I have now I think that 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.440
 fx 8320 and 8350 are all the same as 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.860
 fx 8300 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.010
 this is not a rejected cycle which is bad 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.980
 chasing and just md decided to expand the range 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.920
 models and you can save by buying fx 8300 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.440
 I put it on maybe the rush I 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.719
 got out and not very good but we will find out 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.149
 and here I expressed my personal opinion on 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.170
 my opinion is the best processor on the market 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.930
 now of the eight cores well let's 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.920
 let's get started now in the test processor i 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.760
 already installed 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.890
 and will measure its power consumption 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.080
 I took this kind of stuff here. 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.439
 we will measure the power consumption there pir 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.930
 meters it connects here 6 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.850
 pin jack here on the output 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.890
 4 pin that connects to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.930
 motherboard and that is measured 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.750
 current that is suitable for power 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.060
 processor he accordingly to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.610
 learn about power in watts we need 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.640
 multiply the voltage on the tokdo is here 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.020
 of course it will most likely 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.409
 drop a little voltage there what is here 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.049
 gtx 470 video card that lives give 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.329
 goodness dfx eat well voltage will 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.210
 slightly less all the same 12 volts but if 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.040
 roughly it is 12 volts needed 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.189
 multiply by this we get the power in 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.700
 processor watts but what are we going to 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.700
 dough 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.310
 Now the computer is not loaded with anything 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.050
 the process is practical idle 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.000
 power consumption as it is called on 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:16.750
 the desktop into the game itself is a neighborhood of one 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.050
 ampere from fx 8340 processor shay model 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:26.050
 why run the test than the scourge 11 5 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:28.780
 We look that he will give out a current in a mode 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.900
 loads of all cores under almost 10 amps 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.480
 voltage on the 12 volt line now 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.480
 see 1184 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.780
 In the test, the processor scored 563 hundredths 5 ps 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.459
 it is so far all on par without overclocking 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.070
 went to krayzis 3 let's see 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.200
 as far as krayzis 3 loads the core 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.209
 processors how many cores does it use 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.090
 This is the latest game that is already 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.320
 can download not only none not 2 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.010
 processor cores 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.220
 here now krayzis we turn and see 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.290
 as the same processor core as a load 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.579
 visible load is approximately distributed 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.519
 of course 4 cores 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.590
 but approximately in principle there is no such thing 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.130
 any one of i'm dera loaded 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.950
 under a hundred percent and this is the processor for now 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.650
 that in the nominal without any overclocking 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.569
 in crisis the third processor is approximately 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:32.360
 consumes around 4 amps 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:37.900
 Well, try your luck in overclocking to home 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:41.060
 let's start somewhere around 3 8 gigahertz and 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.230
 already there if everything is stable 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:49.400
 I will quietly raise so ru tu that 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:53.450
 the one where we put the voltage there and 1 there 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.190
 This 3 volts will go to although you can even 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.230
 Marked in principle raise minutes 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:05.269
 let's put one 2965 and now 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:08.060
 look at a frequency of 4 2 gigahertz 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:11.709
 cpu scored 6 point eighty 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.709
 nine hundredths is pop 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.140
 Now the processor is loaded with dough than 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.610
 the furnace is open 4 2 gigahertz only when 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.610
 this area is 16 amps 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.370
 CPU managed to overclock to 4 and 8 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:32.010
 gigahertz is the result enough 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.360
 not bad for a budget option fx 8350 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.300
 worth it just happens to load 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.010
 hanging generally as noticed on think 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.040
 problem in the motherboard on this 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.570
 the motherboard is with me and msi 970 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.140
 and g46 as soon as the current comes in 20 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.750
 ampere 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.550
 Immediately happens, they can also be hung 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.370
 reduce the frequency and increase the voltage 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.220
 so that the current was at work more and all 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.190
 Equally where here for 20 amps immediately hung 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.920
 They I think all the same problem in semolina 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.140
 but what conclusions do I want to say about 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.110
 this processor yes of course, many say 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.030
 Oh and fixes there are many minuses basking 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.920
 great heat dissipation and 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.920
 energy consumption, respectively, at 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.990
 load but the most important thing is 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.200
 unlocked multiplier and price 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.900
 he is currently worth 5800 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.150
 rubles for the money I think it's just 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.210
 excellent processor with eight threads 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.810
 Entogo competitors in this style just 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.400
 No, of course, yes, most games 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.760
 optimized for dual core stands 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.680
 load 2 4 cores in principle, no now 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.990
 not a single game that would load everything 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.900
 eight cores but basically if 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.919
 Look here at the new games gta 5 here 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.990
 Witcher 3 higher do not already distribute 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.230
 load on all cores and basically here 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.630
 if from budget processors, that's it 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.960
 fx 8300 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:03.240
 an excellent choice for your money but what 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.240
 thank you all for watching
