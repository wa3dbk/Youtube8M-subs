00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 and there my dear friends who 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.640
 accompany the life science school 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.890
 by facebook by youtube 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.809
 pure beauty with all six of ours 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.330
 fifth class of the microbiology course 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.460
 we will follow the lessons of 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.940
 microscopy in this class we will talk 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.470
 the dark field microscopy 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.439
 specifically we are going to talk about the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.310
 general concepts that involve the use of 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.529
 dark field microscopy show how 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.750
 this microscopy it works and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.590
 obviously make a parallel of the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.800
 differences of the common optical microscopy and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.920
 show the applications of the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 dark field microscopy a good class 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.129
 quick little beauty 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.350
 Let's start here by showing the following 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.260
 for us to do the visualization of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.250
 any microorganism that is us 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.680
 we need tools that increase the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.780
 resolution capability of that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.059
 microorganisms that are the microscopes 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.370
 in the previous case in the previous video what 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.500
 we observed we studied a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.350
 optical microscope that we 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.320
 we charge a sample and we use a 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.260
 beam of light that is extended toward the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.090
 shows and passes through a series of lenses 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.689
 until our eyes reach the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.630
 resolution on that image is enlarged 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.420
 only in the case of the optical microscope 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.939
 common we have some problems 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.390
 example many times samples 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.540
 may suffer a color distortion 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.030
 it does not fit very well and when the light 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.820
 in that color we do not 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.579
 we can see the show a certain 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.040
 amount of detail and obviously this 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.189
 difficulty in visualization 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.070
 There are also samples from the sample that 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.170
 even went well but because they have structure 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.030
 extremely different than 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.610
 normally seen in the microscope 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.149
 common in the case eg spirochetes 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.899
 we can not see with so much 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.509
 sharpening that sample so pre- 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.849
 certain viewing conditions 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.610
 of the show structures is necessary 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.819
 only the reflection of the light emitted by 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.999
 same as that 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.609
 light emitted on the show and reflects all 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:22.609
 environment that is the background has no reflection 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:25.189
 light turns dark and this makes it 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.409
 very much the visualization and this is obtained 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.980
 using a field microscope 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:33.739
 that allows only the passage of 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.010
 light reflected by the lens show 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.680
 objective at first in the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.200
 optical microscope common to light 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.840
 reflects on the show and obviously the background 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.359
 also have light passing and then people 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.719
 see the whitish background in case 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.849
 darkfield microscope only 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:55.519
 light that is reflected by the show 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.799
 observed the whole bottom is left with a 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.650
 darkened picture and obviously this does not 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.719
 it is possible to see the sample with a 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.030
 more detail 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.400
 samples can only be viewed 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.099
 with a lot of detail in the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.659
 field microscopy bait for people 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.889
 understand the working mechanism of the 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.250
 first of all we have to give a 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.000
 look at the main components that 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.060
 make up ii 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.790
 the dark field optical microscope that 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.470
 are almost the same that make up the 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.810
 optical microscope then we have 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.389
 a source of lighting that the coach 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.949
 the condensation or the objectives 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.169
 and ocular lenses 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:35.989
 the main difference in relation to a 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:39.699
 common optical microscope is the presence of 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:43.009
 an opaque disc that is next to the 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:46.639
 capacitor and this allows us to 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:48.379
 just view the sample you have 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.509
 the reflection of light 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.639
 then we will understand how the 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.530
 dark field microscope making a 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:58.189
 comparative table so let's put 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.109
 here the lenses of both microscopes 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.719
 right on the left side we have the 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.780
 common microscope and on the right side of 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:08.269
 dark field and we have the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.039
 different sizes of microscopes that 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.939
 the light source represented here in 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.489
 yellow 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.859
 this intersection that the region is the 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.469
 shows and obviously here 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:22.010
 the eye of the observer who is well 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:24.830
 that the other girls are the lenses and that 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.570
 compose the microscopes both one and the 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.700
 other has the capacitor 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.700
 objective and 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.770
 calculates the good is when we observe in 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.700
 an optical microscope common to our 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.080
 light source 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.090
 she will totally go through a 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.460
 condenser and will achieve our shows 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.650
 that we will have here the reflections of 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.940
 light through other lenses until 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.790
 reach our eyes 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.300
 see that the whole source of light has passed through 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.730
 our show now in the case of 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.850
 dark field optical microscope that 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.970
 happens just before the condenser 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.240
 we have here one oops disk that does not 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.240
 allows all the light emitted to be 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.820
 passed to the condenser only one 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.310
 small fraction of light passes through the 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.730
 condenser and it is adjusted so that 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.030
 specifically target our show 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:18.610
 all in addition light that will pass through 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.240
 point is diverted and does not reach the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:25.000
 goal then in light it is not reflected 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.630
 here for the purpose so that only 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.170
 the light that hit the show gets 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.450
 reach our eyes and then the 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.180
 people can observe the show a 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.670
 much more detail 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.190
 take a look here this figure is a 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.220
 figure of a crystal obtained through the 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.870
 optical microscope provided that we 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.610
 we have a certain amount of detail 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.530
 that we can observe that these 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.370
 Snow crystals have almost a format 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.550
 pyramidal 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.560
 but if we observe these crystals 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.780
 obviously these are not more crystals 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.270
 similar in the optical microscope of 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.250
 dark field looks only at the difference 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.340
 see that we have been able to observe a 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.190
 too much detail since 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.240
 that the background in light does not pass through 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.270
 from the bottom 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.100
 it is reflected out of the lens and 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.650
 people can not observe the background it 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.930
 with a dark color is only 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.540
 our samples that are here can 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.850
 capture them and reflect them to the next 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.340
 milk then see that in the condition that the 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:30.490
 people observe that the differences in 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.050
 contrast and display quality of the 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.570
 much larger picture 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.730
 The kiss to see these 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.370
 these pictures that are not 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.240
 that can be cured or are poorly 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.260
 stained 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.270
 the microscope 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.790
 dark field it's an alternative 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.200
 very good so obviously we 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.730
 still talking the applications 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.980
 the main applications are the 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.370
 visualization of slightly colored samples 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.380
 that I told you before 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.720
 detection of many thin spirochetes 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.240
 times for us to detect syphilis in 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.250
 biological samples we used a 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.260
 optical microscope dark corner them 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.840
 They are very difficult to be found and 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.390
 to be observed in the common microscope 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.630
 becomes very difficult then uses if a 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.570
 dark field microscope and also we 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:19.990
 we were able to detail more structures in 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.790
 for samples that are poorly colored 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.280
 when we use a microscope 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.590
 optical system served in the previous figure 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.410
 which we can observe much more 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.330
 details of the crystals that were 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:35.040
 viewed through the microscope 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.540
 optical field listen to certain occasions 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.150
 allows the use of an optical microscope 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:44.200
 dark corner for observation of 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.580
 more details of personal beauty sample 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.560
 so this was the reference 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.390
 classic I used that lesson one 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.220
 class very fast, I hope you 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.990
 have enjoyed it if you liked fishing and 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.060
 Since then, it helps me to share the video 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.500
 The more you do that, but in 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.670
 October the boss more people are 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.510
 benefited here with the school of 

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.000
 life sciences 

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:03.280
 If you want to participate sign up 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.220
 here on the youtube channel and participate 

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.900
 side of page on facebook all 

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.330
 the information is here in the description 

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.760
 So this video of that person 

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:16.380
 strong hug to everyone keep god 

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.380
 until the next video, God willing
