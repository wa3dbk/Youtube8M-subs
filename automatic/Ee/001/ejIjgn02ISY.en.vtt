00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Confidence has come from the two wins we picked up and also the performance against Genoa

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But we shouldn't be looking too far ahead

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Fact is we've only won a single away game so far this season

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We’'e doing well in Europe but we still need another point to make sure of qualification

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We have to go into the match with our feet on the ground basically. We'll need balance and we have to know that tomorrow is a a big game for us as it would improve our league standing

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It won't be easy though as Livorno have played well in their last few games. The match against Juventus even though they lost and also against Verona before they let in the second goal

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I think we should be thinking only about tomorrow's game. We have to try and put a stop to what has been a negative tendency for us

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In 14 games we've only managed to keep a clean sheet on three occasions

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That's something that we've been working on and it's something that we definitely have to improve on. We can't continue conceding in every game we play

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If you keep a clean sheet, the worst that happen is a 0-0 draw

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
That’s a scoreline that doesn't happen often in the league so logically, if you don't concede you’ve got a much better chance of winning the game

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So we need to improve. We have to take things one step at a time but first anf foremost, we have to focus on tomorrow's game
