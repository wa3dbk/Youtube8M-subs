00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.869
 server that the truth is very good not 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.700

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.860

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.980

 I know how to vocalize well and have mini-games 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.130
 servers vpn server survival and is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.590

 minigames to watch what they 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.559
 I speak good as they see the star we 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.470
 indicates the two types of modalities that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.400
 there are as you see carlotto wake also 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.400
 there is call of duty 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.070
 is in what is the villa defends 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:09.530
 have to have a I think 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.530
 and I think I 'm deep in the nexus 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.700
 and many more but here in defending the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.630
 life I think no one messes up is very 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.870
 just how do you see Carlos Dure pixels 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.900

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.210
 there are several the truth that they are good as 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.850
 look, escape from the beast, let's go 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.340
 put us to one to see if 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.590
 works and see the truth that this 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.380
 server is very, very good 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.689
 I recommend since 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.719
 They do not have anything I've been told 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.700
 that the server is very good and therefore my 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.299
 subscribers if they want to go out in videos 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.990
 that I'm going to be recording this is the 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.750
 server where I'll be 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.189
 recording videos of minecraft and had them 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.250
 said that I was going to start with with the one 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.990
 plants against zombies but I'm not going to 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.640
 climb what is minecraft plants against 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.759
 zombies and I'm going to put other games 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.200
 also and I hope you like it and if not 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.230
 possible to improve the videos 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.790

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.819
 I thank you very much because not only 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.010

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.359

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.389
 Once they are good I think this map is 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.950
 who is supported I think so because 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.849

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.790
 they serve and if it has touched me if I think so 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:50.800
