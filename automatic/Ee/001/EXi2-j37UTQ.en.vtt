out<00:03:56.680> some<00:03:57.069> Pokemon<00:03:57.579> ears<00:03:57.879> um<00:03:58.359> I<00:03:59.230> realized

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
out some Pokemon ears um I realized

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.949 
out some Pokemon ears um I realized
after<00:04:00.340> cooking<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:00.849> that<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.299> ears<00:04:01.510> kept

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
after cooking it that the ears kept

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.259 
after cooking it that the ears kept
falling<00:04:02.409> off<00:04:02.560> but<00:04:03.189> no<00:04:03.489> problem<00:04:03.970> because<00:04:04.090> you

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
falling off but no problem because you

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.470 
falling off but no problem because you
can<00:04:04.599> definitely<00:04:04.829> just<00:04:05.829> fix<00:04:06.220> that<00:04:06.489> by<00:04:06.790> icing<00:04:07.329> it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
can definitely just fix that by icing it

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.500 
can definitely just fix that by icing it
cuz<00:04:07.689> the<00:04:07.840> icing<00:04:08.439> will<00:04:08.609> act<00:04:09.609> like<00:04:09.730> glue<00:04:10.090> and

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
cuz the icing will act like glue and

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.349 
cuz the icing will act like glue and
will<00:04:11.319> stick<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.829> will<00:04:12.430> stick<00:04:12.760> your<00:04:12.939> cookies

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
will stick it will stick your cookies

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.740 
will stick it will stick your cookies
together<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.769> if<00:04:15.489> you<00:04:15.669> have<00:04:15.790> broken<00:04:16.000> ears<00:04:16.479> like

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
together so if you have broken ears like

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.020 
together so if you have broken ears like

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
I did don't worry about it because icing

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:29.110

turn into like white icing now after we
hit<00:06:01.020> this<00:06:01.200> icing<00:06:01.650> made<00:06:01.770> again<00:06:02.370> if<00:06:02.640> it's<00:06:02.970> really

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
hit this icing made again if it's really

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.030 
hit this icing made again if it's really
soupy<00:06:04.140> looking<00:06:04.500> you<00:06:04.890> can<00:06:04.920> put<00:06:05.280> more<00:06:06.020> sugar

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
soupy looking you can put more sugar

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.260 
soupy looking you can put more sugar
more<00:06:08.040> powdered<00:06:08.340> sugar<00:06:08.400> in<00:06:08.730> it<00:06:08.880> and<00:06:09.030> it<00:06:09.150> will

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
more powdered sugar in it and it will

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.140 
more powdered sugar in it and it will
thicken<00:06:09.450> up<00:06:09.720> I<00:06:10.100> made<00:06:11.100> a<00:06:11.130> few<00:06:11.370> batches<00:06:11.550> of<00:06:11.970> this

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
thicken up I made a few batches of this

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.840 
thicken up I made a few batches of this
so<00:06:12.840> you<00:06:13.500> can<00:06:13.680> also<00:06:13.800> do<00:06:14.100> that<00:06:14.220> if<00:06:14.370> you<00:06:14.460> want<00:06:14.610> more

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
so you can also do that if you want more

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:33.249 
so you can also do that if you want more
colors

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.189 

so<00:06:34.039> I<00:06:34.280> just<00:06:34.460> have<00:06:34.639> to<00:06:34.759> set<00:06:34.970> Walmart<00:06:35.419> it's<00:06:35.720> 12

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
so I just have to set Walmart it's 12

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.760 
so I just have to set Walmart it's 12
Ising<00:06:36.800> hopes<00:06:37.389> I'm<00:06:38.389> also<00:06:38.690> using<00:06:38.960> piping<00:06:39.590> bags

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
Ising hopes I'm also using piping bags

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.890 
Ising hopes I'm also using piping bags
for<00:06:40.009> more<00:06:40.220> control<00:06:40.699> over<00:06:40.729> where<00:06:41.300> my<00:06:41.509> icing

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
for more control over where my icing

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.040 
for more control over where my icing
goes<00:06:42.190> so<00:06:43.190> I<00:06:43.220> found<00:06:43.610> that<00:06:43.819> this<00:06:44.030> icing<00:06:44.690> it<00:06:44.930> was

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
goes so I found that this icing it was

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.960 
goes so I found that this icing it was
really<00:06:45.349> hard<00:06:45.560> to<00:06:45.620> show<00:06:45.889> you<00:06:45.949> guys<00:06:46.220> how<00:06:46.610> I<00:06:46.639> did

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
it but I am basically just going really

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.939
