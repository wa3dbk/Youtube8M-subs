00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.500
Come on, all together we make the revolution

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.000
fianÃ§ailles

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.500
I loved you since before you were born

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.000
You are the person of destiny that I have not yet met

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.900
The time is separating us for no reason

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.000
While I look outside I see 
loneliness spreading in every direction

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.200
I wander looking for you 
as if I had been invited by the wind

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.000
Where you blooming now?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:33.500
Riding a chariot of light
we fly higher than anyone else

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.000
You show yourself as a figure of seven colors as the rainbow

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.400
And then, you blossom at my side

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.800
On earth the noisy flowers

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.700
are they composing a melody with their hearts?

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.000
The sky burst into tears just like you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.200
The heart starts to ache

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:48.800
Riding a chariot of light we fly higher than anyone else

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.900
You show yourself to me as a figure of seven colors as the rainbow

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.200
And then, you blossom at my side

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:19.400
~In the heart of every person
is going to bloom the flower of destiny~

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.000
Come, let's pray together

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.380
to ensure that our desire may reach the entire world

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.100
The rainbow that appeared in the sky

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.000
was a flower that shone in seven colors

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.500
Thinking that "certainly we will meet" makes me change gently

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.300
Keep blooming until I'll see you
