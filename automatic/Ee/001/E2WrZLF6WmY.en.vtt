 pitol and montecelo red bull we do not speak of the wound of the summer but of the 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.690
 ice cream flavors that succeed this year 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.100
 creativity is also very present among the ice cream craftsmen 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.579
 who try to innovate in their creations to get each time 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.800
 harder to choose a flavor when we sit in an ice cream parlor 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.320
 not to mention side of hope sponge that does not leave any child indifferent 

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:24.319
 and neither to adults 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.589
 like every summer 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.710
 with the heat anyone wants an ice cream 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.070
 the traditional flavors have been giving way to others with difficult 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.220
 names and made with ingredients that until recently would be unimaginable 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.850
 think 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.560
 express lemon chocolate we can remove each year the ice cream parlors offer 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.850
 more flavors and it is more difficult to choose one 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 but why choose is only one 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.329
 in this one of the day of torrevieja 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.680
 they have dared to mix ice cream and innovation 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.120
 Each year they create seven new flavors, some of them so surprising 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.850
 like the mojito of cotton candy or sponge 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.400
 how are we innovating 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.880
 The first thing we look for is 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.070
 that people do not believe this trance of the same for the chest an aspect 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.330
 additional can not miss 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.750
 but percent to pol-ka we only have our department 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.870
 dd dd 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.800
 tasted let's say where it is used for flavors do not start with flavors 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.690
 new 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.320
 we have six months to look for flavors 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.320
 we look at what flavors like which we can not like 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.780
 and according to that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.690
 we prepare ourselves before we die 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.120
 we try them and say you may like 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.650
 the vacationers 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.900
 they look for the novelties but always maintaining the artisan character of 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.080
 The Ice creams 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.890
 not that the only thing 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.480
 the ice cream man says 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.030
 What is the love of work that makes an ice cream come out well and has an end 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.030
 but always taking care of the elaboration process 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.410
 the vecchia signora is advised hour is a pasteurizing machine where 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.039
 exhibits milk room 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.179
 it ends, you use regrets 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.959
 the detainees are all oscar 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.040
 percent sbk that lower the temperature to 6 degrees when already up to six degrees 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.040
 as 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.539
 but to kick this machine you already play 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.849
 then we were going to do 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.369
 he was squeezing a certain amount of dulce de leche his additives his preparations 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:42.739
 we assemble a machine 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.829
 here we do not agree that he sold titles 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.309
 and after this we can freeze 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.799
 I'm at least nine degrees 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.829
 when she goes out 9 10 degrees 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.069
 we do not go down and put it to a camera 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.069
 that is minus 32 degrees that after 15 thousand 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.129
 and villa after this 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.289
 we passed it to the end 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.559
 for consume 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:09.099
 we can meet with more than 200 varieties of ice cream 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.239
 but the ice cream makers seek to differentiate themselves from the competition with each ball 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.730
 trying to play with soft and delicate flavors that adapt to the moment 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.109
 cost of the client's mood 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.089
 Well, we have 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:24.379
 by the way, it is not 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.209
 exotic fruits 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.629
 flavors that you have a lot and then everything that is of this that we do 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.889
 little for example white chocolate with a veining 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:39.429
 in fact colate with hazelnut or cream mixed with alcohol j jam 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.289
 Strawberry oo mango jam 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.000

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.599
 they will tear off a little people go through their hands 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.389
 more and more the ice cream sector are concerned not only with the quality but 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.259
 also for the presentation of their ice cream 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:04.359
 now the customer no longer only wants an artisanal ice cream, but seeks a flavor 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.079
 innovative with colors dyn the fruits and cookies that accompany it 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.419

 deceased posco the classics the chocolate the native nougat teapot 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.939
 we decided to incorporate flavors that would attract attention 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.150
 and in fact before mentioned a lot of acceptance 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.320
 from the fruit cd more acid flavors

 The Ice creams 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.740
 they are taken throughout the year it is no longer a summer industry 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.389
 although this is the time of most affluence in ice cream parlors 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.909
 It is also a business that does not understand age or nationality 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.370
 It has a lot of tourism 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.259
 or the international 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.659

 this year nobody will be left without taking ice cream 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.930
 since we also find ept and sugar-free products 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.159
 there is no excuse for not resisting temptation
