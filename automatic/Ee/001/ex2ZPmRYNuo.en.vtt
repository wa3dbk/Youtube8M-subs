00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
textures are pretty high res compared to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.690 
textures are pretty high res compared to
the<00:02:17.950> other<00:02:18.069> games<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:20.500> know<00:02:20.700> this

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.820 
kind of just looks like a simple one
from<00:02:27.150> early<00:02:28.150> source<00:02:28.450> games<00:02:28.750> like<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.379> know<00:02:29.709> I

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
from early source games like I know I

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.500 
from early source games like I know I
know<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.220> not<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.430> big<00:02:30.730> budget<00:02:30.970> thing<00:02:31.299> but

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
know it's not a big budget thing but

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.970 
know it's not a big budget thing but
he's<00:02:31.599> using<00:02:31.780> pre-rendered<00:02:32.410> stuff<00:02:32.650> he<00:02:32.830> could

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
he's using pre-rendered stuff he could

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.250 
he's using pre-rendered stuff he could
dare<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.790> use<00:02:33.910> better<00:02:34.540> sort<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.930> lighting

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
dare to use better sort of lighting

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.430 
dare to use better sort of lighting
setup<00:02:36.010> um<00:02:36.730> pretty<00:02:37.269> bland<00:02:37.599> color<00:02:37.959> scheme<00:02:38.260> as

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
setup um pretty bland color scheme as

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.199

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
well I don't mean like the walls and

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.690 
well I don't mean like the walls and
stuff<00:02:40.329> I<00:02:40.510> just<00:02:40.720> mean<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.019> looks<00:02:41.200> very<00:02:41.459> kind<00:02:42.459> of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
stuff I just mean it looks very kind of

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.940 
stuff I just mean it looks very kind of
a<00:02:44.040> pea<00:02:45.040> kike<00:02:45.670> looks<00:02:46.480> very<00:02:46.660> plaster<00:02:47.260> II<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.560> don't

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
a pea kike looks very plaster II I don't

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.020 
a pea kike looks very plaster II I don't
know<00:02:48.069> if<00:02:48.190> that's<00:02:48.370> something<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.790> do<00:02:48.880> with

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
know if that's something to do with

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.009 
know if that's something to do with
video<00:02:49.390> compression<00:02:49.870> but<00:02:50.739> uh<00:02:50.799> I<00:02:51.630> think<00:02:52.630> another

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
video compression but uh I think another

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.750 
video compression but uh I think another
part<00:02:53.319> was<00:02:53.470> especially<00:02:53.920> with<00:02:54.190> foxy<00:02:54.549> in<00:02:54.670> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
part was especially with foxy in the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.890 
part was especially with foxy in the
cupboard<00:02:55.030> as<00:02:55.150> well<00:02:55.299> I'm<00:02:55.569> sorry<00:02:56.380> closet<00:02:57.900> he

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
cupboard as well I'm sorry closet he

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.039 
cupboard as well I'm sorry closet he
looks<00:02:59.140> really<00:02:59.380> there's<00:03:00.250> no<00:03:00.459> sort<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:01.049> like

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
looks really there's no sort of like

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.610

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
kind of looks really dry I I know an

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.750 
kind of looks really dry I I know an
animatronic<00:03:08.620> wouldn't<00:03:09.099> be<00:03:09.220> moist<00:03:09.459> but

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
animatronic wouldn't be moist but

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.729 
animatronic wouldn't be moist but
there's<00:03:10.269> no<00:03:10.420> sort<00:03:10.630> of<00:03:10.720> slickness<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.590> like

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
there's no sort of slickness to it like

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.229 
there's no sort of slickness to it like
that<00:03:11.859> has<00:03:12.040> been<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> animatronics<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
that has been in the animatronics in the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.759 
that has been in the animatronics in the
previous<00:03:13.540> games<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:14.079> don't<00:03:14.440> know<00:03:14.530> if<00:03:14.590> that's

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
previous games I don't know if that's

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.500 
previous games I don't know if that's
meant<00:03:14.889> to<00:03:14.980> be<00:03:15.130> a<00:03:15.160> realism<00:03:15.549> thing<00:03:15.880> but<00:03:16.060> it

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
meant to be a realism thing but it

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.090 
meant to be a realism thing but it
certainly<00:03:16.870> doesn't<00:03:17.290> look<00:03:17.410> like<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.859> has<00:03:17.980> the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
certainly doesn't look like it has the

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.039 
certainly doesn't look like it has the
same<00:03:18.280> sort<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.579> style<00:03:18.819> to<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.480> definitely

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
same sort of style to it I definitely

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.530 
same sort of style to it I definitely
there<00:03:20.769> definitely<00:03:21.069> expected<00:03:21.940> like<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.450> be

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
there definitely expected like to be

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.690 
there definitely expected like to be
bouncing<00:03:22.989> off<00:03:23.079> these<00:03:23.290> guys<00:03:23.530> as<00:03:23.709> teeth<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.250> the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
bouncing off these guys as teeth and the

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.789 
bouncing off these guys as teeth and the
metal<00:03:24.910> parts<00:03:25.269> inside<00:03:25.569> of<00:03:25.750> them<00:03:25.870> but<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.650> know

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
metal parts inside of them but you know

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.960 
metal parts inside of them but you know
I<00:03:27.069> guess<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:29.220> don't<00:03:30.220> know<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.519> could<00:03:30.549> be<00:03:30.819> the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
I guess I don't know it could be the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.629 
I guess I don't know it could be the
compression<00:03:31.660> again<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.049> doubt<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.410> I'm<00:03:32.980> someone

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
compression again I doubt it I'm someone

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.039 
compression again I doubt it I'm someone
saying<00:03:33.850> this<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.180> just<00:03:34.389> a<00:03:34.480> teaser<00:03:34.690> but<00:03:34.930> this

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
saying this is just a teaser but this

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.360 
saying this is just a teaser but this
looks<00:03:35.230> like<00:03:35.410> it's<00:03:35.590> pretty<00:03:35.709> much<00:03:35.950> finished

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
looks like it's pretty much finished

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.490 
looks like it's pretty much finished
product<00:03:36.849> i<00:03:37.030> like<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.540> little<00:03:37.750> robots<00:03:38.319> and

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
product i like the little robots and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.349 
product i like the little robots and
stuff<00:03:38.680> looks<00:03:39.639> like<00:03:39.790> it'll<00:03:39.940> have<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.120> lot<00:03:40.329> of

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
stuff looks like it'll have a lot of

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.839 
stuff looks like it'll have a lot of
nights<00:03:40.630> touches<00:03:41.200> there's<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.650> purple<00:03:42.010> fan<00:03:42.310> so

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
nights touches there's a purple fan so

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.289 
nights touches there's a purple fan so
obviously<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.510> means<00:03:43.540> something<00:03:45.299> maybe

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
obviously that means something maybe

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.699 
obviously that means something maybe
maybe<00:03:46.690> because<00:03:47.200> there's<00:03:47.470> all<00:03:47.590> these

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
maybe because there's all these

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.000 
maybe because there's all these
different<00:03:47.980> rooms<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:48.819> look<00:03:49.120> around<00:03:49.419> um

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
different rooms that you look around um
