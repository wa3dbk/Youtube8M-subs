00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.640 

of<00:00:16.670> many<00:00:17.179> detailed<00:00:17.750> pieces<00:00:18.080> of<00:00:18.320> information

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
of many detailed pieces of information

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.900 
of many detailed pieces of information
on<00:00:19.220> here<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:20.829> the<00:00:21.829> cooking<00:00:22.250> of<00:00:22.400> your<00:00:22.640> firmware

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
on here and the cooking of your firmware

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.499 
on here and the cooking of your firmware
is<00:00:23.329> done<00:00:23.660> entirely<00:00:24.789> unrestricted<00:00:25.789> -<00:00:26.029> inside

is done entirely unrestricted - inside
the<00:00:26.750> application<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:28.279> main<00:00:28.519> reason<00:00:28.970> for<00:00:29.000> this

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
the application the main reason for this

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.870 
the application the main reason for this
is<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.840> fact<00:00:30.019> that<00:00:30.349> every<00:00:31.250> time<00:00:31.279> you<00:00:31.640> change

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
is the fact that every time you change

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.149 
is the fact that every time you change
something<00:00:32.059> on<00:00:32.509> here<00:00:32.870> it<00:00:33.409> will<00:00:33.440> make<00:00:33.710> a<00:00:33.739> change

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:34.159 
something on here it will make a change

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.410 
something on here it will make a change
log<00:00:34.460> in<00:00:34.699> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
log in the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.259 
log in the
Nakia<00:00:37.230> firmware<00:00:37.710> added<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.129> directory<00:00:38.820> call

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
Nakia firmware added to directory call

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.990 
Nakia firmware added to directory call
Roth's<00:00:39.600> build<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:41.760> good<00:00:42.089> for

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.660 

postin<00:00:45.810> change<00:00:46.140> locust<00:00:46.680> logs<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.430> things

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
postin change locust logs and things

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.390 
postin change locust logs and things
like<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.810 

so<00:00:51.030> that's<00:00:51.240> a<00:00:51.360> really<00:00:51.720> handy<00:00:51.900> feature

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
so that's a really handy feature

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.480 
so that's a really handy feature
and<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.110> open<00:00:55.530> your<00:00:55.560> firmware<00:00:55.980> files

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
and you can open your firmware files

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.100 
and you can open your firmware files
just<00:00:56.760> by<00:00:56.940> dragging<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.480> dropping<00:00:57.540> them<00:00:57.960> onto

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
just by dragging and dropping them onto

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.799 
just by dragging and dropping them onto
the<00:00:58.260> left<00:00:58.500> pane<00:00:58.770> here

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809

it's got a fast file search engine so

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.500 
it's got a fast file search engine so
what<00:02:18.110> I'm<00:02:18.200> gonna<00:02:18.350> do<00:02:18.590> here<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:19.550> extract

and clean and extract the image into the
user<00:02:25.340> interface

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.630 

okay<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:34.810> we<00:02:35.140> have<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.470> user<00:02:35.680> interface<00:02:36.310> here

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
okay so we have the user interface here

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.600

say someone's told you about a file that
you<00:02:41.650> come<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:42.510> instead<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.659> having<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:44.049> click

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
you come on instead of having to click

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.050 
you come on instead of having to click
through<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.680> tree<00:02:44.920> list<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.519> go<00:02:45.670> through

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
everything you can just for example if

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.490 
everything you can just for example if

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
quick I was surprised at how quick that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.820 
quick I was surprised at how quick that
was<00:03:00.460> there's<00:03:00.820> no<00:03:01.050> graphical<00:03:02.050> user<00:03:02.110> interface

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
was there's no graphical user interface

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.320 
was there's no graphical user interface

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
to show you a search and it's just

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.559 
to show you a search and it's just
straight<00:03:04.690> there<00:03:04.990> which<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.800> really<00:03:06.160> good

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
straight there which is really good

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.690 
straight there which is really good
you<00:03:08.140> can<00:03:08.379> drag<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.709> drop<00:03:08.890> things<00:03:09.310> straight

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
you can drag and drop things straight

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.610 
you can drag and drop things straight
off<00:03:09.879> your<00:03:10.060> desktop<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.719> into<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.200> user

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
off your desktop and into the user

off your desktop and into the user
interface<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:12.099> this<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.849> that<00:03:12.969> I<00:03:12.999> like<00:03:13.239> that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
interface of this and that I like that

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.170 
interface of this and that I like that
automatically<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.379> ROM<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:15.430> for<00:03:15.670> example

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
automatically to the ROM so for example

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.179 
automatically to the ROM so for example
you<00:03:16.480> wouldn't<00:03:16.659> probably<00:03:17.530> wouldn't<00:03:18.010> need<00:03:18.129> to

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
you wouldn't probably wouldn't need to

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.280 
you wouldn't probably wouldn't need to
do<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.700> but<00:03:18.909> if<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.120> wanted<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.599> add<00:03:19.719> SAS

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
do this but if you wanted to add SAS

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.429 
do this but if you wanted to add SAS
contents<00:03:20.920> into<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:22.299> Z<00:03:22.659> part<00:03:23.019> of<00:03:23.109> the<00:03:23.230> ROM<00:03:23.409> you

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:23.439 
contents into the Z part of the ROM you

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.929 
contents into the Z part of the ROM you
can<00:03:23.680> just<00:03:23.829> drag<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.159> drop<00:03:24.189> that<00:03:24.340> straight<00:03:24.760> in

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
can just drag and drop that straight in

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.970 
can just drag and drop that straight in
there<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.209> if<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.079> watch<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.409> free<00:03:26.650> space

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
there and if you watch the free space

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.899 
there and if you watch the free space
partition<00:03:27.790> free<00:03:28.389> space<00:03:29.700> information<00:03:30.700> there

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
partition free space information there

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.240 
partition free space information there
that<00:03:30.939> should<00:03:31.329> also<00:03:31.510> update<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.379> that's<00:03:32.950> very

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
that should also update and that's very

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.949 
that should also update and that's very
quick<00:03:33.609> as<00:03:33.819> you<00:03:33.939> can<00:03:33.969> see<00:03:34.359> there's<00:03:34.689> only<00:03:34.780> a

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
quick as you can see there's only a

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.659 
quick as you can see there's only a
small<00:03:35.079> graphical<00:03:35.709> user<00:03:35.739> interface<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
small graphical user interface and the

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.500 
small graphical user interface and the
delay<00:03:36.999> of<00:03:37.209> about<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> second<00:03:38.909> to<00:03:39.909> import<00:03:40.299> them

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
delay of about a second to import them

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.959 
delay of about a second to import them
into<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.230> ROM<00:03:41.469> so<00:03:42.340> I'm<00:03:42.400> gonna<00:03:42.579> get<00:03:42.760> rid<00:03:42.939> of

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:42.969 
into the ROM so I'm gonna get rid of

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.660 
into the ROM so I'm gonna get rid of
that

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.750
