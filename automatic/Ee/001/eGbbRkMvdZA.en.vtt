00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello I am veterinarian veterinarian 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.680
 and we'll talk now about 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.410
 third age of the third age of the dog 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.840
 the third age of the field the progress of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.240
 human medicine have made us 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.500
 let's live more and more progress 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.330
 of veterinary medicine have done 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.640
 also that animals live more and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.619
 older when before the expectation of 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.289
 life of a cat and is around 13 14 years old 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.089
 now he goes up to 16 17 years for the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.949
 little dogs it turns over 15 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.900
 16 years old and that can go of course more 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.110
 far for the big fields around 10 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.730
 12 years old so again the prevention is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.410
 the best remedies ie 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.650
 when your pet starts to take 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 age 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.570
 we will say from 8 to 10 years for a 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.250
 cat from 8 10 years for a small 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.890
 dog and from 8 years old for a big 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.350
 dog it is better to do some 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.770
 diagnoses before the appearance of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.230
 diseases 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.330
 the diagnosis how come it is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.760
 done on a blood test by taking 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.560
 blood on an animal agen whatsoever 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.390
 a dog or a cat and a balance sheet 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.939
 by this blood test one can 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.610
 already some leads and some troubles of 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.950
 hepatic or renal it is customary to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.660
 say that cardiovascular disease 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.600
 of man they are the first 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.430
 diseases in humans are a little bit 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.370
 the cat's equivalent of their diseases 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.850
 renal and hepatic therefore by a balance sheet 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.860
 sanguine 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.390
 we can diagnose and see the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 first variations or the first 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.460
 fatigue or liver or kidney and as soon as 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.110
 we started to detect these disorders 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.390
 hepatic or renal disorders 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.890
 some drugs can be put 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.510
 some diets 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.970
 can be implemented 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.830
 this is precisely the prevention of 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.360
 to avoid aggravation of 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.220
 symptoms and that's what allows 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.260

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.180
