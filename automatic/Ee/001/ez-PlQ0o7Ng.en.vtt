00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.730
 hello dear hungry it is the same 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.949
 again easter traditionally it is 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.140
 for easter breakfast like a yeast cake 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.419
 But I thought we would do it 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.669
 So, I'll do something different 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.640
 the series and a paschal variant 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.539
 of the zoo or folding bread should 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.580
 also fit well 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.080
 the shape does not taste ordinary 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.519
 are delicious and we need night 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.769
 flour sugar 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.379
 that may be browner but not necessarily 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.260
 Dry yeast could also be fresh 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.960
 some are used for decoration purposes 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:59.280
 chocolate eggs or similar vanilla 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:03.000
 sugar milk eggs salt cinnamon &amp; butter in 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.070
 a bowl we enter the sea 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.070
 part of the sugar vanilla sugar 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:19.320
 as well as dry yeast and salt 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:21.539
 and catch everything thoroughly in one 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.310
 other bowl we fill the milk and 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.100
 heat up this one to more than a short while 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.360
 lukewarm enough and then give 50 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.069
 grate the butter into it 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.530
 this is now the warm milk 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.740
 then we go everything resolved 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.460
 to give them too 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.950
 bring in both eggs and stir 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.189
 then all enduring with the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.259
 kneading hook of the device persistently because of that 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.840
 because the whole procedure is about eight 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.539
 minutes will be so your 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.329
 mogis a bit strained and that 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.450
 result is a smooth loader 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.399
 Now turn it off and let it go 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.090
 a warm place for about an hour 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.860
 go 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.959
 this is also possible in the oven , for example 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.750
 you just a little before 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.970
 Tempered after the dough has gone 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.530
 is and its volume is approximately doubled 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.530
 we knead them on the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.900
 work surface again by choosing 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.209
 then the workspace a little and 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.280
 Roll out the dough on it and that way 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.319
 that a rather rectangular area 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.569
 arises with me here is the bigger ones 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.220
 about 40 x 45 cm 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.230
 but that comes on a few inches 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.970
 Also not matter and the thick of 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.920
 Doughs should not be less than one 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.700
 half and no more than a whole 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.609
 centimeters are the rolled out 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.130
 We cut the dough into strips first 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:44.040
 and then in the right angle to it 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.560
 in rectangles the sizes these rectangles 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.329
 should be approximately the size of the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.180
 orient selected baking mold 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.160
 my pieces are about five times 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.319
 seven inches tall and when he is the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.209
 dough thicker rolled out there is 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.310
 correspondingly fewer pieces but that 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.590
 volume total, he remains the same at 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.310
 the end should be about the part area 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.500
 appearance 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.880
 now it will be cinnamon and sugar 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.739
 to mix with each other 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.780
 because I always have a stock anyway 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.370
 but I'll spare that now 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.530
 now the rest of the butter 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.840
 be melted and then 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.400
 Let's take about three tablespoons of it 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.400
 and put these aside 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.810
 with the liquid butter we stroke 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.640
 now our dough pieces 1 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.320
 that would be synonymous form cut the dough 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.100
 gone but i was rather into 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.230
 this sequence 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.730
 then the dough pieces are still 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.950
 with the 10 come already scattered and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.190
 Now we live on the dough pieces always 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.640
 so five to six pieces together 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.030
 So arrange them in small piles 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.570
 and this until just all dough pieces 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.570
 are ordered accordingly 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:01.670
 And now we pack these piles into the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.830
 previously greased box shape is this 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.050
 filled we brush the top 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.750
 the dough pieces again with liquid 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.470
 butter and give again from the cinnamon 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.810
 sugar mixture afterwards 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.989
 Let's cover the form again and leave 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.840
 the dough again for about 20 to 30 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.050
 minutes go because the subset for one 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.520
 30 cm box shape calculated mine, however 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.100
 a little smaller is still some remained 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.840
 dough pieces left over and fill with these 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.060
 I only have a little reform of the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.389
 process is identical again yes and 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.470
 then it is baked at 175 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.460
 150 degrees for 30 to 40 degrees 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.430
 minutes 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.780
 it was exactly 35 minutes to me 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.240
 here the result looks quite right 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.600
 Finally, I'll stick it on top 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.790
 as easter decoration still some cappuccino on 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.979
 the bread I stir with powdered sugar 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.289
 quite thick to use it as an adhesive 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.060
 and so it's easy to get these eggs 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.100
 place and like you said 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.950
 You can also use completely different ones for that 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.380
 so that's all I can find this 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.270
 breads look funny and still very much 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.310
 Tastes delicious too 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.990
 some were of course the best I 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.780
 I wish you a great one 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.810
 Easter fun and then baking 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.890
 pretty good appetite 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.050
 but if you prefer one 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.389
 maybe want to bake another bread 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.580
 a monkey or even a bread 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.360
 then just have a look 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.430
 videos into it 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.320
 I still have to say until the 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.320
 next time may may
