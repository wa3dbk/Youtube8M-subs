and when it gets kind of dark ground I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.289 
and when it gets kind of dark ground I
thought<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> may<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.310> used<00:01:14.850> some<00:01:14.970> long

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
thought I may have used some long

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.740 
thought I may have used some long
exposures<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:17.210> brought<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.420> reading

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
exposures and brought some reading

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.940 
exposures and brought some reading
material<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.950> magazines<00:01:21.290> in<00:01:22.290> case<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.830> was

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
material to magazines in case there was

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.429 
material to magazines in case there was
a<00:01:22.979> rain<00:01:23.250> delay<00:01:23.400> which<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:24.030> wasn't<00:01:24.409> but<00:01:25.409> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
a rain delay which there wasn't but I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.810 
a rain delay which there wasn't but I
ended<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.830> bringing<00:01:25.979> them<00:01:26.250> anyway

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
ended up bringing them anyway

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.770 
ended up bringing them anyway
and<00:01:26.909> I'll<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.570> over<00:01:27.689> some<00:01:28.020> more<00:01:28.259> details

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
and I'll go over some more details

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.350 
and I'll go over some more details
afterwards<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.470> here's<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.189> look<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
afterwards so here's a look at the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.870 
afterwards so here's a look at the
retrospective<00:01:37.049> 30<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.710> its<00:01:37.950> rain<00:01:38.250> cover<00:01:38.579> on

the<00:01:39.810> rain<00:01:39.960> cover<00:01:40.200> income<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.220> pretty

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the rain cover income you know pretty

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.399 
the rain cover income you know pretty
much<00:01:41.549> encloses<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> entire<00:01:42.659> bag<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.380> you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
much encloses the entire bag so you

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.580 
much encloses the entire bag so you
cannot<00:01:44.119> access<00:01:45.119> your<00:01:45.509> gear<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.170> least<00:01:46.409> through

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
cannot access your gear at least through

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.590 
cannot access your gear at least through

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the front flap there's a flap in the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.160 
the front flap there's a flap in the
rear<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.140> exposed<00:01:50.299> just<00:01:51.299> make<00:01:51.509> sure<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
rear that's exposed just make sure to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.880

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
leave both of those straps free I tend

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.160 
leave both of those straps free I tend
to<00:01:56.009> use<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.549> shorter<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.180> from<00:01:57.689> getting<00:01:58.020> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to use the shorter one from getting in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.310 
to use the shorter one from getting in
