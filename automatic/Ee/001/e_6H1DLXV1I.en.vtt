can do that jump over the Saul's without
using<00:00:21.060> robot<00:00:21.359> master<00:00:21.750> weapons<00:00:22.050> or<00:00:22.260> utilities

that<00:01:33.229> jump<00:01:33.560> man<00:01:33.800> ah<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:39.470> reason<00:01:39.800> I<00:01:39.890> wanted<00:01:40.220> to

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
that jump man ah the reason I wanted to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.249 
that jump man ah the reason I wanted to
go<00:01:40.550> back<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:40.789> redo<00:01:41.360> this<00:01:41.570> instead<00:01:42.110> of<00:01:42.170> just

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
go back and redo this instead of just

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.080 
go back and redo this instead of just
doing<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.740> as<00:01:42.890> my<00:01:43.039> original<00:01:43.130> plan<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.729> just

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
doing it as my original plan of just

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.820 
doing it as my original plan of just
tacking<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.720> on<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.080> revisiting<00:01:45.710> in<00:01:45.770> the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
tacking it on to a revisiting in the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.300 
tacking it on to a revisiting in the
past<00:01:46.070> video<00:01:46.310> is<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.590> major<00:01:48.770> point<00:01:49.160> of

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
past video is this is the major point of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.450 
past video is this is the major point of
difficulty<00:01:49.820> on<00:01:50.149> which<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.570> stage<00:01:50.869> hinges<00:01:51.560> it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
difficulty on which the stage hinges it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.490 
difficulty on which the stage hinges it
so<00:01:52.700> drastically<00:01:53.240> changes<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.899> way<00:01:54.110> of<00:01:54.229> going

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
so drastically changes the way of going

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.190 
so drastically changes the way of going
through<00:01:54.679> the<00:01:54.890> stage<00:01:55.100> is<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.340> perfect<00:01:55.759> run<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.929> I

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
through the stage is a perfect run so I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.990 
through the stage is a perfect run so I
felt<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.860> was<00:01:57.890> kind<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.190> worth<00:01:58.369> doing<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:58.850> as

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
felt it was kind of worth doing it as

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.919 
felt it was kind of worth doing it as
another<00:01:59.390> full<00:01:59.720> perfect<00:02:00.170> run<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:01.690> just<00:02:02.690> hope<00:02:02.810> I

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
another full perfect run I just hope I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:11.360 
another full perfect run I just hope I
don't<00:02:02.990> have<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.259> do<00:02:03.440> it<00:02:03.530> again

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.860 

of<00:02:12.370> course<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.730> problem<00:02:13.060> now<00:02:13.210> is<00:02:13.240> there's<00:02:13.690> not

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
of course the problem now is there's not

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.450 
of course the problem now is there's not
really<00:02:14.020> much<00:02:14.230> else<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.650> talk<00:02:14.800> about<00:02:14.860> because

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460

another full run of the stage that's

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.630 
another full run of the stage that's
something<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:53.620> think<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.890> can<00:02:54.159> just<00:02:54.340> safely

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
something I think that can just safely

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.250 
something I think that can just safely
be<00:02:54.790> tacked<00:02:55.030> into<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.390> revisiting<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.049> past

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
be tacked into a revisiting the past

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.830 
be tacked into a revisiting the past
video<00:02:56.560> but<00:02:56.799> this<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.849> drastically<00:02:58.360> changes

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
video but this this drastically changes

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.259 
video but this this drastically changes
it<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.019> where<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.760> wanted<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.819> get<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.120> full

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
it to where I wanted to get the full

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.699 
it to where I wanted to get the full
experience<00:03:01.659> of<00:03:01.870> going<00:03:02.019> through<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.440> stage

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
experience of going through this stage

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:11.339 
experience of going through this stage
and<00:03:02.980> having<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:03.819> do<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.180> jump

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.589 

okay<00:03:11.999> gotta<00:03:12.999> watch<00:03:13.209> out<00:03:13.420> for<00:03:13.599> you<00:03:15.480> you're<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
okay gotta watch out for you you're the

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:31.970 
okay gotta watch out for you you're the
easier<00:03:16.959> one<00:03:17.260> we<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.799> do<00:03:17.980> this

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:41.130 

all<00:03:32.980> right<00:03:33.190> almost<00:03:34.120> there<00:03:39.660> we<00:03:40.660> go

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
all right almost there we go

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.580 
all right almost there we go
Cossack<00:03:41.650> three<00:03:41.950> done<00:03:42.310> for<00:03:42.640> real<00:03:42.790> this<00:03:43.030> time

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
Cossack three done for real this time

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:55.890 
Cossack three done for real this time
that<00:03:44.590> was<00:03:44.740> a<00:03:44.770> thing

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.120 

so<00:03:56.900> with<00:03:57.170> that<00:03:57.320> we've<00:03:57.590> gone<00:03:57.770> through<00:03:57.830> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
so with that we've gone through the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.270 
so with that we've gone through the
stage<00:03:58.370> truly<00:03:59.000> Buster<00:03:59.450> only<00:03:59.600> no<00:04:00.020> damage<00:04:00.470> and

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
stage truly Buster only no damage and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.180 
stage truly Buster only no damage and
what<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:01.790> thing<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.210> was<00:04:02.530> we<00:04:03.530> basically<00:04:03.890> have<00:04:04.160> a

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
what a thing it was we basically have a

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.060 
what a thing it was we basically have a
reverse<00:04:04.550> revenge<00:04:04.970> situation<00:04:05.750> here<00:04:06.020> so<00:04:06.620> let's

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
reverse revenge situation here so let's

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.160 
reverse revenge situation here so let's
get<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.400> original<00:04:07.640> rating<00:04:08.180> up<00:04:08.300> there

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.930 

Cossack<00:04:12.170> citadel<00:04:12.590> stage<00:04:12.890> three<00:04:13.220> originally

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
Cossack citadel stage three originally

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.180 
Cossack citadel stage three originally
got<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.120> two<00:04:14.390> out<00:04:14.570> of<00:04:14.600> ten<00:04:14.900> mainly<00:04:15.800> because<00:04:15.950> the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
got a two out of ten mainly because the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.680 
got a two out of ten mainly because the
ring<00:04:16.370> boomerang<00:04:16.760> made<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.150> one<00:04:17.329> area<00:04:17.630> a

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
ring boomerang made that one area a

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.380 
ring boomerang made that one area a
complete<00:04:18.109> non-issue<00:04:18.670> but<00:04:19.670> now<00:04:19.970> that<00:04:20.150> we<00:04:20.239> have

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
complete non-issue but now that we have

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.820 
complete non-issue but now that we have
to<00:04:20.510> do<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.750> properly

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.560 

well<00:04:24.830> that<00:04:25.310> bumps<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.730> difficulty<00:04:26.270> up<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.540> a

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
well that bumps the difficulty up to a

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.740 
well that bumps the difficulty up to a
seven<00:04:26.930> out<00:04:27.050> of<00:04:27.080> ten<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:28.790> one<00:04:29.000> jump<00:04:29.360> that's

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
seven out of ten the one jump that's

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.570 
seven out of ten the one jump that's
where<00:04:30.080> all<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.530> difficulty<00:04:31.070> in<00:04:31.190> this<00:04:31.370> stage

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
where all the difficulty in this stage

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.640 
where all the difficulty in this stage
lies<00:04:31.910> nothing<00:04:32.690> leading<00:04:33.169> up<00:04:33.290> to<00:04:33.320> it<00:04:33.560> is

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
lies nothing leading up to it is

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.830 
lies nothing leading up to it is
particularly<00:04:34.040> hard<00:04:34.520> nor<00:04:34.940> is<00:04:35.120> anything<00:04:35.450> after

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
particularly hard nor is anything after

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.440 
particularly hard nor is anything after
it<00:04:35.870> it's<00:04:36.320> all<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.740> one<00:04:37.040> room<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:38.180> jump

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
it it's all that one room the jump

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.510 
it it's all that one room the jump
however<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:39.080> felt<00:04:39.770> like<00:04:39.980> I<00:04:40.100> was<00:04:40.220> at<00:04:40.340> least

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
however I felt like I was at least

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.130 
however I felt like I was at least
getting<00:04:40.760> better<00:04:41.120> at<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:41.480> I<00:04:41.600> felt<00:04:41.810> like<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.050> was

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
getting better at it I felt like I was

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.930 
getting better at it I felt like I was
getting<00:04:42.230> more<00:04:42.530> experience<00:04:42.950> and<00:04:43.730> I<00:04:43.820> was

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
getting more experience and I was

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.340 
getting more experience and I was
getting<00:04:44.120> better<00:04:44.330> at<00:04:44.540> at<00:04:44.600> least<00:04:44.630> getting<00:04:45.140> past

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
getting better at at least getting past

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.400 
getting better at at least getting past
the<00:04:45.560> first<00:04:45.770> platform<00:04:46.100> as<00:04:46.760> such<00:04:47.480> I<00:04:47.870> feel<00:04:47.960> like

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
the first platform as such I feel like

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.110 
the first platform as such I feel like
with<00:04:48.590> more<00:04:48.710> practice<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.400> could<00:04:49.580> also<00:04:49.850> improve

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
with more practice I could also improve

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.270 
with more practice I could also improve
at<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.540> second<00:04:50.900> platform<00:04:51.110> so<00:04:51.919> it's<00:04:52.100> something

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
at the second platform so it's something

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.400 
at the second platform so it's something
that's<00:04:52.460> highly<00:04:52.820> difficult<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:53.930> technically

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
that's highly difficult but technically

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.800 
that's highly difficult but technically
learn<00:04:54.950> about<00:04:55.419> yeah<00:04:56.860> technically<00:04:57.860> yeah<00:04:58.810> still

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
learn about yeah technically yeah still

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.360 
learn about yeah technically yeah still
quite<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.110> difficult<00:05:00.350> spot<00:05:00.860> but<00:05:01.160> there's

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
quite a difficult spot but there's

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.800 
quite a difficult spot but there's
nothing<00:05:01.729> else<00:05:01.880> really<00:05:02.090> in<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.390> stage<00:05:02.600> to

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
nothing else really in the stage to

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.960 
nothing else really in the stage to
warrant<00:05:03.110> a<00:05:03.169> higher<00:05:03.350> rating<00:05:03.760> everything<00:05:04.760> else

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
warrant a higher rating everything else

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.780 
warrant a higher rating everything else
is<00:05:05.150> just<00:05:05.180> pretty<00:05:05.780> easy<00:05:06.020> here<00:05:06.520> now<00:05:07.520> for<00:05:07.700> those

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
is just pretty easy here now for those

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.100 
is just pretty easy here now for those
wondering<00:05:08.270> about<00:05:08.390> outtakes

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
wondering about outtakes

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.409 
wondering about outtakes
well<00:05:09.530> no<00:05:10.100> real<00:05:10.340> reason<00:05:10.669> to<00:05:10.760> save<00:05:10.970> them<00:05:11.150> you

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
session there I did however keep count

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.270 
session there I did however keep count
and<00:05:17.540> it<00:05:17.690> took<00:05:17.810> 56<00:05:18.470> attempts<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:18.979> get<00:05:19.100> this

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
and it took 56 attempts to get this

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.070 
and it took 56 attempts to get this
blasted<00:05:19.669> jump<00:05:19.940> right<00:05:20.150> so<00:05:20.870> yeah

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080
