00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
which says the expendables is also

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.990

slightly<00:04:05.010> embossed<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:06.590> again<00:04:07.790> medium<00:04:08.790> act

slightly embossed and again medium act

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.740 
slightly embossed and again medium act
does<00:04:09.449> this<00:04:10.290> as<00:04:10.590> same<00:04:11.280> as<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.609> HMV<00:04:12.120> exclusive

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
does this as same as the HMV exclusive

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.129 
does this as same as the HMV exclusive
steelbooks<00:04:13.290> we<00:04:13.620> have<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:14.099> corners<00:04:15.139> slightly

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
steelbooks we have the corners slightly

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.870 
steelbooks we have the corners slightly
embossed<00:04:16.530> or<00:04:16.799> slightly<00:04:17.549> raised<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:19.789> this<00:04:20.789> is

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
embossed or slightly raised and this is

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.040 
embossed or slightly raised and this is
also<00:04:21.060> identical<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.340> Cowboys<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.490> Aliens

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
also identical to the Cowboys and Aliens

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.040 
also identical to the Cowboys and Aliens
steelbook<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:26.700> I

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
steelbook and and I

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.659 
steelbook and and I
think<00:04:27.229> that<00:04:27.349> this<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.620> quite<00:04:27.979> nice<00:04:28.220> idea

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
think that this is a quite nice idea

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.260 
think that this is a quite nice idea
same<00:04:29.629> goes<00:04:29.840> for<00:04:30.139> the<00:04:30.400> upper<00:04:31.400> side<00:04:31.669> which

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
same goes for the upper side which

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.399 
same goes for the upper side which
normally<00:04:32.690> is<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:33.319> in<00:04:33.819> blue<00:04:34.870> with<00:04:35.870> this<00:04:36.080> has

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
normally is a is in blue with this has

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.129 
normally is a is in blue with this has
the<00:04:36.770> metallic<00:04:37.220> looking<00:04:37.690> but<00:04:38.690> I<00:04:38.720> think<00:04:39.050> it

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
the metallic looking but I think it

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.469 
the metallic looking but I think it
would<00:04:39.349> be<00:04:39.379> better<00:04:39.830> if<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.819> would<00:04:41.030> also<00:04:41.300> be

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
would be better if that would also be

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.279 
would be better if that would also be
black<00:04:41.840> but<00:04:42.830> anyway<00:04:43.720> then<00:04:44.720> let's<00:04:44.960> take<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.139> look

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289
