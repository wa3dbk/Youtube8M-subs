I<00:02:00.380> have<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.619> mention<00:02:00.950> though<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:01.490> that<00:02:02.000> when

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
I have to mention though is that when

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.770 
I have to mention though is that when
you<00:02:02.720> when<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.440> bypass<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.130> okay<00:02:04.970> here<00:02:05.390> let's

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
you when you bypass it okay here let's

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.080 
you when you bypass it okay here let's
turn<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:06.200> off<00:02:06.290> again

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
turn it off again

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.719 
turn it off again
you<00:02:08.090> only<00:02:08.420> have<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.780> bypass<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.200> once<00:02:09.619> on<00:02:09.950> and

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
you only have to bypass it once on and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.910 
you only have to bypass it once on and
if<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.420> turn<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.780> off<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.200> have<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.500> bypass<00:02:12.709> it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
if you turn it off you have to bypass it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.500 
if you turn it off you have to bypass it
again<00:02:13.340> but<00:02:13.940> let's<00:02:14.420> say<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:15.100> bypassed<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.640> it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
again but let's say I bypassed it it

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.530 
again but let's say I bypassed it it
goes<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.770> safe<00:02:18.980> mode<00:02:19.250> again<00:02:19.610> well

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
goes to to the safe mode again well

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.220 
goes to to the safe mode again well
check<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.900> out

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
check it out

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.500 
check it out
when<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.010> when<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.730> bypass<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:26.120> has<00:02:26.330> a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
when you when you bypass it it has a

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.680 
when you when you bypass it it has a
counter<00:02:26.989> on<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.880> it'll<00:02:29.120> count<00:02:29.390> how<00:02:29.630> many

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
counter on it and it'll count how many

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
times you have bypassed it and let me

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.830

show you 29 you see I

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.910 
show you 29 you see I
I<00:02:39.080> have<00:02:39.410> bypassed<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.700> safe<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:42.380> safe<00:02:42.590> code

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
I have bypassed the safe the safe code

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.770 
I have bypassed the safe the safe code
twenty-nine<00:02:43.459> times<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:44.060> don't<00:02:44.540> know<00:02:44.630> what

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
twenty-nine times I don't know what

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.350 
twenty-nine times I don't know what
happens<00:02:45.170> when<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.410> reach<00:02:45.620> thirty<00:02:46.489> forty

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
happens when you reach thirty forty

fifty<00:02:47.810> 99<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.920> don't<00:02:49.459> know<00:02:49.549> what<00:02:49.700> what<00:02:50.180> will

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
fifty 99 I don't know what what will

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.660 
fifty 99 I don't know what what will
happen<00:02:50.840> this<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:51.920> probably<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.370> temporary

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
happen this is probably a temporary

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.380 
happen this is probably a temporary
solution<00:02:53.860> while<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.190> find<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.150> right

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
solution while you find the the right

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.920 
solution while you find the the right
code<00:02:56.690> or<00:02:56.989> while<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.890> get<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.430> code<00:02:58.930> from

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
code or while you get the code from

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.759 
code or while you get the code from
somewhere<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:01.010> one<00:03:01.220> who<00:03:02.150> told<00:03:03.049> you<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.350> car<00:03:03.530> I

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
somewhere the one who told you the car I

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.470 
somewhere the one who told you the car I
don't<00:03:04.310> know<00:03:04.400> but<00:03:04.940> there's<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.180> temporary

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
don't know but there's a temporary

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.890 
don't know but there's a temporary
solution<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.680> guess<00:03:06.920> it's<00:03:07.760> probably<00:03:08.060> permanent

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
solution I guess it's probably permanent

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.720 
solution I guess it's probably permanent
and<00:03:09.079> you<00:03:09.350> wouldn't<00:03:09.560> even<00:03:09.620> have<00:03:09.799> to<00:03:10.130> get<00:03:10.610> the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
and you wouldn't even have to get the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.690 
and you wouldn't even have to get the
code<00:03:10.940> again<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.769> is<00:03:12.829> pretty<00:03:13.160> much<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.340> I

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
code again and this is pretty much it I

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.640 
code again and this is pretty much it I
hope<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.450> guys<00:03:14.829> use<00:03:15.829> this<00:03:16.070> tutorial<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.690> hope
