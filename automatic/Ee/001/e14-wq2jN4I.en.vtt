little<00:01:57.080> bit<00:01:57.229> more<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.800> shimmery<00:01:58.280> look<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.060> I

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
little bit more of a shimmery look and I

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.400 
little bit more of a shimmery look and I
just<00:01:59.300> thought<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.540> looked<00:01:59.660> really<00:01:59.900> nice<00:02:00.110> and

even because the tape will be there is
kind<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.980> like<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.310> protective<00:02:34.880> barrier<00:02:35.060> but

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
kind of like a protective barrier but

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.440 
kind of like a protective barrier but
just<00:02:36.050> make<00:02:36.200> sure<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.680> thinner<00:02:36.980> than<00:02:37.100> me
