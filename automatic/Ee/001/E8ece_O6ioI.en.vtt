00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.820
 heinz again and after the kainsmal super 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.890
 I answered the questions 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.830
 a few more questions today 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.900
 Regarding material I'm a student and 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.119
 Of course a lot of money is what is 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.220
 necessary to climb 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.260
 So first in every climbing hall can 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.240
 you can just borrow and if 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.940
 then, according to aids, this is for me 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.280
 I want to start now and be 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.790
 small starter set then wants together 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:49.640
 It is very important that one 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.649
 that is exactly what is generally what is 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.300
 this is a huge one on everyone 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.030
 case that I bought first 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.489
 I think it is important that you 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.980
 So tÃ¤ve schur should in English but 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.719
 just for beginners and in there tons 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.059
 So it can be later 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.590
 now second team so what should 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.240
 you do not give as a beginner first time 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.240
 she moves in with you at the son that is 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.070
 so biased and the buy either 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.080
 at springer and to represent 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.430
 but that does not matter from the beginning 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.650
 to do something first 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.479
 next to you can stand well that is completely 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.320
 enough how much money do I have to 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.290
 take in hand 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.880
 as a beginner yes all four are beginners 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.030
 show so in any case you are there 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.280
 under 100 euro depending on where you are 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.399
 but it also buys 60 to 80 euros 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.369
 Realistically feasible in any case 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.950
 ok with shoes we now have ticked 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.799
 is there anything else I need? 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.990
 yes, there is one here 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.799
 so-called talkback that's like that 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.479
 a bag and there you can magnesia my 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.509
 So you know that from the movie 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:58.520
 Physical education from the tower and that is how it is 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.049
 A pure white powder gripped 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.880
 slips off that dries the farthest 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.350
 then you just grab it and it 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.670
 can take a bit more and if 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.379
 a climbing frame and as I said 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.739
 not so easy off so that too one 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.849
 very meaningful purchase lead so 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.380
 You can get that pot away here 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.519
 also to bid and to climb with 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.590
 take it up very handy 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.019
 Weiligmann on the way a little pot 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.239
 you also have to boulder yourself 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.099
 usually a bit larger copy 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.650
 that one does not lift with it then 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.630
 simply form well then once in three 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.360
 makes talkt and once off 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.220
 climbs up if you do a lot now 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.560
 has stalked then it happens sometimes 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.269
 that the pores of the handles that the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.680
 constipation and chambers are like that 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.310
 you can get along relatively quickly 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.190
 to adjust 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.400
 so you need a intervened 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.720
 bit like a toothbrush and 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.130
 if you 're here with the interventions right now 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.489
 Shortly then they have a lot under it 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:03:00.049
 and over it are like this against 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:03:02.420
 these are relatively poorly complete 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.350
 and then you realize that they are the same 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.180
 feel a lot better otherwise if you are 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.850
 his climbing partner does not like and beautiful 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.480
 you can also use these terms 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.540
 Another nice point came 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.640
 lead very well to exactly that 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.760
 such a brush in any case 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.440
 also always for beginners set climbing 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.269
 but most of them have something like that too 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.230
 In stock, so sometimes you can too 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.940
 easy to share as 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.709
 great that 's it or that 's it 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.060
 Thank you for that 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:43.110
 no problem and tends the video thumb 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.390
 high shares it and continues to follow 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.549
 us on the channels facebook instagram 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.420
 and so many thanks 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.420
