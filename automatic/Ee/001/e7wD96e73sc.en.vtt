 infinity what to do with it only 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:27.870
 when asking guys if you have this 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:33.100
 The moment the battery sits down, then the phone 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.489
 will turn into a brick floor which can 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.830

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.580
 charge the battery before doing 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.560
