00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.390
 how it works 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.779
 showing her colored paper requires a 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.890

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 the paper in the middle soon kinks that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.620
 back up and put it with the motive 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.620

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.740

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.760
 narrow border of yellow tone paper 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.760

 after that , the fingers were in the other 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:13.230
 side of the papper roll and painted the rest 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.959

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:20.630
