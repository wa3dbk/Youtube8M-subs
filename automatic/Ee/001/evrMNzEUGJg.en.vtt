00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:26.029
 good afternoon dear sirs 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.919
 Today I decided to talk a bit for 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.210
 order to illuminate the theoretical 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.860
 aspects of their task and the task I will remind 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.600
 is to shake 200 pounds 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.710
 maybe more business museums steroids 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:48.530
 without using pamping 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:52.640
 I began training February first 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:57.220
 control point that was scheduled 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.220
 is 150 kg at three 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:08.540
 proper front were made two 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:13.600
 summers approach warm up and finish 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.600
 training even us 162 approaches either 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.789
 then followed two weeks of lung and 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.520
 average workouts after which there was 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:28.560
 the next control point was reduced 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.810
 more precisely, the volume and reduced 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:38.490
 intensity accordingly there were fires 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:43.250
 120 and 5 133 each with structure 5 and 5 each 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.840
 performed even on 150 by 3 and 170 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.619
 then again followed two weeks I 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.610
 light and medium workouts were 3 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:57.560
 checkpoint that looked 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.200
 as follows 120 by 4 140 by 3 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.380
 160 sodium and 165 two for three 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.990
 about the structure of all these control points 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.500
 why choosing such a weight 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.180
 the number of repetitions I will tell later 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.120
 the next video is now just in fact 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.430
 what has been done to make you understand 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.910
 then two medium weeks followed again 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.140
 and light workouts as you already understood I 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.950
 doing one 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.950
 hard workout 3 weeks and 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.150
 4 control point again you reduced 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:42.160
 volume increased volume and reduced 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:46.330
 oranges were fires 130 at 5 143 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.630
 on 5 and 153 on 5 even move no, I'm not 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.430
 did this training because 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.269
 big enough as if our big 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.310
 it was no appropriate next 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:02.560
 training could observe the previous 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:08.709
 video, I repeat, it was 170 kilograms 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.370
 inside 175 by 3 and we even met 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.760
 You are not logged in video 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.290
 185 one approach to cuddle but how am I 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.510
 coped with the following control 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.510
 point you now see
