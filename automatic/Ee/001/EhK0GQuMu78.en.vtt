00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.150
 this origami this bird count yesterday the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.470

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:37.910

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.449
 so it's a4 sheet 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:55.879
 we will take this corner there bend the bend 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:01:02.910
 to fold the fold must be seen that 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:06.000
 this lie the key that night we go 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.869
 take the filled alley like that on 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.869
 this line 1 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:35.320
 now we will have to cut out this 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:35.320
 part me I take the compact and 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:52.119
 maintenance shaped square we have 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:57.000
 folded like that we're going to bend the hundred 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.000
 will be offered at cost will inform 6 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.130
 of course this corner there that we have we go 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.920
 return what was called as simple 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.550
 we turn upside down shield x 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:30.040
 stand out and we will fold on without 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:32.489
 that the corners of even another to 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.489
 sides 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:47.770
 now of course we support 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:51.380
 Leaves on leaves of points 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:55.670
 that's normally it should look like 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.880
 that's it, so we go to a corner 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.490
 we flip the flaw we put ourselves in a 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.430
 corner we take the two points here on 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:09.680
 rahman rahman rahman like that here we are 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.160
 bring them back and we bend like that 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.750
 done I was there normally if you 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:22.239
 open a little bit like that ok we take 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.239
 this side we fold 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.880

 aulas of the other way on of course the 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.700
 horizontal line 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.520

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:43.600
