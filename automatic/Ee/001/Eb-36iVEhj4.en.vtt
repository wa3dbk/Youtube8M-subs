there's<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.510> lot<00:01:01.629> of<00:01:01.720> tuning<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.080> goes<00:01:02.200> into

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
there's a lot of tuning that goes into

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.479 
there's a lot of tuning that goes into
these<00:01:02.590> events<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:02.980> there's<00:01:03.129> definitely

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
these events and there's definitely

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.350 
these events and there's definitely

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
and watching the other day

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.660 
and watching the other day
someday<00:01:28.840> I<00:01:28.869> want<00:01:29.049> to<00:01:29.170> do<00:01:29.289> that

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.090 

it's<00:01:32.570> just<00:01:32.810> way<00:01:33.080> different<00:01:33.110> feeling<00:01:33.950> just

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
it's just way different feeling just

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.649 
it's just way different feeling just
hitting<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.430> ramp<00:01:34.640> all<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.120> hair<00:01:35.300> time<00:01:35.510> I

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
hitting that ramp all that hair time I

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:36.910 
hitting that ramp all that hair time I
guess<00:01:35.810> it's<00:01:35.930> just<00:01:35.960> an<00:01:36.140> adrenaline<00:01:36.320> thing<00:01:36.740> I

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
guess it's just an adrenaline thing I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.460 
guess it's just an adrenaline thing I
mean<00:01:37.130> when<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.310> used<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.760> race<00:01:38.110> briefer<00:01:39.110> race

you're<00:02:06.560> not<00:02:06.710> freezing<00:02:07.039> there<00:02:07.250> but<00:02:07.430> out<00:02:07.579> there

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
you're not freezing there but out there

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.570 
you're not freezing there but out there
your<00:02:07.969> hands<00:02:08.119> are<00:02:08.330> cold<00:02:08.569> but<00:02:09.250> obviously<00:02:10.250> the

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
your hands are cold but obviously the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.300 
your hands are cold but obviously the
snow<00:02:11.450> conditions<00:02:11.720> are<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.530> great<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.280> the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
snow conditions are that great in the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.160 
snow conditions are that great in the
summer<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.480> get<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.629> little<00:02:14.840> bit<00:02:14.989> a

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
summer and so you get a little bit a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.020 
summer and so you get a little bit a
little<00:02:15.440> bit<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.800> dirty<00:02:16.010> snow<00:02:16.160> coming<00:02:16.700> at<00:02:16.819> you

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
little bit of dirty snow coming at you

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.790 
little bit of dirty snow coming at you
but<00:02:17.209> it's<00:02:17.360> alright<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:17.870> it's<00:02:18.050> fun<00:02:18.260> uh<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.709> a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
but it's alright it's it's fun uh it's a

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.920 
but it's alright it's it's fun uh it's a
little<00:02:18.920> bit<00:02:19.069> more<00:02:19.360> difficult<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.480> turn<00:02:20.690> you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
little bit more difficult to turn you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.080 
little bit more difficult to turn you
don't<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.680> skis<00:02:21.980> don't<00:02:22.220> slide<00:02:22.459> quite<00:02:22.760> as<00:02:22.880> good

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
don't the skis don't slide quite as good

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.500 
don't the skis don't slide quite as good
with<00:02:23.450> wood<00:02:24.019> chips<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.500> mod<00:02:24.680> mixed<00:02:25.040> in<00:02:25.160> and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
with wood chips and the mod mixed in and

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.850 
with wood chips and the mod mixed in and
also<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.630> makes<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.290> lot<00:02:27.380> tougher<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.769> see

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
also it makes it a lot tougher to see

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.620 
also it makes it a lot tougher to see
because<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.310> get<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.549> mud<00:02:28.849> flying<00:02:29.269> at<00:02:29.450> your

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
because you get this mud flying at your

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.350 
because you get this mud flying at your
goggles<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.319> that<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.799> a<00:02:31.069> little<00:02:31.519> bit<00:02:31.760> makes

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
goggles and that so a little bit makes

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.210 
goggles and that so a little bit makes
you<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.510> little<00:02:32.750> bit<00:02:32.870> tougher<00:02:33.260> but<00:02:33.500> still<00:02:34.190> a

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
you a little bit tougher but still a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.370 
you a little bit tougher but still a
good<00:02:34.400> time<00:02:34.610> this<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> little<00:02:35.810> bit<00:02:35.959> too<00:02:36.170> hot<00:02:36.349> I

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
good time this is a little bit too hot I

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.589 
good time this is a little bit too hot I
mean<00:02:36.590> 80<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.280> all<00:02:37.489> this<00:02:37.670> note<00:02:37.910> here<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:38.330> not

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
ideal but you know 30 40 degrees you

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.150 
ideal but you know 30 40 degrees you
know<00:02:41.599> he<00:02:41.720> can't<00:02:41.959> be<00:02:42.079> dead<00:02:42.349> that's<00:02:42.620> always<00:02:42.860> nice

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
know he can't be dead that's always nice

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.190 
know he can't be dead that's always nice

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
because he work up a sweat on the sled

because he work up a sweat on the sled
in<00:02:45.349> that<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:46.190> body<00:02:46.970> temperature<00:02:47.329> rises

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
in that and the body temperature rises

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.650 
in that and the body temperature rises
but<00:02:48.250> yeah<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:49.700> good<00:02:49.790> though<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.209> used<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.540> it

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
but yeah it's good though it used to it
