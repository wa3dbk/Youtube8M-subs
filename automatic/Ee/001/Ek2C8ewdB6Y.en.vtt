be<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.910> flat<00:00:33.329> exact<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.140> say<00:00:34.410> no<00:00:34.679> it's<00:00:35.010> much

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
be a flat exact but I say no it's much

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.310 
be a flat exact but I say no it's much
better<00:00:35.640> than<00:00:35.879> that<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:36.750> e-tailer

flow<00:00:44.510> literally<00:00:45.510> 20<00:00:45.839> throughout<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> cell<00:00:46.890> so

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429 
flow literally 20 throughout the cell so

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:48.710 
flow literally 20 throughout the cell so
I<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> thank<00:00:48.300> you

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
I like to thank you

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.290 
I like to thank you
as<00:00:49.290> a<00:00:49.350> maze<00:00:49.710> full<00:00:50.040> of<00:00:50.160> Cuba<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.090> one

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
as a maze full of Cuba was just one

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.740 
as a maze full of Cuba was just one
thing<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:51.870> used<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> explain<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.830> you<00:00:53.010> that

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
thing I used to explain to you that

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.910 
thing I used to explain to you that
increases<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> organelles<00:00:55.290> efficiency<00:00:55.830> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
increases the organelles efficiency of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
increases the organelles efficiency of
protein<00:00:56.340> synthesis<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.540> because

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
protein synthesis this is because

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.000 
protein synthesis this is because
there's<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> higher<00:00:58.230> surface<00:00:58.590> area<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.920> volume

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
there's a higher surface area to volume

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.800 
there's a higher surface area to volume
ratio<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.880> larger<00:01:00.210> amount<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.480> ribosomes

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
ratio for a larger amount of ribosomes

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.020 
ratio for a larger amount of ribosomes
are<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.170> turn<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.680> higher<00:01:02.070> rate<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.400> protein

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
are in turn a higher rate of protein

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:15.800 
are in turn a higher rate of protein
production<00:01:03.470> yeah

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.889 

well<00:01:16.460> inside<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.640> cells<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.090> too<00:01:18.270> kind<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.750> me

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
well inside the cells is too kind to me

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.340 
well inside the cells is too kind to me

what<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> stupid<00:01:27.149> assumption<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> fact<00:01:28.200> Murphy

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
what a stupid assumption in fact Murphy

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.100 
what a stupid assumption in fact Murphy

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.690 
our packages and foam parties dropped
almost<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.680> your<00:01:31.860> mother<00:01:32.039> but<00:01:32.399> it<00:01:32.490> doesn't

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
almost like your mother but it doesn't

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.550 
almost like your mother but it doesn't
cook<00:01:32.939> or<00:01:33.149> clean<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.840> packages<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
cook or clean it just packages and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.529 
cook or clean it just packages and
ribosomes<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.340> membrane<00:01:35.700> vesicles<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
ribosomes it's a membrane vesicles and

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:37.999 
ribosomes it's a membrane vesicles and
then<00:01:36.869> change<00:01:37.110> them<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> Golgi<00:01:37.649> bodies

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
then change them to the Golgi bodies

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
then change them to the Golgi bodies
doing<00:01:38.399> than<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:38.789> will<00:01:39.000> certain<00:01:39.600> organs

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
doing than what they will certain organs

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.539 
doing than what they will certain organs
and<00:01:40.110> fly<00:01:40.350> ourselves<00:01:40.409> lots<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.340> roughly

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and fly ourselves lots of roughly

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.639 
and fly ourselves lots of roughly
Ironmen<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.479> themselves<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.170> make<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.530> the

who had died for tiny Kennecott if we
bleed<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.450> who<00:01:48.869> couldn't<00:01:49.170> clock<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.560> that

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
bleed out who couldn't clock and that

00:01:49.709 --> 00:02:01.120 
bleed out who couldn't clock and that
would<00:01:49.799> really<00:01:49.920> suck

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.789 

wow<00:02:01.430> this<00:02:02.030> movie<00:02:02.360> as<00:02:02.689> important<00:02:03.320> in<00:02:03.500> very

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
wow this movie as important in very

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.410 
wow this movie as important in very
different<00:02:04.039> way<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.820> although<00:02:05.119> it<00:02:05.240> has<00:02:05.390> been

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
different way it although it has been

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.840 
different way it although it has been
ribosomes<00:02:06.079> still<00:02:06.590> got<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.770> lot<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.950> say<00:02:07.280> it's

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
ribosomes still got a lot to say it's

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.999 
ribosomes still got a lot to say it's
synthesizing<00:02:08.539> lipids<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.080> steroids<00:02:09.679> swell

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the smooth ER recommends testes yes you

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.839 
the smooth ER recommends testes yes you
know<00:02:18.050> what<00:02:18.200> they<00:02:18.380> are<00:02:18.530> yeah<00:02:19.069> makes<00:02:19.430> us<00:02:19.580> here<00:02:19.760> in

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
know what they are yeah makes us here in

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.699 
know what they are yeah makes us here in
