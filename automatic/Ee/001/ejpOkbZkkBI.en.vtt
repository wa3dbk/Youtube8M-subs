00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
I'm going to make a quick little Cylon

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.930 
I'm going to make a quick little Cylon
strategy<00:00:03.620> video<00:00:04.620> just<00:00:05.130> so<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.339> can<00:00:05.490> see<00:00:05.670> some

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
strategy video just so you can see some

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.049 
strategy video just so you can see some
of<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.120> things<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.660> can<00:00:06.810> do<00:00:07.350> in<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:07.560> game

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
of the things you can do in this game

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.150 
of the things you can do in this game
and<00:00:09.059> some<00:00:09.360> human<00:00:09.630> strategy<00:00:10.019> so<00:00:10.620> let's<00:00:11.040> say

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
and some human strategy so let's say

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.100 
and some human strategy so let's say
this<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.340> just<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.790> normal<00:00:12.150> churn<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.900> some

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
this is just a normal churn for some

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.780 
this is just a normal churn for some
reason<00:00:13.440> helo<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.950> here<00:00:14.280> let's<00:00:14.519> say<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.639> is

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
reason helo is here let's say this is

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.390 
reason helo is here let's say this is
after<00:00:15.059> jump<00:00:15.330> who<00:00:15.450> knows<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.440> it's<00:00:16.830> helos<00:00:17.130> turn

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
after jump who knows so it's helos turn

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.599 
after jump who knows so it's helos turn
he's<00:00:18.000> human<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.630> sake<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.109> video

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
he's human for the sake of this video

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.179 
he's human for the sake of this video
and<00:00:20.609> he's<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.180> Admiral<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.320> since<00:00:23.039> he's<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and he's the Admiral so since he's the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.279 
and he's the Admiral so since he's the
Admiral<00:00:23.609> he<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:24.000> use<00:00:24.150> an<00:00:24.300> action<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.960> launch<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
Admiral he can use an action to launch a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.380 
Admiral he can use an action to launch a
nuke<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.160> he<00:00:26.279> uses<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:26.880> it's<00:00:27.180> gone

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
nuke so he uses that up it's gone

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.959 
nuke so he uses that up it's gone
forever<00:00:28.490> he<00:00:29.490> uses<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> nuke<00:00:30.029> he<00:00:30.570> rolls<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.380> dice

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
forever he uses the nuke he rolls a dice

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.930 
forever he uses the nuke he rolls a dice
she's<00:00:32.969> over<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:34.130> five<00:00:35.130> good<00:00:35.579> that's<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
she's over here five good that's a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.500 
she's over here five good that's a
pretty<00:00:36.120> decent<00:00:36.329> roll<00:00:37.160> he<00:00:38.160> damages<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.270> twice

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
pretty decent roll he damages it twice

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.720 
pretty decent roll he damages it twice
I'm<00:00:39.840> not<00:00:39.960> using<00:00:40.170> he<00:00:40.350> destroys<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.739> if<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
I'm not using he destroys it if you

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
I'm not using he destroys it if you
rolled<00:00:41.910> low<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> would<00:00:42.390> damage<00:00:42.540> twice<00:00:42.899> he<00:00:43.110> can

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
rolled low it would damage twice he can

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.330 
rolled low it would damage twice he can
actually<00:00:43.469> choose<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.649> reroll<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.250> he

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
actually choose to reroll that if he

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.910 
actually choose to reroll that if he
wants<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.570> let's<00:00:45.719> say<00:00:45.809> he<00:00:45.930> does<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.320> he

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
wants so let's say he does that he

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.760 
wants so let's say he does that he
damages<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.579> twice<00:00:48.230> good<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.410> him<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.739> that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
damages it twice good for him and that

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.080 
damages it twice good for him and that
actually<00:00:50.520> would<00:00:50.610> kill<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:52.399> now<00:00:53.399> let's<00:00:53.879> say

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
actually would kill it now let's say

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.920 
actually would kill it now let's say
it's<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.750> Lee<00:00:55.500> Adama<00:00:55.680> Stern<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.579> let's<00:00:57.449> say<00:00:57.660> Lee

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
it's a Lee Adama Stern and let's say Lee

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.840 
it's a Lee Adama Stern and let's say Lee
Adama<00:00:58.140> who's<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> ship<00:00:59.160> right<00:00:59.370> now<00:00:59.399> let's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
Adama who's in the ship right now let's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.009 
Adama who's in the ship right now let's
say<00:01:00.000> he<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> Cylon<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> he<00:01:03.510> goes<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.989> know

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
say he is a Cylon so he goes you know

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.140 
say he is a Cylon so he goes you know
what<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.530> don't<00:01:04.920> trust<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.369> helo<00:01:05.729> even<00:01:06.090> though

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
what I don't trust you helo even though

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.789 
what I don't trust you helo even though
you<00:01:06.210> totally<00:01:06.570> should<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:07.500> he<00:01:07.650> just

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you totally should because he just

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
you totally should because he just
destroyed<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.250> thing<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> he's<00:01:09.450> gonna

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
destroyed that thing for you he's gonna

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.210 
destroyed that thing for you he's gonna
go<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.470> gonna<00:01:10.680> discard<00:01:11.070> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
go you know what I'm gonna discard a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.539 
go you know what I'm gonna discard a
card<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.060> onto<00:01:12.240> Galactica

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
card to get onto Galactica

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.240 
card to get onto Galactica
so<00:01:14.549> he<00:01:14.700> discards<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.509> card<00:01:15.950> he's<00:01:16.950> no<00:01:17.100> longer

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
so he discards a card he's no longer

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.990 
so he discards a card he's no longer
piloting<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.299> goes<00:01:18.420> back<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> reserves

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
piloting this it goes back to reserves

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.149 
piloting this it goes back to reserves
he<00:01:21.000> goes<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.540> Admirals<00:01:21.869> quarters<00:01:22.080> which<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.920> a

he goes the Admirals quarters which is a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.640 
he goes the Admirals quarters which is a
skill<00:01:23.520> check<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.659> activating<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.229> location

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
skill check it's activating the location

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.260 
skill check it's activating the location
as<00:01:25.740> his<00:01:25.920> action<00:01:26.250> that's<00:01:26.400> movement<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.150> in

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
as his action that's movement and in

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.640 
as his action that's movement and in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
throw helo in the brig to throw him in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.530 
throw helo in the brig to throw him in
the<00:01:35.400> Brig

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the Brig

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
the Brig
which<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.590> jail<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:39.380> destiny<00:01:40.380> deck

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
which is like a jail so destiny deck

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
which is like a jail so destiny deck
gets<00:01:40.979> thrown<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:41.610> everybody<00:01:42.030> puts<00:01:42.390> in

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
gets thrown in there everybody puts in

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.770 
gets thrown in there everybody puts in
cards<00:01:42.930> let's<00:01:43.560> say<00:01:43.740> he<00:01:43.920> gets<00:01:44.070> thrown<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> break

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
cards let's say he gets thrown the break

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.030 
cards let's say he gets thrown the break
because<00:01:45.780> he's<00:01:46.110> thrown<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.470> brig<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
because he's thrown in the brig the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
because he's thrown in the brig the
whenever<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.149> admiral<00:01:48.600> gets<00:01:48.780> thrown<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
whenever an admiral gets thrown in the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.810 
whenever an admiral gets thrown in the
brig<00:01:49.259> he<00:01:49.979> actually<00:01:50.340> loses<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.970> Admiral<00:01:51.329> C<00:01:51.570> so

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
brig he actually loses the Admiral C so

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.670 
brig he actually loses the Admiral C so
he<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:54.060> no<00:01:54.210> longer<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.020> Admiral<00:01:55.439> once

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
he would no longer be the Admiral once

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.440 
he would no longer be the Admiral once
he<00:01:55.770> gets<00:01:55.920> thrown<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.280> brig<00:01:56.399> whoever<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
he gets thrown in the brig whoever it is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.499 
he gets thrown in the brig whoever it is
is<00:01:57.719> next<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> line<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.649> secession<00:01:59.509> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
is next in the line of secession and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.480 
is next in the line of secession and
guess<00:02:01.200> who's<00:02:01.380> next<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.770> line<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:01.920> secession

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
guess who's next in line is secession

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.260 
guess who's next in line is secession
for<00:02:02.850> Admiral<00:02:03.270> C<00:02:03.710> Lee<00:02:04.710> Adama<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.969> Lee<00:02:06.149> Adama

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
for Admiral C Lee Adama is so Lee Adama

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.719 
for Admiral C Lee Adama is so Lee Adama
because<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> Admiral<00:02:07.380> from<00:02:08.009> now<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.670> only

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
because the Admiral from now on not only

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.320 
because the Admiral from now on not only
does<00:02:09.060> he

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
does he

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.700 
does he
have<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.630> remaining<00:02:10.050> nuke<00:02:10.290> that<00:02:10.500> he'll

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
have that remaining nuke that he'll

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.500 
have that remaining nuke that he'll
probably<00:02:10.920> waste<00:02:11.370> when<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.700> don't<00:02:11.880> need<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.210> or

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
probably waste when we don't need it or

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.200 
probably waste when we don't need it or
he'll<00:02:13.050> never<00:02:13.200> use<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:14.280> also<00:02:14.340> he<00:02:14.820> sees<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
he'll never use it but also he sees the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.320 
he'll never use it but also he sees the
destiny<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.870> destinations<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:18.000> every<00:02:18.210> time

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
destiny the destinations so every time

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.020 
destiny the destinations so every time
we<00:02:18.450> jump<00:02:18.690> he<00:02:19.170> sees<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.620> next<00:02:19.830> place<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.370> so

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
we jump he sees the next place to go so

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.610 
we jump he sees the next place to go so
he's<00:02:21.240> going<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.480> choose<00:02:21.630> terrible<00:02:22.080> places

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.320
