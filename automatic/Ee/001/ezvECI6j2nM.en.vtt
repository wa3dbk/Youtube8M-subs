rares<00:00:37.970> I<00:00:38.180> found<00:00:38.480> recently<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:39.680> I<00:00:39.890> will<00:00:40.520> be

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
rares I found recently so I will be

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.700 
rares I found recently so I will be
identifying<00:00:41.360> them<00:00:41.600> all<00:00:41.809> together<00:00:43.180> after<00:00:44.180> I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
identifying them all together after I

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.590

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
kill the Goblin there's two rings so

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.260

00:00:50.270 --> 00:01:01.520 
hopefully I get some nice magic so what
I<00:00:50.300> usually<00:00:50.510> do<00:00:50.810> is<00:00:50.840> just<00:00:51.080> use<00:00:51.260> my<00:00:51.860> demon

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
something just so that it is this not

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.730 
something just so that it is this not
that<00:02:38.550> good<00:02:38.850> actually<00:02:39.320> discussing<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.470> dies

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
that good actually discussing this dies

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.070 
that good actually discussing this dies
but<00:02:41.040> too<00:02:41.490> bad<00:02:41.520> only<00:02:41.880> 11<00:02:42.420> /<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:42.930> like

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
but too bad only 11 / so just like

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.510 
but too bad only 11 / so just like
sixteen<00:02:43.470> percent<00:02:43.740> of<00:02:43.890> increasing<00:02:49.520> thirteen

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
sixteen percent of increasing thirteen

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.790 
sixteen percent of increasing thirteen
percent<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.930> yeah<00:02:55.050> out<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.410> what<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.680> know

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
percent so yeah out of what you know

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.530 
percent so yeah out of what you know
maybe<00:02:56.040> like<00:02:56.250> 50<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.670> me<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:56.970> just<00:02:57.240> thought<00:02:57.420> you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
maybe like 50 I me I just thought you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.940 
maybe like 50 I me I just thought you
might<00:02:57.690> get<00:02:57.870> one<00:02:58.170> that's<00:02:58.350> really<00:02:58.680> good<00:02:58.830> but

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
might get one that's really good but

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.070 
might get one that's really good but
myself<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.880> lot<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.690> don't<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:00.959> that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
myself for a lot and I don't have that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.040 
myself for a lot and I don't have that
much<00:03:01.200> better<00:03:01.440> now<00:03:01.680> because<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.160> have<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.340> lot<00:03:02.580> of

much better now because I have a lot of

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.310 
much better now because I have a lot of
gold<00:03:04.050> tied<00:03:04.350> up<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.690> items<00:03:06.690> like<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.170> bought

percent let's go for like one prevent I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.810 
percent let's go for like one prevent I
got<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> three<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.810> them<00:03:12.930> right<00:03:13.080> now<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:14.220> auction

the<00:03:22.739> end<00:03:23.150> dexterity<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:25.890> really<00:03:26.700> looking<00:03:27.510> for

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
the end dexterity I really looking for

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
the end dexterity I really looking for
is<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:30.239> Rings<00:03:30.540> because<00:03:31.080> if<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.620> could<00:03:31.770> be

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
is the Rings because if it could be

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.460 
is the Rings because if it could be
eighteen<00:03:32.190> percent<00:03:32.400> I'd<00:03:33.060> be<00:03:33.209> really<00:03:33.390> nice<00:03:33.630> belt

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
eighteen percent I'd be really nice belt

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.930 
eighteen percent I'd be really nice belt
it's<00:03:34.830> actually<00:03:35.180> decent<00:03:36.650> 51%<00:03:37.650> with<00:03:37.980> some<00:03:38.310> huge

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
it's actually decent 51% with some huge

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.680 
it's actually decent 51% with some huge
a<00:03:39.570> lot<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.350> globe<00:03:40.680> increase<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:41.940> for<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.239> little

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
a lot of globe increase in for a little

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.190 
a lot of globe increase in for a little
low<00:03:42.959> on<00:03:42.989> dexterity<00:03:43.709> maybe<00:03:44.070> some<00:03:44.610> low-level

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
low on dexterity maybe some low-level

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.940 
low on dexterity maybe some low-level
beginning<00:03:46.200> monkey<00:03:47.040> use<00:03:47.510> how<00:03:48.510> much<00:03:48.660> they're<00:03:48.989> so

as you can see haven't really got much
yet<00:03:52.080> us<00:03:52.590> okay<00:03:53.549> fourteen<00:03:54.269> percent<00:03:54.510> with<00:03:55.260> 57

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
yet us okay fourteen percent with 57

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.400 
yet us okay fourteen percent with 57
resists<00:03:56.730> maybe<00:03:57.450> someone<00:03:57.690> can<00:03:57.810> use<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.170> you

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
resists maybe someone can use that you

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.360 
resists maybe someone can use that you
can<00:03:58.560> see<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:58.980> 16-percent<00:03:59.700> with<00:03:59.970> 41

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
can see I have a 16-percent with 41

can see I have a 16-percent with 41
listen<00:04:02.239> texture<00:04:02.599> so<00:04:02.840> wouldn't<00:04:03.590> be<00:04:03.620> awkward

could be useful i have to look up week

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.159 
could be useful i have to look up week
all<00:04:28.760> right<00:04:28.970> two<00:04:29.389> more<00:04:29.690> left<00:04:31.479> thirteen<00:04:32.479> percent

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
all right two more left thirteen percent

magic<00:04:33.680> fly<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:37.930> no<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.740> they<00:04:40.280> don't<00:04:40.460> get

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
magic fly and no so they don't get

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.939 
magic fly and no so they don't get
really<00:04:41.090> much<00:04:41.389> this<00:04:41.780> one<00:04:42.110> might<00:04:42.590> be<00:04:42.620> okay<00:04:44.949> this

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
really much this one might be okay this

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:51.010 
really much this one might be okay this
one<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.400> decent<00:04:47.210> for<00:04:48.100> someone<00:04:49.100> who<00:04:49.220> used<00:04:50.020> but

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
one is decent for someone who used but

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.310 
one is decent for someone who used but
yeah<00:04:51.139> that's<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.620> for<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:51.979> video<00:04:52.160> again<00:04:52.610> took

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
yeah that's it for the video again took

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.270 
yeah that's it for the video again took
maybe<00:04:54.370> two<00:04:55.370> hours<00:04:55.400> three<00:04:56.090> hours<00:04:56.240> upon<00:04:56.870> that

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
maybe two hours three hours upon that

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.860 
maybe two hours three hours upon that
again<00:04:58.280> this<00:04:58.490> gets<00:04:58.699> tons<00:04:59.090> of<00:04:59.270> Blues<00:04:59.510> you<00:04:59.720> can

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
again this gets tons of Blues you can

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.110 
again this gets tons of Blues you can
see<00:05:00.080> outlook<00:05:00.620> this<00:05:00.830> is<00:05:01.010> seventeen<00:05:01.430> percent<00:05:01.580> so

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
see outlook this is seventeen percent so

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.480 
see outlook this is seventeen percent so
it<00:05:02.270> would<00:05:02.449> actually<00:05:02.600> even<00:05:02.990> be<00:05:03.139> a<00:05:03.490> improvement

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
it would actually even be a improvement

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.730 
it would actually even be a improvement
for<00:05:04.669> me<00:05:04.820> if<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:05.570> was<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:06.050> get<00:05:06.380> rid<00:05:06.440> of<00:05:06.560> the

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
for me if I was to get rid of the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.560 
for me if I was to get rid of the
obvious<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.580> exterior<00:05:07.940> which<00:05:08.150> is<00:05:08.270> not<00:05:08.450> that

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
obvious and exterior which is not that

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.330 
obvious and exterior which is not that
big<00:05:08.690> of<00:05:08.750> deal<00:05:08.870> for<00:05:09.229> me<00:05:09.380> since<00:05:09.650> I'm<00:05:10.099> just

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
big of deal for me since I'm just

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.640 
big of deal for me since I'm just
hunting<00:05:10.550> goblins<00:05:10.970> so<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.750> might<00:05:12.020> even<00:05:12.050> use<00:05:12.229> that

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
hunting goblins so I might even use that

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.400 
hunting goblins so I might even use that
for<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.280> extra<00:05:13.550> two<00:05:13.700> percent<00:05:14.110> but<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.260> could

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
for the extra two percent but you could

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.110 
for the extra two percent but you could
definitely<00:05:15.530> get<00:05:15.919> some<00:05:16.099> decent<00:05:16.280> blues<00:05:16.789> and<00:05:17.030> if

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
definitely get some decent blues and if

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.000 
definitely get some decent blues and if
you<00:05:17.180> get<00:05:17.360> even<00:05:17.599> eighteen<00:05:18.440> percent<00:05:18.590> magic

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
you get even eighteen percent magic

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.909 
you get even eighteen percent magic
flying<00:05:19.220> bluray<00:05:19.820> that's<00:05:20.180> worth<00:05:20.510> 1.5<00:05:21.410> million

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
flying bluray that's worth 1.5 million

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.159 
flying bluray that's worth 1.5 million
so<00:05:22.220> nothing<00:05:23.150> is<00:05:23.180> some<00:05:23.360> nice<00:05:23.599> way<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:23.870> make

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
so nothing is some nice way to make

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.410 
so nothing is some nice way to make
money
