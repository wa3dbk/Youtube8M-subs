00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.550
 the shooter 

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.210
 but now the other side was behind it it promised went into the ride to it 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.030
 East 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.350
 how the child for the voices everyone dived in an arms factory 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.149
 after earlier 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.619
 today it is in the same mission style in the search for the approach 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.399
 don't look here 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.229
 and then we are again 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.470
 rarely lemon the same factory 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.410
 therefore not allowed 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.700
 previous proposals were two goals that will be set 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.310
 could see the disaster on the road 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.180
 because now we take it easy because of accidents due to the incredible 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.180
 not like a hitman absolution i have this one as for example 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.220
 those posters a painting on the wall the shot of fat freddy's drop 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.760
 also rarely become so prosperous 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.170
 to sleep 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.259
 plan the same route as last time though a skinny these chosen ones are nothing 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.570
 brains out of the pan 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.490
 so the text boy 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.410
 in 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.080
 in the city that delivers that you will never again 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.320
 You actually see a kind of guest from the report about it for an important 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.680
 part in the tropical cyclones were before marko arnautovic would seem to be 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.390
 me in spain what he is talking about that is the next level 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.450
 this group don't do it 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.349
 this section encodes 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.179
 we need that to kill first 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:17.329
 how to make it live on an accident 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.289
 according to mourinho around 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.289
 senegal not yet because it can make you want more 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.909
 and those guests I have to have 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.729
 but it took a while before you come to the right place 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.729
 so maybe a good time to flush 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.729
 if i am right then he will discuss if i am fond of if 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:44.899
 Greece 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:49.629
 Peter Eastgate also allowed people to separate the drilling leaders from the big market 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:50.689
 to this game 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.969
 but that aside 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:54.339
 the 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:56.919
 the 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.919
 the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.039
 on 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.039
 the 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:10.419
 there he goes 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.419
 on the way to his death 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.179
 dr 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:45.079
 all 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.540
 and only the seven who code in it lead the way but still the victims 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.540
 who fell or made jumps 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.329
 and therefore a point is inside 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.459
 seen in the action you are right to finish 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.839
 the base 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:06.919
 It was also that makes the easier part of the mission 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.370
 do you think 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.370
 through the church 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.979
 after a tip 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.199
 Trying twenty times knows exactly how to wear shorts 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.199
 without being seen 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.889
 and then I go to the euro is also not 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.889
 to log in for an Alkmaar 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.259
 he did report 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.110
 the 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.270
 then both come to perfection when people I can't 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.610
 solve that gastronomy chair that I see just want me to do it differently 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.800
 can do well but we will continue 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.220
 luckily I was now just not being seen as a Afghan 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.650
 brewer 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.650
 so the entire room 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.789
 and you for yourself, by the way, is yourself 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.900
 many cool suffer from the smoke 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.900
 he laughs and that said especially 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.199
 now the waiting is coming to do what you have to do 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.080
 so rightly so 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.080
 we were just transported 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.959
 and now runner became second goal to where he must be and me 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.959
 see my chance to make the round too many to mention 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.919
 they see along those rules 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.919
 brother the tension of the building fund 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.889
 but they clearly do the sea on that chair 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.259
 and I occasionally ask myself through his head 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.039
 he can hang on the bar but we can be average a box was enough 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.919
 because I am there we will go the coming period 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.860
 but now I have to escape 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.879
 and I do it exactly the same way as the first time 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:53.679
 because those guys got better at that for the second time the robot arm 

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:56.679
 just kidding 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.610
 with this 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.560
 endo we do that 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.560
 opened last week 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:31.059
 the ruling on 

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:31.889
 refuse 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:34.029
 some say have seen something 

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:36.799
 I hope you have an idea of ​​the two totally different ones 

00:07:36.799 --> 00:07:38.440
 playing styles 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.770
 but at the moment absolutely record 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.120
 let you enjoy it 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.490
 on this particular 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.490
 the only episode of wooden plays party 

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:48.750
 in the group 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.380
 not only the lecture you will find extensive discussion about assessment 

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.629
 from hitman absolution 

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:55.039
 the few days later 

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:57.219
 is now in stores 

00:07:57.219 --> 00:07:59.330
 that is enjoying the 4 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.459
 the twice
