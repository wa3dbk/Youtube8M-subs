00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
battery wire and then you want to get

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.719 
battery wire and then you want to get
the<00:01:08.280> end<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.610> your<00:01:09.110> light<00:01:10.110> strip<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.729> just

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the end of your light strip and just

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.120 
the end of your light strip and just
touch<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.990> ends<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> wire<00:01:13.530> together<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
touch the ends of the wire together to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.649 
touch the ends of the wire together to
make<00:01:14.280> sure<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:14.909> which<00:01:15.119> side<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
make sure that you know which side is

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.780 
make sure that you know which side is
positive<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.290> which<00:01:16.380> side<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.740> negative<00:01:16.860> if

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
positive and which side is negative if

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.490 
positive and which side is negative if
they<00:01:18.060> light<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
they light up then you know you have it

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
they light up then you know you have it
correct<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
correct and then you're just going to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.359 
correct and then you're just going to
want<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.869> twist<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.740> positive<00:01:23.220> end<00:01:23.430> around

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
want to twist the positive end around

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.980 
want to twist the positive end around
the<00:01:26.369> positive<00:01:26.850> wire<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.299> twist<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> negative

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the positive wire and twist the negative

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.770 
the positive wire and twist the negative
around<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:29.549> negative<00:01:30.000> end<00:01:30.240> around<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
around the negative end around the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.050 
around the negative end around the
negative<00:01:31.140> wire<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> first<00:01:32.759> thing<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
negative wire so the first thing you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.569 
negative wire so the first thing you
need<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.770> connect<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.369> battery

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
need to do is to connect to your battery

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.289 
need to do is to connect to your battery
clip<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.990> figure<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.590> which<00:01:37.950> end<00:01:38.310> of

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
clip and then figure out which end of

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.270 
clip and then figure out which end of
the<00:01:39.420> lights<00:01:39.659> wire<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.680> positive<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the lights wire is the positive and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.429 
the lights wire is the positive and
which<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> negative<00:01:41.869> if<00:01:42.869> they<00:01:43.020> come<00:01:43.229> on

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
which is the negative if they come on

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.090 
which is the negative if they come on
then<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.430> correct<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
then you know you have it correct and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.100 
then you know you have it correct and
then<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:47.729> want<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.030> keep<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.450> separate

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
then you just want to keep that separate

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.510 
then you just want to keep that separate
and<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> same<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:50.100> other<00:01:50.250> light

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
and do the same with your other light

these but if you want to solder them

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:40.410 
these but if you want to solder them
that's<00:02:31.340> fine<00:02:35.710> and<00:02:36.710> then<00:02:37.150> combine<00:02:38.150> all<00:02:38.390> three

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
that's fine and then combine all three

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:55.770 
that's fine and then combine all three
positive<00:02:41.420> wires<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.790> twist<00:02:43.790> those<00:02:44.180> up

then you want to get a piece of

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.230 
then you want to get a piece of
electrical<00:03:03.430> tape<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:09.400> make<00:03:09.700> sure<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.120> the

battery clip to make sure that it works

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.810 
battery clip to make sure that it works
and<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.800> does<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:18.310> get<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.580> piece<00:03:18.790> of

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
and it does and get a piece of

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.140 
and it does and get a piece of
electrical<00:03:19.360> tape<00:03:23.490> wrap<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.670> around<00:03:24.790> one<00:03:25.120> of

electrical tape wrap it around one of

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.310 
electrical tape wrap it around one of
your<00:03:25.270> connections<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:30.630> then<00:03:31.630> wrap<00:03:32.020> it<00:03:32.050> around

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
your connections and then wrap it around

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:41.670 
your connections and then wrap it around
the<00:03:32.620> other<00:03:32.770> one<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.690> then<00:03:40.900> I'm<00:03:41.080> going<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.380> just

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
the other one and then I'm going to just

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.610 
the other one and then I'm going to just
twist<00:03:41.920> this<00:03:42.310> wire<00:03:42.630> back<00:03:43.630> up<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.080> tape<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.350> over

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
twist this wire back up and tape it over

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.140 
twist this wire back up and tape it over
again<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:45.250> can<00:03:45.400> have<00:03:45.610> one<00:03:45.820> nice

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
again so that we can have one nice

00:03:46.150 --> 00:04:05.319 
again so that we can have one nice
straight<00:03:46.630> wire

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.110 

now<00:04:06.329> all<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.659> have<00:04:06.689> to<00:04:06.870> do<00:04:07.140> is<00:04:07.909> mount<00:04:08.909> these

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
now all you have to do is mount these

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.160 
now all you have to do is mount these
lights<00:04:09.750> somewhere<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.560> your<00:04:11.189> car<00:04:11.510> if<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.930> can

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
lights somewhere in your car if you can

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.960 
lights somewhere in your car if you can
I've<00:04:13.379> seen<00:04:13.620> them<00:04:13.769> mounted<00:04:14.099> on<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.310> inside<00:04:14.340> or

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
I've seen them mounted on the inside or

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.330 
I've seen them mounted on the inside or
you<00:04:15.060> can<00:04:15.269> mount<00:04:15.420> them<00:04:15.659> on<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.470> bottom<00:04:16.889> facing

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
you can mount them on the bottom facing

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.029 
you can mount them on the bottom facing
the<00:04:17.430> ground<00:04:17.699> or<00:04:18.030> facing<00:04:18.660> out<00:04:18.810> weather<00:04:19.709> doesn't

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
the ground or facing out weather doesn't

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.129 
the ground or facing out weather doesn't
matter<00:04:20.160> where<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:20.430> put<00:04:20.579> them<00:04:20.729> on<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.389> car<00:04:21.720> where

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
matter where you put them on a car where

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.040 
matter where you put them on a car where
the<00:04:22.289> roof<00:04:22.470> separates<00:04:23.039> from<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.030> body<00:04:24.330> the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
the roof separates from the body the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.170 
the roof separates from the body the
easiest<00:04:25.710> way<00:04:25.889> to<00:04:25.919> do<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.220> is<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.490> actually<00:04:26.759> take

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
easiest way to do it is to actually take

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.529 
easiest way to do it is to actually take
the<00:04:27.449> battery<00:04:28.250> either<00:04:29.250> leave<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:29.910> in<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> truck

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
the battery either leave it in the truck

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.029 
the battery either leave it in the truck
or<00:04:30.720> tape<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.229> roof<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:31.680> then<00:04:31.800> tape

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
or tape it to the roof and then tape

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.060 
or tape it to the roof and then tape
these<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.760> edges<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.240> body<00:04:33.919> so<00:04:34.919> now

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
these to the edges of the body so now

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.830 
these to the edges of the body so now
that<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.400> lights<00:04:35.639> are<00:04:35.940> all<00:04:36.090> wired<00:04:36.360> up<00:04:36.600> I've

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
that the lights are all wired up I've

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.740 
that the lights are all wired up I've
decided<00:04:37.229> I'm<00:04:37.500> going<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.210> install<00:04:39.210> them<00:04:39.419> on<00:04:39.570> my

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
decided I'm going to install them on my

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.939 
decided I'm going to install them on my
volcano<00:04:40.350> EPX<00:04:41.330> so<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:43.139> first<00:04:43.350> thing<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:43.590> do<00:04:43.800> is

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
volcano EPX so the first thing to do is

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.650 
volcano EPX so the first thing to do is
take<00:04:44.160> off<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.520> cover<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:44.850> decide<00:04:45.300> where<00:04:45.539> to

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
take off the cover and decide where to

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.020 
take off the cover and decide where to
put<00:04:45.810> them<00:04:45.990> so<00:04:46.949> I<00:04:46.979> have<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.280> cover<00:04:47.490> off<00:04:47.729> as<00:04:47.910> you

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
put them so I have the cover off as you

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.320 
put them so I have the cover off as you
can<00:04:48.090> see<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:50.490> I've<00:04:50.610> decided<00:04:50.880> I'm<00:04:51.120> going<00:04:51.270> to

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
can see and I've decided I'm going to

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.890 
can see and I've decided I'm going to
mount<00:04:51.539> them<00:04:51.780> on<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.250> inside<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:54.180> body<00:04:54.599> I'm

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
mount them on the inside of the body I'm

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.409 
mount them on the inside of the body I'm
going<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.229> just<00:04:55.440> going<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.680> attach<00:04:56.130> them<00:04:56.699> with

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
going to just going to attach them with

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.050 
going to just going to attach them with
some<00:04:57.570> electrical<00:04:58.020> tape<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.530> grooves<00:04:59.060> that

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
some electrical tape to the grooves that

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.779 
some electrical tape to the grooves that
are<00:05:00.210> back<00:05:00.539> here<00:05:00.919> around<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.250> liner<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.760> can

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
are back here around the liner you can

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.279 
are back here around the liner you can
kind<00:05:03.210> of<00:05:03.240> see<00:05:03.419> there's<00:05:03.630> a<00:05:03.690> little<00:05:03.780> indentation

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
kind of see there's a little indentation

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.529 
kind of see there's a little indentation
that<00:05:04.470> goes<00:05:04.680> all<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:04.919> way<00:05:05.039> around<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.639> happens

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
that goes all the way around and happens

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.300 
that goes all the way around and happens
to<00:05:06.690> fit<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.990> lights<00:05:07.169> pretty<00:05:07.410> well<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:07.949> I'll

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
to fit the lights pretty well so I'll

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.839 
to fit the lights pretty well so I'll
get<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.789> hooked<00:05:09.539> up<00:05:10.160> so<00:05:11.160> now<00:05:11.340> I<00:05:11.370> have<00:05:11.699> it

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
get that hooked up so now I have it

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.969 
get that hooked up so now I have it
attached<00:05:12.449> to<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.900> hood<00:05:13.139> I<00:05:13.409> just<00:05:14.190> use<00:05:14.430> some

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
attached to the hood I just use some

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.960 
attached to the hood I just use some
electrical<00:05:16.979> tape<00:05:18.349> ran<00:05:19.349> the<00:05:19.590> wires<00:05:19.880> to<00:05:20.880> the

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
electrical tape ran the wires to the

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.170 
electrical tape ran the wires to the
back<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.659> tape<00:05:22.620> them<00:05:22.800> down<00:05:23.039> and<00:05:23.310> then<00:05:23.789> all

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
back and tape them down and then all

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.550 
back and tape them down and then all
that's<00:05:24.330> left<00:05:24.479> to<00:05:24.659> do<00:05:24.810> now<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:25.020> install<00:05:25.470> the

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
that's left to do now is install the

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.620 
that's left to do now is install the
better<00:05:25.770> so<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.490> decided<00:05:26.849> to<00:05:27.000> mount<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.449> battery

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
better so I decided to mount the battery

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.350 
better so I decided to mount the battery
at<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.680> back<00:05:28.919> of<00:05:29.099> the<00:05:29.190> car<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.460> just<00:05:29.699> used<00:05:30.150> some

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
at the back of the car I just used some

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.960 
at the back of the car I just used some
electrical<00:05:30.960> tape<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:32.430> wrapped<00:05:32.699> it<00:05:32.909> around

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
electrical tape and I wrapped it around

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.850 
electrical tape and I wrapped it around
the<00:05:33.330> rear<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:35.460> I<00:05:36.150> used<00:05:36.990> some<00:05:37.139> electrical<00:05:37.680> tape

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
the rear the I used some electrical tape

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.159 
the rear the I used some electrical tape
and<00:05:38.010> I<00:05:38.099> wrapped<00:05:38.310> it<00:05:38.460> around<00:05:38.550> a<00:05:39.150> part<00:05:39.990> of<00:05:40.050> the

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
and I wrapped it around a part of the

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.439 
and I wrapped it around a part of the
frame<00:05:40.470> at<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:40.710> back<00:05:41.010> and<00:05:41.849> it's<00:05:42.150> not<00:05:42.300> super

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
frame at the back and it's not super

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.219 
frame at the back and it's not super
solid<00:05:42.990> but<00:05:43.169> it's<00:05:43.380> on<00:05:43.560> there<00:05:43.800> it'll<00:05:44.430> it'll<00:05:45.000> do

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
solid but it's on there it'll it'll do

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.719 
solid but it's on there it'll it'll do
and<00:05:46.229> I<00:05:46.320> just<00:05:46.620> have<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:46.800> connect<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.400> battery

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
and I just have to connect the battery

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:54.889 
and I just have to connect the battery
clip

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:54.899 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:58.499 

and<00:05:55.899> the<00:05:56.110> lights<00:05:56.319> come<00:05:56.709> on<00:05:56.889> doesn't<00:05:57.879> that<00:05:58.209> look

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509
