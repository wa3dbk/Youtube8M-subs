00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
Steve Smith okay that's the full pattern

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.709 
Steve Smith okay that's the full pattern
when<00:00:50.510> I<00:00:50.539> originally<00:00:50.840> heard<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:52.149> it<00:00:53.149> was<00:00:53.179> it<00:00:53.600> was

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
when I originally heard it it was it was

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.500 
when I originally heard it it was it was
more<00:00:54.379> of<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.649> Latin<00:00:55.100> kind<00:00:55.699> of<00:00:55.820> style<00:00:56.179> where<00:00:56.480> the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
more of a Latin kind of style where the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.299 
more of a Latin kind of style where the
bass<00:00:56.750> drum<00:00:57.079> was<00:00:57.230> playing<00:00:57.440> a<00:00:57.530> simpler<00:00:58.039> part

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
bass drum was playing a simpler part

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.680 
bass drum was playing a simpler part
which<00:00:59.269> was<00:00:59.449> in<00:00:59.629> unison<00:01:00.109> to<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:00.379> right<00:01:00.559> cymbal

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
which was in unison to the right cymbal

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:26.550 
which was in unison to the right cymbal
and<00:01:03.160> that<00:01:04.160> sounded<00:01:05.089> more<00:01:05.300> like<00:01:05.600> this

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.010 

okay<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:27.620> that<00:01:27.950> was<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.130> Latin<00:01:28.730> part<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.900> get

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
okay so that was the Latin part to get

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.150 
okay so that was the Latin part to get
your<00:01:30.170> head<00:01:30.320> round<00:01:30.500> they<00:01:30.680> should<00:01:30.830> really<00:01:31.010> need

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
your head round they should really need

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.280 
your head round they should really need
to<00:01:31.250> break<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.640> down<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.300> what<00:01:32.750> we're<00:01:32.900> gonna

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
to break it down so what we're gonna

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.700 
to break it down so what we're gonna
start<00:01:33.830> with<00:01:33.980> is<00:01:34.040> just<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.490> basic<00:01:35.260> eighths<00:01:36.260> on

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
start with is just the basic eighths on

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.160 
start with is just the basic eighths on
the<00:01:36.950> hi-hat

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
the hi-hat

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.350 
the hi-hat
the<00:01:39.170> one<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.740> three<00:01:40.100> on<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.460> kick<00:01:40.640> drum<00:01:40.820> and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
the one and three on the kick drum and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.790 
the one and three on the kick drum and
we'll<00:01:41.540> work<00:01:41.690> on<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:41.990> snare<00:01:42.200> part<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:42.710> there

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
we'll work on the snare part and there

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.850 
we'll work on the snare part and there
the<00:01:42.890> snare<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.370> is<00:01:43.610> is<00:01:44.540> two<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:44.990> four<00:01:45.230> normally

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
the snare is is is two and four normally

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.690 
the snare is is is two and four normally
and<00:01:46.040> then<00:01:46.730> the<00:01:46.880> ghost<00:01:47.090> notes<00:01:47.450> are<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:49.250> e<00:01:49.460> and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
and then the ghost notes are the e and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.900 
and then the ghost notes are the e and
the<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.210> one<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.890> backbeat<00:01:52.220> on<00:01:52.370> -<00:01:52.610> and

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
the and of one the backbeat on - and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.520 
the and of one the backbeat on - and
then<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:54.110> E<00:01:54.410> and<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.430> two<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.030> repeats

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
then the E and a of two and that repeats

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.420 
then the E and a of two and that repeats
so<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.680> would<00:01:57.830> be<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.190> E<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.720> end<00:02:00.050> of

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
so that would be the E and the end of

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.820 
so that would be the E and the end of
three<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:02.240> back<00:02:02.479> beat<00:02:02.690> on<00:02:02.720> four<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.410> then<00:02:03.740> the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
three the back beat on four and then the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:35.199 
three the back beat on four and then the
ene<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:05.630> will<00:02:05.780> sound<00:02:06.020> like<00:02:06.080> this<00:02:34.209> okay

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
ene and that will sound like this okay

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.010 
ene and that will sound like this okay
so<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.860> bass<00:02:37.220> drum<00:02:37.459> part<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.480> same<00:02:38.750> as<00:02:38.900> the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
so the bass drum part is the same as the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.160 
so the bass drum part is the same as the
snare<00:02:39.290> snare<00:02:40.130> drum<00:02:40.430> part<00:02:40.670> but<00:02:41.239> it's<00:02:41.480> displaced

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
snare snare drum part but it's displaced

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.290 
snare snare drum part but it's displaced
a<00:02:42.530> quarter<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.610> quarter<00:02:44.540> note<00:02:44.920> later<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:47.239> it

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
a quarter a quarter note later on so it

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.810 
a quarter a quarter note later on so it
starts<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.690> little<00:02:47.720> bit<00:02:48.110> later<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:48.640> I'll<00:02:49.640> play

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
starts a little bit later so I'll play

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.460 
starts a little bit later so I'll play
outs<00:02:50.000> on<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.269> hi-hat<00:02:50.450> two<00:02:50.930> or<00:02:51.080> four<00:02:51.290> on<00:02:51.380> the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
outs on the hi-hat two or four on the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.100 
outs on the hi-hat two or four on the
snare<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.890> I'll<00:02:52.670> bring<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.180> bass<00:02:53.510> drum<00:02:53.780> parts

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:23.849 
snare and I'll bring the bass drum parts
in

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.020 

okay<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:24.920> that's<00:03:25.129> the<00:03:25.310> snare<00:03:25.579> part<00:03:25.849> on<00:03:25.939> the

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
okay so that's the snare part on the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.750 
okay so that's the snare part on the
bass<00:03:26.209> drum<00:03:26.239> part<00:03:26.689> and<00:03:27.370> obviously<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.579> next

bass drum part and obviously the next

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.080 
bass drum part and obviously the next
stage<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:29.420> bring<00:03:29.599> them<00:03:29.750> both<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.109> together

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
stage is to bring them both in together

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.670 
stage is to bring them both in together
stay<00:03:32.090> with<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.420> eighths<00:03:32.569> on<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.989> hi-hat<00:03:33.170> for
