00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.200
 twelfth win of the season 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.110
 in the league bbva del valencià the picture 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.700
 Che managed to beat him by 2 goals to 1 at 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.680
 elche after the great European day 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.009
 before the basilea the valencianista picture 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.140
 very 'plugged in' at all times was the 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.720
 dominator of the party in many phases 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.470
 before an elche that did not arrive so much but 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.360
 who made danger that took danger to the 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.010
 guaita goal when he tried 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.769
 this is the first controversial move 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.879
 they claimed Sunday hand schism the 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.700
 Valencian players the set of 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.510
 pizzi 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.070
 I 'm looking for at the start of the game 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.420
 the first goal and in fact finished it 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.910
 finding 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.059
 in the 21 with this action in which aunt 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.550
 that ends up turning a goal into a goal 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.859
 that michelle intended from the front 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.920
 of the area the shot of michel just 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.190
 becoming the basis for piatti here 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.409
 we see it is in regulatory position 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.119
 the player who would end up receiving the 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.700
 ball and hitting with the left 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.970
 score 1 to 0 until then had 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.850
 arrived more and better in Valencia but in 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.500
 a very long play against the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.690
 illicit table 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.020
 the escrivá men would end 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.270
 scoring the 1 to 1 turnover of 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.860
 michelle recovery by part of 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.170
 Carlos Sanchez does not reach Cristian 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.950
 Herrera and from behind the one who finished 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.320
 firing is ferran corominas chorus 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.560
 scoring 1 to 1 in the 28th minute had 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.890
 passed only 7 minutes from 1 to 0 of 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.550
 Valencia 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.860
 the duel 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.310
 of the Valencian community of this 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.320
 day 33 was being exciting 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.580
 as we said with greater mastery of the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 ball on the part of the box but with 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.900
 a more pragmatic elche in his game he 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.830
 had to retire injured in the minute 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.700
 33 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.150
 botia the central was replaced by 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.150
 lombán 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.980
 setback to write although the 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.590
 bank and got and have coincided during 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.140
 many matches many days as 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.050
 central elche second counterattack 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.130
 lethal or very dangerous of the box 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:36.090
 ilicitano because in the end it does not end in 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.940
 goal avoids guaita the replica puts it 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.560
 see even with this masterful execution 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.670
 from the front of the area that ends 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.849
 taking out the goalkeeper manu herrera 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.780
 the end of the first period was encouraged 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:54.250
 but it would end with tied with tie to 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.250
 1 see the one that gets to have 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.780
 very clear opportunity 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.380
 in the last breath of the first half 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.630
 from colombiano carlos sánchez 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.680
 a great opportunity to put what 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.590
 it would have been 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.219
 1 to 2 on the score valence 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.739
 I would go back in advance I would do it in 16 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:19.860
 evenly scoring the 2 to 1 and his third goal 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.230
 this season in the pdv league 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.080
 another action that comes from a ball 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.170
 rebounded from another footballer who returns to 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.310
 get second line there we see how 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.610
 for the ball 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.280
 jonas take away the ball the bad clearance 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.690
 at the end of the ilicitana defense allows 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.180
 evenly coming from behind it 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.530
 hooked a strong shot was the 2 to 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.270
 1 with which the valence was put by 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.830
 front and with which the valence was 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.200
 passing over milk in the 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.120
 second half here proves it one of the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.820
 envelopes center of refreshment in the second 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.220
 time and he was one of the animators 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:58.850
 of the match cede cartabia good ball 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.850
 blocked by the goalkeeper 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.760
 manu herrera and this would be a play 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.879
 controversy that would end the penalty of 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.120
 piatti about christian herrera and that the 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:16.170
 left alvarez collector would remove 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.160
 in the 25th minute 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.710
 the second period a dubious penalty that 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.390
 would not transform into goal damián suárez 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.860
 because the hand of guaita would avoid what 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.770
 It could have been 2 to 2 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.550
 there we see guaita how it takes out 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.580
 the ball and avoid the goal of the tie 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.650
 elche until the last breath achieved the 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.849
 set of escrivá this was a very 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.960
 clear of another man who entered 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.690
 in the second half huachi 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.479
 in Valencia he managed to hold on at the end 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.630
 the advantage and add in this way the 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.250
 twelfth win of the season 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.860
 here we have again like watch and 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.650
 first prema is with the left and 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.419
 this would be the action 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.270
 of the bar ejection that had already 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.540
 seen a yellow card and in this 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.840
 play loses the ball he puts his hands 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.389
 the foot ends up committing a clear fault and the 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.400
 referee shows that second yellow 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.490
 and we see how the foot clearly puts the 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.900
 knee and get to finally see that 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.580
 second yellow card at the end 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.710
 victory of valencia in day 33 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.710
 valencia 2 elche 1
