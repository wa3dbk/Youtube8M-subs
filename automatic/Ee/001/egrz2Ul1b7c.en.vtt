00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
the document away otherwise you can redo

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.719 
the document away otherwise you can redo
it<00:01:40.479> so<00:01:40.719> two<00:01:40.990> great<00:01:41.500> features<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.310> third<00:01:42.520> thing

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
it so two great features the third thing

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.870 
it so two great features the third thing
is<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.539> will<00:01:43.810> run<00:01:44.109> off<00:01:44.320> of<00:01:44.380> 12<00:01:45.369> volts<00:01:45.640> so<00:01:45.729> where

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
is it will run off of 12 volts so where

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.819 
is it will run off of 12 volts so where
there<00:01:46.119> is<00:01:46.210> an<00:01:46.270> adapter<00:01:46.719> there's<00:01:47.289> an<00:01:47.380> accessory

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
there is an adapter there's an accessory

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.410 
there is an adapter there's an accessory
where<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.100> can<00:01:48.250> actually<00:01:48.369> plug<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.000> have

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
where you can actually plug it and have
