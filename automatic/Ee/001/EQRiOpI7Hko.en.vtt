00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
until I get to that three I'm I'm always

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.630 
until I get to that three I'm I'm always
just<00:02:20.290> hitting<00:02:20.560> as<00:02:20.650> much<00:02:20.920> tongue<00:02:21.190> blocking<00:02:21.340> as

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
just hitting as much tongue blocking as

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.400 
just hitting as much tongue blocking as
I<00:02:21.700> can<00:02:21.940> in<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> middle<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.630> heart<00:02:22.840> why

I can in the middle of the heart why

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.470 
I can in the middle of the heart why
because<00:02:24.130> that's<00:02:24.310> where<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.700> can<00:02:24.850> get<00:02:24.970> really

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
because that's where it can get really

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.280 
because that's where it can get really

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
the transition point between midriff

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:30.710 
the transition point between midriff
often<00:03:18.130> ongoing<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.790> when<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:24.970> hear<00:03:25.180> me<00:03:25.330> oh

right there when I get the pork I'm into
a<00:03:39.980> tongue<00:03:40.980> box<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.340> how<00:03:41.520> do<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.730> get<00:03:41.970> into<00:03:42.120> that

and make it smooth
well<00:03:45.500> practice<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.680> point<00:03:46.950> when<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.790> switch

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
well practice the point when the switch

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.640 
well practice the point when the switch
is<00:03:48.350> three<00:03:49.350> draw<00:03:49.560> half<00:03:49.770> step<00:03:50.040> Bend<00:03:50.190> let's<00:03:50.490> say

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
is three draw half step Bend let's say

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.010 
is three draw half step Bend let's say

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
puckering and tongue block to get good

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.020 
puckering and tongue block to get good
tone<00:04:22.140> but<00:04:22.440> for<00:04:22.770> tongue<00:04:22.950> blocking<00:04:23.130> it's<00:04:23.460> really

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
tone but for tongue blocking it's really

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:32.150 
tone but for tongue blocking it's really
far<00:04:24.240> in<00:04:24.420> there<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:24.780> just<00:04:24.810> practice<00:04:25.170> that<00:04:31.160> then

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
far in there so just practice that then

come down maybe from four drop down to

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.270 
come down maybe from four drop down to
three<00:04:37.790> here's<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:38.940> four<00:04:39.120> draw<00:04:39.980> twelve<00:04:40.980> punker

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
three here's the four draw twelve punker

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.159 
three here's the four draw twelve punker
three<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:41.669> that<00:04:41.850> little<00:04:42.180> practice<00:04:42.660> point<00:04:42.930> is

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
three and that little practice point is

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.950 
three and that little practice point is
wonderful<00:04:43.919> because<00:04:44.390> I'm<00:04:45.390> constantly

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
wonderful because I'm constantly

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.210 
wonderful because I'm constantly
switching<00:04:46.380> back<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:46.710> forth<00:04:46.919> without

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
switching back and forth without

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.670 
switching back and forth without
thinking<00:04:47.760> about<00:04:47.850> it<00:04:48.060> now<00:04:48.210> it's<00:04:48.450> just<00:04:48.690> in<00:04:49.470> my

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
thinking about it now it's just in my

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.930 
thinking about it now it's just in my
brain<00:04:49.950> it's<00:04:50.490> hardwired<00:04:51.060> but<00:04:52.100> I<00:04:53.100> just<00:04:53.730> want<00:04:53.910> to

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
brain it's hardwired but I just want to

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.040 
brain it's hardwired but I just want to
happen<00:04:54.060> naturally<00:04:54.330> but<00:04:54.600> I<00:04:54.660> think<00:04:54.870> for<00:04:54.990> those

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
happen naturally but I think for those

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.900 
happen naturally but I think for those
getting<00:04:55.350> into<00:04:55.710> that's<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.250> recommendation

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
getting into that's the recommendation

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.940 
getting into that's the recommendation
in<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:57.720> I<00:04:57.960> would<00:04:58.140> just<00:04:58.380> leave<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.800> with

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
in the and I would just leave you with

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.140 
in the and I would just leave you with
that<00:04:59.070> thought<00:04:59.130> it's<00:04:59.520> just

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.090 

or<00:05:03.150> octaves<00:05:03.810> just<00:05:04.080> don't<00:05:04.320> forget<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.800> practice

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
or octaves just don't forget to practice

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.629 
or octaves just don't forget to practice
those<00:05:05.550> little<00:05:05.759> points<00:05:06.330> of<00:05:06.710> transition<00:05:07.710> three

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
those little points of transition three

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.260 
those little points of transition three
drop<00:05:09.000> step<00:05:09.210> into<00:05:09.570> one<00:05:09.750> for<00:05:10.020> draw<00:05:10.229> maybe<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:12.180> an

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
drop step into one for draw maybe to an

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.040 
drop step into one for draw maybe to an
octave<00:05:16.400> so<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.699> before<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.630> know<00:05:18.750> it<00:05:18.930> it'll

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
octave so and before you know it it'll

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.900 
octave so and before you know it it'll
be<00:05:19.139> seamless<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:19.860> you'll<00:05:20.250> be<00:05:20.370> able<00:05:20.460> to<00:05:20.610> really

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
be seamless and you'll be able to really

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:34.460 
be seamless and you'll be able to really
switch<00:05:21.150> back<00:05:21.419> and<00:05:21.449> forth<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:33.539> key<00:05:33.720> is<00:05:33.930> not

switch back and forth the key is not

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.439 
switch back and forth the key is not
puckering<00:05:35.130> I<00:05:35.310> don't<00:05:35.520> sacrifice<00:05:35.760> tone<00:05:36.300> I<00:05:36.330> want

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
puckering I don't sacrifice tone I want

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:37.909 
puckering I don't sacrifice tone I want
to<00:05:36.660> make<00:05:36.780> sure<00:05:36.810> I<00:05:36.960> can<00:05:37.080> still<00:05:37.350> get<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.650> biggest

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
to make sure I can still get the biggest

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:44.120 
to make sure I can still get the biggest
tone<00:05:38.280> possible<00:05:38.880> in<00:05:38.970> those<00:05:39.090> draw<00:05:39.389> notes<00:05:43.130> so

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
tone possible in those draw notes so

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.240 
tone possible in those draw notes so
still<00:05:44.550> practice<00:05:45.090> good<00:05:45.510> tone<00:05:45.949> even<00:05:46.949> when

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
still practice good tone even when

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.279 
still practice good tone even when
you're<00:05:47.370> popping<00:05:47.580> don't<00:05:48.030> let<00:05:48.270> that<00:05:48.479> tone<00:05:48.870> it

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
you're popping don't let that tone it

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.400 
you're popping don't let that tone it
can<00:05:49.530> never<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:50.220> can<00:05:50.370> never<00:05:50.520> sacrifice<00:05:51.120> that

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
can never you can never sacrifice that

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.909 
can never you can never sacrifice that
