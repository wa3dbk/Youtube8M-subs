friend we have in Jesus things we can do
to<00:00:13.370> that<00:00:13.520> little<00:00:13.760> him

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:14.300 
to that little him

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.019 
to that little him
that'll<00:00:15.170> make<00:00:15.290> it<00:00:15.350> sound<00:00:15.680> better<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.820> far

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
that'll make it sound better so far

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.760 
that'll make it sound better so far
we've<00:00:17.240> been<00:00:17.270> focused<00:00:17.750> on<00:00:17.840> harmony<00:00:18.350> we're

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
we've been focused on harmony we're

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.200 
we've been focused on harmony we're
gonna<00:00:18.859> stay<00:00:19.100> focused<00:00:19.130> on<00:00:19.609> harmony<00:00:19.970> for<00:00:20.179> a

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
gonna stay focused on harmony for a

gonna stay focused on harmony for a
while<00:00:20.390> in<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:21.199> first<00:00:21.439> segment<00:00:21.679> we<00:00:21.919> talked

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
while in the first segment we talked

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.579 
while in the first segment we talked
about<00:00:22.490> changing<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.210> 4<00:00:23.449> chord<00:00:23.810> into<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.259> little

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:24.589 
about changing the 4 chord into a little

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.649 
about changing the 4 chord into a little
progression<00:00:25.329> 2<00:00:26.329> or<00:00:26.480> 4<00:00:26.689> 5<00:00:27.199> 4<00:00:27.499> &amp;<00:00:27.890> 4<00:00:28.659> basically

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:29.659 
progression 2 or 4 5 4 &amp; 4 basically

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.720 
progression 2 or 4 5 4 &amp; 4 basically
turning<00:00:30.079> it<00:00:30.230> inserting<00:00:30.829> two<00:00:31.009> chords<00:00:31.400> in<00:00:31.519> front

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
turning it inserting two chords in front

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.150 
turning it inserting two chords in front
of<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:31.849> 4<00:00:32.060> chord<00:00:32.620> listen<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:33.860> if<00:00:33.980> you

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
of the 4 chord listen to it if you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.880 
of the 4 chord listen to it if you
haven't<00:00:34.400> already<00:00:34.760> in<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:36.079> second<00:00:36.440> segment<00:00:36.620> we

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
haven't already in the second segment we

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.160 
haven't already in the second segment we
talked<00:00:37.160> about<00:00:37.430> changing<00:00:38.030> 5<00:00:38.300> 1<00:00:38.570> progressions

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
talked about changing 5 1 progressions

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.340 
talked about changing 5 1 progressions
into<00:00:39.500> 2<00:00:39.770> 5<00:00:40.100> 1<00:00:40.640> progressions<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.449> both<00:00:42.320> of

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
into 2 5 1 progressions and both of

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.009 
into 2 5 1 progressions and both of
those<00:00:42.559> are<00:00:42.620> really<00:00:43.039> really<00:00:43.190> important<00:00:44.000> but<00:00:44.870> in

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
those are really really important but in

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.660 
those are really really important but in
this<00:00:45.170> segment<00:00:45.410> I<00:00:45.680> want<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.890> go<00:00:46.070> beyond<00:00:46.460> that

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
this segment I want to go beyond that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.689 
this segment I want to go beyond that
and<00:00:46.730> talk<00:00:47.059> about<00:00:47.090> color<00:00:47.719> notes<00:00:47.989> now<00:00:48.949> if<00:00:49.460> you

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
and talk about color notes now if you

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.790 
and talk about color notes now if you
like<00:00:49.940> my<00:00:50.149> music<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.750> I'm<00:00:50.899> not<00:00:51.079> saying<00:00:51.320> you<00:00:51.500> do

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
like my music and I'm not saying you do

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.619 
like my music and I'm not saying you do
or<00:00:52.129> should<00:00:52.370> like<00:00:52.579> my<00:00:52.730> music<00:00:53.030> but<00:00:53.149> if<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:53.359> like

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
or should like my music but if you like

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.360 
or should like my music but if you like
it<00:00:53.929> one<00:00:54.199> of<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:54.350> things<00:00:54.589> you<00:00:54.800> probably<00:00:55.070> like

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
it one of the things you probably like

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.669 
it one of the things you probably like
about<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:55.789> is<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.179> complexity<00:00:56.929> and<00:00:56.960> texture

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
about it is the complexity and texture

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.630 
about it is the complexity and texture
of<00:00:57.829> some<00:00:58.489> of<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.640> sounds<00:00:59.410> and<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.859> way<00:01:01.160> I<00:01:01.190> get

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
of some of the sounds and the way I get

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.420 
of some of the sounds and the way I get
that<00:01:01.820> complexity<00:01:02.510> in<00:01:02.870> texture<00:01:03.829> is<00:01:03.949> by<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.160> use

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
that complexity in texture is by the use

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.940 
that complexity in texture is by the use
of<00:01:04.460> color<00:01:04.910> notes<00:01:05.150> now<00:01:05.780> color<00:01:06.170> notes<00:01:06.470> are<00:01:06.740> notes

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
of color notes now color notes are notes

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.520 
of color notes now color notes are notes
that<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:07.369> add<00:01:07.579> to<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.970> chord<00:01:08.360> in<00:01:08.689> addition<00:01:09.350> to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
that you add to a chord in addition to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.440 
that you add to a chord in addition to
the<00:01:09.680> normal<00:01:09.920> notes<00:01:10.310> now<00:01:10.549> most<00:01:10.759> of<00:01:10.880> us<00:01:11.030> think<00:01:11.240> in

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
the normal notes now most of us think in

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.810 
the normal notes now most of us think in
terms<00:01:11.659> of<00:01:11.810> either<00:01:11.930> triads<00:01:12.560> which<00:01:13.430> are<00:01:13.579> three

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
terms of either triads which are three

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.230 
terms of either triads which are three
note<00:01:14.000> chords<00:01:14.329> like<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:14.780> or<00:01:15.579> perhaps<00:01:16.579> for

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
note chords like this or perhaps for

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.380 
note chords like this or perhaps for
note<00:01:17.450> chords<00:01:17.840> like<00:01:18.470> this<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.369> that<00:01:20.180> is<00:01:20.360> a

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
note chords like this and that is a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.840 
note chords like this and that is a
chord<00:01:20.930> that<00:01:20.990> has<00:01:21.320> not<00:01:21.920> only<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.189> triad<00:01:22.520> but<00:01:22.759> it

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
chord that has not only a triad but it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.840 
chord that has not only a triad but it
has<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:22.970> 7th<00:01:23.479> added<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.140> if<00:01:24.820> you're<00:01:25.820> not

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
has a 7th added to it if you're not

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.090 
has a 7th added to it if you're not
playing<00:01:26.270> sevens<00:01:26.869> that's<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.320> good<00:01:27.500> first<00:01:27.770> step

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
playing sevens that's a good first step

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.850 
playing sevens that's a good first step
for<00:01:28.399> example<00:01:28.549> if<00:01:29.119> I<00:01:29.299> play<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.630> C<00:01:30.020> minor<00:01:30.259> chord

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
for example if I play a C minor chord

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.109 
for example if I play a C minor chord
I<00:01:31.149> want<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.240> 7th<00:01:32.659> minute<00:01:32.840> okay<00:01:33.799> I'm<00:01:34.100> playing<00:01:34.759> C

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
I want the 7th minute okay I'm playing C

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.350 
I want the 7th minute okay I'm playing C
and<00:01:35.479> B<00:01:36.020> flat<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:36.530> left<00:01:36.710> hand<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.280> E<00:01:38.060> flat

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
and B flat in the left hand and E flat

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.300 
and B flat in the left hand and E flat
and<00:01:38.540> G<00:01:38.719> that's<00:01:38.899> a<00:01:39.049> C<00:01:39.290> minor<00:01:39.530> chord<00:01:39.619> but<00:01:40.130> it's

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
and G that's a C minor chord but it's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.219 
and G that's a C minor chord but it's
really<00:01:40.549> a<00:01:40.579> C<00:01:40.850> minor<00:01:41.060> 7<00:01:41.299> it<00:01:41.689> sounds<00:01:42.049> way<00:01:42.200> better

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
really a C minor 7 it sounds way better

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
really a C minor 7 it sounds way better
than<00:01:42.680> this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.249 

much<00:01:46.600> more<00:01:46.869> complex<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.920> better<00:01:48.880> sound<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:50.200> you

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
much more complex a better sound so you

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.609 
much more complex a better sound so you
want<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.619> start<00:01:50.829> using<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.189> seventh<00:01:51.549> but

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
want to start using the seventh but

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.440 
want to start using the seventh but
really<00:01:53.619> this<00:01:54.220> could<00:01:54.549> this<00:01:54.700> little<00:01:54.939> clip<00:01:55.299> I

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
really this could this little clip I

note<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.540> right<00:03:54.750> here<00:03:55.079> I'm<00:03:55.230> throwing<00:03:55.439> in<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.769> G

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
note just right here I'm throwing in a G

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.420 
note just right here I'm throwing in a G
now<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:58.290> can<00:03:58.469> be<00:03:58.590> intimidating<00:03:58.920> at<00:03:59.400> first

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
now this can be intimidating at first

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.089 
now this can be intimidating at first
but<00:03:59.909> what<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.239> G<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.689> and<00:04:00.959> AF<00:04:01.260> chord<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.950> the

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
but what the G is and AF chord is the

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.490 
but what the G is and AF chord is the
ninth<00:04:02.340> we<00:04:02.670> call<00:04:02.849> it<00:04:02.939> the<00:04:03.030> ninth<00:04:03.239> or<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.049> second

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
ninth we call it the ninth or the second

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.539 
ninth we call it the ninth or the second
depending<00:04:04.859> on<00:04:06.950> whether<00:04:07.950> there's<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.189> seventh
