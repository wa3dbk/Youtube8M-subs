longer<00:06:37.060> than<00:06:37.770> you<00:06:38.770> would<00:06:38.919> be<00:06:39.040> if<00:06:39.070> you<00:06:39.220> had

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
longer than you would be if you had

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.820 
longer than you would be if you had
android<00:06:40.240> which<00:06:40.419> gives<00:06:40.600> you<00:06:40.660> more<00:06:40.810> options<00:06:40.840> but

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
android which gives you more options but

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.540

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
that being said I see myself and the

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.040 
that being said I see myself and the
future<00:06:45.850> switching<00:06:46.180> between<00:06:46.270> iphone<00:06:46.870> and

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
future switching between iphone and

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.420 
future switching between iphone and
android<00:06:47.199> and<00:06:47.560> not<00:06:47.650> staying<00:06:47.919> with<00:06:48.070> each<00:06:48.190> one

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
android and not staying with each one

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.000 
android and not staying with each one
