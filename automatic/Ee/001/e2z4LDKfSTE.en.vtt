00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hi my name is bad fame and go - a 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.759
 new video here on the rival channel and 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.890
 tic go I hope you like it and good 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.870
 we go there we will have a junior to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.490
 dink ya totti and playing a three for 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.769
 three on the shopping map as they are 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.240
 seeing generally the tactic that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.130
 used in these three for three is 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.470
 juniors opens up as they are watching now 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.699
 same totti gets in the middle and they say 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.980
 that tries to control a little the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.630
 part of platform and they appear in 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.640
 this first round they chose to send 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.289
 a pineapple person who gets pretty 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.760
 well because they manage to kill dean but 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.219
 It's generally a bit dangerous since 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.630
 is leaving a single person already two already 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.059
 only people here who are playing 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.440
 against three and obviously the team that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.420
 has sent three people to the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.040
 Well, it's going to be a lot of play 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.989
 much more aggressive knowing that there 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.309
 two people nothing more but will have 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.809
 to be careful of the grenades by 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.149
 that to see how the next rounds go 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.950
 We saw a little while ago that totti managed 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.350
 kill a person with the bigger so 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.910
 which put things 2 versus 2 and here 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.860
 let's see what junior manages to save 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.989
 by the hairs of that incendiary that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.879
 threw totti managed to kill one so 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.129
 well it 's pretty good if he died 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.309
 juniors in that case they were going to put the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.240
 things 1 versus 1 and generally the ones 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.610
 verses 1 end 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.320
 dead center most times the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.060
 Most good rounds to finish the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.799
 first round we will see junior there 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.720
 a brilliant tactic made between 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.280
 two that totti stays there with the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.659
 wool be I think he's got him 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.399
 little touches with the nasa 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.960
 and junior with the spear so good 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.240
 first round the rival wins and they had 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 that strategy if they did not do very well 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.560
 apart from having killed dink with the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.240
 granada here we will see that it turns to 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.679
 open the junior I do not know if maybe 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 they sent someone to the part of the 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.670
 grenade since they sent them one 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.830
 before it does not look very good no no they are not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.880
 there fighting are worth platform so in 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.890
 this round are going to be things a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.200
 little more even we are going to see there 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.240
 someone who rises to the finger and almost kills 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.220
 juniors also kills almost kills 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.590
 siquier also which could have 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 done finishing the round in a second but 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.940
 good are things that happen here we see 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.159
 Junior in a two against one surely 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.470
 will try to do the best you can 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.600
 in these situations it is very difficult 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.140
 because since if the other team does 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.080
 all right 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.939
 no matter how much you do it, the best 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.549
 can you be the best player in the world 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.190
 if the two people do it well you do not go 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.870
 to be able to kill them both 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.850
 the round but since nobody is perfect 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.950
 obviously you can be wrong so 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.660
 Junior can take advantage of that and here 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.250
 we see that they separate there is a moment that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.190
 they separate and juniors take advantage of it 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.540
 maximum killing the hummer and we see that 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.980
 quickly the other player comes to 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.260
 throw some shots at junior and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.060
 unfortunately it could not be stuck to and in 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.000
 the latest coverage which made the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.650
 player jump and allowed him to reuters 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.960
 put the last shot to 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.150
 knock it down a very good very good 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.310
 try part of junior so good 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.400
 we return to another round going 1-1 for now 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.230
 the same tactics see there totti 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.450
 getting in the middle is a strategy 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.040
 very very good since the smoke that pulls 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.630
 when it goes in the middle it leaves all 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.300
 that are in the other area where it is 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.860
 Juniors stunned and unable to do anything 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.450
 there we are seeing that he was 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.430
 forming a great battle of myers 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.260
 They manage to kill Denia Totti but totti 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.060
 manages to kill one and they are watching as 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.530
 takes advantage of juniors that he managed to bring down 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.200
 to one with the haul to get in 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.270
 head go and kill them both a 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.580
 tremendous play taking advantage of that 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.980
 knocked down one many times it depends on 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.810
 decisions of thousandths of a second win 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.340
 a round or not because many times 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.060
 you also have to leave 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.489
 running 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.470
 two times you have to get into 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.270
 head like he did junior and managed to win the 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.940
 round from this moment is gaining 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.790
 rival and titos to one let's go see 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.170
 the same junior tactics opens up and 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.360
 has also said that holding a little 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.519
 behind him it is very important not to die 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.870
 in these three for three much more 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.090
 important that in the four against 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.220
 four because with two people against 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.959
 three you can not control anything on the map 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.340
 you can not control anything basically 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.410
 what you have to do is go running 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.750
 by all parties another round that is going to 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.549
 please the rival and you 90% of this 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.380
 round is due to the first ink he threw 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.390
 of how he managed to kill a person and now 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.190
 after you manage to kill one the 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.650
 others left running as I told them and 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.600
 good the junior lancer took advantage 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.640
 very much also all dry ticket for 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.500
 the other side did not lock themselves in here 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.269
 we are seeing the next round we see 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.560
 that killed the dim but totti managed 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.720
 killing someone is very important 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.519
 also if you see that they kill in a 3 to 3 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.500
 kill someone on your team go try 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.480
 kill one even if that's the way 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.040
 three together to meet with your partner 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.470
 team here I think they were pretty 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.389
 reds the crazy ones why they decided to leave 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.130
 of this battle and give him 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.540
 practically to junior the incendiary and 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.040
 to totti the excavator 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.770
 that then they will pay more very very 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.660
 expensive they should have gone as totti 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.400
 and junior were quite separated that 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.960
 they were one in each corner I think that 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.090
 the best thing would have been to try to go for 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.980
 one of the two but well this I say 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.840
 me here quietly watching gameplays 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.820
 but obviously when he is playing 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.530
 many things go through the heads of the 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.700
 players that's why generally 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.290
 quieter places are those that 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.270
 often make better decisions there is 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.010
 very close to having killed him juniors 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.410
 with the incendiary here they will see how 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.550
 they locked themselves alone in there and 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.500
 here to totti you will not be able to 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.540
 approach because it has fish and to junior 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.980
 neither because it has incendiary 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.260
 therefore basically have in this 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.000
 missed round unless some 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.250
 Game error how can it happen 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.920
 quietly the good thing is that normal 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.110
 there are good Totti already killed 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.270
 one with the excavator that was given to him 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.060
 that was a mistake they made and now 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.920
 practically manages to bring down everything and 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.530
 last and kill him jove wednesday 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.760
 incendiary and testify looking at the good 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.410
 that was pretty much everything I hope that 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.360
 you liked it and do not forget to leave your 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.540
 like that if I do not get sad up 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.540
 then
