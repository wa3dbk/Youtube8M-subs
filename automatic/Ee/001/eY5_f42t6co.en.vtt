The mango is a drupe, meaning the flesh adheres to a wide flat pit. The peel is considered inedible because it contains irritants. Begin by peeling the mango, starting at the stem end. 
A good mango should be relatively firm but should have some give when you touch it. If overripe, the flesh becomes stringy.  

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Peel in a spiral on one side. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then repeat on the other side. The peel is fairly stiff. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The mango has a rounded end and an elongated end. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Hold the mango rounded side up. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:48.933
Make a cut in the center until your knife touches the pit. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Move the knife 5 mm (1/4”) right or left. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Cut down; you will feel the pit. Press the blade against the pit and cut down alongside it. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You can see the pit is practically clean. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Repeat on the other side: press the knife 5 mm from the center; cut down then move along the pit with the blade. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You can see that the pit is quite large. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:19.000
There’s a little flesh sticking to the pit which you can just slice off.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.066
Thus you have removed all the flesh from the mango with almost no waste. Let’s move on to the next step.
