said I did buy it youth but yeah I did

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.870 
said I did buy it youth but yeah I did
open<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:43.500> up<00:02:43.680> actually<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.340> see<00:02:44.520> if<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.760> was

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
open this up actually to see if it was

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.780 
open this up actually to see if it was
messed<00:02:45.150> up<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:46.110> they<00:02:46.950> said<00:02:47.190> if<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:47.550> like

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
messed up like they said if it's like

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.700 
messed up like they said if it's like
nice<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.060> neat<00:02:48.480> then<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.900> means<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.350> is<00:02:49.380> an

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
nice and neat then that means it is an

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.130 
nice and neat then that means it is an
Epiphone<00:02:50.310> or<00:02:50.460> Gibson<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.120> if<00:02:51.270> it's<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.720> all

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
Epiphone or Gibson but if it's like all

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.330 
Epiphone or Gibson but if it's like all
wires<00:02:52.800> all<00:02:53.130> over<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:54.080> um<00:02:55.080> then<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.100> means

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
wires all over that um then that means

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.500 
wires all over that um then that means
it's<00:02:56.700> fake<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.870> um<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.740> did<00:02:59.550> open<00:02:59.820> it<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.360> it

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
it's fake but um I did open it up and it

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.990 
it's fake but um I did open it up and it
looks<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:00.780> someone<00:03:01.350> replaced<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
looks like someone replaced the the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.280 
looks like someone replaced the the
pickups<00:03:03.420> because<00:03:04.410> there<00:03:04.740> was<00:03:04.950> um<00:03:05.780> like<00:03:06.780> oops

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
pickups because there was um like oops

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.720 
pickups because there was um like oops
there<00:03:07.980> was<00:03:08.160> um<00:03:09.590> like<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.620> little<00:03:10.950> tie<00:03:11.250> thing

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
there was um like a little tie thing

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.690 
there was um like a little tie thing
just<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.450> tie<00:03:12.630> some<00:03:12.960> like<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:14.130> cords<00:03:14.550> all

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
just to tie some like the cords all

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.760 
just to tie some like the cords all
together<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.330> stuff<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.230> reason<00:03:16.740> to

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
together and stuff so I have reason to

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.690 
together and stuff so I have reason to
think<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.400> person<00:03:17.550> did<00:03:17.880> change<00:03:18.150> them

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
think that the person did change them

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.240 
think that the person did change them
the<00:03:20.700> pickups<00:03:21.330> on<00:03:21.780> these<00:03:22.230> things<00:03:22.970> okay<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:25.250> um

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250

be and how high this one should be even

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.340 
be and how high this one should be even
though<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.160> F<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.840> isn't<00:03:58.230> right

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
though this is like F this isn't right

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.040 
though this is like F this isn't right
now<00:03:58.530> but<00:03:58.800> if<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.160> was<00:03:59.340> like<00:03:59.580> the<00:04:00.239> 5<00:04:00.450> cents

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
now but if it was like the 5 cents

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.690 
now but if it was like the 5 cents
I<00:04:01.080> understand<00:04:01.770> this<00:04:01.920> whole<00:04:02.130> part<00:04:02.370> but<00:04:02.520> like

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
I understand this whole part but like

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.400 
I understand this whole part but like
should<00:04:03.209> this<00:04:03.300> be<00:04:03.510> elevated<00:04:04.050> because<00:04:04.170> there's

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
should this be elevated because there's

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.340 
should this be elevated because there's
so<00:04:04.560> much<00:04:04.739> like<00:04:05.030> it's<00:04:06.030> tugging<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.020> much<00:04:07.170> of

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
so much like it's tugging on so much of

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.810 
so much like it's tugging on so much of
the<00:04:07.470> strings<00:04:07.830> should<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:08.220> be<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:08.459> little<00:04:08.730> bit

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
the strings should this be a little bit

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.380 
the strings should this be a little bit
higher<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.480> really<00:04:10.290> don't<00:04:10.500> know<00:04:10.680> but<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:11.700> am<00:04:12.060> I

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
higher I really don't know but I am I

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.949 
higher I really don't know but I am I
know<00:04:12.510> I'm<00:04:12.840> probably<00:04:13.140> going<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.590> be<00:04:13.709> replacing

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
know I'm probably going to be replacing

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.140 
know I'm probably going to be replacing
this<00:04:15.959> this<00:04:16.620> little<00:04:16.890> thing<00:04:17.010> right<00:04:17.310> here<00:04:17.489> like

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
this this little thing right here like

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.360
