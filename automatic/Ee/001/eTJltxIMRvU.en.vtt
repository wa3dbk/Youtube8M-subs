anaerobic<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.490> entire<00:01:35.759> bucket<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.990> water<00:01:37.409> for

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
anaerobic the entire bucket in water for

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.819 
anaerobic the entire bucket in water for
you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> couple<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.880> weeks<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.900> then<00:01:40.710> we

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
you know a couple of weeks and then we

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.389 
you know a couple of weeks and then we
transfer<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.729> liquid<00:01:42.649> into<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.100> know

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
transfer that liquid into here you know

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.399 
transfer that liquid into here you know
we<00:01:44.579> could<00:01:44.700> top<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.060> off<00:01:45.299> take<00:01:45.720> some<00:01:45.930> out<00:01:46.079> top

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
we could top this off take some out top

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
we could top this off take some out top
them<00:01:46.619> off<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.420> that's<00:01:48.420> basically<00:01:48.750> what<00:01:48.960> we're

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
them off and that's basically what we're

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.609 
them off and that's basically what we're
doing<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.290> we've<00:01:49.380> got<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> liquid<00:01:50.090> fertilizer

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
doing so we've got a liquid fertilizer

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.660 
doing so we've got a liquid fertilizer
making<00:01:52.619> contraption<00:01:53.460> using<00:01:53.909> food<00:01:54.390> waste<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
making contraption using food waste and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.859 
making contraption using food waste and
this<00:01:56.670> thing<00:01:56.850> has<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> number<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> other<00:01:57.390> uses

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
this thing has a number of other uses

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170 
this thing has a number of other uses
that<00:01:58.049> will<00:01:58.320> will<00:01:58.860> will<00:01:59.159> share<00:01:59.430> with<00:01:59.520> you
