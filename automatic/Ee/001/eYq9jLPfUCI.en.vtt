00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
terms of this unit um I think what I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.130 
terms of this unit um I think what I
what<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> did<00:01:26.100> was<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.700> tamed<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.930> little

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
what I did was I tamed it just a little

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
what I did was I tamed it just a little
bit<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.890> would<00:01:29.070> form<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.700> little<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.329> my

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
bit so it would form a little more to my

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.960 
bit so it would form a little more to my
face<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:32.009> wear<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.579> really

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.289 
face but you can wear it really really
big<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.450> puff<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> wear<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> big<00:01:35.299> you

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
big to puff this out and wear a big you

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.910 
big to puff this out and wear a big you
can<00:01:36.479> also<00:01:37.759> look<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.060> layer<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.860> think

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
going to make a decision because I wore

a couple of days and you know when I
first<00:01:48.689> pulled<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.170> off<00:01:49.320> said<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
first pulled it off said there there is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.999 
first pulled it off said there there is
something<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.479> not<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:52.320> know<00:01:52.439> making<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
something that is not you know making it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.569 
something that is not you know making it
pop<00:01:53.430> specifically<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:55.140> me<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.250> was<00:01:56.369> trying

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
pop specifically for me and I was trying

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.030 
pop specifically for me and I was trying
to<00:01:56.640> figure<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.270> was<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.530> believe

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
to figure out what that was I believe

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.469 
to figure out what that was I believe
that<00:01:59.219> wearing<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.549> closest<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.119> my<00:02:00.270> face

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
that wearing the closest to my face

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.170 
that wearing the closest to my face
really<00:02:00.810> does<00:02:01.170> help<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.880> that

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
really does help but I think that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.980 
really does help but I think that
layering<00:02:03.750> layering<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:05.369> wig<00:02:05.610> out<00:02:05.990> in

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
layering layering this wig out in

this<00:04:12.269> mess<00:04:12.630> with<00:04:12.780> this<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.930> little<00:04:13.140> bit<00:04:13.320> more

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
this mess with this a little bit more

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.630 
this mess with this a little bit more
yes<00:04:14.280> bring<00:04:14.640> out<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.940> parting<00:04:15.329> space<00:04:15.450> here

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
yes bring out the parting space here

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.370 
yes bring out the parting space here
part<00:04:17.640> it<00:04:17.789> straight<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.900> know<00:04:19.109> would<00:04:19.350> be

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
part it straight so you know would be

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.270 
part it straight so you know would be
parted<00:04:19.890> well<00:04:20.130> but<00:04:20.519> JLS<00:04:21.419> 15<00:04:21.930> really<00:04:22.740> does<00:04:22.919> come

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
parted well but JLS 15 really does come

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.790 
parted well but JLS 15 really does come
through<00:04:23.490> um<00:04:24.470> let's<00:04:25.470> see

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
through um let's see

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.670 
through um let's see
so<00:04:26.250> many<00:04:26.490> people<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.659> thought<00:04:28.199> that<00:04:28.409> it<00:04:28.530> was

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
so many people and I thought that it was

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.559 
so many people and I thought that it was
pretty<00:04:28.949> on<00:04:29.220> so<00:04:29.460> many<00:04:29.610> people<00:04:30.060> but<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.240> will<00:04:30.449> be

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
pretty on so many people but I will be

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:31.730 
pretty on so many people but I will be
honest<00:04:30.810> with<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.080> put<00:04:31.379> it<00:04:31.470> on<00:04:31.590> myself

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
honest with you I put it on myself

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.550 
honest with you I put it on myself
initially<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.849> I<00:04:33.539> was<00:04:33.810> skeptical<00:04:34.169> because<00:04:34.409> I

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
initially and I was skeptical because I

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.770 
initially and I was skeptical because I
didn't<00:04:35.009> understand<00:04:35.759> because<00:04:36.120> I've<00:04:36.240> had<00:04:36.479> wigs

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
didn't understand because I've had wigs

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.020 
didn't understand because I've had wigs
that<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.830> know<00:04:37.979> was<00:04:38.159> this<00:04:38.280> type<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.580> length<00:04:38.849> in

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
that you know was this type of length in

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.240 
that you know was this type of length in
this<00:04:39.180> color<00:04:39.479> pattern<00:04:39.900> before<00:04:40.319> and<00:04:40.710> it

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
this color pattern before and it

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.249 
this color pattern before and it
absolutely<00:04:41.490> worked<00:04:42.030> for<00:04:42.240> me<00:04:42.360> so<00:04:42.690> when<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.020> put

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
absolutely worked for me so when I put

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.550 
absolutely worked for me so when I put
it<00:04:43.349> on<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.500> was<00:04:43.740> just<00:04:43.770> like<00:04:44.039> there's<00:04:44.220> something

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
it on I was just like there's something

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.749 
it on I was just like there's something
wrong<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.979> I<00:04:47.069> couldn't<00:04:47.310> figure<00:04:47.430> out<00:04:47.550> what<00:04:47.729> it

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
wrong and I couldn't figure out what it

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.089 
wrong and I couldn't figure out what it
was<00:04:47.940> but<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.629> think<00:04:48.930> it's<00:04:49.349> just<00:04:49.409> the<00:04:49.860> face

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
was but I think it's just the face

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.950 
was but I think it's just the face
framing<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.849> you<00:04:51.240> know<00:04:51.330> where<00:04:51.539> I<00:04:51.569> decide<00:04:51.930> to

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
framing and you know where I decide to

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.930 
framing and you know where I decide to
where<00:04:52.319> I<00:04:52.560> was<00:04:52.830> trying<00:04:53.069> to<00:04:53.190> figure<00:04:53.400> out<00:04:53.610> what

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
where I was trying to figure out what

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.399 
where I was trying to figure out what
this<00:04:54.330> curl<00:04:54.840> reminds<00:04:55.680> me<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:56.069> this<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:57.229> but<00:04:58.229> this

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
this curl reminds me of this is but this

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.770 
this curl reminds me of this is but this
reminds<00:04:58.889> me<00:04:59.069> of<00:04:59.159> Janet<00:04:59.580> Jackson's<00:05:00.030> hair<00:05:00.419> and

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
reminds me of Janet Jackson's hair and

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.760 
reminds me of Janet Jackson's hair and
why<00:05:01.469> did<00:05:01.650> I<00:05:01.740> get<00:05:01.800> married<00:05:02.509> to<00:05:03.509> this<00:05:04.379> would<00:05:04.620> be

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
why did I get married to this would be

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.149 
why did I get married to this would be
like<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.460> synthetic<00:05:06.800> spin-off<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.009> if<00:05:08.099> you

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
like the synthetic spin-off so if you

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:09.860 
like the synthetic spin-off so if you
ever<00:05:08.280> wanted<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.639> do<00:05:08.789> a<00:05:08.819> spin-off<00:05:09.210> hairstyle

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
ever wanted to do a spin-off hairstyle

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.659 
ever wanted to do a spin-off hairstyle
and<00:05:10.139> you<00:05:10.560> wanted<00:05:10.860> something<00:05:11.099> that<00:05:11.280> was<00:05:11.490> almost

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
and you wanted something that was almost

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.459 
and you wanted something that was almost
like<00:05:11.879> that<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.449> would<00:05:12.810> suggest<00:05:12.960> that<00:05:13.259> you<00:05:13.349> take

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
like that I would suggest that you take

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.680 
like that I would suggest that you take
GLS<00:05:14.129> 15<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.909> you<00:05:15.000> would<00:05:15.150> frame<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.509> the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
GLS 15 and you would frame it to the

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.480 
GLS 15 and you would frame it to the
face<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.169> give<00:05:16.289> it<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.590> know<00:05:16.710> eight<00:05:16.949> cut

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
face and give it you know eight cut

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.730 
face and give it you know eight cut
because<00:05:17.909> it<00:05:18.150> wasn't<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.599> same<00:05:18.810> look<00:05:19.020> all<00:05:19.500> the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
because it wasn't the same look all the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.230 
because it wasn't the same look all the
way<00:05:19.830> around<00:05:20.099> especially<00:05:20.879> what<00:05:21.000> she<00:05:21.120> was

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
way around especially what she was

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.219 
way around especially what she was
spazzing<00:05:21.629> out<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.840> she<00:05:21.930> was<00:05:22.050> breaking

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
spazzing out and she was breaking

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.649 
spazzing out and she was breaking
everything<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:23.159> you<00:05:23.190> know<00:05:23.699> you<00:05:24.060> really

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
everything it you know you really

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:25.700 
everything it you know you really
thought<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:24.960> should<00:05:25.139> sweat<00:05:25.349> and<00:05:25.530> it's<00:05:25.620> all

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
thought I should sweat and it's all

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.040 
thought I should sweat and it's all
stuck<00:05:25.979> to<00:05:26.129> her<00:05:26.219> face<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.639> stuff<00:05:26.849> yeah<00:05:29.690> here<00:05:30.690> so

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
stuck to her face and stuff yeah here so

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.240 
stuck to her face and stuff yeah here so
you<00:05:31.110> know<00:05:31.319> if<00:05:31.409> I<00:05:31.500> was<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.740> compare<00:05:32.069> this<00:05:32.190> to

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
you know if I was to compare this to

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.459 
you know if I was to compare this to
anything<00:05:32.669> this<00:05:33.449> would<00:05:33.659> be<00:05:33.779> like<00:05:33.960> the

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
anything this would be like the

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.339 
anything this would be like the
synthetic<00:05:35.130> version<00:05:35.159> of<00:05:35.840> Janet<00:05:36.840> Jackson's

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
synthetic version of Janet Jackson's

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.370 
synthetic version of Janet Jackson's
character<00:05:37.889> and<00:05:38.159> why<00:05:38.880> did<00:05:39.029> I<00:05:39.150> get<00:05:39.210> married<00:05:39.419> to

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
character and why did I get married to

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.059 
character and why did I get married to
so<00:05:41.539> so<00:05:42.539> what<00:05:42.900> I<00:05:42.930> think<00:05:43.020> I'm<00:05:43.319> going<00:05:43.469> to<00:05:43.529> do<00:05:43.800> is

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
so so what I think I'm going to do is

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.790 
so so what I think I'm going to do is
even<00:05:44.729> more<00:05:45.210> so<00:05:45.479> than<00:05:45.719> what<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:45.870> have<00:05:46.199> done<00:05:46.440> is

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
even more so than what I have done is

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.580 
even more so than what I have done is
really<00:05:47.729> take<00:05:47.940> the<00:05:48.090> nearly<00:05:48.300> natural<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.139> um

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
really take the nearly natural and um

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.149 
really take the nearly natural and um
set<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:50.639> whole<00:05:50.849> top<00:05:51.120> so<00:05:51.840> I'm<00:05:52.590> gonna<00:05:52.710> set<00:05:53.009> the

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
set the whole top so I'm gonna set the

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:54.860 
set the whole top so I'm gonna set the
whole<00:05:53.310> top<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:53.849> then<00:05:53.969> I'm<00:05:54.150> gonna<00:05:54.270> pull<00:05:54.629> this

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
whole top and then I'm gonna pull this

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.040 
whole top and then I'm gonna pull this
down<00:05:55.740> to<00:05:56.009> the<00:05:56.159> side<00:05:56.370> and<00:05:56.729> it<00:05:57.180> will<00:05:57.539> end<00:05:57.840> up

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
down to the side and it will end up

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.399 
down to the side and it will end up
being<00:05:59.060> perfection<00:06:00.060> for<00:06:00.240> me<00:06:00.419> but<00:06:00.930> this<00:06:01.050> is<00:06:01.229> a

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
being perfection for me but this is a
