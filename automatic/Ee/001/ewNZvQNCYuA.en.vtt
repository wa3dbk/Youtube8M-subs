didn't<00:01:13.610> happen<00:01:13.909> which<00:01:14.270> was<00:01:14.420> definitely<00:01:14.870> a

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
didn't happen which was definitely a

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.080 
didn't happen which was definitely a
bummer<00:01:15.020> I<00:01:15.350> end<00:01:16.040> up<00:01:16.130> just<00:01:16.310> getting<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.610> knife<00:01:16.759> and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
bummer I end up just getting a knife and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.080 
bummer I end up just getting a knife and
not<00:01:17.630> getting<00:01:18.560> any<00:01:18.680> further<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.759> then<00:01:19.939> it<00:01:20.060> was

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
not getting any further so then it was

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.240 
not getting any further so then it was
down<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.840> watching<00:01:21.229> hub<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:21.710> see<00:01:21.890> if<00:01:21.979> he<00:01:22.100> could

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
down to watching hub to see if he could

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.149 
down to watching hub to see if he could
improve<00:01:22.520> on<00:01:22.670> his<00:01:22.880> night<00:01:23.530> which<00:01:24.530> he<00:01:24.710> in<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.040> end

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159

he<00:01:25.310> didn't<00:01:25.909> end<00:01:26.030> up<00:01:26.119> doing<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:27.079> was<00:01:27.170> probably

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
he didn't end up doing that was probably

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.380 
he didn't end up doing that was probably
the<00:01:27.439> major<00:01:27.740> result<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.820> I<00:01:28.909> was<00:01:29.000> looking<00:01:29.210> at
