00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
and many people believe that that also

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.070 
and many people believe that that also
has<00:00:02.760> either<00:00:02.970> been<00:00:03.090> tampered<00:00:03.570> with<00:00:03.570> or<00:00:03.929> was

Capricorn<00:00:07.170> One<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.859> fit<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.189> film<00:00:08.450> was<00:00:09.450> made

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
Capricorn One the fit the film was made

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.509 
Capricorn One the fit the film was made
about<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.170> theory<00:00:10.620> right<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.250> they<00:00:11.370> was

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
about that theory right that they was

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.360 
about that theory right that they was
shot<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.360> stage<00:00:12.679> and<00:00:13.679> some<00:00:14.190> people

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
shot in a stage and some people

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.430 
shot in a stage and some people
allegedly<00:00:15.030> Kubrick<00:00:15.450> himself<00:00:15.780> was<00:00:16.020> involved

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
allegedly Kubrick himself was involved

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.340 
allegedly Kubrick himself was involved
in<00:00:16.560> shooting<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.400> moon<00:00:18.060> landing<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:19.020> i

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
in shooting that moon landing and i

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.750 
in shooting that moon landing and i
think<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.800> there's<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.070> lot<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.189> credibility

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
think that there's a lot of credibility

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.910 
think that there's a lot of credibility
to<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.510> theory<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.109> they<00:00:22.289> did<00:00:22.470> not<00:00:22.500> root

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
to that theory that they did not root

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.769 
to that theory that they did not root
that<00:00:23.039> they<00:00:23.189> did<00:00:23.340> not<00:00:23.460> shoot<00:00:24.119> show<00:00:24.510> us<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
that they did not shoot show us the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.120 
that they did not shoot show us the
actual<00:00:25.140> moon<00:00:25.289> landing<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:25.980> not

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
actual moon landing and that was not

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.339 
actual moon landing and that was not
actually<00:00:26.490> shot<00:00:26.699> they're<00:00:27.000> not<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.660> say<00:00:27.840> not<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
actually shot they're not to say not to

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.720 
actually shot they're not to say not to
discount<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:28.980> ever<00:00:29.130> went<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> moon

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
discount that we ever went to the moon

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.299 
discount that we ever went to the moon
but<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> idea<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.109> what<00:00:31.710> they<00:00:31.830> showed<00:00:32.099> us

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
but to the idea that what they showed us

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.520 
but to the idea that what they showed us
was<00:00:32.579> not<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.910> actual<00:00:33.210> moon<00:00:33.450> what's<00:00:34.050> your<00:00:34.290> take

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
was not the actual moon what's your take

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.400 
was not the actual moon what's your take
on<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:35.430> take<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.760> i<00:00:36.300> saw<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.140> moon

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
on this my take is i saw the moon

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
on this my take is i saw the moon
landing<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.670> they<00:00:38.790> show<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.480> is

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
landing and what they show you now is

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.819 
landing and what they show you now is
what<00:00:40.050> we're<00:00:40.770> seeing<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.129> TV<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:42.320> what<00:00:43.320> went

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
what we're seeing on TV is not what went

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.310 
what we're seeing on TV is not what went
down<00:00:44.300> this<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> weirdest<00:00:46.079> thing<00:00:46.289> about

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
down this is the weirdest thing about

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.090 
down this is the weirdest thing about
the<00:00:46.680> moon<00:00:46.860> landing<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.590> vivid<00:00:49.829> in

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the moon landing and it is so vivid in

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.200 
the moon landing and it is so vivid in
my<00:00:50.129> mind<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.449> thought<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.559> NASA<00:00:53.059> did<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
my mind that I thought that NASA did it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.720 
my mind that I thought that NASA did it
intentionally<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.020> goof<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.710> when<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
intentionally are they goof but when you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
intentionally are they goof but when you
see<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> moon<00:00:57.210> landing<00:00:57.660> now<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
see the moon landing now you see the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.270 
see the moon landing now you see the
lunar<00:00:59.879> lander<00:01:00.480> upright<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.620> vertical<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
lunar lander upright and vertical and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.039 
lunar lander upright and vertical and
horizontal<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.000> way<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.329> perceive<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
horizontal to the way we perceive it and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.710 
horizontal to the way we perceive it and
the<00:01:04.860> man<00:01:05.430> comes<00:01:05.670> down<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> ladder<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.479> this

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the man comes down the ladder like this

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.010 
the man comes down the ladder like this
well<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.310> night<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.270> whole<00:01:09.299> world<00:01:09.510> was

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
watching that frame was upside down and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.550 
watching that frame was upside down and
the<00:01:14.040> astronaut<00:01:14.700> went<00:01:14.970> from<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.840> lower<00:01:16.140> left

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the astronaut went from the lower left

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.789

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
man one giant leap for mankind the image

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.130 
man one giant leap for mankind the image
on<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> TV<00:01:25.560> went<00:01:26.100> bull<00:01:26.520> he<00:01:27.030> was<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
on the TV went bull he was going that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.800 
on the TV went bull he was going that
way<00:01:28.340> that's<00:01:29.340> been<00:01:29.700> reversed<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.299> flipped<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
way that's been reversed it flipped it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.280 
way that's been reversed it flipped it
and<00:01:30.840> that's<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:31.259> they<00:01:31.470> show<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:33.290> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and that's what they show you so the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.580 
and that's what they show you so the
alteration<00:01:35.009> starts<00:01:35.909> right<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:37.350> when<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
alteration starts right there but when I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.490 
alteration starts right there but when I
said<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.130> earlier<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.600> studied<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
said to you earlier I have studied the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.679 
said to you earlier I have studied the
Apollo<00:01:40.950> photographs<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.090> years<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.630> years

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
Apollo photographs for years and years

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.350 
Apollo photographs for years and years
and<00:01:43.020> years<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.560> yes<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.340> are<00:01:44.369> altered<00:01:45.090> but

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and years and yes they are altered but

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.120 
and years and yes they are altered but
they're<00:01:45.540> not<00:01:45.659> altered<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.619> didn't<00:01:46.890> go

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
they're not altered because we didn't go

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.160 
they're not altered because we didn't go
there<00:01:47.820> altered<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:48.869> want<00:01:49.079> us

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
there altered because they don't want us

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.380 
there altered because they don't want us
to<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:50.009> there<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.460> we're

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
to see what was really there and we're

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.940 
to see what was really there and we're
going<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.750> some<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.020> those<00:01:52.229> really<00:01:52.649> there

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
going to see some of those really there

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.319 
going to see some of those really there
and<00:01:53.130> you're<00:01:53.340> seeing<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:53.850> you're<00:01:53.970> showing

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and you're seeing it if you're showing

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.929 
and you're seeing it if you're showing
the<00:01:55.280> Big<00:01:56.280> Ben<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> moon<00:01:57.049> um<00:01:58.640> you're<00:01:59.640> seeing

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the Big Ben on the moon um you're seeing

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.929 
the Big Ben on the moon um you're seeing
what's<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.240> there<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.759> now

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
what's really there so what is that now

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.560 
what's really there so what is that now
Big<00:02:03.509> Ben<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.840> moon<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.670> just<00:02:05.670> call<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
Big Ben on the moon I just call it in a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.540 
Big Ben on the moon I just call it in a
tower<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.829> say<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:08.129> artificial

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
tower and I would say it's artificial

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.770 
tower and I would say it's artificial
because<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> symmetry<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.530> structure

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
because of the symmetry in the structure

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.800 
because of the symmetry in the structure
and<00:02:14.189> it's<00:02:15.189> far<00:02:15.640> taller<00:02:16.150> than<00:02:16.510> what<00:02:16.659> you've

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
and it's far taller than what you've

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.440 
and it's far taller than what you've
seen<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.549> look<00:02:18.730> closely<00:02:19.000> at<00:02:19.269> that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
seen if you look closely at that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.289 
seen if you look closely at that
photograph<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.250> structure<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.120> not

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
photograph it that structure is not

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.869 
photograph it that structure is not
sitting<00:02:22.689> on<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.370> horizontal<00:02:24.370> line<00:02:24.579> on<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
sitting on the horizontal line on the

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.059 
sitting on the horizontal line on the
horizon<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.510> if<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.349> look<00:02:26.379> closely<00:02:26.769> it's

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
horizon and if you look closely it's

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.420 
horizon and if you look closely it's
actually<00:02:27.400> pitched<00:02:27.670> back<00:02:28.319> someone<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.500> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
actually pitched back someone and the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.660 
actually pitched back someone and the
pitch<00:02:30.670> back<00:02:31.620> indicates<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.280> much

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
pitch back indicates that it's much

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.319 
pitch back indicates that it's much
farther<00:02:34.030> back<00:02:34.480> behind<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.560> horizon<00:02:36.329> then

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
farther back behind the horizon then

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.349 
farther back behind the horizon then
then<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.500> would<00:02:38.709> think<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:40.000> reason

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
then it you would think and the reason

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.800 
then it you would think and the reason
is<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:41.500> them<00:02:41.859> the<00:02:42.040> moon<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.489> much<00:02:42.810> smaller

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
is that on them the moon is much smaller

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.229 
is that on them the moon is much smaller
it's<00:02:44.409> in<00:02:44.590> diameter<00:02:45.310> than<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.700> earth<00:02:45.970> it's

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
it's in diameter than the earth it's

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.960 
it's in diameter than the earth it's
actually<00:02:46.769> twenty-seven<00:02:47.769> percent<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.849> earth

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
actually twenty-seven percent the earth

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.330 
actually twenty-seven percent the earth
and<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.530> thing<00:02:50.530> that's<00:02:50.560> vertical<00:02:51.220> here<00:02:51.579> is

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
and the thing that's vertical here is

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.280 
and the thing that's vertical here is
vertical<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.849> here<00:02:55.239> but<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.870> thing<00:02:56.109> that's

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
vertical to you here but a thing that's

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.470 
vertical to you here but a thing that's
vertical<00:02:56.769> over<00:02:57.040> here<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.879> moon<00:02:58.030> still

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
vertical over here to the moon still

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.170 
vertical over here to the moon still
vertical<00:02:58.689> it's<00:02:59.620> seen<00:03:00.370> as<00:03:00.400> slant<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.120> the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
vertical it's seen as slant and the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.319 
vertical it's seen as slant and the
astronauts<00:03:01.810> describe<00:03:02.019> how<00:03:02.769> strange<00:03:03.430> strange

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
astronauts describe how strange strange

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.539 
astronauts describe how strange strange
strange<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.870> was<00:03:05.069> perception<00:03:06.069> on<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.340> moon

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
strange it was perception on the moon

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.410 
strange it was perception on the moon
and<00:03:06.819> a<00:03:07.239> human<00:03:07.629> expectations<00:03:08.819> because<00:03:09.819> they

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
and a human expectations because they

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.500 
and a human expectations because they
found<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.989> they<00:03:11.230> would<00:03:11.409> see<00:03:11.560> an<00:03:11.680> object<00:03:12.359> at<00:03:13.359> a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
found that they would see an object at a

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.059 
found that they would see an object at a
distance<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.200> they<00:03:14.319> thought<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.650> was<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.769> very

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
distance and they thought it was a very

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.490 
distance and they thought it was a very
small<00:03:15.159> object<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:16.120> then<00:03:16.480> they<00:03:16.599> start<00:03:16.900> walking

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
small object and then they start walking

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.369 
small object and then they start walking
toward<00:03:17.949> it<00:03:18.099> and<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.579> object<00:03:19.150> would<00:03:19.389> start<00:03:19.810> to

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
toward it and the object would start to

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.490 
toward it and the object would start to
rise<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.400> rise<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:21.609> rise<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.359> loom<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.349> it

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
rise and rise and rise and loom and it

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.879 
rise and rise and rise and loom and it
was<00:03:23.879> gigantic<00:03:24.879> and<00:03:25.329> they<00:03:25.810> realized<00:03:26.500> that

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
was gigantic and they realized that

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.000 
was gigantic and they realized that
because<00:03:27.549> of<00:03:27.699> the<00:03:27.730> curvature<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.389> moon

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
because of the curvature of the moon

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.640 
because of the curvature of the moon
mountains<00:03:30.010> fall<00:03:30.370> away<00:03:31.209> faster<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.169> they

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
mountains fall away faster and they

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.319 
mountains fall away faster and they
don't<00:03:32.799> look<00:03:33.040> as<00:03:33.250> steep<00:03:33.519> even<00:03:33.879> though<00:03:34.000> they<00:03:34.180> are

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
don't look as steep even though they are

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.990 
don't look as steep even though they are
it's<00:03:35.169> it's<00:03:35.470> really<00:03:35.709> amazing<00:03:36.040> it's<00:03:36.370> wonderful

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
it's it's really amazing it's wonderful

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.649 
it's it's really amazing it's wonderful
if<00:03:37.120> you're<00:03:37.540> into<00:03:37.810> geometry<00:03:38.879> and<00:03:39.879> studying

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
if you're into geometry and studying

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.110 
if you're into geometry and studying
these<00:03:40.840> things<00:03:41.549> everything<00:03:42.549> about<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.940> moon

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
these things everything about the moon

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.479 
these things everything about the moon
is<00:03:43.329> different<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.349> thing<00:03:44.560> about<00:03:44.590> towers<00:03:45.280> we

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
is different the thing about towers we

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.430 
is different the thing about towers we
hear<00:03:45.699> things<00:03:46.000> about<00:03:46.120> towers<00:03:46.750> multi<00:03:47.199> miles

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
hear things about towers multi miles

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.559 
hear things about towers multi miles
high<00:03:47.799> on<00:03:48.159> the<00:03:48.729> moon<00:03:48.879> and<00:03:49.120> we<00:03:49.239> think<00:03:49.389> that's

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
high on the moon and we think that's

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.809 
high on the moon and we think that's
ludicrous<00:03:50.169> but<00:03:50.349> and<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:50.949> did<00:03:51.099> I<00:03:51.190> actually<00:03:51.430> when

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
ludicrous but and so did I actually when

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.680 
ludicrous but and so did I actually when
I<00:03:51.849> first<00:03:52.180> heard<00:03:52.419> these<00:03:52.859> stories<00:03:53.859> in<00:03:54.489> early<00:03:55.209> 90s

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
I first heard these stories in early 90s

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.110 
I first heard these stories in early 90s
and<00:03:56.049> when<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.500> first<00:03:57.069> heard<00:03:57.280> about<00:03:57.430> Richard

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
and when I first heard about Richard

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.119 
and when I first heard about Richard
Hoagland<00:03:58.299> theories<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.229> other<00:03:59.680> people<00:04:00.040> who

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
Hoagland theories and other people who

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.979 
Hoagland theories and other people who
work<00:04:00.340> in<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:01.060> that's<00:04:01.209> really<00:04:01.599> far-fetched

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
work in and that's really far-fetched

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.949 
work in and that's really far-fetched
and<00:04:02.699> over<00:04:03.699> the<00:04:03.819> years<00:04:03.849> I<00:04:04.239> started<00:04:04.449> to<00:04:04.690> see<00:04:04.840> the

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
and over the years I started to see the

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.399 
and over the years I started to see the
pictures<00:04:05.319> right<00:04:05.650> The<00:04:06.069> Shard<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:07.060> castle<00:04:07.659> so

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
pictures right The Shard the castle so

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.920 
pictures right The Shard the castle so
on<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:08.919> then<00:04:09.579> I<00:04:09.609> started<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.239> let<00:04:10.599> my

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
on and then I started to let my

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.069 
on and then I started to let my
skepticism<00:04:11.620> blow<00:04:11.949> away<00:04:12.069> election<00:04:13.060> now<00:04:13.419> listen

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
skepticism blow away election now listen

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.390 
skepticism blow away election now listen
think<00:04:14.530> about<00:04:14.620> this<00:04:15.099> really<00:04:15.940> consciously<00:04:17.400> why

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
think about this really consciously why

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.599 
think about this really consciously why
couldn't<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.209> happen<00:04:19.500> well<00:04:20.500> that's<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.519> good

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
couldn't it happen well that's a good

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.870 
couldn't it happen well that's a good
question<00:04:22.169> but<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.289> better<00:04:23.500> answer<00:04:23.889> is<00:04:24.039> why

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
question but the better answer is why

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.100 
question but the better answer is why
could<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.389> happen

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
could it happen

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.459 
could it happen
why<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:26.620> could<00:04:26.919> happen<00:04:27.129> is<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:28.419> moon<00:04:28.629> has<00:04:28.870> 16

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:29.469 
why it could happen is the moon has 16

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.159 
why it could happen is the moon has 16
the<00:04:29.860> gravity<00:04:30.430> so<00:04:30.759> they<00:04:31.030> are<00:04:31.090> alone<00:04:31.360> if<00:04:31.900> we<00:04:32.050> were

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
the gravity so they are alone if we were

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.809 
the gravity so they are alone if we were
on<00:04:32.289> the<00:04:32.409> moon<00:04:32.590> we<00:04:32.830> could<00:04:33.009> build<00:04:33.159> something<00:04:33.460> six

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
on the moon we could build something six

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:35.010 
on the moon we could build something six
times<00:04:34.060> higher<00:04:34.270> than<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.659> Empire<00:04:34.689> State

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
times higher than the Empire State

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.499 
times higher than the Empire State
Building<00:04:35.650> or<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.830> World<00:04:36.009> Trade<00:04:36.219> Centers<00:04:36.580> just

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
Building or the World Trade Centers just

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.129 
Building or the World Trade Centers just
based<00:04:37.750> on<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.159> secondly<00:04:39.159> glass<00:04:39.909> towers<00:04:40.569> well

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
based on that secondly glass towers well

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.170 
based on that secondly glass towers well
class<00:04:41.949> is<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:43.389> most<00:04:43.800> prolific<00:04:44.800> element<00:04:45.580> glass

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
class is the most prolific element glass

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.860 
class is the most prolific element glass
like<00:04:46.629> rocks<00:04:47.080> it's<00:04:48.069> the<00:04:48.159> best<00:04:48.419> building<00:04:49.419> block

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
like rocks it's the best building block

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.279 
like rocks it's the best building block
and<00:04:50.110> you<00:04:50.139> know<00:04:50.319> glass<00:04:51.069> is<00:04:51.400> very<00:04:51.639> strong<00:04:52.289> now

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
and you know glass is very strong now

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.890 
and you know glass is very strong now
building<00:04:53.949> glass<00:04:54.099> buildings<00:04:54.580> on<00:04:54.729> earth<00:04:54.909> out<00:04:55.330> of

building glass buildings on earth out of

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.869 
building glass buildings on earth out of
the<00:04:55.960> question<00:04:56.139> they'd<00:04:57.069> be<00:04:57.219> broken<00:04:57.699> off<00:04:57.849> and

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:57.879 
the question they'd be broken off and

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.379 
the question they'd be broken off and
blown<00:04:58.479> away<00:04:58.719> in<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.900> hurricane<00:04:59.080> ah<00:05:00.389> building

glass<00:05:01.870> towers<00:05:02.469> on<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.740> moon<00:05:03.099> which<00:05:03.939> has

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
glass towers on the moon which has

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.170 
glass towers on the moon which has
little<00:05:05.229> whether<00:05:05.469> i<00:05:05.710> think<00:05:06.009> the<00:05:06.219> they<00:05:06.849> say<00:05:07.029> the

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
little whether i think the they say the

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.689 
little whether i think the they say the
atmosphere<00:05:07.629> is<00:05:07.750> about<00:05:07.960> this<00:05:08.199> this<00:05:08.560> much<00:05:08.860> above

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
atmosphere is about this this much above

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.580 
atmosphere is about this this much above
the<00:05:09.819> ground<00:05:10.000> well<00:05:10.870> i<00:05:10.900> think<00:05:11.139> there's<00:05:11.469> much

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
the ground well i think there's much

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.499 
the ground well i think there's much
more<00:05:11.800> atmosphere<00:05:12.340> i<00:05:12.370> found<00:05:12.729> photographs<00:05:13.000> to

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
more atmosphere i found photographs to

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:19.129 
more atmosphere i found photographs to
show<00:05:13.779> that<00:05:14.439> the<00:05:14.830> moon<00:05:15.310> is<00:05:15.639> a<00:05:15.699> volcanic<00:05:16.500> fuming

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
show that the moon is a volcanic fuming

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.459 
show that the moon is a volcanic fuming
gas<00:05:20.139> if<00:05:20.590> using<00:05:21.219> body<00:05:21.699> and<00:05:22.029> the<00:05:22.779> Chinese<00:05:23.199> have

gas if using body and the Chinese have

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:26.159 
gas if using body and the Chinese have

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
discovered a remarkable area on the far

your oshima on the moon because it looks

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.969 
your oshima on the moon because it looks
to<00:05:31.659> me<00:05:31.690> like<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.529> city<00:05:32.919> that<00:05:33.219> was<00:05:33.339> wiped<00:05:33.610> out<00:05:33.819> by
