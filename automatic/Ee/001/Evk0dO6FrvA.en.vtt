been a bit a little bit of a tour to get
to<00:00:23.090> this<00:00:23.270> step<00:00:23.600> I<00:00:24.020> want<00:00:24.500> to<00:00:24.650> take<00:00:24.740> a<00:00:24.830> long<00:00:25.010> time

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
to this step I want to take a long time

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.970 
to this step I want to take a long time
to<00:00:25.400> fill<00:00:25.580> it<00:00:25.670> up<00:00:25.790> got<00:00:26.750> a<00:00:26.780> quite<00:00:27.200> a<00:00:27.230> capacity<00:00:27.830> in

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
to fill it up got a quite a capacity in

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.200 
to fill it up got a quite a capacity in
the<00:00:28.100> lower<00:00:28.250> section<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:30.340> the<00:00:31.340> end<00:00:31.580> close<00:00:32.029> to

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
the lower section and the end close to

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.930 
the lower section and the end close to
the<00:00:32.329> grass<00:00:32.570> right<00:00:32.989> there<00:00:33.050> as<00:00:33.649> much<00:00:34.100> I<00:00:34.640> would

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
the grass right there as much I would

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.250 
the grass right there as much I would
say<00:00:34.969> much<00:00:35.300> deeper<00:00:35.660> but<00:00:35.750> it's<00:00:35.899> deeper<00:00:36.230> than

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
say much deeper but it's deeper than

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.959 
say much deeper but it's deeper than
they'll<00:00:36.500> end<00:00:36.739> up<00:00:36.890> there<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:37.489> all<00:00:37.610> filled<00:00:37.850> up

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
they'll end up there so it all filled up

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.489 
they'll end up there so it all filled up
from<00:00:38.090> down<00:00:38.329> here<00:00:38.510> up<00:00:39.190> but<00:00:41.230> it's<00:00:42.230> holding

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:42.499 
from down here up but it's holding

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.930 
from down here up but it's holding
together<00:00:42.620> quite<00:00:43.039> quite<00:00:43.820> nicely<00:00:44.230> I've<00:00:45.280> got<00:00:46.280> the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
together quite quite nicely I've got the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.450 
together quite quite nicely I've got the
plastic<00:00:47.480> laid<00:00:47.659> down<00:00:47.870> at<00:00:48.289> six<00:00:48.530> mil<00:00:48.710> plastic<00:00:48.920> I

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
plastic laid down at six mil plastic I

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.299 
plastic laid down at six mil plastic I
cut<00:00:50.149> a<00:00:50.179> piece<00:00:50.300> it's<00:00:51.199> a<00:00:51.379> it's<00:00:51.679> a<00:00:51.769> ten<00:00:51.980> foot<00:00:52.159> by

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
cut a piece it's a it's a ten foot by

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.599 
cut a piece it's a it's a ten foot by
twenty<00:00:52.489> five<00:00:52.760> foot<00:00:53.170> so<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.199> cut<00:00:54.859> a<00:00:54.890> piece<00:00:54.980> six

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
twenty five foot so I cut a piece six

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.649 
twenty five foot so I cut a piece six
feet<00:00:55.909> and<00:00:56.800> so<00:00:57.800> it's<00:00:57.949> six<00:00:58.159> by<00:00:58.339> ten<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.390> it'll

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
feet and so it's six by ten so it'll

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.799 
feet and so it's six by ten so it'll
stick<00:00:59.870> out<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.260> edge<00:01:00.760> a<00:01:01.760> few<00:01:02.300> inches<00:01:02.449> above

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
stick out the edge a few inches above

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.820 
stick out the edge a few inches above
the<00:01:02.929> two<00:01:03.079> by<00:01:03.229> four<00:01:03.499> on<00:01:04.129> each<00:01:04.190> side<00:01:04.400> I<00:01:05.470> also<00:01:06.470> put

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
the two by four on each side I also put

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.160 
the two by four on each side I also put
bricks<00:01:07.130> in<00:01:07.370> there<00:01:07.580> that<00:01:07.790> way<00:01:07.909> once<00:01:08.240> we<00:01:08.360> lay<00:01:08.690> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
bricks in there that way once we lay the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.010 
bricks in there that way once we lay the
plywood<00:01:09.740> on<00:01:09.770> top<00:01:10.119> those<00:01:11.119> bricks<00:01:11.509> will<00:01:11.750> hold

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
plywood on top those bricks will hold

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.209 
plywood on top those bricks will hold
the<00:01:12.170> center<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.680> keep<00:01:12.799> it<00:01:12.979> from<00:01:13.159> caving<00:01:13.700> in

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
the center and keep it from caving in

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.350 
the center and keep it from caving in
not<00:01:16.219> all<00:01:16.460> of<00:01:16.579> them<00:01:16.700> will<00:01:16.790> probably<00:01:16.880> stand<00:01:17.240> up

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
not all of them will probably stand up

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.550 
not all of them will probably stand up
some<00:01:17.540> of<00:01:17.600> them<00:01:17.719> will<00:01:17.810> probably<00:01:17.840> slip<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:18.469> can

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
some of them will probably slip you can

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.580 
some of them will probably slip you can
see<00:01:18.680> it's<00:01:19.070> not<00:01:19.219> a<00:01:19.250> level<00:01:19.840> truly<00:01:20.840> level<00:01:21.170> surface

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
see it's not a level truly level surface

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.469 
see it's not a level truly level surface
and<00:01:22.520> it's<00:01:22.670> got<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:22.789> little<00:01:22.909> bumps<00:01:23.240> because<00:01:23.420> of

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
and it's got a little bumps because of

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.010 
and it's got a little bumps because of
the<00:01:23.539> woodchips<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:25.420> one<00:01:26.420> or<00:01:26.539> two<00:01:26.630> may<00:01:26.750> fall

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
the woodchips so one or two may fall

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.980 
the woodchips so one or two may fall
down<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:27.530> most<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:27.890> them<00:01:28.039> are<00:01:28.430> good<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.119> set

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
down but most of them are good and set

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.200 
down but most of them are good and set
firm<00:01:30.350> because<00:01:31.219> I<00:01:31.340> put<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.610> brick<00:01:31.789> down<00:01:31.969> there

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
firm because I put the brick down there

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.240 
firm because I put the brick down there
I<00:01:32.450> didn't<00:01:33.409> have<00:01:33.530> all<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.770> bricks<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.009> I<00:01:34.130> had

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
I didn't have all the bricks that I had

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.130 
I didn't have all the bricks that I had
counted<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:34.850> I<00:01:34.880> used<00:01:35.359> I<00:01:35.659> got<00:01:35.810> some<00:01:35.930> extra

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
counted so I used I got some extra

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.179 
counted so I used I got some extra
landscaping<00:01:36.920> stones<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:38.200> put<00:01:39.200> one<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.070> those

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
landscaping stones and put one of those

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.590 
landscaping stones and put one of those
in<00:01:40.399> there<00:01:40.579> at<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.850> lower<00:01:41.000> end<00:01:41.299> because<00:01:41.509> I

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
in there at the lower end because I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.719 
in there at the lower end because I
actually<00:01:41.719> needed<00:01:42.229> more<00:01:42.500> needed<00:01:43.460> something

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
actually needed more needed something

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.639 
actually needed more needed something
larger<00:01:44.210> there<00:01:44.359> anyways<00:01:44.869> because<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.409> bricks

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
larger there anyways because the bricks

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.950 
larger there anyways because the bricks
wouldn't<00:01:46.070> have<00:01:46.159> come<00:01:46.609> all<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.820> way<00:01:46.850> up<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.299> I

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
wouldn't have come all the way up so I

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.069 
wouldn't have come all the way up so I
got<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.469> landscaping<00:01:48.890> stone<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.899> black

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
got the landscaping stone and the black

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.770 
got the landscaping stone and the black
plastic<00:01:51.320> in<00:01:51.909> you<00:01:52.909> can<00:01:53.060> see<00:01:53.240> all<00:01:53.450> I<00:01:53.479> had<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.689> do

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
plastic in you can see all I had to do

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.539 
plastic in you can see all I had to do
is<00:01:53.869> just<00:01:54.020> pretty<00:01:54.380> much<00:01:54.530> put<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.890> plastic<00:01:55.310> down

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
is just pretty much put the plastic down

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.660 
is just pretty much put the plastic down
and<00:01:55.939> start<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.539> hose<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.950> hose<00:01:57.979> worked<00:01:58.429> out

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
and start a hose and the hose worked out

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.209 
and start a hose and the hose worked out
all<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.090> air<00:01:59.210> and<00:01:59.240> formed<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.200> into<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.979> shape

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
all the air and formed it into the shape

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.649 
all the air and formed it into the shape
of<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.700> container<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:04.299> everything<00:02:05.299> kind<00:02:05.570> of

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
of the container so everything kind of

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.020 
of the container so everything kind of
made<00:02:06.409> itself<00:02:06.799> happen<00:02:07.189> it<00:02:07.310> didn't<00:02:07.549> take<00:02:07.789> much

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
made itself happen it didn't take much

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.210 
made itself happen it didn't take much
on<00:02:08.270> my<00:02:08.450> end<00:02:08.660> actually<00:02:09.050> get<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.380> formed<00:02:09.920> and

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
on my end actually get this formed and

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.650 
on my end actually get this formed and
then<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:10.940> was<00:02:11.060> just<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.210> matter<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.390> putting<00:02:11.570> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
then it was just a matter of putting the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.540 
then it was just a matter of putting the
bricks<00:02:11.900> in<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.140> putting<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.380> float<00:02:12.620> in<00:02:12.800> you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
bricks in and putting the float in you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.210 
bricks in and putting the float in you
see<00:02:13.730> I've<00:02:13.820> got<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.150> float<00:02:14.480> here

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
see I've got the float here

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.030 
see I've got the float here
it<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.090> hooked<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.660> cut<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:18.990> little<00:02:19.050> slit<00:02:19.530> into

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
it is hooked I cut a little slit into

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.520 
it is hooked I cut a little slit into
the<00:02:20.160> plastic<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.930> hook<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.380> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the plastic so we just hook to the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.120 
the plastic so we just hook to the
plastic<00:02:23.510> through<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.660> wood<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:25.620> got<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.770> pipe

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
plastic through the wood we got a pipe

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.680 
plastic through the wood we got a pipe
coming<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.100> see<00:02:29.370> all<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.580> way<00:02:29.690> it's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
coming in you can see all the way it's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.900 
coming in you can see all the way it's
not<00:02:30.750> bright<00:02:31.140> enough<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> pipe<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.730> to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
not bright enough but a pipe going to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.600 
not bright enough but a pipe going to
the<00:02:33.030> barbed<00:02:33.390> end<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:36.000> setup<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:37.610> that's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
the barbed end of the setup so that's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.670 
the barbed end of the setup so that's
going<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.120> my<00:02:39.390> hose<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.990> just<00:02:40.440> used<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.650> little

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
going to my hose I just used a little

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.900 
going to my hose I just used a little
Quick<00:02:40.980> Connect<00:02:41.570> on<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.690> hose<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:44.790> way<00:02:44.880> I

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
Quick Connect on the hose and that way I

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.640 
Quick Connect on the hose and that way I
could<00:02:45.120> turn<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.420> off<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.230> needed<00:02:46.500> to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
could turn it off and on as I needed to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.620 
could turn it off and on as I needed to
I've<00:02:47.460> discovered<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.910> need<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.300> pressure

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
I've discovered the need for a pressure

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.720 
I've discovered the need for a pressure
reducer<00:02:49.140> apparently<00:02:49.860> Maya<00:02:50.040> pressures<00:02:50.550> too

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
reducer apparently Maya pressures too

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.330 
reducer apparently Maya pressures too
high<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.530> what<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.560> do<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:52.860> fill<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.190> up

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
high and what I do is I fill this up

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.890 
high and what I do is I fill this up
with<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.730> garden<00:02:53.880> hose<00:02:54.150> at<00:02:54.300> first<00:02:54.540> and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
with just the garden hose at first and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.930 
with just the garden hose at first and
then<00:02:55.560> once<00:02:55.710> I<00:02:55.800> got<00:02:55.920> most<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.340> way<00:02:56.400> full<00:02:56.670> put

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
then once I got most of the way full put

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.570 
then once I got most of the way full put
the<00:02:57.030> float<00:02:57.270> in<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.190> could<00:02:59.370> kind<00:02:59.490> of

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
the float in so that I could kind of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.240 
the float in so that I could kind of
gauge<00:02:59.850> how<00:03:00.590> high<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.620> wanted<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:04.250> I'll

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
gauge how high I wanted it and I'll

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
gauge how high I wanted it and I'll
probably<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> little<00:03:05.670> bit<00:03:05.880> more<00:03:05.910> tweaking

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
probably do a little bit more tweaking

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.060 
probably do a little bit more tweaking
with<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.750> height<00:03:06.990> of<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.320> water<00:03:07.500> because<00:03:07.920> one

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
with the height of the water because one

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.780 
with the height of the water because one
of<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.250> things<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.850> didn't<00:03:09.810> foresee

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
of the things that I didn't foresee

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.530 
of the things that I didn't foresee
shouldn't<00:03:11.790> be<00:03:11.850> an<00:03:11.940> issue<00:03:12.030> but<00:03:12.270> I<00:03:12.360> didn't

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
shouldn't be an issue but I didn't

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.460 
shouldn't be an issue but I didn't
really<00:03:12.660> foresee<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:14.430> float<00:03:15.320> sticks<00:03:16.320> up

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
really foresee it is the float sticks up

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.600 
really foresee it is the float sticks up
out<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:16.770> water<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.040> little<00:03:17.250> bit<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.580> I

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
out of the water a little bit so I

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.900 
out of the water a little bit so I
couldn't<00:03:18.060> have<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.590> water<00:03:19.890> come<00:03:20.280> all<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.880> way

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
couldn't have the water come all the way

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.940 
couldn't have the water come all the way
up<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.570> plywood<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.320> don't<00:03:22.440> know<00:03:22.530> if<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.680> want

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
up to the plywood I don't know if I want

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.530 
up to the plywood I don't know if I want
that<00:03:23.010> anyways<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:24.120> i<00:03:24.180> couldnt<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.480> the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
that anyways but i couldnt have the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.610 
that anyways but i couldnt have the
water<00:03:24.690> come<00:03:24.870> all<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.110> way<00:03:25.140> up<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.410> plywood

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
water come all the way up to the plywood

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.370 
water come all the way up to the plywood
because<00:03:26.180> then<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.390> float<00:03:27.690> would<00:03:27.870> be<00:03:27.990> sticking

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
because then the float would be sticking

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.170 
because then the float would be sticking
out<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:29.100> plywood<00:03:29.520> would<00:03:29.610> be<00:03:29.670> resting<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
out the plywood would be resting on the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.070 
out the plywood would be resting on the
float<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.660> would<00:03:30.780> always<00:03:30.990> stay<00:03:31.380> open<00:03:31.709> so

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
float and it would always stay open so

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.760 
float and it would always stay open so
just<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.520> unforeseen<00:03:35.520> issue<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.390> but<00:03:36.810> if<00:03:37.500> i

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
just the unforeseen issue there but if i

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.220 
just the unforeseen issue there but if i
keep<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.310> water<00:03:39.240> level<00:03:39.470> lower<00:03:40.470> than<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:42.230> the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
keep the water level lower than the the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.350 
keep the water level lower than the the
plywood<00:03:43.680> by<00:03:43.860> maybe<00:03:44.100> on<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.550> quarter<00:03:44.910> inch<00:03:45.120> half

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
plywood by maybe on a quarter inch half

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.970 
plywood by maybe on a quarter inch half
inch<00:03:45.570> then<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.080> amount<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.410> float<00:03:46.590> sticks<00:03:46.860> up

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
inch then the amount of float sticks up

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.479 
inch then the amount of float sticks up
is<00:03:47.100> not<00:03:47.250> going<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.959> significant<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.489> that's

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
is not going to be significant so that's

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.140 
is not going to be significant so that's
the<00:03:52.010> water<00:03:53.010> reservoir<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.820> then<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.000> guys

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
the water reservoir and then the guys

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.930 
the water reservoir and then the guys
also<00:03:54.330> going<00:03:54.570> ahead<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.900> show<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.400> how<00:03:56.400> i<00:03:56.430> have

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
also going ahead and show you how i have

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.090 
also going ahead and show you how i have
the<00:03:57.239> holes<00:03:57.540> drilled<00:03:58.340> in<00:03:59.340> my<00:03:59.790> plywood

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
the holes drilled in my plywood

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.860 
the holes drilled in my plywood
basically<00:04:02.100> it's<00:04:02.310> like<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:03.209> five<00:04:03.480> the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
basically it's like a the five the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.920 
basically it's like a the five the
number<00:04:03.989> five<00:04:04.290> side<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.830> dice<00:04:05.270> if<00:04:06.270> you<00:04:06.540> if<00:04:06.810> you

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
number five side of a dice if you if you

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.120 
number five side of a dice if you if you
were<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.110> cut<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.380> board<00:04:07.590> right<00:04:07.830> down<00:04:08.010> the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
were to cut the board right down the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.370 
were to cut the board right down the
middle<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.430> do<00:04:09.120> two<00:04:09.360> number<00:04:09.660> Five's<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.260> then

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
middle you do two number Five's and then

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.830 
middle you do two number Five's and then
do<00:04:10.500> one<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.800> middle<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.300> that<00:04:12.300> puts<00:04:12.660> about

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
do one in the middle and that puts about

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.340 
do one in the middle and that puts about
i<00:04:13.670> think<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.790> foot<00:04:15.209> foot<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.750> half<00:04:16.970> square

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
i think a foot foot and a half square

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.539 
i think a foot foot and a half square
which<00:04:19.350> should<00:04:19.620> be<00:04:19.739> plenty<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.100> let<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.430> water

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
which should be plenty to let the water

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.839 
which should be plenty to let the water
wick<00:04:20.910> up<00:04:21.150> into<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.690> soil<00:04:22.370> so<00:04:23.370> it's

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
wick up into the soil so it's

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:30.450 
wick up into the soil so it's
pretty<00:04:25.849> well<00:04:25.939> setup<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:27.250> then<00:04:28.250> these<00:04:28.900> netcups

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
pretty well setup and then these netcups

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.379 
pretty well setup and then these netcups
will<00:04:31.659> focus<00:04:33.099> just<00:04:34.099> slide<00:04:34.490> on<00:04:34.520> in<00:04:34.879> there<00:04:35.120> they

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
will focus just slide on in there they

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.730 
will focus just slide on in there they
stick<00:04:35.659> up<00:04:35.810> out<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.050> little<00:04:36.289> bit<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:38.469> may<00:04:39.469> try

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
stick up out a little bit so I may try

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.920 
stick up out a little bit so I may try
and<00:04:39.770> bore<00:04:40.759> some<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.270> out<00:04:41.330> with<00:04:41.659> another

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
and bore some of that out with another

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.999 
and bore some of that out with another
drill<00:04:42.259> but<00:04:42.919> they<00:04:43.039> come<00:04:43.280> through<00:04:44.889> now<00:04:45.889> they're

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
drill but they come through now they're

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.469 
drill but they come through now they're
coming<00:04:46.129> about<00:04:46.490> come<00:04:46.729> out<00:04:46.849> about<00:04:46.939> an<00:04:47.150> inch<00:04:47.240> and

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
coming about come out about an inch and

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.350 
coming about come out about an inch and
a<00:04:47.509> half<00:04:47.539> out<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.740> as<00:04:48.860> long<00:04:49.039> as<00:04:49.069> that's

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
a half out and as long as that's

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.080 
a half out and as long as that's
touching<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.449> water<00:04:50.599> the<00:04:51.020> water<00:04:51.199> will<00:04:51.409> wick

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
touching the water the water will wick

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.959 
touching the water the water will wick
through<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.870> board<00:04:54.199> so<00:04:55.069> I<00:04:55.099> don't<00:04:55.460> know<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.550> may

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
through the board so I don't know I may

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:57.969 
through the board so I don't know I may
bring<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.330> hammer<00:04:56.509> out<00:04:56.629> a<00:04:57.259> rubber<00:04:57.500> mallet<00:04:57.949> and

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
bring a hammer out a rubber mallet and

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.700 
bring a hammer out a rubber mallet and
just<00:04:58.280> tap<00:04:58.759> them<00:04:58.940> in<00:04:59.210> you<00:05:00.199> know<00:05:00.259> try<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.560> get

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
just tap them in you know try and get

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.589 
just tap them in you know try and get
them<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:00.860> form<00:05:01.159> as<00:05:01.310> much<00:05:01.460> as<00:05:01.610> possible<00:05:02.979> but

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
them to form as much as possible but

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:10.089 
them to form as much as possible but
let's<00:05:05.599> look<00:05:05.840> at<00:05:05.990> pretty<00:05:06.110> good<00:05:07.509> so<00:05:08.509> that's<00:05:09.099> this

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
let's look at pretty good so that's this

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:11.770 
let's look at pretty good so that's this
board<00:05:10.520> well<00:05:10.729> then<00:05:10.849> I'm<00:05:11.090> just<00:05:11.240> gonna<00:05:11.389> sit<00:05:11.690> it

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
board well then I'm just gonna sit it

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.760 
board well then I'm just gonna sit it
right<00:05:12.229> on<00:05:12.349> top<00:05:12.530> of<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:14.379> probably<00:05:15.379> lay

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
right on top of that and probably lay

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.129 
right on top of that and probably lay
the<00:05:15.949> plastic<00:05:16.099> around<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:17.270> board<00:05:17.629> and<00:05:17.840> up<00:05:17.990> on

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
the plastic around the board and up on

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.959 
the plastic around the board and up on
top<00:05:18.349> of<00:05:18.469> the<00:05:18.529> board<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:18.949> then<00:05:19.159> set<00:05:19.490> those<00:05:19.699> two

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
top of the board and then set those two

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:26.159 
top of the board and then set those two
by<00:05:20.120> sixes<00:05:20.650> once<00:05:21.650> I<00:05:21.800> make<00:05:22.009> the<00:05:22.759> frame<00:05:23.150> for<00:05:23.900> the

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.230 

for<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.229> soil<00:05:27.560> I'll<00:05:28.069> probably<00:05:28.370> set<00:05:28.729> those<00:05:28.969> two

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
for the soil I'll probably set those two

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.779 
for the soil I'll probably set those two
by<00:05:29.389> sixes<00:05:29.919> just<00:05:30.919> right<00:05:31.219> on<00:05:31.370> top<00:05:31.400> of<00:05:31.729> the

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
by sixes just right on top of the

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.980 
by sixes just right on top of the
plywood<00:05:32.949> so<00:05:33.949> the<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.520> plastic<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.629> plastic

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
plywood so the the plastic the plastic

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.709 
plywood so the the plastic the plastic
will<00:05:36.110> wrap<00:05:36.289> over<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.919> plywood<00:05:37.389> the<00:05:38.389> boards

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:38.719 
will wrap over the plywood the boards

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:40.089 
will wrap over the plywood the boards
will<00:05:38.870> sit<00:05:39.020> on<00:05:39.050> top<00:05:39.319> of<00:05:39.379> it<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:39.830> I<00:05:39.860> shouldn't

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
will sit on top of it so I shouldn't

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.529 
will sit on top of it so I shouldn't
have<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:40.339> use<00:05:40.460> any<00:05:40.610> staples<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:41.300> then<00:05:41.419> that

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
have to use any staples and then that

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.550 
have to use any staples and then that
way<00:05:41.659> as<00:05:41.960> those<00:05:42.740> wood<00:05:43.009> chips<00:05:44.020> decompose<00:05:45.020> and

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
way as those wood chips decompose and

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.730 
way as those wood chips decompose and
shrink<00:05:46.310> and<00:05:46.610> compact<00:05:47.169> the<00:05:48.169> staples<00:05:48.560> aren't

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
shrink and compact the staples aren't

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.159 
shrink and compact the staples aren't
gonna<00:05:48.860> pull<00:05:49.610> on<00:05:49.969> the<00:05:50.180> plastic<00:05:50.690> there<00:05:51.020> won't<00:05:51.139> be

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
gonna pull on the plastic there won't be

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.189 
gonna pull on the plastic there won't be
any<00:05:51.289> staples<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.770> pull<00:05:52.009> it<00:05:52.190> it<00:05:52.810> should<00:05:53.810> kind<00:05:54.050> of

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
any staples to pull it it should kind of

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.439 
any staples to pull it it should kind of
come<00:05:54.680> loose<00:05:54.919> from<00:05:55.279> some<00:05:55.879> of<00:05:55.969> that<00:05:56.060> board<00:05:56.300> and

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
come loose from some of that board and

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:57.730 
come loose from some of that board and
I'll<00:05:56.539> have<00:05:56.629> a<00:05:56.659> little<00:05:56.779> slack<00:05:57.110> in<00:05:57.319> the<00:05:57.379> system

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
I'll have a little slack in the system

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.279 
I'll have a little slack in the system
so<00:05:58.669> as<00:05:59.060> long<00:05:59.270> as<00:05:59.330> it<00:05:59.599> doesn't<00:05:59.779> come<00:05:59.990> all<00:06:00.199> the

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
so as long as it doesn't come all the

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:01.990 
so as long as it doesn't come all the
way<00:06:00.319> in<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.650> just<00:06:00.740> fold<00:06:01.069> into<00:06:01.279> the<00:06:01.460> reservoir

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
way in and just fold into the reservoir

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.839 
way in and just fold into the reservoir
and<00:06:02.500> let<00:06:03.500> water<00:06:03.620> out<00:06:03.770> it<00:06:03.979> should<00:06:04.129> be<00:06:04.190> fine<00:06:04.430> a

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.869 

quick<00:06:07.849> update<00:06:07.879> before<00:06:08.330> I<00:06:08.539> let<00:06:09.409> you<00:06:09.550> move<00:06:10.550> on<00:06:10.729> to

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:10.879 
quick update before I let you move on to

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.879
