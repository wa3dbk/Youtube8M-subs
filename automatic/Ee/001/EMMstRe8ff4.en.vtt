I'll start with mushrooms which are good

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.509 
I'll start with mushrooms which are good
as<00:00:08.730> an<00:00:08.849> appetizer<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.950> cooked<00:00:10.950> them<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.370> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
as an appetizer I cooked them in a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.999 
as an appetizer I cooked them in a
convection<00:00:11.910> toaster<00:00:12.599> oven<00:00:13.139> without<00:00:13.559> any<00:00:13.889> oil

convection toaster oven without any oil

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.570 
convection toaster oven without any oil
I<00:00:14.750> cut<00:00:15.750> up<00:00:15.780> some<00:00:15.900> white<00:00:16.379> or<00:00:16.650> brown<00:00:16.949> mushrooms

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
I cut up some white or brown mushrooms

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.109 
I cut up some white or brown mushrooms
and<00:00:17.850> place<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> oven<00:00:19.410> between<00:00:20.189> 350

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and place them in the oven between 350

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.170 
and place them in the oven between 350
and<00:00:21.150> 400<00:00:21.900> degrees<00:00:22.170> Fahrenheit<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:23.609> about<00:00:23.820> 5

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 5

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.609 
and 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 5
minutes<00:00:26.510> after<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> few<00:00:27.840> minutes<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
minutes after a few minutes the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.320 
minutes after a few minutes the
mushrooms<00:00:29.070> will<00:00:29.250> start<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.699> shrivel<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
mushrooms will start to shrivel and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.860 
mushrooms will start to shrivel and
you'll<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> few<00:00:31.500> droplets<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.309> liquid<00:00:32.870> by

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
you'll see a few droplets of liquid by

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
you'll see a few droplets of liquid by
adjusting<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> temperature<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> time

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
adjusting the temperature and the time

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.680 
adjusting the temperature and the time
you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.750> make<00:00:36.899> them<00:00:37.079> either<00:00:37.230> firm<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:37.980> soft<00:00:38.219> I

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
you can make them either firm or soft I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.180 
you can make them either firm or soft I
like<00:00:39.690> them<00:00:39.899> partially<00:00:40.260> firm<00:00:42.710> then<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.829> put<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
like them partially firm then I put the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.180 
like them partially firm then I put the
mushrooms<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.969> bowl<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.680> add<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> tiny<00:00:47.039> bit

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
mushrooms in a bowl and add a tiny bit

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.819 
mushrooms in a bowl and add a tiny bit
of<00:00:47.340> salt<00:00:47.700> which<00:00:48.629> causes<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> mushrooms<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
of salt which causes the mushrooms to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.750 
of salt which causes the mushrooms to
release<00:00:50.280> more<00:00:50.579> juice

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
release more juice

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.150 
release more juice
this<00:00:53.760> creates<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.449> mushroom<00:00:54.930> soup<00:00:55.230> except

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
this creates a mushroom soup except

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.660 
this creates a mushroom soup except
there's<00:00:56.670> no<00:00:56.730> oil<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:57.420> burnt<00:00:57.960> flavor<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:59.340> just

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
there's no oil or burnt flavor it's just

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.729 
there's no oil or burnt flavor it's just
pure<00:01:00.059> mushrooms<00:01:00.859> with<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.219> salt<00:01:03.739> you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
pure mushrooms with a little salt you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
pure mushrooms with a little salt you
can<00:01:04.920> also<00:01:05.100> cook<00:01:05.489> onions<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.180> this

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
can also cook onions like this

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.020 
can also cook onions like this
just<00:01:07.290> place<00:01:07.590> some<00:01:07.799> slices<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> convection

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
just place some slices in the convection

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.899 
just place some slices in the convection
oven<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.630> let<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:10.409> cook<00:01:10.650> about<00:01:10.950> 2<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.670> 3

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
seems hot I turn off the heat and then I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.889 
seems hot I turn off the heat and then I
put<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> cover<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.880> let<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> sit<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
few minutes the pan is very thick so it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.790 
few minutes the pan is very thick so it
holds<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.009> heat<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:09.780> lets<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> burger<00:02:10.530> cook

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
holds the heat this lets the burger cook

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.950 
holds the heat this lets the burger cook
at<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.400> low<00:02:11.580> temperature

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.230 

after<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:14.990> few<00:02:15.260> minutes<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:16.069> juice<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.670> oozing

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
after a few minutes the juice is oozing

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.630 
after a few minutes the juice is oozing
out<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.600> burger<00:02:18.160> then<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.280> turned<00:02:19.550> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
out of the burger then I turned the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.090 
out of the burger then I turned the
