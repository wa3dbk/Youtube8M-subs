interested in doing green screen but he

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.030 
interested in doing green screen but he
just<00:01:41.400> didn't<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:41.909> he<00:01:42.090> had<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.390> room<00:01:43.040> so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
think I told in that video that my

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
think I told in that video that my
screen<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.640> about<00:01:56.880> 10<00:01:57.210> feet<00:01:57.420> by<00:01:57.630> 10<00:01:57.869> feet<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
screen was about 10 feet by 10 feet and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.639 
screen was about 10 feet by 10 feet and
that's<00:01:58.770> that's<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.780> huge<00:02:00.780> green<00:02:01.200> screen

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that's that's not a huge green screen

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.459 
that's that's not a huge green screen
compared<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.369> some<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.729> TV<00:02:03.719> studios<00:02:04.200> and

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.939 
it that way in your video you can cut
out<00:04:07.159> a<00:04:07.189> hole<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:08.000> let<00:04:08.539> the<00:04:08.750> hole<00:04:08.930> be<00:04:09.349> cut<00:04:09.829> out

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:09.949 
out a hole and let the hole be cut out

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:12.999 
out a hole and let the hole be cut out
in<00:04:10.159> the<00:04:10.189> center<00:04:10.329> or<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.599> can<00:04:11.810> say<00:04:12.109> invert<00:04:12.979> that

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:13.009 
in the center or you can say invert that

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:15.699 
in the center or you can say invert that
and<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:13.819> cut<00:04:14.449> out<00:04:14.599> will<00:04:14.810> be<00:04:14.840> around<00:04:15.349> that

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
and the cut out will be around that

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.819 
and the cut out will be around that
center<00:04:16.340> portion<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:17.570> what<00:04:17.780> I've<00:04:17.930> done<00:04:18.380> is<00:04:18.739> you

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
center portion so what I've done is you

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.520 
center portion so what I've done is you

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
cookie-cutter function of Sony Vegas and

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.610 
cookie-cutter function of Sony Vegas and
cut<00:04:25.530> out<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.710> hole<00:04:26.189> where<00:04:26.909> my<00:04:29.240> silhouette<00:04:30.240> my

cut out a hole where my silhouette my

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.619 
cut out a hole where my silhouette my
upper<00:04:31.620> body<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:32.129> in<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.669> green<00:04:32.909> screen<00:04:33.330> in<00:04:33.539> the

upper body is in the green screen in the

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.469 
upper body is in the green screen in the
background<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.379> then<00:04:35.250> I've<00:04:35.460> let<00:04:35.849> the<00:04:36.000> rest<00:04:36.240> of

background and then I've let the rest of
it<00:04:36.800> be<00:04:37.800> if<00:04:38.460> this<00:04:39.000> makes<00:04:39.270> sense

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
it be if this makes sense

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.740 
it be if this makes sense
an<00:04:40.110> artificial<00:04:40.889> green<00:04:41.340> screen<00:04:41.819> so<00:04:42.389> that<00:04:42.509> I<00:04:42.569> can

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
an artificial green screen so that I can

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.659 
an artificial green screen so that I can
now<00:04:42.840> bring<00:04:42.870> things<00:04:43.439> in<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:43.979> that<00:04:44.129> total<00:04:44.490> area

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
now bring things in and that total area

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.360 
now bring things in and that total area
back<00:04:45.060> there<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.599> you<00:04:46.229> will<00:04:46.469> have<00:04:46.650> seen<00:04:46.979> in<00:04:47.280> the

that'll<00:05:51.810> let<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.069> accomplish<00:05:53.069> the<00:05:53.400> green

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
that'll let you accomplish the green

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.309 
that'll let you accomplish the green
screen<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.479> chroma<00:05:55.199> keying<00:05:55.560> function<00:05:56.279> in<00:05:56.430> my

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
screen the chroma keying function in my

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.189 
screen the chroma keying function in my
case<00:05:58.319> that's<00:05:58.589> an<00:05:58.770> old<00:05:58.919> copy<00:05:59.279> of<00:05:59.569> Sony<00:06:00.569> Vegas<00:06:00.810> I

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
case that's an old copy of Sony Vegas I

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.350 
case that's an old copy of Sony Vegas I
think<00:06:01.440> I<00:06:01.560> have<00:06:01.710> a<00:06:01.740> version<00:06:02.009> six<00:06:02.669> and<00:06:03.000> I<00:06:03.089> think

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
think I have a version six and I think

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.540 
think I have a version six and I think
they're<00:06:03.569> up<00:06:03.719> to<00:06:03.750> an<00:06:04.020> eight<00:06:04.319> or<00:06:04.379> nine<00:06:04.589> now<00:06:05.099> so

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
they're up to an eight or nine now so

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.209 
they're up to an eight or nine now so
the<00:06:05.849> old<00:06:06.000> version<00:06:06.509> still<00:06:06.779> does<00:06:07.020> all<00:06:07.289> I<00:06:07.650> need<00:06:08.099> to

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.219 
the old version still does all I need to
