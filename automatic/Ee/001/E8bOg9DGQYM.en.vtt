00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.090
 hello, I'm anna de pasteles the Moreliana and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.970
 today I leave this video type 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.230
 I invite you to follow me on the channel 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:20.660
 Youtube pastries the Moreliana in this 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.810
 occasion in this video tip the cake is 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.619
 20 x 20 and the only thing I did that I gave him 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.250
 two extra inches to the tray where 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.940
 I sat at my base where I felt the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.940
 cake 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.149
 for nothing is only as it is part of 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.149
 as I also decorate the cakes 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.380
 and how do I tell this every time that 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.100
 you prepare your chantilly if you 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.890
 They think they have this very hard 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.840
 add chantilly liquid or cream 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.270
 to beat liquid and if they are very 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.379
 Well, well, go through again 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.340
 blender 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.980
 so that 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.170
 and they are blue 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.240
 way of you how to work because 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.800
 there are times that there is a little left 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.820
 harder and at the time that we are in 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.010
 bitumen I walk the cake then bread 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.920
 for the cake, then, if it does not arrive 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.650
 up to the hand 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.780
 and well what I do there is that I have my 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.880
 photo on the side 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.750
 with the country lillo de dientes I'm going 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.270
 giving the figure and it makes me better 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.890
 because if I'm wrong then it does not happen 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.890
 nothing does not stain the cake 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.670
 to color the cake the only thing 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.820
 I make my cream chantilly and I put 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.880
 part of the cream since I have whipped and 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.770
 then I add chantilly liquid and it's 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.860
 the way that I leave it so that it remains 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.319
 like a little bit between the liquid and the thickener 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.200
 that I can work it to be able to 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.520
 handle at the time that I'm 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.760
 coloring the cakes 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.850
 Well, I hope you can appreciate it and 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.510
 It makes me more practical because 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.470
 I work even faster 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.230
 and it is still 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.010
 that is, a texture is very different 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.010
 It looks very nice 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.370
