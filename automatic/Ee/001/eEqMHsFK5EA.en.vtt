00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
end it's time for a little bead practice

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.270 
end it's time for a little bead practice
anyway<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:14.750> pinoke<00:02:15.170> will<00:02:15.410> be<00:02:15.530> planed<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.010> let

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
anyway the pinoke will be planed to let

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.850 
anyway the pinoke will be planed to let
the<00:02:16.430> wood<00:02:16.610> speak<00:02:16.940> for<00:02:17.180> itself<00:02:17.349> this<00:02:18.349> project

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
the wood speak for itself this project

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.190 
the wood speak for itself this project
is<00:02:19.010> probably<00:02:19.250> an<00:02:19.700> excellent<00:02:20.330> candidate<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:20.989> a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
is probably an excellent candidate for a

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.580 
is probably an excellent candidate for a
multi<00:02:21.769> would<00:02:21.980> glue<00:02:22.519> up<00:02:22.700> other<00:02:23.690> than<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.140> beads

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
multi would glue up other than the beads

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.130 
multi would glue up other than the beads
I'm<00:02:24.680> aiming<00:02:25.220> for<00:02:25.580> an<00:02:25.700> egg<00:02:26.060> shape<00:02:26.450> with<00:02:26.989> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
I'm aiming for an egg shape with the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.130 
I'm aiming for an egg shape with the
large<00:02:27.470> end<00:02:27.800> being<00:02:28.099> opposite<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.880> eyepiece<00:02:29.269> my

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
large end being opposite the eyepiece my

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:47.960 
large end being opposite the eyepiece my
personal<00:02:30.620> preference

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.580 

then<00:02:48.970> they'll<00:02:49.150> sand<00:02:49.420> up<00:02:49.600> through<00:02:49.810> 400<00:02:50.110> grit

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
then they'll sand up through 400 grit

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.190 
then they'll sand up through 400 grit
and<00:02:50.860> finish<00:02:51.370> with<00:02:51.580> beeswax<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.510> mineral<00:02:52.600> oil

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
and finish with beeswax and mineral oil

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.580 
and finish with beeswax and mineral oil
I<00:02:53.830> chose<00:02:54.580> this<00:02:54.760> finish<00:02:55.120> over<00:02:55.480> shellac<00:02:55.840> because

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
I chose this finish over shellac because

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.440 
I chose this finish over shellac because
it<00:02:56.710> will<00:02:56.830> be<00:02:56.950> handled<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.430> lot<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:58.270> can

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
it will be handled a lot and I can

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.040 
it will be handled a lot and I can
easily<00:02:58.690> renew<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.620> finish<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:01.420> challenge<00:03:01.720> is

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
easily renew the finish the challenge is

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.050 
easily renew the finish the challenge is
in<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.410> simply<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:03.340> instructions<00:03:03.910> are

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
in this simply the instructions are

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.390 
in this simply the instructions are
fairly<00:03:04.450> detailed<00:03:04.630> so<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.560> tried<00:03:05.890> my<00:03:05.920> best<00:03:06.100> to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
fairly detailed so I tried my best to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.020 
fairly detailed so I tried my best to
actually<00:03:06.880> read<00:03:07.210> and<00:03:07.540> follow<00:03:08.170> them<00:03:08.820> first<00:03:09.820> are

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
actually read and follow them first are

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.300 
actually read and follow them first are
the<00:03:10.150> mirrors<00:03:10.540> these<00:03:11.380> are<00:03:11.590> front<00:03:11.920> surface

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the mirrors these are front surface

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.580 
the mirrors these are front surface
mirrors<00:03:12.640> they<00:03:13.030> are<00:03:13.210> small<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.870> hard<00:03:14.320> to<00:03:14.380> hold

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
mirrors they are small and hard to hold

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.370 
mirrors they are small and hard to hold
I<00:03:14.950> did<00:03:15.610> better<00:03:15.820> with<00:03:16.090> my<00:03:16.330> second<00:03:16.780> set<00:03:16.990> so

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
I did better with my second set so

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.800 
I did better with my second set so
that's<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.770> one<00:03:17.920> I'm<00:03:18.040> joined<00:03:18.310> I'm<00:03:19.240> using<00:03:19.540> the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
that's the one I'm joined I'm using the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.960 
that's the one I'm joined I'm using the
tube<00:03:20.020> as<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.410> holder<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:21.010> assemble<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.640> mirrors

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
tube as a holder to assemble the mirrors

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.900 
tube as a holder to assemble the mirrors
then<00:03:22.780> sliding<00:03:23.590> them<00:03:23.740> out<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.950> little<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.640> grab<00:03:24.880> a

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
then sliding them out a little to grab a

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.720 
then sliding them out a little to grab a
little<00:03:25.300> bit<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.690> tape<00:03:25.840> around<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.500> idea<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.460> to

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
little bit of tape around the idea is to

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.090 
little bit of tape around the idea is to
not<00:03:27.940> let<00:03:28.210> them<00:03:28.390> rattle<00:03:28.600> inside<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.800> metal

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
not let them rattle inside the metal

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.790 
not let them rattle inside the metal
tube<00:03:30.330> then<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:31.360> blackened<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.140> cut<00:03:32.350> ends<00:03:32.650> of

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
tube then I blackened the cut ends of

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.120 
tube then I blackened the cut ends of
the<00:03:32.890> glass<00:03:33.100> for<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.730> instructions<00:03:34.860> next<00:03:35.860> the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
the glass for the instructions next the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.640 
the glass for the instructions next the
eyepiece<00:03:36.490> the<00:03:37.360> compact<00:03:37.900> side<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.470> lens

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
eyepiece the compact side of the lens

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.550 
eyepiece the compact side of the lens
goes<00:03:39.160> into<00:03:39.520> the<00:03:39.640> eyepiece<00:03:40.000> then<00:03:40.990> on<00:03:41.110> such<00:03:41.530> a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
goes into the eyepiece then on such a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.690 
goes into the eyepiece then on such a
small<00:03:42.070> piece<00:03:42.370> which<00:03:43.240> is<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.600> convex<00:03:44.200> side

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
small piece which is the convex side

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.340 
small piece which is the convex side
then<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.880> retaining<00:03:46.330> ring<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.840> hold<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.170> lens

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
then a retaining ring to hold the lens

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.760 
then a retaining ring to hold the lens
in<00:03:47.590> place<00:03:47.700> on<00:03:48.700> my<00:03:48.970> two<00:03:49.030> kits<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:50.290> retaining

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
in place on my two kits the retaining

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.890 
in place on my two kits the retaining
ring<00:03:50.920> was<00:03:51.430> too<00:03:52.030> small

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
ring was too small

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.190 
ring was too small
I<00:03:52.930> had<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.680> stretch<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.400> open<00:03:55.200> before

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
I had to stretch it open before

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.930 
I had to stretch it open before
inserting<00:03:56.740> it<00:03:57.010> end<00:03:57.220> for<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.760> function

inserting it end for it to function

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.620 
inserting it end for it to function
properly<00:03:59.070> then<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.610> little<00:04:00.910> gems<00:04:01.150> go<00:04:01.390> into

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
properly then the little gems go into

biggest tip don't do this assembly in

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.390 
biggest tip don't do this assembly in
the<00:04:31.550> shop<00:04:31.819> it's<00:04:32.620> impossible<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:34.099> eliminate
