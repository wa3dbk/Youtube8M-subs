00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
see here let's try to think of something

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.020 
see here let's try to think of something
like<00:05:21.650> a<00:05:21.770> montage<00:05:22.010> video<00:05:22.490> yeah<00:05:22.760> there<00:05:22.940> you<00:05:23.000> go

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
that work really good with that but uh

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.580 
that work really good with that but uh
that<00:05:26.510> looks<00:05:26.630> like<00:05:26.750> it's<00:05:26.900> about<00:05:26.960> everything

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590
