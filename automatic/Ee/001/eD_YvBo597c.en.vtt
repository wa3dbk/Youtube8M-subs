00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.789
 integral flour 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.380
 If you do not have a blender with a 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.449
 hook to knead like the one that 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.449
 shows you can use a wooden stick 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.460
 first take the natural lake and warm 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.820
 in the microwave oven for 20 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.230
 seconds later it empties the notation and 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.230
 add white flour and yeast 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.950

 up a spoon and mix well 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.170
 I wait 5 to 10 minutes here I was the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.360
 yeast when the time has passed and 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.159
 have as bubbles he uses his 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.920
 blender another wooden stick 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.439
 about nuts the raisins the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.470
 cinnamon oats melted butter 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.660
 honey and salt 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.610
 of mixing and adding little by little 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.610
 ingredients to the container 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.610
 Y 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.600
 once everything is well mixed 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.700
 about wholemeal and bell flour 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.800
 adding little by little to the mixture can 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:02.300
 be 2 tablespoons at a time so that it 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:03.790
 can incorporate more easily when 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.290
 it's very difficult to keep mixing 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.940
 add the rest of the flour and using 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.920
 your hands more until everything is 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.920
 well stirred and not so sticky 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.020
 ah 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.050
 Take a clean and greased container 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.850
 with a little oil put your dough 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.210
 in the bush and cover it with a bag of 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.210
 plastic 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.540
 Y 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.670
 ah 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.010
 10 the specimen more or less for one hour 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.900
 or you can use the following title 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.640
 heat the oven for 2 minutes 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.890
 approximately until warm 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.409
 turn it off and place your role inside 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.090
 leave it there for 35 minutes instead of 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.709
 one hour this works because the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.500
 Yeast inflates faster in places 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.450
 warm when time is up remove 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.470
 the bag and amazon the mixture to give 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.470
 the way of the way 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.120
 ah 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.030
 Y 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.280
 If you have a clean rag, put it on 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.770
 over and covers with a plastic bag 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.190
 again let inflate for 30 minutes 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.170
 15 minutes using the tip of the oven 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.390
 When the time is up, uncover 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.050
 logically baked it to 190 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.410
 degrees centigrade bakes from 35 to 40 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.410
 minutes 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.580
 take the bam out of the oven and carefully use 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.030
 a knife to get it out of the way 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.030
 enjoy
