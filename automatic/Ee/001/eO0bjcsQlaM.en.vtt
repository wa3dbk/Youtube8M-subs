operation<00:00:58.760> basically<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.629> premise<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
operation basically the premise of it is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.280 
operation basically the premise of it is
quite<00:01:02.190> simple<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.570> nice<00:01:03.809> smooth

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
quite simple it's just a nice smooth

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.070 
quite simple it's just a nice smooth
ramp<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:05.159> been<00:01:05.460> hammered<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
ramp that's been hammered out for the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.910 
ramp that's been hammered out for the
equal<00:01:07.710> stickers<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.700> glide<00:01:09.479> along<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.080> also

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
equal stickers to glide along and also

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.460 
equal stickers to glide along and also
the<00:01:11.100> herp<00:01:11.520> Ling's<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.540> they<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.869> go<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.140> there

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the herp Ling's so they just go up there

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.760

I've<00:01:14.159> put<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:15.049> dunno<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> call<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I've put a little dunno what to call it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.940 
I've put a little dunno what to call it
a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:17.070> block<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> top<00:01:18.409> that<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.619> equal

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a little block at the top that the equal

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
a little block at the top that the equal
stickers<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.640> stuck<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.360> go<00:01:21.479> down<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
stickers get stuck on and go down and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.260 
stickers get stuck on and go down and
also<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.619> Herlings<00:01:23.100> hit<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.580> middle<00:01:24.060> part

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
also the Herlings hit this middle part

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.660 
also the Herlings hit this middle part
here<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.810> pretty<00:01:25.530> much<00:01:25.770> fall<00:01:26.100> into<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> lava

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
here and pretty much fall into the lava

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.469 
here and pretty much fall into the lava
trap<00:01:27.530> now<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.590> tricky<00:01:29.340> part<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.180> floaty

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
trap now the tricky part is the floaty

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.740 
trap now the tricky part is the floaty
grocers<00:01:31.729> they're<00:01:32.729> very<00:01:32.970> similar<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.479> wraiths

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
grocers they're very similar to wraiths

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.840 
grocers they're very similar to wraiths
and<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.470> glide<00:01:34.770> through<00:01:35.220> blocks<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and they can glide through blocks and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.010 
and they can glide through blocks and
there's<00:01:36.119> none<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.299> screen<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> moment

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
there's none on screen at the moment

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.219 
there's none on screen at the moment
here's<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.360> they'll<00:01:39.360> go<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.869> bit<00:01:39.900> but

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
here's one and they'll go up a bit but

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.120 
here's one and they'll go up a bit but
then<00:01:40.380> they<00:01:40.530> sort<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.610> through<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:43.130> where

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
then they sort of get through to where

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.120 
then they sort of get through to where
your<00:01:44.610> character<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:46.200> I've<00:01:46.530> had<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.979> app

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130

I've<00:01:47.399> had<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.909> I've<00:01:48.210> had<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.659> add<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> bit<00:01:49.049> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
I've had it I've had to add a bit of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.350 
I've had it I've had to add a bit of
honey<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.640> will<00:01:50.820> take<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> bit<00:01:51.329> of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
honey to this and you will take a bit of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.410 
honey to this and you will take a bit of
damage<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> find<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:54.000> you're

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
damage and if you find that you're

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.950 
damage and if you find that you're
taking<00:01:54.810> too<00:01:55.049> much<00:01:55.320> I'd<00:01:55.619> recommend<00:01:56.960> re-rolling

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
taking too much I'd recommend re-rolling

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.270 
taking too much I'd recommend re-rolling
