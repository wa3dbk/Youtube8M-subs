00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.550
 Hi guys, I'm here with another video this 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.670
 video being to you how to draw the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.150
 naruto going out would be a bad mourning in the way 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.539
 of the fox is 4 caldas 15 broth if I 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.029
 I'm not mistaken, this drawing is fine 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.300
 looking like a link there where it 's a guy 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.150
 American or French I do not know where the guy 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.730
 It was the video of this guy that I came from. 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.250
 to make this design so after 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.050
 see my video you see his video 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.960
 I want to make it very clear that I 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.420
 I copied it from nobody I came to speak on 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.210
 comment then I'm admitting that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.340
 I copied in it that not this image did not 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.050
 I saw on the internet but I also think 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.270
 you have no problem copying because you 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 You want to copy a video of me. 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.070
 It may also be logical that I made the video 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.500
 Of course I did not make a video of him can see 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.989
 that if you go and see his video it will 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.120
 being different the video is hopefully 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.369
 You understood that I said it is 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.020
 Now I wanted to give some news, I walked. 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.479
 talking to some friends of mine there 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.360
 which also has a channel on youtube and people 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.930
 and I've decided that I'm going to focus on the channel in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.420
 then drawing my channel will be the 90% 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.810
 drawing not 80% drawing and 20% video games 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.509
 and I'm just going to continue with the wee series 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.880
 Coffee, because I already started 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.860
 You and I like to do these series. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.500
 because I have an obligation to finish 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.579
 of course I had already started and I 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.659
 I like too 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.119
 but it's just like sw and the rest will be 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.990
 drawings so you can expect more 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.520
 drawings on the channel are also you 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.229
 Unfortunately there will be a day that will not go 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.290
 to post video that I will not have to 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.240
 like but I hope you have 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.740

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.630
 Sad, do not be sad, that's it. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.149

 something that youtube is very cattle is 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.890
 harming me a lot 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.930
 take a look if you 're writing in 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.470

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.220

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.489

 some tips where we use youtube 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.170
 designers have to come together to 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.459
 grow because there is not much 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.280
 well that makes big drawings so big 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.660
 only time and drawings 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.799
 So I think we have to get together for 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.169
 grow and that's what we are 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.989

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.099

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:38.430
