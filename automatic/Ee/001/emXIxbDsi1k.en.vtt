00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.690
 Cho Su-jin 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.740
 If you build a road and have an accident, 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.879
 Problems of cargo car process 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.329
 It was not yesterday. 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.049
 The recession makes me wonder if I can take a break 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.740
 I am fascinated. 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.470
 Lee Hyun-jung reports. 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.389
 Last year, 7.8 billion won 

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:25.319
 The budget of nearly 10 billion won per year, including 8 billion won in the previous year, 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.579
 Used to repair. 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.579
 One of the main causes of road breakage is excessive love 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.720
 Last year In-Saks's overcontrolling 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.700
 At the municipal check-in and check-in control, 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.000
 It was just. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.920
 I caught a checkpoint at three checkpoints on the cine plate. 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.440
 The number of cases 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.850
 There are a lot of nec. 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.230
 There are 709 as well as the number of the mobilization division that the performance was successful. 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.000
 Under consideration 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 What you see now is a mobile measurement. 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.140
 The officers will carry six of these meters, 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.120
 We are cracking overboards while moving. 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 I will follow the scene myself. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 The detachments follow the falling man. 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.970
 I took measures, but I stand by the difference 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.720
 I will go to another vehicle. 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.050
 Receiving water quality inspection of the shaft weight this time caught with money 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.259
 It's a target. 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:21.920
 It is. 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.210
 10. 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.580
 6. 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.730
 The KOSDAQ market 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.850
 10. 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 When I took a photo, I went in. Come and go. 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.910
 This is about a man 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 It is said that the case of swearing and fists is also common. 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.810
 Overruns are more than a ton of each foundation 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.329
 There is a limit because the total weight can be developed for more than 40 minutes. 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.670
 For all trim. And I added one more. Specifically, 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.829
 When 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.220
 You can not crack down even if you play third 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.729
 It's a clear loading violation. 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.660
 There's a police officer in control. 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.530
 To get caught in oversight, people with a lot of traffic 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.740
 Mumana 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.930
 I would like to install the Ministry of Labor 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.099
 not 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.999
 You do not have permission to enlist in the roster. 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.260
 Make space for them 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.809
 The real estate port corporation is 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:18.289
 Is not 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.389
 FSS, of course, should be installed in such departments 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.069
 I feel right. 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.950
 Although billions of won are wasted each year, 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.950
 Effective oversight has not been achieved. 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.219
 They scoffed at the nine checkpoints that were unfamiliar, 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:35.869
 Overload vehicle 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:39.259
 The hide-and-seek executives of the crackdowns 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.809
 It's spreading from above. 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.370
