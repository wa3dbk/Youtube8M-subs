00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.339 
definitely be considered a big win in
anybody's<00:03:10.819> eyes<00:03:11.030> but<00:03:11.599> how<00:03:11.750> did<00:03:11.900> we<00:03:12.019> even<00:03:12.170> get

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
anybody's eyes but how did we even get

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.050 
anybody's eyes but how did we even get
to<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.530> point<00:03:12.829> where<00:03:13.310> we<00:03:13.430> could<00:03:13.549> even<00:03:13.760> see

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
to the point where we could even see

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.759 
to the point where we could even see
that<00:03:14.180> deal<00:03:14.420> as<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.599> possibility<00:03:14.989> by<00:03:15.530> being

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
that deal as a possibility by being

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.280 
that deal as a possibility by being
frugal<00:03:16.099> and<00:03:16.519> living<00:03:16.880> below<00:03:17.060> our<00:03:17.209> means<00:03:17.419> we<00:03:18.049> see

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
frugal and living below our means we see

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.229 
frugal and living below our means we see
the<00:03:18.440> rich<00:03:18.620> getting<00:03:18.889> richer<00:03:19.010> as<00:03:19.430> encouraging

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
the rich getting richer as encouraging

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.819 
the rich getting richer as encouraging
not<00:03:20.419> discouraging<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.260> means<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.650> if<00:03:21.739> you

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
not discouraging it means that if you

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.199 
not discouraging it means that if you
can<00:03:21.980> fight<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.370> uphill<00:03:22.730> battle<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.120> the

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
can fight the uphill battle in the

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.420 
can fight the uphill battle in the
beginning<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:24.049> downhill<00:03:24.560> is<00:03:24.829> sure<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.250> come

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
beginning the downhill is sure to come

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.400 
beginning the downhill is sure to come
much<00:03:25.760> easier<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.599> is<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.810> better<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.169> pinch

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
much easier so is it better to pinch

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.830 
much easier so is it better to pinch
pennies<00:03:27.620> or<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.400> focus<00:03:28.519> on<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:28.940> big<00:03:29.090> wins<00:03:29.299> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
pennies or to focus on the big wins the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.440 
pennies or to focus on the big wins the
answer<00:03:30.109> is<00:03:30.319> both<00:03:30.769> our<00:03:31.010> strategy<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:31.940> live

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
answer is both our strategy is to live

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.949 
answer is both our strategy is to live
below<00:03:32.750> our<00:03:32.870> means<00:03:33.079> and<00:03:33.380> earn<00:03:34.280> more<00:03:34.639> and<00:03:34.959> invest

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
below our means and earn more and invest

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.990 
below our means and earn more and invest
that<00:03:36.079> money<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:36.739> our<00:03:37.099> money<00:03:37.310> makes<00:03:37.700> more

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
that money so that our money makes more

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.400 
that money so that our money makes more
money<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.540> think<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:38.780> that's<00:03:38.959> beyond<00:03:39.290> our

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
money to think that that's beyond our

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.409 
money to think that that's beyond our
mental<00:03:39.709> capacity<00:03:39.829> is<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.489> great<00:03:40.970> way<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.150> stay

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
mental capacity is a great way to stay

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.960 
mental capacity is a great way to stay
broke<00:03:41.660> but<00:03:42.319> what<00:03:42.410> do<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:42.560> guys<00:03:42.620> think<00:03:42.849> let<00:03:43.849> us

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
broke but what do you guys think let us

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.960 
broke but what do you guys think let us
