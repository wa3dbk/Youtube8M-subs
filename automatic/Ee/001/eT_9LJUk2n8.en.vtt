what we get from three and remember each

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.990 
what we get from three and remember each
time<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.220> that's<00:01:41.220> another<00:01:41.490> point<00:01:41.820> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
time you do it that's another point you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.539 
time you do it that's another point you
want<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> need<00:01:42.360> fifty<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:44.130> average<00:01:44.340> about

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549

six<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.149> eight<00:01:45.299> times<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.850> shouldn't<00:01:48.060> take

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
six to eight times so it shouldn't take

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.359 
six to eight times so it shouldn't take
that<00:01:48.360> long<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:49.170> which<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.220> is

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that long really which I think that is

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.569

counting<00:02:01.430> but<00:02:02.430> yeah<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.850> only<00:02:03.000> took<00:02:03.270> fifty

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
counting but yeah we only took fifty

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.859 
counting but yeah we only took fifty
times<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:05.570> six<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.719> eight

times and you can do like six to eight
each<00:02:07.110> go<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.860> should<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.220> balance

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
