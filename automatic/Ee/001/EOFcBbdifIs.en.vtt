00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello to you if it I was thinking 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.299
 create a video tutorial on how to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.980
 shift piano notes to guitar 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.990
 I often have to put 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.259
 works before it always did 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.900
 manual it was very hard work 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.180
 and here is the last piece that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.770
 shifted it like a work to i 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.949
 at once the grace it was really 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.180
 hard because there notes if 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.980
 to shift pure 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.039
 shift as usual 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 then just these notes will not be on the guitar then 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.669
 have got to get more lift on 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.350
 several tons so two tones about 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.450
 and then more signs at the key and very 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.600
 many signs of adventure so all this 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.390
 trade it pass it is very hard 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.610
 it's very hard for me just the brain explodes 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.579
 figuratively speaking I was thinking here that 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.160
 some other way you can do it 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.680
 everything in the program that is automatically 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.410
 it's half an hour I looked looked thought 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 and realized that this can be done now 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.930
 I will show you how to suggest using 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.740
 programs here i'm on an example now 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.490
 let's shift product 2 and she 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.350
 just generally open guitar the right way 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.760
 Here we see 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.920
 we have two pieces here 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.049
 tracks created for piano 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.479
 that is, you can only play on the protopi 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.049
 She if we now shifted manually 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.659
 then we would need a lot of things to consider 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.670
 for example, what if we shift everything 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.280
 how is the table this mod for example we have 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.720
 the guitar will not be well, and there are many such 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.180
 watch which we will not be on 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.600
 guitar so we need to shift after all 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.009
 still raise by 1 and so on and so 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.829
 some run into it let's all be done 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.860
 using the program and as we see y 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.509
 we have a treble clef here but for guitar 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.540
 we need rag exactly exactly a 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:56.369
 here is massive and we do not need it therefore 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.860
 to translate into the wall of the treble 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.740
 the key then click on the leftmost icon 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.040
 top looks like this violin 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.030
 key here and choose the key 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.060
 same 2 press ok everything we have a note 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.910
 transferred to the treble if you thought 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.560
 that this is all wrong because now 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.540
 if we play where we are on guitar 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.180
 on her so low 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.900
 the notes it doesn't exist at all 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.140
 guitar so what do we do now now if 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.440
 we will now raise these notes 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.160
 then behave like here a la flat 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.610
 For us, we are accustomed by fashion, so all 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.840
 notes that are there now 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.510
 lower by half a ton if we are now 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.270
 let's raise on let's say 2 tons up 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.980
 there will also be a little bit and another one over 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.220
 people but it should also be lowered 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.820
 so there will be a lot of very gender errors 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.760
 tones not to allow just remove 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.070
 flat and put in C major all we have 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.200
 automatically note rearranged 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.820
 put there diets sea where 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.100
 it is necessary in this case nozbe sea 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.270
 They were put instead of where they were 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.700
 who stood at the key 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.910
 now it is already possible to lift us 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.380
 raise tons more accurately let's 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.160
 let's raise about two tones first 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.590
 what we had where the bass clef 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.910
 now we have a violin so in general we find 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.670
 here's a button like not up here up 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.580
 Narin semitone press 4 1 that is 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.140
 lift by 2 tons one two three three 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:42.140
 all we raised now let's also 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.140
 the top also raise oh second 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.430
 so too 1 2 3 4 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.020
 if we listen then we will now 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.020
 all right should be 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.290
 yes all right ray of light no failures 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.910
 no so what do we do now 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.850
 create a guitar track and type you can 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.299
 nylon and so we got there 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:25.340
 cool vitali now we copy everything here 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.340
 these notes that were on the piano 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:34.010
 copy and paste the track with a guitar 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.710
 country music 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.720
 so all we got notes in the tracks with 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:46.490
 guitar now these can be notes that 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:49.590
 there were tracks with piano remove the look 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:55.190
 so everything means from us in principle from 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.190
 stayed the same see secrets 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:03.659
 yes, everything is fine, so now we need to 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:06.449
 these notes also copy the same 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:10.109
 insert into the track with the guitar so from 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:12.659
 new track test from copy layer 

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:18.979
 track add again select group 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:21.959
 Guitar type nylon and paste here 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:26.429
 all now this track with piano 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:31.799
 you can completely delete so click 

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:35.129
 select the track so the track push 

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:37.349
 great but now what we have 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:39.509
 the path that should not be left 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:44.759
 on top of the main below that is here 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:46.979
 see d a must be bearded all below 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:51.509
 solved very simply just choose 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:53.849
 Dear, which is the top and now click on 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:58.469
 here this arrow down she becomes 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:06:01.709
 below so well that's basically all well i 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.610
 for convenience, I will remove the tablature click 

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:06.019
 truth cane 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:10.639
 white press twice on the track and 

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:10.639
 I take goldex tabulatura here 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.779
 that's all we got works for 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.669
 guitars meaning we suggested 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:22.189
 piano work with guitar 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.719
 using the program guitar pro 6 see 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.939
 all this is actually very simple 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:28.669
 now they have to sit for a long time 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:33.969
 torment the application works on 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:36.680
 guitar and yes by the way here we forgot 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:37.189
 it was necessary to remove the signs here as well 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.849
 the vein 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:43.129
 I did not look this one was also lying 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.810
 so then we do operations further 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:55.699
 not played on this sound will sound 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:58.249
 the wrong kind of yourself is almost correct 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:02.740
 but still for some distortion there 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:11.870
 eat and so I better better just 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:20.150
 I forgot to delete it all right here. 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:24.470
 it is necessary here we delete here we delete 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:30.310
 cut the track completely now 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:33.820
 all is now exactly to everyone but 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.820
 rename this is optional 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.050
 save 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.620
 all the work is ready now you can 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.810
 just learn guitar 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.600
 thank you all for watching subscribe 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.220
 We like it though I think this video 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:04.820
 Very few people will look at what it is. 

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.820
 very few people need but oh well everyone bye
