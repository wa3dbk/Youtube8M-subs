00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.440
 the canopy of English culture and 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.720
 radim sÃ£o josÃ© dos campos 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.400
 is a very important event that we 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.200
 we are giving a great appreciation 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.230
 so the presence of this youth here 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.019
 To participate in this tournament, let's 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.390
 very much the joy of great honor and 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.990
 expectation that really gives here has a 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.990
 wonderful show 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.320
 the second time I'm participating in the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.450
 tournament 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.659
 I think it 's the most important point. 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.310
 of this tournament is that it is a place where 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.259
 you can be seen to reach the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.020
 Brazilian team is a championship of 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.990
 state selections then a championship 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.390
 youth who rolls in the country 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.819
 and the best opportunity you get in 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.659
 Brazilian selection for very special 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:02:00.619
 for me that competes with several teams but 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.470
 of hades states so the players 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.329
 greater honor is disputing this 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.929
 championship that is very big in brazil 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.299
 the cooler part and the trip 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:16.150
 personal diverticulum and to be able to 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.150
 championship so it 's time 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.170
 to say it is to work with the 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.720
 basic categories, people know that the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.090
 future of sport in any sport 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.590
 to be happy with all they have 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.060
 nowadays a power pot that the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.580
 Brazil is becoming a sport the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.860
 investment we are having 15 to 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.930
 prospect to listen to great tournaments 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.410
 such as the Olympic Games as the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.750
 world is their way is more clear 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.720
 than my time I see them playing 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.720
 today and I see that they know the game 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.730
 play better in fundamentals in technique 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.829

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.019
 can certainly be much better 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.760
 of what my generation was and how I 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.739
 told them the responsibility of the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.329
