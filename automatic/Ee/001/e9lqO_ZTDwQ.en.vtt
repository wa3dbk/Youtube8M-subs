added<00:00:14.990> more<00:00:15.990> things<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> painting<00:00:17.750> here

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
added more things to the painting here

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.420 
added more things to the painting here
I've<00:00:18.930> used<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:20.060> stencil<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.529> a<00:00:22.529> butterfly<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
I've used a stencil of a butterfly I

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.970 
I've used a stencil of a butterfly I
have<00:00:24.240> three<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.470> painting<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:27.740> it's<00:00:28.740> good

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
have three on the painting and it's good

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.060 
have three on the painting and it's good
to<00:00:29.160> work<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.670> odd<00:00:30.269> numbers<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.560> painting

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
to work with odd numbers in a painting

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.160 
to work with odd numbers in a painting
it<00:00:32.279> makes<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.759> much<00:00:33.420> more<00:00:33.770> interesting<00:00:36.170> here

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
it makes it much more interesting here

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.619 
it makes it much more interesting here
I've<00:00:37.380> used<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.040> broth<00:00:39.320> stencil<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.940> a<00:00:41.940> flower

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
I've used a broth stencil of a flower

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.470 
I've used a broth stencil of a flower
part<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> flower<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:48.410> here<00:00:49.410> I've<00:00:49.649> used

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
part of the flower and here I've used

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.080 
part of the flower and here I've used
foam<00:00:51.480> stamps<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:53.239> love<00:00:54.239> circles<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.739> had<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
foam stamps I love circles and I had a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.200 
foam stamps I love circles and I had a
small<00:00:57.090> circular<00:00:58.079> foam<00:00:58.649> stamp<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.699> bigger

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
small circular foam stamp and a bigger

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.560 
small circular foam stamp and a bigger
one<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.780> I've<00:01:01.649> also<00:01:01.859> used<00:01:02.329> something<00:01:03.329> called

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
one and I've also used something called

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
one and I've also used something called
punchy<00:01:04.470> nella<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.590> they're<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.799> these

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
punchy nella and they're like these

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.210 
punchy nella and they're like these
little<00:01:08.970> tiny<00:01:09.299> holes<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> makes<00:01:10.860> great

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
little tiny holes and it makes great

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.050 
little tiny holes and it makes great
textures<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> gives<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.640> variety

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
textures and so it gives you a variety

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.810 
textures and so it gives you a variety
of<00:01:17.210> sizes<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> circles<00:01:19.259> which<00:01:19.530> makes<00:01:20.369> it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
of sizes and circles which makes it

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:34.200 
of sizes and circles which makes it
kind<00:01:22.480> of<00:01:22.600> need

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.090 

the<00:01:34.780> next<00:01:35.140> thing<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.560> did<00:01:35.860> is<00:01:37.650> painting<00:01:38.650> over

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
the next thing I did is painting over

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.350 
the next thing I did is painting over
the<00:01:39.130> aluminum<00:01:39.790> foil<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:41.770> when<00:01:42.040> you<00:01:42.190> just<00:01:42.400> use

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
the aluminum foil now when you just use

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.090 
the aluminum foil now when you just use
regular<00:01:43.770> paint<00:01:44.770> on<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.670> foil<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:47.290> very<00:01:47.740> hard

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
regular paint on the foil it's very hard

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.999 
regular paint on the foil it's very hard
to<00:01:48.159> stick<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.940> surface<00:01:49.180> so<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:50.110> use<00:01:50.800> the

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
to stick to the surface so I use the

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:58.050 
to stick to the surface so I use the
product<00:01:51.490> called<00:01:51.670> gak<00:01:53.070> 200g<00:01:54.070> AC<00:01:54.540> 200<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:57.060> this

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
product called gak 200g AC 200 and this

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.620 
product called gak 200g AC 200 and this
guy<00:01:58.330> 200<00:01:59.170> when<00:01:59.619> you<00:02:00.550> put<00:02:00.759> about<00:02:00.970> eight<00:02:01.240> drops

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
guy 200 when you put about eight drops

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.320 
guy 200 when you put about eight drops
to<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.020> paint<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.590> you're<00:02:02.830> using<00:02:03.330> it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
to the paint that you're using it

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.380 
to the paint that you're using it
hardens<00:02:05.320> somewhat<00:02:06.159> when<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.820> start<00:02:07.240> applying

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
hardens somewhat when you start applying

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.370 
hardens somewhat when you start applying
it<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.019> surface<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:10.000> aluminum<00:02:10.720> foil

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
it to the surface of the aluminum foil

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.530 
it to the surface of the aluminum foil
and<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:13.000> way<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.480> will<00:02:13.630> stick<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.800> foil

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and that way it will stick to the foil

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.610 
and that way it will stick to the foil
once<00:02:16.540> you've<00:02:16.840> got<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.470> first<00:02:17.860> layer<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:19.620> then

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
once you've got that first layer on then

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.340 
once you've got that first layer on then
you<00:02:21.489> could<00:02:21.760> apply<00:02:22.570> just<00:02:24.480> paint<00:02:25.480> as<00:02:25.720> you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
you could apply just paint as you

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.580 
you could apply just paint as you
normally<00:02:26.500> would<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.239> first<00:02:28.510> layer<00:02:28.810> with

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
normally would but that first layer with

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.490 
normally would but that first layer with
the<00:02:29.620> gac<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.400> really<00:02:30.970> important<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.630> order<00:02:32.140> for

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
the gac is really important in order for

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.170 
the gac is really important in order for
it<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.739> dear<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> surface

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.990 

I've<00:02:37.319> continued<00:02:38.319> playing<00:02:38.620> around<00:02:39.280> with<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
I've continued playing around with the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.140 
I've continued playing around with the
gold<00:02:40.269> and<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.689> burnt<00:02:41.230> orange<00:02:41.909> which<00:02:42.909> are

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
gold and the burnt orange which are

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.800 
gold and the burnt orange which are
analogous<00:02:43.689> color<00:02:44.140> on<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.950> color<00:02:44.980> wheel<00:02:45.280> and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
analogous color on the color wheel and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.630 
analogous color on the color wheel and
they're<00:02:46.810> very<00:02:46.840> warm<00:02:47.469> colors<00:02:48.569> I'm<00:02:49.569> using<00:02:49.629> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
they're very warm colors I'm using a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.990 
they're very warm colors I'm using a
transparent<00:02:52.439> acrylic<00:02:53.439> fluid<00:02:54.159> which<00:02:54.640> are

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
transparent acrylic fluid which are

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.149 
transparent acrylic fluid which are
great<00:02:56.159> and<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.680> at<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.069> point<00:03:01.560> I'm<00:03:02.560> looking

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
great and so at this point I'm looking

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.970 
great and so at this point I'm looking
at<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.790> painting<00:03:04.359> at<00:03:04.629> the<00:03:04.689> overall<00:03:05.200> painting

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
at the painting at the overall painting

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.410 
at the painting at the overall painting
in<00:03:06.250> I'm<00:03:06.819> trying<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.389> find<00:03:07.659> the<00:03:07.989> area<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.709> focus

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
in I'm trying to find the area of focus

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.129 
in I'm trying to find the area of focus
it's<00:03:10.420> good<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.409> turn<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.859> painting<00:03:12.310> around

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
it's good to to turn the painting around

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.659 
it's good to to turn the painting around
because<00:03:14.139> then<00:03:14.409> it<00:03:14.590> gives<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:15.129> a<00:03:15.370> different

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
because then it gives you a different

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.440 
because then it gives you a different
perspective<00:03:15.939> on<00:03:16.840> your<00:03:17.319> painting<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.450> that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
perspective on your painting and that

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.119 
perspective on your painting and that
way<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.780> might<00:03:20.109> find<00:03:20.470> something<00:03:21.419> that<00:03:23.129> you

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
way you might find something that you

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
the same position and it gives you an

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.619 
the same position and it gives you an
opportunity<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:29.069> alter<00:03:30.069> it<00:03:30.159> to<00:03:30.459> create<00:03:31.419> more

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
opportunity to alter it to create more

balanced<00:03:32.230> with<00:03:32.889> your<00:03:33.129> painting<00:03:34.079> I've<00:03:35.079> turned

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
balanced with your painting I've turned

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.089 
balanced with your painting I've turned
it<00:03:35.590> around<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:36.159> few<00:03:36.189> times<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.409> I<00:03:40.709> sort<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.799> feel

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
it around a few times and I sort of feel

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.710 
it around a few times and I sort of feel
that<00:03:43.290> at<00:03:44.290> this<00:03:44.650> point<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.760> might<00:03:46.000> change<00:03:46.030> as

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
that at this point that might change as

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.309 
that at this point that might change as
the<00:03:46.870> painting<00:03:48.030> develops<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.510> this<00:03:49.840> would<00:03:50.109> be

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
the painting develops that this would be

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.979 
the painting develops that this would be
my<00:03:50.590> preferred<00:03:53.430> position<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.690> see<00:03:55.690> something

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
my preferred position I see something

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.830 
my preferred position I see something
happening<00:03:56.739> here<00:03:56.799> in<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:57.489> area<00:03:58.000> is<00:03:58.180> clearing

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
happening here in this area is clearing

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.839 
happening here in this area is clearing
here<00:03:59.019> I'm<00:03:59.199> looking<00:03:59.440> at<00:03:59.799> it<00:03:59.979> for<00:04:00.609> some<00:04:00.819> reason

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
here I'm looking at it for some reason

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.330 
here I'm looking at it for some reason
as<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.359> forest<00:04:02.079> right<00:04:02.530> now<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:02.979> this<00:04:03.159> the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
as a forest right now is this the

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.339 
as a forest right now is this the
picture<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.299> came<00:04:04.510> into<00:04:04.690> my<00:04:04.810> mind<00:04:04.959> this

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
picture that came into my mind this

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.710 
picture that came into my mind this
morning<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:06.519> this<00:04:06.790> is<00:04:06.970> like<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.269> clearing

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
morning that this is like the clearing

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.580 
morning that this is like the clearing
in<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.930> forest<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.739> this<00:04:09.190> is<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:11.139> inside

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
in the forest and this is the the inside

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.399 
in the forest and this is the the inside
of<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.919> forest<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.639> when<00:04:13.629> I<00:04:13.659> start<00:04:13.989> applying

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
of the forest and when I start applying

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.060 
of the forest and when I start applying
darker<00:04:14.979> colors<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.930> might<00:04:17.260> be<00:04:17.769> quite

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
darker colors it might be quite

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.599 
darker colors it might be quite
interesting<00:04:19.169> so<00:04:20.169> this<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.680> what's<00:04:20.919> mulling<00:04:21.430> in

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
interesting so this is what's mulling in

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.370 
interesting so this is what's mulling in
the<00:04:21.820> surface<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.270> my<00:04:22.419> mind<00:04:22.659> on<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:22.960> surface<00:04:23.110> of

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
the surface of my mind on the surface of

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.990 
the surface of my mind on the surface of
my<00:04:23.530> mind<00:04:23.770> right<00:04:24.039> now<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.430> we'll<00:04:24.580> see<00:04:24.820> where

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
my mind right now and we'll see where

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.860 
my mind right now and we'll see where
that<00:04:25.180> takes<00:04:25.210> me<00:04:25.919> eventually<00:04:26.919> i'll<00:04:27.159> apply<00:04:27.870> more

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
that takes me eventually i'll apply more

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.700 
that takes me eventually i'll apply more
blues<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:29.650> more<00:04:29.800> green<00:04:30.159> to<00:04:30.639> give<00:04:30.820> it

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
blues and more green to give it

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.210 
blues and more green to give it
cooler<00:04:33.520> colors<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.300> it'll<00:04:34.690> be<00:04:34.740> more<00:04:35.740> balanced

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
cooler colors so it'll be more balanced

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.800 
cooler colors so it'll be more balanced
so<00:04:36.970> this<00:04:37.180> is<00:04:37.360> it<00:04:37.510> for<00:04:37.690> now<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:38.970> hope<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.390> enjoyed
