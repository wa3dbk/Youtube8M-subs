00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.170
 hello cooking fans I welcome you to one 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.580
 new episode of cooking harry today 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.970
 I want to believe with you bun 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.460
 do 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.630
 the exact recipe you will find as always 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.630
 down in the infobox 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.030
 the first step is the sea well 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.950
 through seven and then 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.720
 one and a half teaspoons of salt to add 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.720
 and then do it all well 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.400
 I have heated the water and now 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.500
 Let's get the butter into it 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.660
 I dissolve completely then we go the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.730
 cold milk added the whole may now 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.890
 just be lukewarm because the hedge 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.690
 bacteria die then we give that 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.690
 for this purpose and let this dissolve 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.090
 we then add the liquid ingredients 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.740
 the dry one 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.750
 then we take the electric 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.380
 hand mixer and knead it all together 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.380
 a smooth dough 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.430
 Of course, handmade is also here 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.110
 demanded so we knead the dough yet 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.070
 something with our hands through bite 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.070
 is very supple 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.909
 then we give a tea towel 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.100
 on the mixing bowl and leave the day 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.890
 in a warm place about 45 minutes 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.020
 After 45 minutes we take our 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.700
 day out of the mixing bowl then we knead 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.340
 Do it properly again and again 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.539
 Give them a long line 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.130
 then we can do this in new ones 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.130
 evenly divide large parts 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.790
 the individual pieces must now in the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.790
 hand to be formed bun 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.010
 in a pot I have water to cook 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.569
 brought now I enter the natron 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.090
 then gradually ours 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.090
 It's about 30 o'clock 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.500
 Bathing in the sodium hydroxide solution for a few seconds 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.090
 then we give it to a 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.090
 laid out baking paper wonders 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.000
 the buns are mixed with the salt 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.530
 sprinkled and then with a very 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.160
 sharp knife cruciform 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.160
 incised 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.090
 in the oven, the rolls must then at 180 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.090
 degrees upper and lower heat for 25 minutes 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.560
 to bake 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.549
 At the beginning I was really scared that 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.230
 I do not get the buns so 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.390
 like the baker but I have to tell you 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.560
 It is not a problem and it is 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.280
 really easy the bun 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.959
 imitate 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.819
 That's why I hope that you 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.110
 a video like because it's really 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.120
 easy to copy 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.680
 if so then just leave me 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.359
 a comment gives me a thumbs up 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.040

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.269
