 olive dupard new 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.030
 he 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.380
 during the intervention 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.130
 tastes 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.130
 no 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.700
 we 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.230
 as a professional and above all 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.730
 during high risk interventions 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.340
 as today we consider that 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.180
 the condition of the material is paramount 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.400
 extinguish a fire it is not 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.720
 necessarily a case of the fire 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.120
 companies that provide maintenance 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.850
 of public goods plays a role 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.320
 essential here is the company riffs 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.450
 well known in Ile de France who 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.620
 maintains the dry columns a 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.930
 dry column it is a metal tube 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.780
 with a tip outside ground 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.590
 floor and a mouthpiece on each floor 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.110
 so water can be propelled 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.300
 quickly to create these columns 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.010
 dry it must tap and thread and 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.720
 cut galvanized tubes that are 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.930
 then assembled is fixed in the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.930
 concrete 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.930
 once the installation is complete 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.450
 annual and five-year checks are 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.010
 necessary controls consists of 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.469
 check the condition of pipes and 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.750
 June the absence of apparent leakage and the 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:40.370
 lubrication of the faucet valve and 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.769
 town hall connection point made go 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.079
 further to check the tightness 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.030
 they created very specific trucks 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.340
 firefighter type technique that 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.349
 allow a pressure test at 25 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.349
 bars fast and without loss of water 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.500
 these trucks sound powerful and compact for 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.500
 city ​​traffic 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.000
 to facilitate maintenance cycles 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.250
 a dry column ryf has come up there 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.319
 ten years ago an innovative system 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.450
 indicating the latest operations of 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.159

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.470
 today taken everywhere in France 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.449
 maintenance and finally completed by a 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.370
