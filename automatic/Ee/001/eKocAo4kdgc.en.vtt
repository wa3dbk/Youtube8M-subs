second<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.510> put<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.689> rice<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:45.120> i<00:03:45.180> tend<00:03:45.359> to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
second and put the rice on so i tend to

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.839 
second and put the rice on so i tend to
just<00:03:45.599> chop<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.959> fish<00:03:46.170> up<00:03:46.379> into<00:03:47.069> fairly<00:03:47.280> you

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
just chop the fish up into fairly you

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.640 
just chop the fish up into fairly you
know<00:03:47.879> biggish<00:03:48.659> cubes<00:03:49.049> otherwise<00:03:49.439> it<00:03:49.620> just

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
know biggish cubes otherwise it just

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.160 
know biggish cubes otherwise it just
tends<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.069> disappear<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.049> add<00:03:52.139> that

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
tends to disappear so going to add that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.429 
tends to disappear so going to add that
into<00:03:52.439> the<00:03:52.560> Pierre<00:03:53.010> which<00:03:53.900> has<00:03:54.900> got<00:03:55.049> some<00:03:55.230> peas

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
into the Pierre which has got some peas

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.140

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
like that quite nice and they tend to

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.530 
like that quite nice and they tend to
just<00:03:59.459> sort<00:03:59.609> of<00:03:59.670> sit<00:03:59.909> there<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.120> give<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.299> bit<00:04:00.450> of

color diversity so Ted I'm just sort of

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.670 
color diversity so Ted I'm just sort of
spread<00:04:05.939> it<00:04:06.030> out<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.180> little<00:04:06.329> bit<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.260> put<00:04:07.530> the

what<00:04:17.789> together<00:04:18.090> anyway<00:04:18.680> but<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:19.769> tend<00:04:20.009> to<00:04:20.190> mix

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
what together anyway but I tend to mix

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
it up dry it tends to be just a little

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.420 
it up dry it tends to be just a little
easier<00:04:22.919> than<00:04:23.070> add<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.340> stock<00:04:25.310> now<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.340> just

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
easier than add the stock now I just

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.590 
easier than add the stock now I just
have<00:04:26.639> my<00:04:26.729> stock

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.140 

spread<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.560> out<00:04:34.650> there<00:04:34.920> I'm<00:04:35.730> going<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.880> give<00:04:36.060> it

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
spread it out there I'm going to give it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.200 
spread it out there I'm going to give it
a<00:04:36.210> good<00:04:36.330> stir<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:37.310> little<00:04:38.310> nice<00:04:38.550> for<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.880> sludge

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
a good stir a little nice for the sludge

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.070 
a good stir a little nice for the sludge
in<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.480> bottom<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:41.420> must<00:04:42.420> forgot<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.870> put<00:04:43.050> the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
in the bottom I must forgot to put the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.190 
in the bottom I must forgot to put the
chicken<00:04:43.470> in<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:44.970> just<00:04:45.270> cut<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:45.600> drumsticks

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
chicken in so I just cut the drumsticks

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.010 
chicken in so I just cut the drumsticks
down<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:47.280> pieces<00:04:47.700> like<00:04:47.850> that<00:04:47.880> don't<00:04:48.720> put<00:04:48.870> any

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
down to pieces like that don't put any

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.240 
down to pieces like that don't put any
smaller<00:04:49.290> because<00:04:49.440> they'll<00:04:49.620> just<00:04:49.770> disappear

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
smaller because they'll just disappear

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.920 
smaller because they'll just disappear
and<00:04:50.490> they<00:04:51.120> go<00:04:51.270> into<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.600> mix<00:04:51.780> as<00:04:51.930> well<00:04:53.930> before

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
and they go into the mix as well before

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.450 
and they go into the mix as well before
people<00:04:55.410> start<00:04:55.620> saying<00:04:55.830> why<00:04:56.130> are<00:04:56.160> you<00:04:56.280> putting

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
people start saying why are you putting

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.790 
people start saying why are you putting
chicken<00:04:56.760> in<00:04:57.000> with<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.210> seafood<00:04:57.420> pee<00:04:58.350> I've<00:04:58.680> had

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
chicken in with the seafood pee I've had

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.820 
chicken in with the seafood pee I've had
rabbit<00:04:59.190> in<00:04:59.340> with<00:04:59.730> seafood<00:05:00.270> before<00:05:01.140> in<00:05:01.470> Spain

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
rabbit in with seafood before in Spain

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.970 
rabbit in with seafood before in Spain
I've<00:05:02.160> had<00:05:02.490> all<00:05:02.700> sorts<00:05:03.120> mixed<00:05:03.600> in<00:05:03.720> there

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
I've had all sorts mixed in there

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.320 
I've had all sorts mixed in there
probably<00:05:04.980> a<00:05:05.070> few<00:05:05.490> other<00:05:05.640> things<00:05:05.730> as<00:05:06.120> well<00:05:06.150> but

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
probably a few other things as well but

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.600 
probably a few other things as well but
you<00:05:06.840> can<00:05:06.990> mix<00:05:07.140> it<00:05:07.320> it's<00:05:07.500> nice<00:05:07.680> chicken<00:05:08.430> tastes

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
you can mix it it's nice chicken tastes

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.470 
you can mix it it's nice chicken tastes
like<00:05:08.700> fish<00:05:08.970> anyway<00:05:10.940> so<00:05:11.940> I<00:05:11.970> tend<00:05:12.210> to<00:05:12.240> whack<00:05:12.450> it

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
like fish anyway so I tend to whack it

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.840 
like fish anyway so I tend to whack it
up<00:05:12.690> fully<00:05:13.050> it's<00:05:13.710> all<00:05:13.830> nice<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:14.280> sizzling<00:05:14.670> and

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
up fully it's all nice and sizzling and

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.580 
up fully it's all nice and sizzling and
then<00:05:14.940> I'll<00:05:15.030> turn<00:05:15.240> it<00:05:15.390> through<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:16.170> third<00:05:16.410> of<00:05:16.530> a

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
then I'll turn it through the third of a

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.610 
then I'll turn it through the third of a
turn<00:05:16.800> just<00:05:17.640> because<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.180> bars<00:05:19.050> which<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:19.500> can

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
turn just because the bars which you can

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.740 
turn just because the bars which you can
see<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:20.100> it'll<00:05:20.370> sort<00:05:20.700> of<00:05:20.820> try<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.600> get<00:05:21.720> a

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
see that it'll sort of try and get a

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.130 
see that it'll sort of try and get a
cross<00:05:21.990> type<00:05:22.230> thing<00:05:22.470> and<00:05:22.680> there<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:24.750> just<00:05:24.900> tends

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
cross type thing and there it just tends

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
cross type thing and there it just tends
to<00:05:25.260> take<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.410> little<00:05:25.560> while<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.830> heat<00:05:25.980> the<00:05:26.070> other

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
to take a little while to heat the other

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.700 
to take a little while to heat the other
bits<00:05:26.340> alternate<00:05:26.940> through<00:05:27.180> to<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:28.380> rest<00:05:28.590> of

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
bits alternate through to the rest of

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.310 
bits alternate through to the rest of
the<00:05:28.890> cold<00:05:29.550> areas<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.570> once<00:05:30.750> it's<00:05:30.900> bubbling<00:05:31.200> it

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
the cold areas and once it's bubbling it

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.210 
the cold areas and once it's bubbling it
really<00:05:31.530> goes<00:05:33.230> this<00:05:34.230> is<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.500> stage<00:05:34.710> I<00:05:34.920> liable

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
really goes this is the stage I liable

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.640 
really goes this is the stage I liable
it's<00:05:35.370> all<00:05:35.520> bottling<00:05:36.210> nice<00:05:36.420> and<00:05:36.690> evenly<00:05:36.960> so

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
it's all bottling nice and evenly so

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.180 
it's all bottling nice and evenly so
it's<00:05:37.770> been<00:05:37.890> going<00:05:38.130> about<00:05:38.480> 6-7<00:05:39.480> minutes<00:05:40.190> and

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
it's been going about 6-7 minutes and

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.830
