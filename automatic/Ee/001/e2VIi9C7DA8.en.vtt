rape still this variety called harper
and<00:00:10.309> we're<00:00:11.309> on<00:00:11.580> some<00:00:11.790> slightly<00:00:12.090> lighter<00:00:12.389> land

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
and we're on some slightly lighter land

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.390 
and we're on some slightly lighter land
now<00:00:12.929> we've<00:00:13.080> moved<00:00:13.110> off<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.530> heavy<00:00:13.860> liars<00:00:14.099> play

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
now we've moved off the heavy liars play

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.890 
now we've moved off the heavy liars play
we're<00:00:14.610> up<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.820> two<00:00:15.150> well<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.540> action<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
we're up on two well for action a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.400 
we're up on two well for action a
so<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.350> lot<00:00:16.859> thinner<00:00:17.160> soil<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.930> this<00:00:18.930> variety

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
so a lot thinner soil and this variety

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.580 
so a lot thinner soil and this variety
or<00:00:19.770> these<00:00:20.070> fields<00:00:20.520> are<00:00:21.289> following<00:00:22.289> spring

barley ourselves drawers chopped and it

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.330 
barley ourselves drawers chopped and it
was<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> really<00:00:24.930> thick<00:00:25.380> layer<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> straw<00:00:26.130> in

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
was a really thick layer of straw in

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.189 
was a really thick layer of straw in
there<00:00:26.519> i<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:27.359> hindsight<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.990> probably

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
there i think in hindsight we probably

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.980 
there i think in hindsight we probably
should<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.560> mail<00:00:28.970> that's<00:00:29.970> trough<00:00:30.449> in

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
should have mail that's trough in

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.069 
should have mail that's trough in

13<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.250> dense<00:00:36.210> matter<00:00:36.660> straw

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
13 is it was a really dense matter straw

to<00:00:37.079> these<00:00:37.290> plants<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.070> through<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.579> in

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
to these plants and to get through so in

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.060 
to these plants and to get through so in
a<00:00:39.180> way<00:00:39.300> thank<00:00:39.570> goodness<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.960> was<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> hybrid<00:00:40.320> as

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
a way thank goodness it was a hybrid as

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.530 
a way thank goodness it was a hybrid as
a<00:00:41.100> conventional<00:00:41.460> partner<00:00:42.059> don't<00:00:42.180> think<00:00:42.450> would

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
a conventional partner don't think would

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.850 
a conventional partner don't think would
have<00:00:42.629> had<00:00:42.750> figured<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.350> through<00:00:43.620> there

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
have had figured to get through there

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.080 
have had figured to get through there
but<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> result<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.329> got<00:00:45.719> some<00:00:46.070> some

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
but as a result we have got some some

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.600 
but as a result we have got some some
below<00:00:48.090> target<00:00:48.870> probably<00:00:49.440> plant<00:00:49.950> populations

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
below target probably plant populations

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.930 
below target probably plant populations
we<00:00:50.700> planted<00:00:51.149> 50<00:00:51.510> seeds<00:00:51.780> per<00:00:51.989> square<00:00:52.260> meter<00:00:52.940> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
we planted 50 seeds per square meter and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.069 
we planted 50 seeds per square meter and
we<00:00:54.239> probably<00:00:55.670> in<00:00:56.670> places<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> heaven

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
we probably in places on the heaven

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.799 
we probably in places on the heaven
they've<00:00:58.289> got<00:00:58.530> maybe<00:00:59.370> maybe<00:00:59.760> 20<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.660> would

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
they've got maybe maybe 20 or so would

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.139 
they've got maybe maybe 20 or so would
survive<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:02.100> probably<00:01:02.190> about<00:01:02.489> 10<00:01:02.820> short

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
survive so it's probably about 10 short

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.179 
survive so it's probably about 10 short
of<00:01:03.480> where<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.170> really<00:01:04.320> needs<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.159> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
of where it really needs to be and I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.770 
of where it really needs to be and I
think<00:01:05.400> that's<00:01:05.519> probably<00:01:05.670> had<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.210> bit<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.630> an

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
think that's probably had a bit of an

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.859 
think that's probably had a bit of an
impact<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.320> yield<00:01:08.180> I'm<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.420> going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.600> try

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
impact on yield I'm just going to try

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.600 
impact on yield I'm just going to try
and<00:01:09.900> pull<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.619> these<00:01:10.710> plants<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and pull up one of these plants and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
and pull up one of these plants and
what's<00:01:12.390> left<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> bit<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.409> stem<00:01:13.650> here

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
what's left in it a bit of a stem here

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.840 
what's left in it a bit of a stem here

caused it to to not reach as good as it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.429 
caused it to to not reach as good as it
should<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.909> done<00:01:36.150> pull<00:01:36.930> another<00:01:37.140> one<00:01:37.229> up

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
should have done pull another one up

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.719 
should have done pull another one up
here<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:42.299> that's<00:01:42.600> slightly<00:01:42.960> better<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
here and that's slightly better so it is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.399 
here and that's slightly better so it is
quite<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.180> quite<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.420> stony<00:01:45.720> bit<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.140> farm

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
quite it's quite a stony bit of the farm

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
there's a worm just weakling there as

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.020 
there's a worm just weakling there as
well<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.909> that's<00:02:03.360> always<00:02:03.600> good<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
well so that's always good to see and

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.499 
well so that's always good to see and
and<00:02:07.879> yeah<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> half<00:02:09.119> way<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.390> probably

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and yeah the half way is probably

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.910 
and yeah the half way is probably
yielding<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.259> little<00:02:10.560> bit<00:02:10.679> less<00:02:11.360> than<00:02:12.920> our

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
yielding a little bit less than our

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.559 
yielding a little bit less than our
average<00:02:14.129> although<00:02:15.030> we've<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.330> got<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
average although we've just got the

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.089 
average although we've just got the
headland<00:02:15.900> off<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.200> field<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.709> hopefully<00:02:17.069> by

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
headland off this field so hopefully by

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.520 
headland off this field so hopefully by
the<00:02:17.250> time<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:18.330> get<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.660> land<00:02:18.870> work<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.319> middle

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the time we get the land work the middle

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.580 
the time we get the land work the middle
of<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.709> field<00:02:19.890> harvested<00:02:21.290> it'll<00:02:22.290> be<00:02:22.379> back<00:02:22.560> up

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
of the field harvested it'll be back up

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.720 
of the field harvested it'll be back up
to<00:02:23.330> somewhere<00:02:24.330> like<00:02:24.390> our<00:02:24.690> average<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.700> a

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
to somewhere like our average so a

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.390 
to somewhere like our average so a
little<00:02:26.910> bit<00:02:27.060> disappointing<00:02:27.660> considering

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
little bit disappointing considering

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.630 
little bit disappointing considering
some<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.520> incentive<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.060> we<00:02:30.269> harvested

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
some of the incentive that we harvested

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.240 
some of the incentive that we harvested
down<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.879> heavy<00:02:33.060> land<00:02:33.920> now<00:02:34.920> I've<00:02:35.069> just

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
down on the heavy land now I've just

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.910 
down on the heavy land now I've just
brought<00:02:35.459> some<00:02:35.790> freaks<00:02:36.349> from<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.500> heavy<00:02:37.680> land

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
brought some freaks from the heavy land

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.500 
brought some freaks from the heavy land
here<00:02:38.250> which<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:40.370> picked<00:02:41.370> out<00:02:41.580> from<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.060> from

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
here which I picked out from the from

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.410 
here which I picked out from the from
one<00:02:42.629> of<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.750> fields<00:02:43.019> this<00:02:43.500> afternoon<00:02:44.330> just<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
one of the fields this afternoon just to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.690 
one of the fields this afternoon just to
give<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.690> an<00:02:45.810> idea<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.290> sort<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.370> some<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
give you an idea of sort of some of the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.860 
give you an idea of sort of some of the
routing<00:02:48.000> structures<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.540> we've<00:02:48.690> got<00:02:48.840> going

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
routing structures that we've got going

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.280 
routing structures that we've got going
on<00:02:49.140> there<00:02:50.000> unrestricted<00:02:51.000> routing<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.900> those

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
on there unrestricted routing on those

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.420 
on there unrestricted routing on those
bits<00:02:52.890> there<00:02:53.190> as<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:53.610> move<00:02:53.790> across<00:02:54.030> here<00:02:55.430> these

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
bits there as we move across here these

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.899 
bits there as we move across here these
ones<00:02:56.640> have<00:02:57.209> got<00:02:58.190> Posey<00:02:59.190> hit<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> slight<00:02:59.700> bit<00:02:59.879> of

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
ones have got Posey hit a slight bit of

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.170 
ones have got Posey hit a slight bit of
compaction<00:03:01.129> which<00:03:02.129> is<00:03:02.280> cause<00:03:02.459> those<00:03:02.700> roots<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
compaction which is cause those roots to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.910 
compaction which is cause those roots to
sort<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.420> splay<00:03:03.750> out<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.870> not<00:03:07.440> send<00:03:07.680> up

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
sort of splay out and and not send up

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.050 
sort of splay out and and not send up
rewrite<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.489> way<00:03:08.610> down<00:03:08.849> into<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.080> soil<00:03:10.260> so

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
rewrite the way down into the soil so

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.339 
rewrite the way down into the soil so
reckon<00:03:12.060> there's<00:03:12.180> about<00:03:12.360> twenty<00:03:12.780> percent<00:03:13.110> of

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
reckon there's about twenty percent of

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.270 
reckon there's about twenty percent of
the<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:14.220> sample<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.230> eight<00:03:16.230> out<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.560> 28<00:03:17.159> I

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
the of this sample and eight out of 28 I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.490 
the of this sample and eight out of 28 I
think<00:03:17.640> there<00:03:17.819> are<00:03:17.849> just<00:03:18.180> about<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:21.409> and<00:03:22.409> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
think there are just about that and the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.710 
think there are just about that and the
other<00:03:22.530> ones<00:03:22.830> are<00:03:22.920> absolutely<00:03:23.400> fine<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.239> bit

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
other ones are absolutely fine so a bit

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.110 
other ones are absolutely fine so a bit
of<00:03:24.959> rain<00:03:25.110> forecast<00:03:25.709> for<00:03:25.920> tomorrow<00:03:26.069> so<00:03:26.670> we're

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
of rain forecast for tomorrow so we're

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.000 
of rain forecast for tomorrow so we're
going<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.299> try<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.480> push<00:03:27.659> on<00:03:27.840> get<00:03:28.620> this<00:03:28.769> field

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
going to try and push on get this field

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.280 
going to try and push on get this field
finished<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.390> next<00:03:30.569> sort<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.810> hour<00:03:30.989> or<00:03:31.140> so

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
finished and the next sort of hour or so

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.059 
finished and the next sort of hour or so
tonight<00:03:31.909> and<00:03:32.909> then<00:03:33.420> we'll<00:03:33.629> see<00:03:33.920> what<00:03:34.920> tomorrow

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
tonight and then we'll see what tomorrow

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.009 
tonight and then we'll see what tomorrow
brings<00:03:35.310> us<00:03:35.790> whether<00:03:36.030> we're<00:03:36.269> we're<00:03:36.720> carrying

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
brings us whether we're we're carrying

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.660 
brings us whether we're we're carrying
on<00:03:37.230> or<00:03:37.409> whether<00:03:38.129> we're<00:03:38.310> going<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.549> have

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
on or whether we're going to have

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.660 
on or whether we're going to have
another<00:03:39.599> delay<00:03:39.959> for<00:03:40.379> rain<00:03:40.560> tune<00:03:41.459> in<00:03:41.580> tomorrow

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
another delay for rain tune in tomorrow

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.930 
another delay for rain tune in tomorrow
find<00:03:42.150> out<00:03:42.299> how<00:03:42.569> we<00:03:42.629> get<00:03:42.780> on
