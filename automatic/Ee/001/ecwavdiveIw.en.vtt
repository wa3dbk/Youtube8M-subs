00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 staff are again welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.549
 time felt news 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.040
 in my last video I talked about here 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.269
 a survey that concluded that people 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.670
 which have an indicator and ring ratio 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.980
 to undergo the greatest influence 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.199
 of testosterone during pregnancy and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.100
 this made them 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.240
 propensity to develop addiction to the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.099
 video game 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.080
 we already know from many 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.630
 investigations that the high amount 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.870
 of testosterone that the individual 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.840
 receiving during pregnancy ends up 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.140
 configuring the brain in a more 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.270
 masculine 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.800
 what are the consequences of a brain 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 more masculine 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.750
 The consequence is that you end up being a 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.090
 individual more systematically than 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.550
 empathetic for example would be the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.079
 most feature of the female brain 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.329
 I'll read here on the difference level 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.270
 essential that the work of taste is something 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.239
 which I even recommend that you admit 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.550
 which is a very interesting book but the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.159
 goalkeeper that the definition he puts 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.580
 for empathy and systematization in the page 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.340
 37 empathy consists of a tuning 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.740
 spontaneous and natural way of thinking 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.640
 feelings of others whatever 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 they are not just about reacting 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.680
 to a small number of emotions of someone 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.950
 like pain or sadness 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.650
 it is about feeling the emotional atmosphere 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.479
 that is installed and put without major 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.450
 effort in the other's place 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.180
 sensitive administration 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.200
 interaction that does not hurt or offend 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.840
 the feelings 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.570
 this definition of empathy now let 's 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.810
 definition of systematization that you 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.240
 on page 79 is the systematization 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.270
 impulse to understand and conscious and 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.670
 build a system the system that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.369
 I mean all that is governed by the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.240
 rules that specify the relationship between 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.149
 input data operation and result 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.229
 this definition includes machines 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.200
 physics 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.370
 logic music music military strategy 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.530
 climate navigation 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.250
 are horticulture and 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.099
 computers also includes systems with 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.830
 libraries economy companies taxonomy 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.739
 board games or sports 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.159
 the system may be very small with a 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.829
 cell or large animal with an animal or 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.750
 even more as a social group 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.250
 political system 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.110
 good and then you keep this 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.500
 differentiation between systematization 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.209
 empathy proposed by the body with a 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.980
 pleasant to contemplate another given that 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.560
 It will be part of this event for 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.510
 trace the gender gap in 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.879
 interest in video games 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.079
 some people had already demonstrated in part 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.660
 I'm putting them here in the 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.720
 description that men not only 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.480
 more interested in electronic games 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.159
 but also spend more time playing in 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.799
 comparison to women 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.810
 this on average, but the mechanism 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.180
 responsible for this difference has not 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.120
 It is very clear what leads me to 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.069
 conjecture that perhaps a possible 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.440
 explanation for this gender difference 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.130
 in the interest of video games 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.829
 would be precisely the difference between 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.859
 systematization and empathy for the fact 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.419
 men nor the vast majority of them are 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.669
 would be of such interest. 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.290
 higher by the electronic games 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:34.049
 so the hypothesis that I want to launch 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.859
 here at first it would be that people 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:41.069
 systems in your area 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:43.859
 men would have a greater interest in 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.599
 for video game games but game of 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.430
 video game is not a thing just the people 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.500
 knows that there are several genres 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.819
 there are different games that are 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.209
 more competitive and games that are more 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.949
 cooperative 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.739
 this may also imply a 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:01.879
 systematization in the 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.470
 interest of the game is more 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.780
 cooperative and competitive 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.359
 At first it seems logical to think that 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.120
 sympathetic people would tend to 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.030
 prefer more cooperative games 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.410
 while the most 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.660
 systematically tend to prefer the 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.889
 most competitive games 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.919
 in addition it has the question of the vice 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.150
 threw the document is said to be or 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.279
 what point in skates systematization 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.389
 influence the tendency of the individual to 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:36.460
 is developing an addiction on the issue is 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.460
 conquer the systematization 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.979
 relates to an addiction to video games and 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.770
 non-pathological interest in games 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.849
 both in general and in the genres 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.919
 specific 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.259
 so far beyond separating players 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.659
 by men and women 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.569
 this investigation would 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:59.020
 this difference of gender based on 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.520
 empathy and systematization, including 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.189
 would explain why there are so many 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.199
 women who like cindy videogame and 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.009
 so many men who do not like 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.810
 video game 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.810
 after all it's possible to be a woman 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.960
 predominantly systematic or a 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.729
 predominantly empathetic man and by 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.900
 they would be interested in the games of 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.849
 different way 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.379
 so if you are interested in researching 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.330
 about this contact me 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:25.210
 through the message message on the 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.669
 channel page on facebook her link 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.279
 is here in the video description hence the 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.270
 people talk better organize ideas 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:36.509
 assemble the project send the ethics committee 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.099
 performs search analyzes data 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.419
 public at time then discloses the 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.949
 results 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.930
 for that the staff this here was the 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.909
 the first psychological hypothesis that is a 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.919
 program with the objective of 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:50.620
 raise the hypothesis about some phenomenon 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:54.849
 and check the possibility of together with 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.039
 you put this hypothesis to the test. 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.500

 of this book on social networks 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.460
 Many thanks and until the next video 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.279
 here a team is news 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.469
 thanks, bed is not leaving yet I just think 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.509
 one more minute of your attention to speak 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.550
 about marketing as honey 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.620
 only there is no personal question to ask 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.210
 videos on youtube is not an easy task 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.069
 especially when it comes to 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.689
 scientific dissemination because people 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.219
 needs to be especially careful with 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.710
 sources to avoid falling into error 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.790
 to disclose the result 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.850
 What happened as recently as 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.160
 happened the question is that despite everything 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.570
 I am not sponsored by this work. 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.400
 no institution 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.800
 I know I have a website I still think 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.120
 allows people to donate more 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.400
 I'm not here to ask for donation. 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.320
 because I want to request that you

 Enjoy the team will feel news and have 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.240
 interest in evolutionary psychology 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.250
 by social neuroscience and by the study 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.760
 of human nature as a whole
