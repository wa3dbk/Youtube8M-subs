how quickly it shifted and how it was

complaint I hear a lot about this car is

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.460 
complaint I hear a lot about this car is
its<00:04:23.620> perceived<00:04:24.100> lack<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.940> low-end<00:04:25.420> torque<00:04:25.510> and

its perceived lack of low-end torque and

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.130 
its perceived lack of low-end torque and
I'll<00:04:26.590> admit<00:04:26.980> that<00:04:27.360> 295<00:04:28.360> pound-feet<00:04:28.870> is<00:04:29.110> a

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
I'll admit that 295 pound-feet is a

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.410 
I'll admit that 295 pound-feet is a
little<00:04:29.440> less<00:04:29.620> imposing<00:04:30.040> than<00:04:30.490> its<00:04:30.670> 414

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
horsepower but it just went so quickly

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.650 
horsepower but it just went so quickly
that<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.350> feel<00:04:35.950> like<00:04:36.160> anyone<00:04:36.760> complaining

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
that I feel like anyone complaining

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.770 

do<00:04:44.640> I<00:04:44.730> look<00:04:44.850> like<00:04:45.060> I'm<00:04:45.180> complaining<00:04:45.690> about

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
do I look like I'm complaining about

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.300 
do I look like I'm complaining about
torque<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:48.270> like<00:04:48.540> most<00:04:48.810> driving<00:04:49.560> enthusiasts

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
torque so like most driving enthusiasts

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.370 
torque so like most driving enthusiasts
I<00:04:50.460> prefer<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.850> traditional<00:04:51.420> manual<00:04:51.810> as<00:04:52.050> opposed

I prefer a traditional manual as opposed
to<00:04:52.500> these<00:04:52.710> automated<00:04:53.250> manuals<00:04:53.850> but<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.510> really

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
to these automated manuals but I really

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.350 
to these automated manuals but I really
can't<00:04:55.440> fault<00:04:55.860> helping<00:04:56.340> MW<00:04:56.760> is<00:04:56.850> put<00:04:57.060> this<00:04:57.180> one

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
can't fault helping MW is put this one

can't fault helping MW is put this one

shifts<00:05:03.480> that's<00:05:04.200> great<00:05:04.560> if<00:05:04.680> you've<00:05:04.830> ever<00:05:04.980> been

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
on a track because you know if you try

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
brace yourself against it is a lot

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.760

better<00:05:14.730> it<00:05:14.970> reduces<00:05:15.480> fatigue<00:05:15.660> you<00:05:16.470> can<00:05:16.650> get

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
better it reduces fatigue you can get

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.320 
better it reduces fatigue you can get
through<00:05:16.980> the<00:05:17.070> corner<00:05:17.400> quicker<00:05:17.670> and<00:05:17.970> get<00:05:18.150> on

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
through the corner quicker and get on

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.690 
through the corner quicker and get on
the<00:05:18.450> gas<00:05:18.630> sooner<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.290> don't<00:05:20.280> think<00:05:20.520> that<00:05:20.670> I

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
the gas sooner I don't think that I

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.310 
the gas sooner I don't think that I
would<00:05:20.850> opt<00:05:21.270> for<00:05:21.420> this<00:05:21.660> transmission

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
would opt for this transmission

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.660 
would opt for this transmission
personally<00:05:22.920> myself<00:05:23.490> because<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.450> adds<00:05:25.670> $2,900

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
personally myself because it adds $2,900

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.300 
personally myself because it adds $2,900
to<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.240> base<00:05:27.420> price<00:05:27.720> of<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.930> car<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:28.560> that

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
to the base price of the car and that

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.040 
to the base price of the car and that
really<00:05:29.520> doesn't<00:05:29.760> do<00:05:30.000> a<00:05:30.030> lot<00:05:30.150> for<00:05:30.300> my<00:05:30.600> budget

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
really doesn't do a lot for my budget

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.440 
really doesn't do a lot for my budget
I'd<00:05:31.500> probably<00:05:31.800> skip<00:05:32.280> it<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:32.670> put<00:05:33.090> that<00:05:33.210> money

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
I'd probably skip it and put that money

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.060 
I'd probably skip it and put that money
towards<00:05:34.050> all<00:05:34.200> the<00:05:34.320> gas<00:05:34.500> I'm<00:05:34.770> going<00:05:34.890> to<00:05:34.980> be

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
towards all the gas I'm going to be

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.240 
towards all the gas I'm going to be
burning

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
burning

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.090 
burning
so<00:05:38.000> this<00:05:38.300> car<00:05:38.540> sounds<00:05:38.870> so<00:05:39.290> good<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.770> I<00:05:39.800> think

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
so this car sounds so good that I think

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.770 
so this car sounds so good that I think
the<00:05:40.220> worst<00:05:40.490> thing<00:05:40.730> I<00:05:40.850> could<00:05:41.030> do<00:05:41.150> is<00:05:41.330> add<00:05:41.540> my
