00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello and new here in a 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.549
 new video a gray shark revolution 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.980
 this time I'm going to show you 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.440
 how to make money and 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.849
 diamonds very easily go all 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.219
 first of all it's not mandatory to have the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.650
 megalodon but hey I think it's more 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.039
 convenient 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.900
 so for now I have you 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.869
 ask to have the first 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 hat which had that gives gaulle + 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:39.300
 10% after the google on fungal necklace 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:42.899
 of chain that gives more 1% money and if 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:01:04.799
 possible the card for a year 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:01:07.200
 started then so here with the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.119
 card you will use to the frames 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.000
 and you will be able to see a little 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:23.869
 safe position right here we go the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.869
 see sub continent 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:46.100
 completely 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:48.770
 yes we are going to have a little treasure 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.540
 and that will give you the bonus of the day we 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.430
 going to have diamonds the money from 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.720
 money from german good it's not 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.780
 a lot but it can still 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.780
 help 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.450
 so after for the money it's not 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.420
 obligatory but it is preferable 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.860
 to have the megalodon I can go on 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.220
 the continents he has more life it is 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.220
 very convenient 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.520
 good then after with your hat with 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.530
 your hat and your collar ben it 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.110
 increases more than 15% the order of the blow 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.810
 should be simpler normally 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.040
 in their now let's get down I was 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.010
 I'm done with the money 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.680
 normally it should go after then 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.709
 let's go to the diamond which a thing a 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.780
 little bit more delicate by a diamond 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.070
 emerald pink earlier then the zebras 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.440
 you can unlock by doing actions 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.060
 special random mus shot I 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.420
 could not explain to you either it's 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.970
 explode helicopter boats or 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.220
 if not 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.530
 I advise you can have some 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:04.960
 fighter the blue giant crab it moves 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:06.010
 who is here looking for what marks the 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:16.690
 megalodon it looks like they 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:20.340
 want for example there I made a 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.340
 Special emphasis I have to unlock the 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.720
 sweat passage to eat wholesale how 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.290
 not a big moment 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.290
 Yes that's it 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.490
 the giant crab lair that is there he 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.500
 be aware that the giant crab more you 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.120
 beat rain will give you things but 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.890
 more fat have for example agent 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.650
 follows the blues that is to say that the 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:13.170
 red and green flats and he tries 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:19.290
 still to guarantee and not that I 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:21.320
 bats I already have this series it will not be 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.320
 wrong 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.160
 ok there it would be too daring to review the bottom 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.770
 since you do not want to put yourself too much 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.900
 in defensive position but normally 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.540
 and you do not know how much 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:10.300
 silver and about five diamonds 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:14.020
 that was the end of his little video or 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.880
 rather thank you for watching especially 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.890
 do not forget the gems where dropouts 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.890
 if you liked it
