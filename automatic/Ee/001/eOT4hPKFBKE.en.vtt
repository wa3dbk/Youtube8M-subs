comes down to this this part right here

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.569 
comes down to this this part right here
the<00:01:51.810> trigger<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.680> trigger<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.700> phenomenal

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.580 

so<00:01:59.579> you<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.210> guess<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.140> me<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so you know I guess you know for me the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.410 
so you know I guess you know for me the
most<00:02:01.740> besides<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.460> fact<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.299> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
most besides the fact that this this is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.569 
most besides the fact that this this is
a<00:02:03.450> one-of-a-kind<00:02:04.439> gun<00:02:04.920> right<00:02:05.159> there's<00:02:05.430> only

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
a one-of-a-kind gun right there's only

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.789 
a one-of-a-kind gun right there's only
one<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.969> these<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.329> world<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:07.049> it's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
one of these in the world this one it's

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.530 
one of these in the world this one it's
mine<00:02:08.629> the<00:02:09.629> advantage<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> custom<00:02:10.800> gun

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
mine the advantage for a custom gun

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.030 
mine the advantage for a custom gun
is<00:02:11.870> basically<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.739> kind<00:02:15.980> of

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
is basically that so and and the kind of

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.039 
is basically that so and and the kind of
trigger<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.519> can<00:02:16.700> get<00:02:16.879> out<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.329> you<00:02:17.900> can

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
trigger you can get out of it you can

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.250 
trigger you can get out of it you can
even<00:02:18.140> go<00:02:18.379> lighter<00:02:18.650> with<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.040> trigger

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
even go lighter with this trigger

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.390 
even go lighter with this trigger
there's<00:02:21.260> no<00:02:21.439> question<00:02:21.920> about<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.129> this

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
there's no question about it this

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
there's no question about it this
trigger<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:24.400> set<00:02:25.400> at<00:02:25.489> about<00:02:25.549> four<00:02:26.180> pounds

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
trigger is set at about four pounds

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.849 
trigger is set at about four pounds
because<00:02:27.349> i'm<00:02:27.439> going<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.620> use<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.829> for

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
because i'm going to use it for
