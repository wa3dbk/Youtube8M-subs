yes<00:01:47.520> he's<00:01:47.790> definitely<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> go<00:01:48.750> up<00:01:48.960> but

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
yes he's definitely going to go up but

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.600 
yes he's definitely going to go up but
with<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> card<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.970> his<00:01:51.380> versatility<00:01:52.610> there's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
with a card of his versatility there's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
with a card of his versatility there's
an<00:01:53.909> expectancy<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.630> Wizards<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
an expectancy that Wizards is going to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.740 
an expectancy that Wizards is going to
print<00:01:55.409> him<00:01:55.560> again<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:56.149> well<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> fact<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
print him again as well as the fact that

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.810 
print him again as well as the fact that
he's<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> rare<00:01:58.290> which<00:01:58.530> means<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.860> given<00:01:59.610> how

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
he's a rare which means that given how

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.060 
he's a rare which means that given how
popular<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.540> destroyed<00:02:00.840> was<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> lot<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> him

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
popular in destroyed was a lot of him

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.590 
popular in destroyed was a lot of him
was<00:02:02.250> opened

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
was opened

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.800 
was opened
and<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:04.140> means<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.610> market<00:02:06.000> itself<00:02:06.450> is

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and that means that the market itself is

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.249 
and that means that the market itself is
going<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.710> able<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.039> support<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.700> rare<00:02:09.390> for

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
going to be able to support a rare for

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.320 
going to be able to support a rare for
quite<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> while<00:02:10.950> before<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.550> starts<00:02:11.910> shooting

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
quite a while before it starts shooting

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.630 
quite a while before it starts shooting
through<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:12.989> roof<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.530> for<00:02:13.890> many<00:02:14.040> many<00:02:14.250> cards

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.610 
through the roof and for many many cards
even<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> coming<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.569> modern<00:02:15.930> many

even with the coming of modern many
cards<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.250> were<00:02:17.370> rare<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.239> is

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
cards that were rare is this is

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.110 
cards that were rare is this is
definitely<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> case<00:02:19.290> where<00:02:20.069> they<00:02:20.550> take<00:02:21.060> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
definitely the case where they take a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.400 
definitely the case where they take a
lot<00:02:21.480> longer<00:02:21.690> than<00:02:21.959> their<00:02:22.110> mythic

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
counterparts to rise in value and that's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.229 
counterparts to rise in value and that's
fine<00:02:25.220> he<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.520> also<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.959> card<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:30.120> the

fine he is also a card that that the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.600 
fine he is also a card that that the

foil is going to keep rising that's for
sure<00:03:00.600> but<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.230> regular<00:03:01.500> guy<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.890> could<00:03:02.100> see<00:03:02.370> him

rising<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.780> long<00:03:04.319> term<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.700> next<00:03:06.000> you

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
rising in the long term in the next you

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.850 
rising in the long term in the next you
know<00:03:06.330> six<00:03:06.569> months<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.989> year<00:03:07.019> especially<00:03:07.380> at

know six months to a year especially at

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.740 
know six months to a year especially at
the<00:03:07.950> S&amp;C<00:03:08.370> play<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.700> could<00:03:09.030> see<00:03:09.180> him<00:03:09.299> rising<00:03:09.660> up

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
the S&amp;C play I could see him rising up

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.840 
the S&amp;C play I could see him rising up
to<00:03:09.900> about<00:03:10.019> forty<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.860> fifty<00:03:11.130> dollars<00:03:11.459> but<00:03:11.700> he's

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
to about forty to fifty dollars but he's

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.319 
to about forty to fifty dollars but he's
been<00:03:12.090> kind<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:13.130> inflation<00:03:14.130> compressed<00:03:15.060> he's

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
been kind of inflation compressed he's

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.220 
been kind of inflation compressed he's
been<00:03:15.799> limited<00:03:16.799> in<00:03:16.980> growth<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:18.180> think<00:03:18.989> that

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
been limited in growth and I think that

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.420 
been limited in growth and I think that
this<00:03:19.380> gives<00:03:19.620> an<00:03:19.709> opportunity<00:03:19.739> for<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.280> lot<00:03:20.340> of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
this gives an opportunity for a lot of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.550 
this gives an opportunity for a lot of
people<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.910> get<00:03:21.180> their<00:03:21.480> snap<00:03:21.780> casters<00:03:22.290> while

able to use them in the future
especially<00:03:29.850> if<00:03:30.150> they<00:03:30.239> spike<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.780> two<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.799> the

especially if they spike and two is the

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.610 
especially if they spike and two is the
fact<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.310> he's<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.120> card<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.750> i<00:03:33.780> think<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.350> on

fact that he's a card that i think is on
par<00:03:34.920> with<00:03:35.220> most<00:03:36.150> other<00:03:36.590> multi-format

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.729 
par with most other multi-format
powerhouses<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.329> you<00:03:39.420> can't<00:03:39.840> undersell

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
powerhouses and so you can't undersell

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.680 
powerhouses and so you can't undersell
him<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.040> can't<00:03:41.280> treat<00:03:41.519> him<00:03:41.579> for<00:03:42.030> small<00:03:42.480> stuff

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
him you can't treat him for small stuff

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.170 
him you can't treat him for small stuff
he's<00:03:43.079> not<00:03:43.290> even<00:03:43.980> though<00:03:44.100> his<00:03:44.250> value<00:03:44.640> isn't<00:03:44.820> you

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
he's not even though his value isn't you

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.390 
he's not even though his value isn't you
know<00:03:45.239> pretend<00:03:45.900> probably<00:03:46.350> duel<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.799> worthy

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
know pretend probably duel and worthy

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.840 
know pretend probably duel and worthy
but<00:03:48.120> he's<00:03:48.810> at<00:03:49.410> least<00:03:49.590> not<00:03:49.769> yet<00:03:49.799> but<00:03:50.579> he<00:03:50.670> has<00:03:50.820> a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
but he's at least not yet but he has a

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.030 
but he's at least not yet but he has a
card<00:03:51.209> he's<00:03:51.480> still<00:03:51.810> one<00:03:52.079> that<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.320> think<00:03:52.620> has<00:03:52.829> a

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
card he's still one that I think has a

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.699 
card he's still one that I think has a
lot<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.310> room<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.640> grow<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.930> compression<00:03:55.590> on

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
lot of room to grow the compression on

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.190 
lot of room to grow the compression on
him<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.280> bit<00:03:56.700> befuddling<00:03:57.299> but<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.540> think<00:03:57.959> it's

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
him is a bit befuddling but I think it's

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.539 
him is a bit befuddling but I think it's
because<00:03:58.320> of<00:03:58.620> some<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:58.890> things<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.280> we

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
because of some of the things that we

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.670 
because of some of the things that we
mentioned<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.269> if<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.170> guys<00:04:01.350> had<00:04:01.530> further

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
mentioned and if you guys had further

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.470 
mentioned and if you guys had further
thoughts<00:04:01.980> about<00:04:02.100> why<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.340> think<00:04:02.819> his<00:04:03.060> price

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
thoughts about why you think his price

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.640 
thoughts about why you think his price
seems<00:04:04.079> pretty<00:04:04.590> darn<00:04:05.160> steady<00:04:05.519> if<00:04:05.790> not

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
seems pretty darn steady if not

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.349 
seems pretty darn steady if not
deteriorating<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.739> little<00:04:07.920> bit<00:04:08.069> then<00:04:08.790> I'd<00:04:09.180> love

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
deteriorating a little bit then I'd love

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.780 
deteriorating a little bit then I'd love
to<00:04:09.480> hear<00:04:09.660> those<00:04:09.780> down<00:04:10.140> below<00:04:10.170> again<00:04:10.790> I'm
