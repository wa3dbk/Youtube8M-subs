00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.870
 hello antonio 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.660
 and they stand out from their rival once before 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.480
 good first good night 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.060
 for us it was our first game 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.500
 of preparation therefore it was a test 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.660
 very demanding 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.190
 it has been difficult for us to adapt to the altitude 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.730
 those who was recovered before the 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.410
 efforts 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.059
 we have tried not to lose the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.350
 organization throughout the game not 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.000
 we have achieved more in the second 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.870
 time because there have been fewer losses 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.670
 in security phases we have gone 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.150
 adapting little by little to the rhythm of 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.910
 party and what it required the same 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.400
 and for us the fundamental thing was to give 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.630
 minutes improve the physical condition of 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.130
 the players and see what answer 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.020
 we had a much better team 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.090
 prepared that we more time of 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.420
 preparation logically I was going very 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.420
 Quick 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.239
 for highlighting something negative in us 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.360
 Well maybe the muscular discomfort of 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.170
 harman of our goalkeeper who is a 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.050
 setback that we hope will not be 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.480
 nothing important, something slight 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.820
 and above all, I remember solidarity 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.480
 effort of the whole group in front of a 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.420
 so demanding test 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.770
 and with respect to my rival what most 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.530
 striking is not a team very 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.299
 vertical 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.070
 he has good control of the game but on 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.320
 everything has very good acceleration of the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.270
 the last meters 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.170
 they were flying we could not fly 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.200
 as the independent players we 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.450
 it's hard to do individual fights and 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.850
 hold or sustain careers as 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.340
 they and I liked it is a team 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.590
 well organized with a good intention 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.899
 and a good soccer proposal and that 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.290
 I imagine that it will be to your liking 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.290
 fans 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.230
 d 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.230
 in the present meeting 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.290
 Y 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.450
 name 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.980
 why 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.360
 and we will sit down 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.260
 about this last one that says I do not have a 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.060
 exact or concrete information on how 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.760
 is the subject are is a theme that takes 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.249
 the leaders and in their interesting place 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.549
 but I would not know to tell you absolutely 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.549
 nothing else 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.030
 logically as a lover of good football 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.820
 he is a very talented player who 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.300
 participates well in the game circuits 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.070
 that has good capacity for the auction 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.650
 who finds goal the truth is that it is a 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.220
 player with a lot of fantasy and I help you I know 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.450
 that would fit perfectly in efe 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.220
 things that I like and another thing is that 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.620
 is within our possibilities and 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.020
 of our reach and the high question no 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.580
 there will be I do not remember who told me 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:13.000
 you exercise the percentage that we are 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:16.630
 logically we are very far away because 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.490
 still missing 89 additions by 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.740
 close the template we have to make a 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.560
 practically new equipment and we have 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.810
 had the bad luck that some of 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.850
 our additions have fallen 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.070
 injured they have had to return to 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.220
 Spain others are waiting there and 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.010
 well little by little we still have many 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.230
 dates to start the championship and 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.850
 We will have time and above all 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.390
 willingness to make an important team 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.390
 d 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.780
 Well, it 's a game that I admire is 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.880
 a player that I really like me 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.060
 I think that's going to be a very good 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.580
 example for 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.640
 to emulate to copy for all 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.230
 children from Spain and from any part of the 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.919
 world a boy who respects the values 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.049
 of the education of fair play and that 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.600
 if you add that your player with 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.610
 a lot of fantasy with a lot of creativity that 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.910
 has made a superb world and I think 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.380
 that I think that comes to a stage on 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.330
 Real Madrid and Spanish football that 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.610
 will allow to grow and progress more 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.710
 as a footballer I think it's very good 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.270
 news for football in general and 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.190
 particularly for fans 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.680
 Spanish that what we will be able to 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.210
 enjoy and in some case like us 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.580
 well we do not have to suffer it but 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.870
 I think it's good news for the 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.529
 Spanish football the arrival of leaving 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.470
 rodrÃ­guez 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:55.470
 but the rest 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.470
 ah 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.690
 Colombia 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.690
 Y 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.720
 and all this situation 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.740
 well I think it will stabilize inside 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.420
 of the great few of a few years the 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.030
 economic crisis of a country is this is 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.940
 what makes the difference is evident 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.500
 There is a crisis because there is a difference 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.750
 then it is logical that the teams 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:30.070
 large ones that have more capacity to 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.500
 receive sponsorships and so on 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.780
 etc. resists the crisis much better 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.730
 and it has many more possibilities I think 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.320
 that will stabilize well could we 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.540
 say that more the president of icadep 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.430
 come from that I do not think that face 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.860
 In the future, that will normalize a 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.470
 little more than no issues now 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.820
 television marketing etc so that 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.700
 the Spanish area remains so 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.010
 competed as it is it is very important that 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.420
 in the football landscape that we have 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.810
 teams like madrid and barcelona 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.390
 tico vice that are there in the most 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.820
 high because in the end a 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.500
 attraction effect for players 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.730
 not only for that to continue possible also 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.380
 for other Spanish teams not 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.380
 although this is going to take time 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.670
 in front of the good cali first we will do 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.850
 about stories to see how they are after 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.290
 of the battle and players I think that 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:27.230
 I insist except the goalkeeper there is no 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:30.200
 no player hurt and try to 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.850
 to grow something more football is 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.110
 possible that if we are not very fatigued 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.000
 and we have good capable of recovery 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.130
 lower altitudes I think we 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.780
 we will adapt better and I think that the 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.280
 team must have to grow and over 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.860
 everything then we will try to make a 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.720
 football proposal that will take us to 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.350
 win and that people enjoy with 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.350
 above all win 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.590
 Thank you
