now when you're using a natural stone
the<00:00:41.160> surfaces<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.820> stone<00:00:42.120> maybe<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:43.110> grit<00:00:43.410> as

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the surfaces of stone maybe one grit as

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.709 
the surfaces of stone maybe one grit as
you<00:00:44.219> use<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.579> stone<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.329> your<00:00:45.480> stone

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
you use your stone and as your stone

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.310 
you use your stone and as your stone
wears<00:00:46.020> down<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.559> grit<00:00:47.160> may<00:00:47.370> change<00:00:48.320> another

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
wears down the grit may change another

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.950 
wears down the grit may change another
thing<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.059> there<00:00:51.059> may<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.239> layers<00:00:51.660> with

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
thing is that there may be layers with

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080 
thing is that there may be layers with
pebbles<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:52.620> slight<00:00:52.980> cracks<00:00:53.340> within<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
pebbles or slight cracks within the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.810 
pebbles or slight cracks within the
stone<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.469> stone<00:00:55.739> wears<00:00:56.010> down<00:00:56.309> these

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
stone so as your stone wears down these

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
stone so as your stone wears down these
cracks<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.449> pebbles<00:00:57.750> might<00:00:57.930> start<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
cracks and pebbles might start to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.680 
cracks and pebbles might start to
surface<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.010> cause<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.910> stones<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.390> work

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
surface and cause your stones not work

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.560 
surface and cause your stones not work
properly<00:01:01.730> problem<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.850> there's<00:01:03.120> no<00:01:03.270> way<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
properly problem is there's no way of

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.630 
properly problem is there's no way of
telling<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.439> state<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
telling in the state you have to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.399 
telling in the state you have to
purchase<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> stone<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.540> go<00:01:06.689> ahead<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.020> use<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
purchase a stone and go ahead and use it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.590 
purchase a stone and go ahead and use it
so<00:01:07.830> purchasing<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.400> natural<00:01:08.729> stone<00:01:08.909> may<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
so purchasing a natural stone may be a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.800 
so purchasing a natural stone may be a
little<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.200> gamble<00:01:10.880> our<00:01:11.880> sharpener<00:01:12.600> at

stone it is recommended that you use
these<00:01:47.790> Nagar<00:01:48.450> stones<00:01:48.840> due<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> fact<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
these Nagar stones due to the fact that

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.010 
these Nagar stones due to the fact that
most<00:01:50.490> natural<00:01:50.939> stones<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> hard<00:01:51.810> time

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
most natural stones have a hard time

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.770 
most natural stones have a hard time
getting<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.710> mud<00:01:52.950> sediment<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.610> sharpen<00:01:53.970> you

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
harmful to the stone itself make sure

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.880 
harmful to the stone itself make sure
that<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:27.580> dry<00:02:28.540> them<00:02:28.690> very<00:02:28.960> well<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.380> then

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
store them make sure they're dry just

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.020
