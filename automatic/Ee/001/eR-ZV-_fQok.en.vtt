observe nothing will happen to the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.720 
observe nothing will happen to the
pepper<00:00:56.640> present<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:57.450> bowl<00:00:57.740> now<00:00:58.740> put<00:00:59.580> some

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
pepper present in the bowl now put some

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.880 
pepper present in the bowl now put some
liquid<00:00:59.970> dishwasher<00:01:00.690> gel<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.080> your<00:01:01.350> finger<00:01:01.710> and

dip<00:01:02.490> that<00:01:02.520> finger<00:01:03.120> into<00:01:03.450> the<00:01:03.930> bowl

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.319 

you'll<00:01:08.799> notice<00:01:09.009> that<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.400> pepper<00:01:09.610> which<00:01:10.149> is

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
you'll notice that the pepper which is

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.749 
you'll notice that the pepper which is
sprinkled<00:01:10.780> over<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:11.140> water<00:01:11.439> moves<00:01:12.250> away<00:01:12.520> from

sprinkled over the water moves away from
the<00:01:13.210> finger<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.780> rushes<00:01:14.350> back<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.100> outer

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
the finger and rushes back to the outer

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.130 
the finger and rushes back to the outer
edge<00:01:15.579> of<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.880> bowl

explanation the pepper floats on top of

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.389 
explanation the pepper floats on top of
the<00:01:22.600> water<00:01:22.750> due<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.500> surface<00:01:23.740> tension<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.340> the

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
the water due to surface tension of the

water the surface tension pulls the top

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.160 
water the surface tension pulls the top
of<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.219> water<00:01:27.399> together<00:01:27.729> like<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.240> skin<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.079> the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
of the water together like a skin so the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.039 
of the water together like a skin so the
water<00:01:29.380> bulges<00:01:29.860> up<00:01:30.009> a<00:01:30.100> bit<00:01:30.479> surface<00:01:31.479> tension<00:01:31.899> is

water bulges up a bit surface tension is

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.020 
water bulges up a bit surface tension is
the<00:01:32.319> result<00:01:32.679> of<00:01:32.829> a<00:01:33.039> strong<00:01:33.369> attraction

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
the result of a strong attraction

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.139 
the result of a strong attraction
between<00:01:34.210> molecules<00:01:34.960> in<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.319> liquid<00:01:35.759> water<00:01:36.759> has

between molecules in a liquid water has
an<00:01:37.360> unusually<00:01:38.020> high<00:01:38.229> surface<00:01:38.709> tension

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
an unusually high surface tension

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.699 
an unusually high surface tension
compared<00:01:39.819> with<00:01:39.909> most<00:01:40.209> other<00:01:40.509> liquids<00:01:41.020> because

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
compared with most other liquids because

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.039 
compared with most other liquids because
water<00:01:42.490> molecules<00:01:42.610> are<00:01:43.299> very<00:01:43.569> strongly

this<00:01:46.209> strong<00:01:46.539> attraction<00:01:46.929> allows<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.890> water

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
this strong attraction allows the water

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.520 
this strong attraction allows the water
to<00:01:48.219> bulge<00:01:48.640> up<00:01:48.909> a<00:01:49.030> bit<00:01:49.209> and<00:01:49.390> make<00:01:49.689> some<00:01:49.719> insects

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
to bulge up a bit and make some insects

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.339 
to bulge up a bit and make some insects
