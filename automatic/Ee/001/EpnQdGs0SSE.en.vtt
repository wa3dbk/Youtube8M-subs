the school put a functionality in the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.440 
the school put a functionality in the
laptop<00:00:52.400> so<00:00:52.970> that<00:00:53.739> they<00:00:54.739> could<00:00:55.149> turn<00:00:56.149> it<00:00:56.329> on

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
laptop so that they could turn it on

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.260 
laptop so that they could turn it on
without<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.350> students<00:00:57.710> knowledge<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.340> take

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
without the students knowledge and take

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.840 
without the students knowledge and take
pictures<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:02.260> basically<00:01:03.260> I<00:01:03.790> mean<00:01:04.790> the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
pictures and basically I mean the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.219 
pictures and basically I mean the
webcams<00:01:05.269> on<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:05.630> I<00:01:05.659> suppose<00:01:05.960> they<00:01:06.079> could

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
webcams on so I suppose they could

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.289 
webcams on so I suppose they could
record<00:01:06.499> as<00:01:06.710> well<00:01:06.859> what<00:01:07.759> you're<00:01:07.880> doing<00:01:08.119> in<00:01:08.210> your
