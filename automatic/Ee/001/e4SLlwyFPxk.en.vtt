00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.510
 now it can start with 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.630
 mummy have cleared battery back 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:25.380
 We had markers attached here 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:25.380
 because it's supposed to be on the lid here 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.820
 beautiful a true-to-measure has one 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.070
 a lot of effort was made that 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.390
 make 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:48.670
 so content should be missing so now 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:55.539
 still aligned only mediocre 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:58.200
 was with iron furniture that on me 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:02.820
 again with the hammer 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.820
 stay warm again 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.219
 Now I have recently with someone 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:23.600
 yes restored 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:28.630
 seen a trick how to do that by me 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.630
 it can do that for yourself 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.770
 Let's try it out the same way 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.770
 always see 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.789
 wonderful 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:46.270
 who did it but that already 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.270
 Know what you are buying as 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:13.120
 a little bit with that I do not have one 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.120
 mega hammer suddenly 1 homeserver 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.060
 produced moderate a bit because 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.060
 should be nice 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:43.950
 then I could still have something light 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:46.410
 section by section I leave that 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.990
 had a bit of a time now 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.990
 bit cool down and then will 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.990
 ironed 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.810
 has a nice dark is beautiful person 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.590
 So it was a very good grip 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.100
 on him 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:56.410
 I have a part of it now 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:06:01.540
 which I have prepared with the two 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.540
 still the inner surface is the same 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:10.880
 also the inner surface but I guess 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:13.970
 from the basic principle for the first time yes see that 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.270
 I do not think so well now 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.570
 it worked that would be me 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:24.970
 but still need to work after 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.970
 I'll get that ok
