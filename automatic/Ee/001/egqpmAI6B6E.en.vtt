00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
will go okay so we've got all three of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.480 
will go okay so we've got all three of
these<00:01:17.670> guys<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.330> now<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.750> same<00:01:18.990> photo<00:01:22.490> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
these guys here now it's same photo and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.460 
these guys here now it's same photo and
this<00:01:24.060> isn't<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.840> great<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.259> an

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this isn't really that great of an

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.690 
this isn't really that great of an
example<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.040> they're<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> same

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
example because they're not the same

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.039 
example because they're not the same
picture<00:01:27.060> they're<00:01:27.270> obviously<00:01:27.630> taking<00:01:27.930> with

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
picture they're obviously taking with

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.350 
picture they're obviously taking with
different<00:01:28.350> cameras<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.070> how<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.119> know

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
different cameras and so how do you know

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.770 
different cameras and so how do you know
you<00:01:31.320> can't<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:31.619> compare<00:01:32.570> exposure<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
you can't really compare exposure and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.620 
you can't really compare exposure and
stuff<00:01:33.960> cuz<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.259> gonna<00:01:34.350> look<00:01:34.560> different<00:01:35.630> I've

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
stuff cuz it's gonna look different I've

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.880 
stuff cuz it's gonna look different I've
been<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:37.020> impressed<00:01:37.380> actually<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
been really impressed actually with the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.380 
been really impressed actually with the
camera<00:01:38.159> quality<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> Xperia<00:01:39.030> Z<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.210> think

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
camera quality on the Xperia Z I think

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.950 
camera quality on the Xperia Z I think
it's<00:01:39.479> actually<00:01:39.720> quite<00:01:39.840> good<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.899> know

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
it's actually quite good this you know

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.300 
it's actually quite good this you know
just<00:01:43.110> looking<00:01:43.320> at<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.470> three<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.130> go

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
just looking at these three if we go

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.789 
just looking at these three if we go
here<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.600> look<00:01:45.750> at<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> exposure<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.560> this

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
here and look at the exposure on this

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.870 
here and look at the exposure on this
guy<00:01:48.380> compared<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> other<00:01:49.680> three<00:01:49.979> they're

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
guy compared to the other three they're

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.130 
guy compared to the other three they're
they're<00:01:51.210> pretty<00:01:51.240> close<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.840> mean<00:01:51.990> they're

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
they're pretty close I mean they're

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.539 
they're pretty close I mean they're
they're<00:01:52.439> kind<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> same<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.490> know

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
this is the One X looks probably the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.590 
this is the One X looks probably the
worst<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> bunch<00:01:55.939> in<00:01:56.939> terms<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.360> noise

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
worst of the bunch in terms of the noise

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.190 
worst of the bunch in terms of the noise
in<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.500> photo<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.540> the<00:02:00.540> sharpness<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.140> the

now<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:07.350> look<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.770> we'll<00:02:08.369> keep<00:02:08.520> this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
now and then look at we'll keep this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.130 
now and then look at we'll keep this
here<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:09.360> we'll<00:02:09.479> go<00:02:09.599> back<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.840> we'll

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
here and then we'll go back and we'll

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.360 
here and then we'll go back and we'll
turn<00:02:10.319> off<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
turn off the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.520 
turn off the
we'll<00:02:12.360> actually<00:02:12.450> turn<00:02:12.810> off<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.230> braava

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
we'll actually turn off the braava

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.110 
we'll actually turn off the braava
engine<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.069> see<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.519> looks<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:14.819> you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
engine and see what that looks like you

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.690 
engine and see what that looks like you
can<00:02:15.239> actually<00:02:15.420> tell<00:02:16.190> when<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.280> do<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.549> you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
can actually tell when you do that you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.839 
can actually tell when you do that you
can<00:02:17.849> see<00:02:18.150> how<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:20.040> Bravia<00:02:20.430> Engine<00:02:20.489> actually

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
can see how the Bravia Engine actually

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.180 
can see how the Bravia Engine actually
changes<00:02:21.659> how<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.989> photos<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.620> videos<00:02:22.890> look

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
changes how the photos and videos look

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.250 
changes how the photos and videos look
in<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.209> gallery<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:27.150> if<00:02:27.239> we<00:02:27.330> open<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.629> up<00:02:27.870> you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
in the gallery so if we open that up you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.300 
in the gallery so if we open that up you
can<00:02:28.290> actually<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:28.650> quite<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> bit<00:02:29.220> of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
can actually see quite a bit of

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.000 
can actually see quite a bit of
difference<00:02:29.610> here<00:02:30.049> not<00:02:31.049> as<00:02:31.170> contrasting<00:02:31.830> not

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
difference here not as contrasting not

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.030 
difference here not as contrasting not
as<00:02:32.129> much<00:02:32.280> color<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.959> pushes<00:02:34.200> makes<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.739> look

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
as much color so it pushes makes it look

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.729 
as much color so it pushes makes it look
more<00:02:35.310> along<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> lines<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.299> One<00:02:36.480> X<00:02:36.739> and

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
more along the lines of the One X and

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.080 
more along the lines of the One X and
the<00:02:37.860> iPhone<00:02:38.160> 5<00:02:38.340> when<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.579> have<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.849> broad

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the iPhone 5 when you have that broad

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.789 
the iPhone 5 when you have that broad
engine<00:02:39.540> turn<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.079> can<00:02:40.200> actually<00:02:40.349> see

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
engine turn on and you can actually see

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.089 
engine turn on and you can actually see
it<00:02:40.920> load<00:02:41.720> as<00:02:42.720> well<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.650> click<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:44.069> a

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099

photo<00:02:44.400> from<00:02:44.670> today<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.269> then<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.200> brings<00:02:46.349> it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
photo from today and then it brings it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.589 
photo from today and then it brings it
up<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.400> don't<00:02:47.519> see<00:02:47.760> any<00:02:47.879> change<00:02:47.910> right<00:02:48.540> it

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.809 
up and you don't see any change right it
just<00:02:48.750> kind<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.930> looks<00:02:49.140> static<00:02:49.799> if<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.430> go<00:02:50.579> back

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
just kind of looks static if I go back

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.390 
just kind of looks static if I go back
now<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:52.379> load<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.920> bravia<00:02:53.250> engine

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
now and then load the bravia engine

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.880 
now and then load the bravia engine
settings<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.790> then<00:02:56.970> go<00:02:57.120> back<00:02:57.359> to<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.660> gallery

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.160 
settings and then go back to the gallery
you<00:02:58.890> can<00:02:58.920> actually<00:02:59.160> see<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.450> bravia<00:03:00.840> engine

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
you can actually see the bravia engine

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.140 
you can actually see the bravia engine
load<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.709> pictures<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:02.280> if<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.430> go<00:03:02.609> it's

can see it boom it loads right there you
get<00:03:09.390> nice<00:03:09.599> color<00:03:09.959> nice<00:03:10.200> contrast<00:03:10.819> nice<00:03:11.819> nicely

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
little bit of a lag there which is kind

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.080 
little bit of a lag there which is kind
of<00:03:24.569> annoying<00:03:24.780> but<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:26.069> does<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.579> does<00:03:26.790> improve

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
of annoying but it does it does improve

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.509 
of annoying but it does it does improve
the<00:03:27.389> overall<00:03:27.419> color<00:03:27.989> saturation<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.099> picture

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
the overall color saturation and picture

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
quality inside the gallery app now if

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.009 
quality inside the gallery app now if
you've<00:03:31.799> seen<00:03:31.829> my<00:03:32.069> other<00:03:32.099> videos<00:03:32.639> if<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.780> talk

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
you've seen my other videos if I talk

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.509 
you've seen my other videos if I talk
about<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.500> complaining<00:03:35.099> a<00:03:35.160> bit<00:03:35.280> about<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
about the complaining a bit about the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.240 
about the complaining a bit about the
screen<00:03:36.260> unfortunately<00:03:37.260> Sony<00:03:37.739> didn't<00:03:38.010> apply

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
screen unfortunately Sony didn't apply

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.129 
screen unfortunately Sony didn't apply
that<00:03:38.459> same<00:03:38.700> tactic<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.419> their<00:03:39.630> home<00:03:39.810> screen<00:03:40.049> or

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
that same tactic to their home screen or

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.050 
that same tactic to their home screen or
to<00:03:40.500> their<00:03:40.709> built-in<00:03:40.950> apps<00:03:41.340> or<00:03:41.609> any<00:03:41.790> other<00:03:41.880> apps

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
to their built-in apps or any other apps

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.750 
to their built-in apps or any other apps
and<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.599> you<00:03:43.200> don't<00:03:43.410> get<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:44.280> nice<00:03:44.519> color

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
and so you don't get that nice color

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.460 
and so you don't get that nice color
saturation<00:03:45.299> in<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:45.690> nice<00:03:45.840> contrast<00:03:46.380> with

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
saturation in that nice contrast with

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.949 
saturation in that nice contrast with
the<00:03:46.739> regular<00:03:47.130> screen<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.910> screen<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.569> my

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
the regular screen so the screen in my

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.140 
the regular screen so the screen in my
opinion<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.919> lacking<00:03:50.310> when<00:03:50.639> you<00:03:50.730> compare<00:03:51.060> it

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
opinion is lacking when you compare it

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.610 
opinion is lacking when you compare it
to<00:03:51.239> some<00:03:51.359> of<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.540> other<00:03:51.660> market<00:03:52.049> leaders<00:03:52.349> like

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
to some of the other market leaders like

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.770 
to some of the other market leaders like
the<00:03:53.130> HTC<00:03:53.519> One<00:03:53.700> X<00:03:53.849> or<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.090> iPhone<00:03:54.239> 5<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.629> think

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
the HTC One X or the iPhone 5 I think

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.420 
the HTC One X or the iPhone 5 I think
Sony<00:03:55.200> should<00:03:55.319> have<00:03:55.680> applied<00:03:55.919> that<00:03:56.220> same

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
Sony should have applied that same

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.009 
Sony should have applied that same
concept<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:57.000> their<00:03:57.239> home<00:03:57.389> screen<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.840> made
