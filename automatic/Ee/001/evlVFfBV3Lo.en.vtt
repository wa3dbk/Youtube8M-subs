00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
driver really very unsafe at that time

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
driver really very unsafe at that time
and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.559> concentration<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.610> getting

if<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.539> couple<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.899> hours<00:00:52.079> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
if they are in a couple of hours it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.970 
if they are in a couple of hours it
makes<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.399> driver<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.379> tunnel<00:00:55.379> thinking

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
makes that driver have tunnel thinking
