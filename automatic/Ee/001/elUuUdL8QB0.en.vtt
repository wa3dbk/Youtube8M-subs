00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.560
 hello people my name is lena flock me 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.260
 I'm currently on the fibo 2015 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.530
 I am 24 years old personal trainer 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.420
 I've been in business for two years now 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.620
 many people just ask me how are you 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.330
 It managed to build such a body 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.280
 and the most important tip I give you 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.530
 can give is just healthy 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.740
 balanced to feed and hard to eat 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.740
 work out 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.460
 So I train in the day I have to 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.200
 honestly admit two hours 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.399
 which is not optimal so you should 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.649
 actually not more than one and a half 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.879
 train for hours 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.440
 but unfortunately I can not do it because of me 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.059
 everything has to go through and my program 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.260
 in any case must complete because of it 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.699
 can it happen to me that me 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.110
 two hours but trains everyone 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.790
 beginner I would not recommend 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.480
 longer than one to at most one and a half 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.480
 to train for hours 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.329
 So I have to be honest now 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.699
 I do cardio training 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.870
 less so I walk less I walk 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.149
 I do not have much stepper 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.649
 now a diet made a lot but im 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.420
 normal case that makes less I am 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.420
 rather the type of the weights moves 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.759
 So that's how you always say it's so beautiful 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.560
 is a very ungrateful sport so 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.420
 once you have two to three to four weeks 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.590
 you do not notice anymore 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.780
 muscles become flatter 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.780
 The point is demonstrated regularly 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.250
 you have such a point effect too 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.869
 You have to note that it's the body 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.700
 so if you have a lot, you will notice 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.869
 you have built muscles as well 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.030
 actually do not be afraid that the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.260
 completely disappear or if you again 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.180
 to train first 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.680
 so that his body remembers 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.390
 And you will definitely be faster 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.390
 expand as where you started 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.650
 So I have to say that honestly 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.850
 I'm less interested in that 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.619
 always ask me you are only training 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.690
 because of the girls or because of the tournament 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.070
 just for me i have to say but one 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.450
 good side effect, it is already as at 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.460
 The women are very well received 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.540
 although many may say no 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.880
 that 's not my thing 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.650
 it 's not my thing but most 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.740
 I have to be honest with women 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.740
 say 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.200
 So my personal fitness 2015 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.420
 is definitely the natural 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.819
 bodybuilding scene it is always more in the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.230
 that people are fine 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.330
 Nurture balanced feed healthy 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.340
 eat less meat vegan 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.840
 more and more must come in all natural 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.819
 that's not illegal 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.170
 substances to fish more in front as the 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.670
 A few years ago, that was the case 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.890
 they mostly did not spend 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.610
 I think nature sports is this 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.610
 year arise correctly
