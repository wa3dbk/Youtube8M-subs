he's okay and i think that the reason
why<00:03:59.729> they<00:03:59.879> reported<00:04:00.389> his<00:04:00.540> critical<00:04:00.930> condition

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
why they reported his critical condition

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:02.990 
why they reported his critical condition
is<00:04:01.500> because<00:04:01.889> this<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.489> what<00:04:02.639> our<00:04:02.669> buddy<00:04:02.909> ken

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
is because this is what our buddy ken

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.089 
is because this is what our buddy ken
nap<00:04:03.299> sock<00:04:03.510> told<00:04:03.750> me<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.109> because<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.889> it's

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
nap sock told me is that because if it's

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.099 
nap sock told me is that because if it's
a<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.579> damage<00:04:05.939> to<00:04:06.090> your<00:04:06.209> head<00:04:06.449> then<00:04:06.930> it

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
a if it's damage to your head then it

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.469 
a if it's damage to your head then it
counts<00:04:07.319> as<00:04:07.560> critical<00:04:08.069> initially<00:04:08.400> before<00:04:09.150> you

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
counts as critical initially before you

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.960 
counts as critical initially before you
become<00:04:09.840> what<00:04:10.470> downgraded<00:04:11.220> or<00:04:11.310> upgraded<00:04:11.849> to

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
become what downgraded or upgraded to

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.819 
become what downgraded or upgraded to
stable<00:04:12.030> condition<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:12.989> i<00:04:13.169> think<00:04:13.409> that's<00:04:13.590> why

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
stable condition so i think that's why

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.499 
stable condition so i think that's why
it<00:04:13.889> was<00:04:13.979> critical<00:04:14.220> initially<00:04:14.609> but<00:04:14.970> still<00:04:15.209> the

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
it was critical initially but still the

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.420 
it was critical initially but still the
fact<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.810> he<00:04:15.900> walked<00:04:16.229> away<00:04:16.409> and<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.190> fact

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159

that<00:05:00.000> would<00:05:00.150> be<00:05:00.240> hanging<00:05:00.449> over<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.960> Star<00:05:01.199> Wars

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319
