working for I fix it they know how to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.060 
working for I fix it they know how to
bust<00:00:39.750> open<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.170> Mac<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.500> get<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.890> stuff

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
bust open a Mac can get all this stuff

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.190 
bust open a Mac can get all this stuff
out<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.520> play<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> RAM<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.989> put<00:00:43.170> new

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
out and play with the RAM and put new

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.440 
out and play with the RAM and put new
this<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.280> sure<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.149> heck<00:00:45.300> don't

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
this and that in I sure as heck don't

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.670 
this and that in I sure as heck don't
really<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> mess<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.289> stuff<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.620> that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
really want a mess and stuff like that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.180 
really want a mess and stuff like that
so<00:00:47.450> now<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.510> rely<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.170> things<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.559> software

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
so now we rely on things like software

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
so now we rely on things like software
tweaks<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.090> there's<00:00:51.390> two<00:00:51.600> things<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.960> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
tweaks so there's two things that you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.590 
tweaks so there's two things that you
can<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.440> speed<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:53.039> your<00:00:53.219> old<00:00:53.399> Mac<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.420> make

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
can do to speed up your old Mac to make

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.720 
can do to speed up your old Mac to make
things<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.260> lion<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.890> snow<00:00:56.160> leopard<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
things like lion and snow leopard and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.720 
things like lion and snow leopard and
things<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.120> run<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> lot<00:00:58.170> quicker<00:00:58.730> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
things like that run a lot quicker and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.760 
things like that run a lot quicker and
most<00:01:00.030> importantly<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.629> would<00:01:00.899> say<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.469> things

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
most importantly I would say is things

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.310 
most importantly I would say is things
like<00:01:01.920> iMovie<00:01:02.609> waiting<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.420> thumbnails<00:01:03.870> to

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
like iMovie waiting for thumbnails to

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.250 
like iMovie waiting for thumbnails to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
things like that load up a lot faster

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.320 
things like that load up a lot faster
these<00:01:12.600> two<00:01:12.840> tips<00:01:13.140> will<00:01:13.500> help<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.950> happen<00:01:14.330> so

just<00:04:16.639> a<00:04:16.759> little<00:04:16.970> bit<00:04:17.090> quicker<00:04:17.299> things<00:04:17.720> like

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
just a little bit quicker things like

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.650 
just a little bit quicker things like
that<00:04:18.340> we<00:04:19.340> will<00:04:19.519> definitely<00:04:19.820> speed<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.299> up<00:04:20.419> and

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
that we will definitely speed it up and

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.840 
that we will definitely speed it up and
now<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:21.320> freed<00:04:21.709> up<00:04:21.889> RAM<00:04:22.190> that<00:04:22.490> your<00:04:22.639> computer

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
now that freed up RAM that your computer

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.379 
now that freed up RAM that your computer
thought<00:04:23.300> was<00:04:24.430> being<00:04:25.430> used<00:04:25.639> or<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.270> know

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
thought was being used or you know

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.210 
thought was being used or you know
somewhere<00:04:26.810> else<00:04:26.990> or<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.350> CPU<00:04:27.740> power<00:04:27.949> that's

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
somewhere else or the CPU power that's

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.640 
somewhere else or the CPU power that's
being<00:04:28.460> generated<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.180> run<00:04:29.750> basically<00:04:30.169> nothing

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
being generated to run basically nothing

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.400 
being generated to run basically nothing
is<00:04:30.830> now<00:04:31.340> free<00:04:31.639> for<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.060> use<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.750> now<00:04:33.350> the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
is now free for you to use and now the

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.559 
is now free for you to use and now the
computer<00:04:33.680> can<00:04:34.130> use<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.729> actually<00:04:34.970> speed

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
computer can use that and actually speed

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.559 
computer can use that and actually speed
up<00:04:35.600> your<00:04:36.380> applications<00:04:37.039> as<00:04:37.220> you<00:04:37.340> go<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:38.270> I've

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
up your applications as you go so I've

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.960 
up your applications as you go so I've
noticed<00:04:38.720> a<00:04:39.229> lot<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:39.979> speed<00:04:40.370> enhancements

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
noticed a lot of speed enhancements

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.760 
noticed a lot of speed enhancements
improvements<00:04:41.509> just<00:04:42.080> by<00:04:42.199> doing<00:04:42.259> these<00:04:42.560> two

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
improvements just by doing these two

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.200 
improvements just by doing these two
things<00:04:42.949> and<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.340> takes<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.610> two<00:04:43.850> minutes<00:04:44.060> of

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
things and it takes you two minutes of

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.990 
things and it takes you two minutes of
time<00:04:44.419> so<00:04:44.900> this<00:04:45.289> tutorial<00:04:45.770> is<00:04:45.800> actually<00:04:46.220> lot

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
time so this tutorial is actually lot

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.550 
time so this tutorial is actually lot
longer<00:04:47.919> than<00:04:48.919> it<00:04:49.100> takes<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.699> do<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.560> anyway

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
longer than it takes to do the anyway

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.980 
longer than it takes to do the anyway
you<00:04:52.340> get<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.520> point<00:04:52.819> I<00:04:53.120> just<00:04:53.330> want<00:04:53.509> to<00:04:53.569> explain

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
you get the point I just want to explain

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.779 
you get the point I just want to explain
so<00:04:54.259> people<00:04:54.530> know<00:04:54.650> that<00:04:54.680> they're<00:04:55.160> doing<00:04:55.280> whist

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
so people know that they're doing whist

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.090 
so people know that they're doing whist
a<00:04:55.910> little<00:04:56.150> bit<00:04:56.300> so<00:04:57.050> anyway<00:04:57.440> give<00:04:57.830> those<00:04:57.949> two

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
a little bit so anyway give those two

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.590 
a little bit so anyway give those two
things<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.430> try<00:04:58.639> and<00:04:58.910> enjoy<00:04:59.810> your<00:05:00.020> faster<00:05:00.380> mac
