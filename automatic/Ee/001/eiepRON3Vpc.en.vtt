will require an internet connection so

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.550 
will require an internet connection so
there's<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> career<00:00:15.509> mode<00:00:15.750> there's<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:16.289> maps

there's a career mode there's like maps
you<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.920> unlock<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.730> here's<00:00:17.940> our<00:00:18.090> first<00:00:18.390> map

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
you can unlock so here's our first map

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.439 
you can unlock so here's our first map
it's<00:00:19.920> looking<00:00:20.250> pretty<00:00:20.369> good<00:00:20.490> graphics<00:00:21.300> are

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
it's looking pretty good graphics are

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.990 
it's looking pretty good graphics are
really<00:00:21.660> good<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.350> also<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.769> Riptide<00:00:23.130> GP<00:00:23.670> 1

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
really good it's also is Riptide GP 1

really good it's also is Riptide GP 1
which<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.720> never<00:00:24.900> played<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.519> get

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
which I never played but you can get

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.700 
which I never played but you can get
something<00:00:27.060> similar<00:00:28.429> but<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.550> game<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> newer

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
something similar but this game is newer

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
if there's a moves but he only taught me

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.500 
if there's a moves but he only taught me
to<00:01:24.140> do<00:01:24.290> this<00:01:24.500> over<00:01:24.950> bar<00:01:25.190> hop<00:01:25.490> it's<00:01:26.090> good<00:01:26.270> also

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
to do this over bar hop it's good also

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.190 
to do this over bar hop it's good also
do<00:01:26.630> this<00:01:26.810> spike<00:01:27.500> down<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.920> do<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:28.160> Superman

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
do this spike down to do it Superman

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.940 
do this spike down to do it Superman
not<00:01:30.200> sure<00:01:31.270> what<00:01:32.270> other<00:01:32.390> tricks<00:01:32.750> are<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.770> game

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
not sure what other tricks are the game

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.550 
not sure what other tricks are the game
plays<00:01:37.310> pretty<00:01:37.610> fluently<00:01:38.060> it's<00:01:38.960> also<00:01:39.110> like<00:01:39.320> oh

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
plays pretty fluently it's also like oh

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.820 
plays pretty fluently it's also like oh
it<00:01:40.250> when<00:01:40.820> we<00:01:40.940> forget<00:01:41.180> up<00:01:41.300> on<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.510> boost<00:01:41.840> boost

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
it when we forget up on that boost boost

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.500 
it when we forget up on that boost boost
forward<00:01:43.430> here<00:01:43.700> whoa<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:45.590> did<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.890> tabletop

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
forward here whoa just did a tabletop

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.300 
forward here whoa just did a tabletop
overhead<00:01:47.510> of<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.810> move

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
overhead of that move

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.650 
overhead of that move
I'll<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.610> even<00:01:49.790> possible<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:50.210> down<00:01:50.450> real

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
I'll is it even possible to down real

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:59.810 
I'll is it even possible to down real
life<00:01:50.840> I've<00:01:51.290> spin<00:01:51.740> around<00:01:52.070> like<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.700> here

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.440 

looks<00:02:00.820> like<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.150> just<00:02:01.480> finished<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.170> am<00:02:02.710> dirt

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
looks like it just finished I am dirt

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.790 
looks like it just finished I am dirt
dirt<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.890> too<00:02:06.040> bad<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:06.250> guess<00:02:06.610> at<00:02:07.000> one<00:02:07.210> star<00:02:07.800> and

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
dirt not too bad I guess at one star and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.070 
dirt not too bad I guess at one star and
we<00:02:09.010> hunter<00:02:09.190> cash<00:02:09.399> also<00:02:10.270> have<00:02:10.479> experience<00:02:11.020> in

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
more people but it did work pretty well

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.979 
more people but it did work pretty well
playing<00:03:48.069> against<00:03:48.340> someone<00:03:48.579> else<00:03:48.760> though<00:03:49.060> and

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
playing against someone else though and

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.400

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
that was kind of a cowardly move

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.349 
that was kind of a cowardly move
especially<00:03:57.250> because<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.519> was<00:03:57.609> winning<00:03:57.819> witty

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
moving left and right to do back flips

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.260 
moving left and right to do back flips
front<00:05:13.470> flips<00:05:13.560> there's<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.610> new<00:05:14.730> maps<00:05:14.970> at<00:05:15.120> our

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.010 
first up maybe I'm just not that good
but<00:05:34.970> just<00:05:35.970> like<00:05:36.090> seem<00:05:36.480> always<00:05:36.720> seems<00:05:36.900> like

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
but just like seem always seems like

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.440 
but just like seem always seems like
there's<00:05:37.169> like<00:05:37.230> two<00:05:37.590> people<00:05:37.800> ahead<00:05:37.980> of<00:05:38.190> you<00:05:38.450> and

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
there's like two people ahead of you and

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.150 
there's like two people ahead of you and
it's<00:05:39.660> like<00:05:39.690> you<00:05:39.900> can<00:05:40.050> never<00:05:40.260> catch<00:05:40.620> up<00:05:40.860> to<00:05:40.890> them

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
it's like you can never catch up to them

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.040 
it's like you can never catch up to them
say<00:05:41.820> no<00:05:41.970> matter<00:05:42.120> how<00:05:42.360> fast<00:05:42.600> you<00:05:42.750> go<00:05:42.780> you<00:05:42.930> can

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
say no matter how fast you go you can

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.450 
say no matter how fast you go you can
never<00:05:43.290> catch<00:05:43.530> up<00:05:43.710> these<00:05:43.800> first<00:05:44.390> two<00:05:45.390> people
