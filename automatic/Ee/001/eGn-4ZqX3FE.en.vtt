00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.180
 the staff I discovered an application well 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.620
 interesting today 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.370
 I do not think it was until his release . 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.950
 today it is based 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.719
 I believe in that episode, the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.029
 big bang theory what the snack 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.160
 it proposes an application that solves 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.960
 mathematical equations from the camera 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.670
 his 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.670
 this is the eff photon that is how to bring 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.239
 I have a list of exercises right now. 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:38.250
 how many high school students of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.410
 to possess I do not know is that math and I 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.079
 I'll get it here 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.809
 I'll get my cell phone and I'll open a photo 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.800
 right, what's going to happen I do not 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.870
 I'll need to type if I equate 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.460
 solve or simply point the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.780
 scanner and he will give me an answer 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.630
 Let's go up and down you. 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.140
 Find the size of the scanner I'm going to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.570
 make it smaller because the spacing 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.060
 between lines and that is small then to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.659
 not hurt the reading or anything 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.380
 type'll leave him in a four socket 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.830
 that picking the first equation 18x -43 is 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.320
 equal to 65 the screen response that arrived 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.360
 to 6 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:39.299
 Here I am going to point out that area says cani. 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:41.850
 18 542 75 x is equal to 6 he gave the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.840
 answer and if I click on the little set here 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.360
 O 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.479
 it will explain why this 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.689
 result to xj6 will teach step to 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.149
 step in this case in four steps as 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.610
 to arrive in china is equal to 6 or not 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.070
 give your answer and point 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.750
 He also explains how to get as 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.360
 to reach her looks here our step up 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.780
 of China to accept the correct answer 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.430
 If you have the wrong thing, it's logical that I 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.090
 I do not think it will 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.030
 you click here 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.629
 Digital comment saying why you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.400
 It's wrong and it's interesting to send you 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.739
 do this whenever you encounter an error 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.480
 because there the developers 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:32.080
 programmers will correct correct 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.170
 Come on, this equation was pretty simple, huh? 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.239
 good let's take two largest here 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.349
 example , the result is what is know three 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:50.860
 bedrooms 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:53.349
 I'm going to point out the letter bx is equal to 34 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.620
 and again if you click on the button 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.700
 here he will explain to you when you arrive 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.599
 in this answer 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:07.150
 he also teaches you correct 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:10.750
 I have some larger ones down here sc 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:20.410
 for example that the result reached 5 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:24.639
 let's test it to be a boy x is equal to 5 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.950
 he must first turn the other then okay 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.340
 seeing arrived to 5 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.470
 I can pick up the little set and see how it is 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.299
 this application is initially 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.709
 available only for windows phone and 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:41.500
 oz iphone in ipad case also and goes 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.299
 go out to android in early 2015 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.540
 I think by then, but the 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.730
 application is to make it possible to solve 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.569
 functions besides basic arithmetic 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.430
 fractions decimal numbers equations of 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.250
 some juggling that he also 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.980
 I solved it, that's it. 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.599
 If you liked the video, leave it here. 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.599
 Please and until the next
