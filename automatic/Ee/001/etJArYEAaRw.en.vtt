there<00:05:23.840> didn't<00:05:24.230> work<00:05:24.380> for<00:05:24.410> zap<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.040> we're

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
there didn't work for zap and we're

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.430 
there didn't work for zap and we're
taking<00:05:25.940> out<00:05:26.090> so<00:05:26.570> they<00:05:26.660> pick<00:05:26.870> up<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.110> diffuse

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
taking out so they pick up the diffuse

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.740 
taking out so they pick up the diffuse
on<00:05:27.680> this<00:05:27.890> round<00:05:28.190> which<00:05:28.490> is<00:05:28.670> unfortunate<00:05:29.360> but

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
on this round which is unfortunate but

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.270 
on this round which is unfortunate but
we<00:05:29.930> were<00:05:30.050> giving<00:05:30.320> them<00:05:30.410> a<00:05:30.470> good<00:05:30.650> run<00:05:30.950> for<00:05:30.980> their

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
we were giving them a good run for their

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.330 
we were giving them a good run for their
money<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.730> mean<00:05:32.000> to<00:05:32.510> be<00:05:32.780> tied<00:05:33.410> to<00:05:33.770> all<00:05:33.950> using

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
money I mean to be tied to all using

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.950 
money I mean to be tied to all using
throwing<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.700> only<00:05:34.940> we<00:05:35.540> were<00:05:35.690> pretty<00:05:35.870> happy

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
throwing that only we were pretty happy

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.080 
throwing that only we were pretty happy
with<00:05:36.320> that<00:05:36.380> nine<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.040> four<00:05:37.280> there<00:05:37.550> on<00:05:37.760> the

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
with that nine and four there on the

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.080 
with that nine and four there on the
leaderboard<00:05:38.780> so<00:05:39.350> really<00:05:39.920> really<00:05:40.190> trying<00:05:40.880> our

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
leaderboard so really really trying our

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.060 
leaderboard so really really trying our
hardest<00:05:41.210> to<00:05:41.510> get<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.780> win<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.200> sometimes<00:05:42.800> I

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
hardest to get the win and sometimes I

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.500 
hardest to get the win and sometimes I
think<00:05:43.250> that's<00:05:43.400> more<00:05:43.550> entertaining<00:05:44.060> than<00:05:44.210> just

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
think that's more entertaining than just

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.140 
think that's more entertaining than just
watching<00:05:44.990> a<00:05:45.260> team<00:05:45.500> you<00:05:45.770> know<00:05:45.920> just<00:05:46.190> mow<00:05:46.820> down

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
watching a team you know just mow down

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.390 
watching a team you know just mow down

enemies you know you see people with the

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.390 
enemies you know you see people with the
ACR<00:05:50.030> getting<00:05:50.930> 100<00:05:51.500> kills<00:05:51.740> in<00:05:51.890> the<00:05:51.950> game<00:05:52.130> on

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
ACR getting 100 kills in the game on

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.920 
ACR getting 100 kills in the game on

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
there we go as you see just skimmed

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.510 
there we go as you see just skimmed
across<00:06:11.600> and<00:06:12.020> then<00:06:12.470> went<00:06:12.620> for<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:12.800> crazy<00:06:13.190> knife

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
across and then went for the crazy knife

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.400 
across and then went for the crazy knife
on<00:06:13.760> me<00:06:13.970> there<00:06:14.180> while<00:06:14.420> he<00:06:14.570> was<00:06:14.630> hawks<00:06:14.870> done<00:06:15.170> and

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
on me there while he was hawks done and

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.500 
on me there while he was hawks done and
then<00:06:16.220> the<00:06:16.370> bomb<00:06:16.610> has<00:06:16.730> been<00:06:16.760> planted<00:06:16.940> in<00:06:17.300> it<00:06:17.420> is

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
then the bomb has been planted in it is

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.810 
then the bomb has been planted in it is
something<00:06:17.690> like<00:06:17.900> 1v5<00:06:18.620> situation<00:06:19.550> so

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
something like 1v5 situation so

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.060 
something like 1v5 situation so
unfortunately<00:06:20.540> lose<00:06:20.810> out<00:06:20.990> there<00:06:21.200> and<00:06:21.530> as<00:06:21.920> you

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
unfortunately lose out there and as you

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.340 
unfortunately lose out there and as you
can<00:06:22.220> guess<00:06:22.250> they<00:06:22.640> defuse<00:06:22.970> the<00:06:23.060> bomb<00:06:23.320> anyway<00:06:24.320> I

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
can guess they defuse the bomb anyway I

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.900 
can guess they defuse the bomb anyway I
