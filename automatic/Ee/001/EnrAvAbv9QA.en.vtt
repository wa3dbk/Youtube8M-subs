like books and stuff on over here you

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.720 
like books and stuff on over here you
know<00:02:20.709> just<00:02:20.860> becomes<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.190> little<00:02:21.370> flat<00:02:21.550> or

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
know just becomes a little flat or

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.150 
know just becomes a little flat or
planar<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:23.230> still<00:02:23.440> has<00:02:23.530> some<00:02:23.769> pretty<00:02:23.980> nice

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
planar it still has some pretty nice

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.610 
planar it still has some pretty nice
features<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.090> over<00:02:25.959> here<00:02:25.989> we<00:02:26.260> come<00:02:26.470> to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
features on it and over here we come to

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.440 
features on it and over here we come to
a<00:02:26.650> snow<00:02:26.920> biome<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.700> doesn't<00:02:28.030> take<00:02:28.120> up<00:02:28.150> too<00:02:28.300> much

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
a snow biome it doesn't take up too much

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.910 
a snow biome it doesn't take up too much
of<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.780> map<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:29.080> as<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.260> can<00:02:29.380> see<00:02:29.530> it's<00:02:29.680> just<00:02:29.739> a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
of the map in as you can see it's just a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.009 
of the map in as you can see it's just a
little<00:02:30.069> this<00:02:30.250> area<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.239> know<00:02:31.330> it's<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.660> decent

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
little this area you know it's a decent

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.110 
little this area you know it's a decent
amount<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.350> snow<00:02:32.590> not<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.519> biggest<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.030> but

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
amount of snow not the biggest and but

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.190 
amount of snow not the biggest and but
you<00:02:34.209> get<00:02:34.300> something<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.780> know<00:02:34.900> snow

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
you get something that you know snow

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.280 
you get something that you know snow
snow<00:02:35.920> biome<00:02:36.130> trees<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.690> that's<00:02:37.989> pretty<00:02:38.110> nice

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
snow biome trees so that's pretty nice

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.740 
snow biome trees so that's pretty nice
and<00:02:38.980> come<00:02:39.400> over<00:02:39.519> over<00:02:39.910> here<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.540> actually
