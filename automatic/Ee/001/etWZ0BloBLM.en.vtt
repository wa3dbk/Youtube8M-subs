00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
down south you know I thought it was

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.050 
down south you know I thought it was
just<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> humidity

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
just the humidity

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.400 
just the humidity
the<00:02:09.179> hairpins<00:02:09.600> like<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> humidity<00:02:10.289> because

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the hairpins like the humidity because

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.140 
the hairpins like the humidity because
where<00:02:10.740> I<00:02:10.770> live<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.130> there<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.580> zero<00:02:11.850> humidity

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
where I live that there is zero humidity

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.630 
where I live that there is zero humidity
none<00:02:12.720> whatsoever<00:02:12.959> probably<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.220> negative

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
none whatsoever probably in a negative

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.790 
none whatsoever probably in a negative
is<00:02:14.730> there's<00:02:14.880> no<00:02:15.030> humidity<00:02:15.600> whatsoever<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.740> you

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
is there's no humidity whatsoever so you

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.930 
is there's no humidity whatsoever so you
know<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.069> thought<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.280> was<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.430> humidity

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
know I just thought it was the humidity

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.990 
know I just thought it was the humidity
and<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.630> thought<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.590> would<00:02:19.680> get<00:02:19.770> better<00:02:19.970> when<00:02:20.970> I

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
and I thought it would get better when I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.350 
and I thought it would get better when I
came<00:02:21.870> back<00:02:22.020> home<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:23.160> no<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.819> did<00:02:24.180> not

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
came back home but no it did not
