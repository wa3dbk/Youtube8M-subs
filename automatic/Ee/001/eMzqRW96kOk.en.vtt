00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.309
 so good evening I suggest to look 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.970
 video dedicated to the dry water in which 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.970
 we can see 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.160
 pipe inlet house-2 check valves 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:24.890
 spin and one second inch 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.660
 automatics block filter and so on 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.189
 half inch check valve 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.180
 with inverted with rearranged springs 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:39.059
 us on one side first from the plate 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.739
 ends with a hose that we have 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.670
 always want 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.000
 does not raise and cultural hides behind 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.100
 by this custom 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.020
 for more visual work of all this 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:04.320
 system offers to watch a video or 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:07.590
 more precisely the system into action before i 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:14.060
 disconnected the accumulator and opened 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.060
 slowly the faucet turned on the pressure switch 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.990
 everything 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.310
 since the hydraulic accumulator is disconnected 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:32.740
 so you can sweet visually 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.740
 look off the pressure drops 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.390
 the water is gone just noticed 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.500
 there will be a restart now 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:04.500
 In general, what I can under demonstrates that 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:11.370
 this end of you is absolutely dry check 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.230
 1 passed out at us again falls 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.120
 pressure for two and two 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.150
 the atmosphere will turn on the pump and again 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.420
 chase and see what happens 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.420
 here 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.590
 up 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:49.489
 but here I am nothing because we have everything 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:57.290
 ended here and so this can 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:03:01.389
 work endlessly look 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.389
 look still consider 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.069
 air is released and serve poorly. 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.709
 and go back here is the water level in the hose 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.099
 how much did he spit out 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.099
 water is gone 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:47.040
 here is such 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:50.459
 video that you can watch again in 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.200
 another option and now the sequel 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.550
 movie how can it all work 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.790
 plain 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.760
 plastic bottle, we have everything again 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.680
 the same closed accumulator 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.580
 small open little tap 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:15.139
 which flows down 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:22.889
 water drops pressure in the system and 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:39.160
 see what happens to us with everything 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:43.009
 I ask this farm 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:47.439
 did not forget everything 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:52.490
 turn on the pump the pump was turned off 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:59.869
 so now everyone is showing 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:01.309
 pump turned on pressure 

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:04.180
 still two and two 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.180
 should work 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.510
 such a picture 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:41.520
 Straight invented stupid horse he 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.520
 works well up 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.080
 so can it work again to 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.080
 infinity
