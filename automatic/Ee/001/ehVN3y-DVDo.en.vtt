00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello everybody, my name is antônio sérgio 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.230
 I want to introduce you to this 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.420
 application that arduino wifi ethernet 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.809
 with him we can control up to 10 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.809
 channels 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.340
 we have here two buttons are on 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.380
 to analog and digital ports 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:30.050
 so we can control 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.719
 as an example lamps lamps 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:42.270
 motors mats any device 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:44.850
 connected to the internet ip a wifi connection and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.550
 button is displayed here. 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:55.559
 connection that the router where I made the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 connection to the iphone fans that are 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.510
 representing the loads to be 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:08.400
 sanctioned here 10 leds arduino board and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.820
 the ethernet child mounted this is the cable 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.180
 that is linking the internet child to the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.180
 router 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.670
 at this moment the system is working 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.930
 wireless via wi fi 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:32.820
 Here, then, relationships with 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:35.939
 buttons with off where it is represented 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.840
 here we can trigger whatever 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.970
 I was able to stay connected at 110 120 volts 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.890
 in case I used leds for the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:51.180
 representation and the functioning is and is 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.130
 totally individual can trigger 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.689
 any device any time 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.700
 turn on and turn off 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.500
 note that we have here is also 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.009
 part of status 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.640
 it returns the address being 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.640
 fired 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.930
 he told me is the return 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:18.180
 is selected not here I'm calling 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:25.750
 the wifi to show you 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:29.590
 Let's get on with it, and our part. 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:35.320
 of configurations we can verify 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:41.040
 here is the fux connection that is mine 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.040
 router and connect 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.970
 so from here the full connected router 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.260
 wifi wireless router connected to another 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.510
 something we can check too 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:06.370
 because entering the part of 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:07.480
 settings football router is 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.270
 connected 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.880
 I have a list here of the state it is 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.630
 connected signal strength and more 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.500
 important looks at the ip address 192 168 1 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.500
 points 101 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.560
 This is the address my cell phone is on. 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.680
 connected to the router 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.950
 but the address that our dp is another 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.970
 which is the 192 168 1 50 cases that I 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:45.430
 I chose this router that is 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:50.620
 within the range that is free and 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:56.709
 end I have here the server that 80 90 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:59.530
 8080 90 81 inner line and 80 90 and here 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.459
 I'm returning as I'm not. 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.980
 still connected with thousand of the connected hymn 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.370
 so it shows hi tim and hoping that 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.340
 I can enter my ip name 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.970
 It was really cool so we can here. 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.070
 type the number of t in case you go 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.060
 enter its dp name which is corresponding 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.300
 To your 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.720
 the router you will choose a number 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.020
 that is free within the range of your 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:35.060
 router and at the end 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:39.770
 be sure to set 2.80 for the 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:43.910
 wifi connection internal network or 2.80 90 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:47.750
 to connect an external network that you 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:54.139
 can access anywhere in the world a 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:55.870
 example I'll put check and leave 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.889
 as 80 90 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:03.290
 but it's you type in 80 or 80 and 90 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:10.160
 To start the example you can 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:13.430
 type 80 and 90 example 80 but you 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.310
 can start with 12 points 80 to 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:21.800
 do the first test with a 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.850
 Internal connection here already connected series 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.510
 that my name dp 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:33.320
 so do not forget to put the end 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:35.020
 2.80 you can exit or save ip 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.180
 if you want to change the ipi name also only 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.900
 give and perceive to save the bank 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.060
 data 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.169
 he will be safe here in the bank. 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.940
 application data in the verified case 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.910
 that he is showing everything off in 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.380
 off and returning here to the door answered 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.690
 which is at zero 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:06:03.919
 in case it will have 5 volts 0 to 1 to 2 a 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:05.900
 3 to 4 and 2d 3d and 4d it is verified that the 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:10.880
 ports go to 5 volts when they are 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:15.710
 triggered indicating that it is being 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.780
 triggered and I have the return that 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.750
 actually was turned on or off in the 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.289
 In case of disagreement calling 0 to 5 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:28.099
 volts to other 5 volts at 25 volts 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:30.349
 that it is almost instantaneous and 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.250
 this will also depend on how the 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.990
 your network 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.500
 If you are very congested, you can 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.050
 take along 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.530
 a few moments if not this is super fast 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:44.930
 almost instantly clicked the button 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:47.450
 it already turns on or off measures or 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.430
 relay you have connected too. 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.180
 can be triggered in case you want 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.520
 control loads and 110 or 220 volts 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:07:01.190
 It should be used in place of one report 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:03.740
 relay module and reads up to ten channels and 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:08.840
 demonstrating then it is with 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:12.830
 leds in the case I just said if 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:16.400
 Do you wish to take a test only 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:19.850
 can easily test using 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.510
 LEDs or to what we have to to to 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:30.110
 anyone who already has experience can use module 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:32.350
 Rene also easy and teaching this 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.630
 demonstration 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:40.190
 we have here is the arduino mounted with 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.810
 internet child with personal i want 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.030
 thank you now for having 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.240
 watched this video and who 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.380
 you can purchase the application from the 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.250
 google play 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:55.419
 the name is that of the anthem wifi ethernet 

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.419
 Thank you very much and see you next time.
