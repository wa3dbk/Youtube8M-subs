00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.330
 Hello, how are you? 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.349
 Less than one more channel video lesson 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 today we are there with windows predicted 10 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.710
 and technique to preview 10 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:29.279
 so are we already have video 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.830
 teaching install it né ii 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.710
 let's focus on what microsoft has released 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.870
 this first technical test version 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.200
 preview that is a prior art 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.940
 means here is not a system 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.550
 finished and only for 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.960
 present the new features some 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.180
 of them not 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.940
 and already protesting to show the guys 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.730
 We are doing this video lesson during 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.870
 the presentation is microsoft hit the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.840
 familiarity key repeatedly is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.059
 must have to see many companies 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.979
 complaining that it was necessary to invest 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.690
 much in training their 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.850
 employees with windows 8 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.090
 the company has backtracked on many 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.149
 main thing is to start from 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.170
 back after a distant period what 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.479
 interface of the new system and 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.319
 similar to that of windows 7 the system and 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.860
 a start menu and looked like a 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:31.200
 windows 7 a start menu then clicking 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.660
 here in the windows window 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.880
 I liked it because it already seems 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.649
 right application 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.920
 you can see that all applications 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.289
 have that boy always alone and equal 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.660
 formerly in windows xp no 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.940
 all your planes that you were going to 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.989
 clicking the installs and when they went 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.509
 appearing here 

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.860
 one of the programs of all 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.050
 right application 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.050
 here are some more applications 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:04.050
 something I found very interesting that 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.819
 do not start the searches 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.770
 she does not just look for things from her 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.540
 computer in search things like da 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.840
 internet we go here because microsoft 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.320
 will fetch only files from itself 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.720
 windows and search for things on the internet ok 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.270
 seeing several 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:29.170
 search the internet if you enter 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.680
 he will he will open the universal search 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.680
 it's very interesting 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.400
 there it already enters the site of the direct in the 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:46.460
 web site is cool this resource 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.380
 show the search for the internet and 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.960
 computer advice seeks all that he 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.980
 found on the computer and on the internet 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.470
 that you highlight in the search 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.280
 a cool thing also have in the system 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.110
 in this version that the programs of his 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.160
 tory place the problems that come with the 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.110
 lesson can be opened window 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.850
 windows 8 point in eight was not possible 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.100
 only open full screen 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.209
 for example here is the drive also you 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.220
 can only 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.880
 you can only open entire internal 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.920
 windows 8 1 and windows 8 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.650
 He can not open a window for you. 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.720
 minimize etc and such to minimize 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.930
 also on foot but only in full window 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.530
 and not in the other united very well this 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.500
 this change also a thing 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.510
 interesting that it does also reminds 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.750
 of the alt tab you will be switching between 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.670
 the applications then windows 10 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.040
 it also allows you to have several 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.920
 windows by pressing the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.720
 windows that itabi ie you can have 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.299
 various work areas 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.110
 I'm going to play here in Rio de Janeiro, he's a 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.640
 another area of ​​work then understood 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.350
 using windows that is fine 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.019
 instead of where you were and you alternate 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.360
 between work areas is a resource that 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.160
 had plenty on linux and there was 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.120
 rather on linux than on windows too 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.280
 it was pretty cool the way it was applied 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.479
 already in the control panel we will see what 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.180
 It is different from what is good at first 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.330
 the same functions of windows 8 points 1 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.349
 and 8 good looking 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.599
 I'm not going to get too much in here 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.580
 control panel functions that 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:38.139
 more or less priest 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.479
 for everyone right now a video lesson from 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.729
 installation being edited 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.789
 I found the installation generally to be 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.210
 very fast even on a virtual machine and 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:52.539
 running on virtual windows it went well 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.979
 quick setup I found faster 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.180
 than I do not know if it's because the version 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.189
 preview ne 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.870
 but it was much faster than the 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:02.110
 from windows 8 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.889
 I found it very interesting, it's difficult 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.169
 say if it will succeed that 8 had 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.000
 or not at all 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.610
 but by the fact the night time we are always saw 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.819
 still have many risks of resources that 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.919
 will not reach the final version as the 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.139
 is not that it is 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.229
 integrated with the search tool 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:27.190
 internal dominance of this system was a 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.919
 special mode for hybrid laptop 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.270
 we must also take into account that 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.300
 very little the percentage of resources 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.189
 which will be in the final version are 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.590
 still does not mean that it has 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:41.259
 a lot of things for them to put in 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.120
 what you have come so far the company to 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:48.279
 be on the right track and I liked it 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:51.159
 Quite right, and this time microsoft 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:53.169
 decided to present new tools that 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:56.500
 integrate more simply with the 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:00.039
 was one in 27 bringing a new one though 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.650
 old familiarity on windows is fine 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.000
 I hope you liked the video
