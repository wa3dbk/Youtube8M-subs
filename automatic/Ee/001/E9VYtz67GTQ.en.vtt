assigned to grinds and I actually
screwed<00:03:20.410> up<00:03:20.560> quite<00:03:20.860> badly<00:03:20.890> there<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.460> didn't

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
screwed up quite badly there I didn't

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.310 
screwed up quite badly there I didn't
want<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.000> get<00:03:22.090> in<00:03:22.210> this<00:03:22.300> bowl<00:03:22.570> but<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:22.840> did<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:23.230> I

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
want to get in this bowl but I did and I

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.350 
want to get in this bowl but I did and I
tried<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.680> make<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:23.980> best<00:03:24.220> out<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.460> it<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.180> I

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
tried to make the best out of it and I

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.750 
tried to make the best out of it and I
got<00:03:25.710> 240,000<00:03:26.710> combo<00:03:27.040> although<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.490> could<00:03:27.640> have

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
got 240,000 combo although it could have

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.100 
got 240,000 combo although it could have
been<00:03:27.850> much<00:03:28.060> higher<00:03:28.240> had<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.540> followed<00:03:28.960> that

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
been much higher had I followed that

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.230 
been much higher had I followed that
grind<00:03:29.350> all<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.830> way<00:03:29.920> through<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.430> then<00:03:31.000> a

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
grind all the way through and then a

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.120 
grind all the way through and then a
second<00:03:31.870> combo<00:03:32.170> this<00:03:32.290> combo<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.710> a<00:03:32.770> waste<00:03:32.950> of

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
second combo this combo is a waste of

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.070 
second combo this combo is a waste of
time<00:03:33.310> basically<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:33.970> actually<00:03:34.420> get<00:03:34.870> like

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
time basically I actually get like

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.110 
time basically I actually get like
20,000<00:03:35.980> points<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.460> was<00:03:36.670> basically

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
20,000 points and it was basically

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.170 
20,000 points and it was basically
useless<00:03:37.330> so<00:03:38.080> that's<00:03:38.800> a<00:03:39.070> lot<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.820> time<00:03:40.000> wasted

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
useless so that's a lot of time wasted

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.670 
useless so that's a lot of time wasted
as<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.600> can<00:03:40.750> tell<00:03:40.900> what<00:03:41.290> you're<00:03:41.410> trying<00:03:41.620> to

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
can so here you can see me going for my

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.410 
can so here you can see me going for my
second<00:03:50.380> combo<00:03:50.770> which<00:03:50.980> is<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.280> my<00:03:51.550> go-to<00:03:51.850> combo

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
second combo which is the my go-to combo

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.840 
second combo which is the my go-to combo
for<00:03:52.630> this<00:03:52.810> level<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.530> obviously<00:03:54.370> pulling<00:03:54.640> off

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
for this level and obviously pulling off

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.780 
for this level and obviously pulling off
as<00:03:55.060> much<00:03:55.300> as<00:03:56.080> many<00:03:56.400> special<00:03:57.400> grinds<00:03:57.700> as

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
as much as many special grinds as

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.880 
as much as many special grinds as
possible<00:03:58.210> here<00:03:58.360> I<00:03:58.420> lost<00:03:59.140> speed<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.710> should

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
possible here I lost speed and I should

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.230 
possible here I lost speed and I should
have<00:03:59.980> probably<00:04:00.100> done<00:04:00.310> some<00:04:00.520> pop<00:04:00.730> shove-its<00:04:01.120> or

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
have probably done some pop shove-its or

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.910 
have probably done some pop shove-its or
something<00:04:01.630> make<00:04:02.260> sure<00:04:02.410> making<00:04:02.560> sure<00:04:02.800> to

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
something make sure making sure to

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.400 
something make sure making sure to
balance<00:04:03.220> as<00:04:03.370> always<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:03.940> just<00:04:04.690> keep<00:04:05.110> going

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
able to make it and here I just learned

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.460 
able to make it and here I just learned
because<00:04:12.490> of<00:04:12.760> my<00:04:12.910> angle<00:04:13.210> and<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:13.720> got<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:14.110> little

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
because of my angle and I got a little

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.520 
because of my angle and I got a little
bit<00:04:14.680> better<00:04:14.800> thanks<00:04:15.190> for<00:04:15.280> watching
