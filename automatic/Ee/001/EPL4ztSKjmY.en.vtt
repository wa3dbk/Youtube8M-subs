00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.560
 The first thing you need to draw a 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.960
 Schnauzer is a black pencil drawing 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.960
 start by drawing a sketch of the animal 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.150
 for this it can be very helpful to have 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.640
 a reference image begins 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.530
 drawing the torso the fast lines 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.530
 to achieve greater fluidity in the drawing 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.170
 follow by the neck and the head 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.150
 remember the snout and the ears 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.340
 continue to draw the legs 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.399
 makes a small tail 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.750
 then use a black marker tip 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.180
 end to finish your drawing 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.480
 above the sketch highlights the lines 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.580
 adding detail to them should not 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.500
 be perfectly straight lines since 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.170
 being a dog this is covered in 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.170
 hair paints the nose in black 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.210
 make him a kind of beard in toxic 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.600
 finish highlighting the rest of the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.600
 food 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.800
 and this is basically the way 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.800
 draw a schnauzer
