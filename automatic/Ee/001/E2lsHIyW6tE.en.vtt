and so forth from day to day driving
stuff<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.239> make<00:00:33.899> sure<00:00:34.050> when<00:00:34.260> she'll<00:00:34.469> look

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
stuff that make sure when she'll look

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.420 
stuff that make sure when she'll look
like<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:37.950> we've<00:00:38.070> done<00:00:38.190> here<00:00:38.250> is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
like that so what we've done here is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.430 
like that so what we've done here is
we're<00:00:38.640> taking<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> card<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> placed<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
we're taking the card and placed it

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.180 
we're taking the card and placed it
underneath<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.100> film<00:00:42.800> just<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.070> can

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
underneath the film just so that you can

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.889 
underneath the film just so that you can
get<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> good<00:00:46.640> vision<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.969> how<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.329> looks<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
get a good vision of how it looks and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.479 
get a good vision of how it looks and
how<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.379> optically<00:00:49.770> clear<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.190> doesn't

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
how it is optically clear it doesn't

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.549 
how it is optically clear it doesn't
cause<00:00:50.610> any<00:00:50.640> distortion<00:00:51.449> or<00:00:51.629> discoloration<00:00:52.440> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
cause any distortion or discoloration it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.520 
cause any distortion or discoloration it
would<00:00:52.649> impair<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.250> visibility<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> we're

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
would impair your visibility so we're

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.459 
would impair your visibility so we're
going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> take<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.960> we<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:57.989> here

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
going to take this here and we have here

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.799

impact<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> glass<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.490> if<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.640> take<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
impact on the glass and if we take that

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120 
impact on the glass and if we take that
center<00:01:09.390> punch<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> center<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
center punch right in the center of the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.289 
center punch right in the center of the
glass<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:13.470> push<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> down<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.689> that

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
glass and push it down you can see that

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.020 
glass and push it down you can see that
creates<00:01:18.299> quite<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.630> crack<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:20.640> big<00:01:20.820> bullseye

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
creates quite a crack and a big bullseye

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.100 
creates quite a crack and a big bullseye
right<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.130> if<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.280> take<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.930> same

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
right there and if we take the same

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.590 
right there and if we take the same
center<00:01:25.409> punch<00:01:25.970> over<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> clear<00:01:27.390> Plex

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
center punch over on the clear Plex

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.940 
center punch over on the clear Plex
protected<00:01:28.110> side<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.119> we<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> same<00:01:30.570> thing

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
protected side and we do the same thing

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.370 
protected side and we do the same thing
you<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> glass<00:01:32.369> doesn't<00:01:32.729> break

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
you see the glass doesn't break

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
you see the glass doesn't break
obviously<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> first<00:01:35.520> break<00:01:35.759> was<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.150> big

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
obviously that first break was so big

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.609 
obviously that first break was so big
that<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.659> carried<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> crack<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.500> way

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that it carried a crack all the way

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
that it carried a crack all the way
through<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.040> protected<00:01:38.640> side<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.030> glass

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
through the protected side of the glass

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.539 
through the protected side of the glass
but<00:01:40.110> where<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.590> hit<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.009> protective

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
but where we hit it on the protective

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.580 
but where we hit it on the protective
side<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.909> glass<00:01:42.090> even<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.229> decide<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
side of the glass even if we decide to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.810 
side of the glass even if we decide to
hit<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.950> multiple<00:01:44.310> times<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.579> see<00:01:47.790> that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
hit it multiple times you can see that

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.880 
hit it multiple times you can see that
that<00:01:48.000> glass<00:01:48.360> nothing<00:01:49.170> happens<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> glass

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that glass nothing happens to the glass

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.780 
that glass nothing happens to the glass
the<00:01:50.189> film<00:01:50.399> actually<00:01:50.630> absorbs<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> impact<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
the film actually absorbs the impact and

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.130 
the film actually absorbs the impact and
then<00:01:53.790> distributes<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.329> across<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.630> center<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
then distributes it across the center of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.030 
then distributes it across the center of
