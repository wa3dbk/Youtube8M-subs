 I will do because well here I have and 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.770
 some a shortcut that is the most 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.079
 recommendable 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.210
 we do not open it, it will send us this folder 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.200
 when we can is an appliance dressing by 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.390
 hundred here and he will send us roaming we will go 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.420
 here pointed minecraft 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.020
 let's look at the resort &amp; spa we have in mind 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.870
 that this is for version 1.6 point 4 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.800
 this only this we will pass here 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:08.970
 is installed we already closed this and what 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.970
 we opened minecraft to see if it worked 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.420
 wait for it to open 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.300
 and let me pause read in what opens 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.970
 now others 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.400
 I do not come 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.610
 and well we are here back and 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.040
 well now we will only give in my case 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.040
 will be playing offline to start 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.530
 2 minutes and 28 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.530
 we wait for him to load 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.090
 is already saying 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.580
 that's what I do not do is it took that 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:57.530
 too much to load 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.980
 and you are already being viewed now 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.720
 we can close the launcher 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.720
 but we will only occupy this 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.260
 we want it to open 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.340
 the track was more options packages of 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.340
 resources 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.560
 we will see that looking here is 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.340
 what we will only give you we will wait for 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.020
 It is done 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.530
 we go to a player I do not know 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.530
 here 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.610
 loading the ground 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.610
 and come here we are already 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.319
 and we are fine as you see that is very 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.870
 pretty the text is more like who would say 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.410
 yes 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.380
 and something simple we could say 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.620
 and I much better for what would be the 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.140
 Onu decorations do not look for example 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.520
 the pumpkin 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.520

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.930
 the product will not be seen 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.170

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.340
 how will it look 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.340
 and good level 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.730
 they see it like these look like more 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.370
 square of text so that the channels 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:43.440
 with square 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.230

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.280

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.280
