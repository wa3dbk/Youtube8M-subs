 new to boxing i have a package here 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.910
 do not get very hard very much 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.800
 irritating it comes from the switzerland i 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.660
 Although I have an idea what it is 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.929
 I ordered that in england 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.320
 and that's why I'm a bit irritated 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.859
 What are three of what it is? 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.230
 but we do not want to be too deep 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.449
 purely slip and yes guessed the right 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.529
 Packaging is revealed so I can 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.070
 now also welcome in one 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.850
 sloth land channel video because in there 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.450
 are 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:42.770
 you see it was really star he was two 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:46.140
 the two figures yes I take one out 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.059
 grabs the carton away is star wars 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.059
 talking character plush 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.670
 So we have a talking here 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.780
 r2d2 for us it is also because all stars 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.039
 again shoes or battery 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.039
 informational even exchange 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.340
 then I'm shows lets us go 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.290
 unpack the little one 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.810
 I'm still very much over there 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.549
 and wonder why this from Switzerland 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:23.460
 comes when you order in england 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:26.840
 out of this and now try that 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.840
 to be careful because 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:40.610
 because because those things should yes 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 Finally, in the case of Ireland Canal 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.869
 be raffled and but I want 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.970
 Nevertheless, take one in hand so 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.830
 side with it now we have our psyche 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.680
 Card is already relatively large 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.869
 i take such a typical energy here 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:04.160
 The little one can stand next to it 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.619
 probably you have to go there as well 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.660
 practice a little 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.429
 the legs can still be solved here 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.290
 they are still sewn on and then 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.700
 you can make the adjusted determined 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.830
 But I can not do it then 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.070
 So somebody else is what it was like 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:35.180
 Now and where do I press you now 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:36.500
 how cool again so where to get the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:44.299
 I do not have to press yet 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:49.160
 out so I'm not right now 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.989
 I listen to find out if that yes 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.820
 I think he always says that every time 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:58.340
 same but it is still typical 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.910
 r2d2 really cool right now you see 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.920
 me here 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.130
 if I really want to give away two 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.579
 want or just one and one keep 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.820
 well no matter 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.340
 That will be the next one 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.640
 I then make the raffle out of it 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.610
 sometimes even the forest ireland like 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.160
 a little bit to kid so that 's it 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:25.160
 a psychiatrist d2 with speaking function 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:29.340
 bake it back in here and we 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:36.389
