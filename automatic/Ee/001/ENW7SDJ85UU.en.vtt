crashing<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.420> tracks<00:00:50.780> biggest<00:00:51.589> challenge<00:00:52.339> is

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
crashing the tracks biggest challenge is

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
definitely the inconsistent surface they

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.119 
definitely the inconsistent surface they
will<00:00:55.579> go<00:00:55.730> from<00:00:56.030> concrete<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.739> asphalt<00:00:57.739> back<00:00:57.980> to

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
will go from concrete to asphalt back to

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.779 
will go from concrete to asphalt back to
concrete<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.480> you<00:00:59.539> have<00:00:59.899> to<00:01:00.079> be<00:01:00.109> very<00:01:00.289> in<00:01:01.190> touch

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789

with<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.149> car<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:02.719> have<00:01:02.839> to<00:01:02.960> be<00:01:03.050> able<00:01:03.109> to

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
with the car and you have to be able to

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.960 
with the car and you have to be able to
feel<00:01:03.559> what<00:01:03.829> surface<00:01:04.220> you're<00:01:04.370> going<00:01:04.580> on<00:01:04.730> to<00:01:04.909> you

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
feel what surface you're going on to you

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.930 
feel what surface you're going on to you
and<00:01:05.030> prep<00:01:05.390> for<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:05.930> just<00:01:06.740> be<00:01:06.890> very<00:01:07.250> very

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
and prep for it and just be very very

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.030 
and prep for it and just be very very
careful<00:01:08.300> with<00:01:08.780> where<00:01:09.500> you're<00:01:09.650> putting<00:01:09.800> the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
careful with where you're putting the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.850 
careful with where you're putting the
car<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.850> initial<00:01:11.090> turn<00:01:11.540> for<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.050> formula<00:01:12.740> of

car the initial turn for the formula of

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.790 
car the initial turn for the formula of
course<00:01:13.159> is<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.690> 90<00:01:14.690> degree<00:01:14.810> right<00:01:15.260> known<00:01:15.620> as

course is a 90 degree right known as

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.510 
course is a 90 degree right known as
turn<00:01:16.100> nine<00:01:16.370> it's<00:01:17.110> definitely<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.439> car<00:01:18.920> killer<00:01:19.250> a

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
turn nine it's definitely a car killer a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.179 
turn nine it's definitely a car killer a
lot<00:01:20.119> of<00:01:20.240> people<00:01:20.420> overshoot<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.350> turn<00:01:21.590> they<00:01:22.009> go

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
lot of people overshoot the turn they go

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.039 
lot of people overshoot the turn they go
in<00:01:22.369> too<00:01:22.549> fast<00:01:22.820> it's<00:01:23.390> probably<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.750> hairiest

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
in too fast it's probably the hairiest

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.780 
in too fast it's probably the hairiest
turn<00:01:24.290> in<00:01:24.439> formula<00:01:24.829> G<00:01:24.979> because<00:01:25.399> a<00:01:25.430> lot<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.640> the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
turn in formula G because a lot of the

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.940 
turn in formula G because a lot of the
tracks<00:01:26.060> have<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.299> lot<00:01:26.509> of<00:01:26.540> runoff<00:01:26.869> they're<00:01:27.500> open

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
tracks have a lot of runoff they're open

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.039 
tracks have a lot of runoff they're open
so<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:28.610> can<00:01:28.790> just<00:01:28.820> fly<00:01:29.210> off<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.600> end<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:30.020> know

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
so you can just fly off the end you know

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.810 
so you can just fly off the end you know
and<00:01:30.320> go<00:01:30.439> in<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.649> gravel<00:01:31.009> pit<00:01:31.219> my<00:01:31.700> initial
