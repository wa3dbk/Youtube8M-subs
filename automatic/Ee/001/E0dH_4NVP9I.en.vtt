00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.170
 to the main resources of one 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.639
 Every computer system includes the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.840
 hard drives and the ones on them 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.790
 available storage space 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 so will be synonymous most windows 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.800
 systems with ever larger hard drives 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.869
 equipped or they are going through 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 external hard drives added 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.650
 but a lot of space does not mean 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.900
 the data is safe with that as well 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.330
 These are completely different techniques 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.580
 necessary with the memory places 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.440
 microsoft one of them in the new one 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.600
 operating system windows 8 integrated 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.340
 I show you in this video like you 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.410
 can set up these memory slots 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.600
 and so can use your data 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.829
 much safer to be stored 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.020
 I already have the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.200
 Control Panel started to switch to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 the area system and security 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.430
 there is a new entry with 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.480
 the name memory places me 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.579
 select now 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.980
 Here is also explained again what 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.559
 hiding behind the storage places 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.720
 files can be run on multiple 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.519
 be saved so that they are in front 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.320
 a drive failure safely protected 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.700
 are 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.740
 You can also save these spaces 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.600
 as you like with other hard drives 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.540
 complete the summary of several 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.520
 Memory boards are called cool 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.619
 show him now how to do such a thing 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.660
 create new pool and at one 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.270
 memory space can create this 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.430
 sign immediately shows you that for 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.570
 this activity administrator rights 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.610
 are required 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.130
 that means after one click on 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.050
 this entry is first the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.330
 user account control reports and 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.149
 demands that you intervene 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.670
 agree windows then shows them all 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.550
 disk in the system for this 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.289
 type of storage would be suitable but 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.930
 careful here is also the normal 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.000
 Warning if you have a disk 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.539
 set up to store it for the pool 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.130
 to use then all disappear 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.170
 data on that is called the volume 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.420
 will reformat you should 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.460
 So make sure beforehand if this 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.020
 data carrier is also really free or 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.300
 if you no longer have the data on it 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.550
 You can use the drives 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.520
 the connected through age or esata 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.650
 are and all disk drives are the ones 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.989
 connected to your computer via usb 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.180
 This technique works only with 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.630
 run directly with the computer 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.620
 are connected and which are 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.830
 Hard disk drives are usb sticks 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.960
 you can not use it for this 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.000
 I want two hard disks from the 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.360
 connected to my system via usb 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.630
 are 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.910
 a hard disk with a total of 250 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.910
 Of course, up to 232 are displayed here 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.130
 but hard drives sitting 250 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.610
 gb space and a big one 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.470
 hard disk with 181 so a total of proto 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.960
 two terabytes of storage space 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.820
 this demonstrates a big advantage 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.790
 the space is the same 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.320
 how big the disks are you can 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.670
 different sizes too 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.570
 different models you can see 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.870
 here also on the model name 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.270
 You can use any hard drive in 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.230
 Integrate a memory pool that is 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.990
 very advantageous 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.570
 I press now once on pool 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.180
 create 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.430
 the drives are being prepared 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.350
 pool is created and a new one 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.820
 screen appears in this 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.010
 screen now meet some 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.440
 important decision how should the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.350
 memory space is my name here 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.240
 create these two hard disks and 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.190
 under which drive letter should 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.470
 me this space then to 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.390
 be made available and the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.350
 Perhaps the most important decision of the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.630
 resilience type 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.180
 that's the kind of reliability 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.730
 meant with your new space 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.500
 work select here just like that 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.390
 there is no reliability given that 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.300
 means it is here to completely 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.739
 normal storage space if there is something 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.510
 that means one of the two happens 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.040
 hard drives would break then 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.870
 your data would be lost too 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.709
 use a two way mirroring 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.850
 so the data will be synchronous on both 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.260
 stored drives 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.420
 That still leaves them one 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.739
 copy the file if available 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.060
 For example, a drive fails 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.459
 logically, that's what it's for 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.209
 at least two drives required 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.880
 Choose a three way mirroring way 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.919
 are then at least 5 drives 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.720
 required for this type of 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.360
 Mirroring really works 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.150
 and created three copies of each file 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.710
 become 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.380
 still remain the adjustment parity 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.270
 in each case to the files 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.120
 additional information stored 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.479
 so that they are protected in case of doubt 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.449
 are 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.310
 for such a constellation need 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.650
 you have at least three drives 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.139
 we have two in our example 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.120
 Therefore select drives available 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.520
 In this case, we also use the two paths 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.610
 logically, we are standing 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.400
 then only a terabyte of the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.650
 a total of over 2 terabytes available 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.220
 because yes twice saved 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.360
 should 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.760
 I now also press space 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.000
 create the memory space becomes 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.000
 formatted 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.000
 and windows then gave me this new one 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.820
 created memory space 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.190
 you see it will be the windows immediately 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.260
 explorer opens and offers itself here 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:25.290
 an entry a new drive 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.690
 total memory space of 1 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.330
 terabyte that this space 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.310
 in reality often become 2-run 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.900
 You can not see it because you 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.760
 have something like virtual 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.490
 hard disk applied over both 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.650
 drives are enough and thereby an increased 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.330
 Security offers you have in this 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.610
 video seen how easy it is with 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.950
 help with your data storage 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.260
 safely drop 1 you should at 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.300
 use of this technique but only consider 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.190
 every time you have a new drive 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.700
 create a pool or even a drive 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.950
 pool clear all data on 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.280
 the hard disks used for this purpose 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.320
 deleted 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.870
 the hard drives are getting new every time 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.630
 formatted so convince yourself 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.220
 whether you backed up the data 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.169
 before you have a new storage pool 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.500
 create or save a memory pool again 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.500
 Clear
