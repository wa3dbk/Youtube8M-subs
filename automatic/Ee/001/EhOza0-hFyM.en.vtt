thought<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.569> was<00:01:59.659> rocked<00:01:59.929> at<00:02:00.109> first<00:02:00.349> but<00:02:00.649> it

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
thought it was rocked at first but it

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.330 
thought it was rocked at first but it
was<00:02:00.950> caliche

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
was caliche

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.279 
was caliche
and<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.729> worked<00:02:03.000> at<00:02:03.240> lose<00:02:03.479> gradually<00:02:04.079> by

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
and I worked at lose gradually by

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.740 
and I worked at lose gradually by
soaking<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.130> digging<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:06.090> very<00:02:06.359> slow

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
soaking it and digging it's very slow

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.630 
soaking it and digging it's very slow
took<00:02:07.170> me<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.350> couple<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.770> years<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.280> my<00:02:08.429> whole

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
took me a couple of years to do my whole

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.869 
took me a couple of years to do my whole
yard<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.030> break<00:02:09.209> through<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> caliche<00:02:10.879> and

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
yard to break through the caliche and

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.009 
yard to break through the caliche and
then<00:02:12.269> you<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:14.190> work<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.670> paper<00:02:14.910> into<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.840> or

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
then you just work the paper into it or

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.410 
then you just work the paper into it or
into<00:02:16.470> your<00:02:16.680> soil<00:02:16.920> or<00:02:17.280> your<00:02:17.430> sand<00:02:17.760> or<00:02:18.090> whatever

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
into your soil or your sand or whatever

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.070 
into your soil or your sand or whatever
you're<00:02:18.629> working<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:19.220> about<00:02:20.690> which<00:02:21.690> if<00:02:21.959> you

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
you're working with about which if you

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.650 
you're working with about which if you
want<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.349> be<00:02:22.440> cautious<00:02:23.069> equal<00:02:23.940> parts<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:24.629> I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
want to be cautious equal parts but I

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.930 
want to be cautious equal parts but I
actually<00:02:24.930> went<00:02:25.349> about<00:02:25.590> three<00:02:25.980> parts<00:02:26.370> paper<00:02:26.670> to

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
actually went about three parts paper to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.589 
actually went about three parts paper to
one<00:02:27.209> part<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.780> dirt<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.519> then<00:02:29.519> it's<00:02:30.180> very

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
one part of dirt and then it's very

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.500 
one part of dirt and then it's very
important<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.410> mix<00:02:31.879> nitrogen<00:02:32.879> into<00:02:33.120> it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
important that you mix nitrogen into it

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.330 
important that you mix nitrogen into it
if<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:34.620> not<00:02:34.769> mix<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.489> nitrogen<00:02:36.209> into<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
if you do not mix the nitrogen into the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.300 
if you do not mix the nitrogen into the
composting<00:02:38.340> paper<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:39.780> will<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.310> curtis's

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
composting paper you will have curtis's

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.740 
composting paper you will have curtis's
paper<00:02:42.200> good<00:02:43.200> paper<00:02:43.500> stockpile<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.970> that's

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
paper good paper stockpile and that's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.509 
paper good paper stockpile and that's
what's<00:02:46.019> really<00:02:46.319> wrong<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.160> doesn't

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
what's really wrong here is it doesn't

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.740 
what's really wrong here is it doesn't
have<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.790> nitrogen<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.360> speed<00:02:48.569> your

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
have the nitrogen to speed your

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.600 
have the nitrogen to speed your
organisms<00:02:49.410> which<00:02:49.709> will<00:02:49.920> do<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.160> decomposed

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
organisms which will do the decomposed

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.130 
organisms which will do the decomposed
act<00:02:50.879> we're<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.360> soil<00:02:51.660> you've<00:02:51.810> got<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> lot<00:02:52.110> of

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
act we're in soil you've got a lot of

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140 
act we're in soil you've got a lot of
organisms<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.860> soil<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.819> you've<00:02:53.970> got<00:02:54.120> to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
organisms in the soil but you've got to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.910 
organisms in the soil but you've got to
give<00:02:54.299> them<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> nitrogen<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.410> feed<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
give them the nitrogen to feed the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.369 
give them the nitrogen to feed the
process<00:02:56.430> that's<00:02:56.819> correct<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.900> what<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.230> would

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
process that's correct so what I would

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.430 
process that's correct so what I would
do<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.010> mix<00:02:59.430> my<00:02:59.780> paper<00:03:00.780> with<00:03:01.379> my<00:03:01.410> soil<00:03:01.860> and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
do is I mix my paper with my soil and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.240 
do is I mix my paper with my soil and
then<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.590> sprinkle<00:03:05.160> in<00:03:05.340> not<00:03:06.000> nitrogen<00:03:07.250> and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
then I sprinkle in not nitrogen and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.160 
then I sprinkle in not nitrogen and
ammonium<00:03:09.150> sulfate<00:03:09.569> here<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.019> could<00:03:10.139> use

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
ammonium sulfate here but you could use

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.660 
ammonium sulfate here but you could use
the<00:03:10.350> money<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.650> nitrate<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.250> could<00:03:11.370> use<00:03:11.489> any

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
the money of nitrate you could use any

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.640 
the money of nitrate you could use any
lawn<00:03:11.970> fertilizer<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:13.079> contains<00:03:13.440> nitrogen

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
lawn fertilizer that contains nitrogen

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.479 
lawn fertilizer that contains nitrogen
and<00:03:14.549> Nick<00:03:15.030> city<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.569> don't<00:03:15.810> know<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.260> cup<00:03:17.160> to

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
and Nick city and I don't know a cup to

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.120 
and Nick city and I don't know a cup to
a<00:03:17.910> two<00:03:18.239> foot<00:03:18.450> square<00:03:18.780> or<00:03:18.959> something<00:03:19.440> take<00:03:19.980> it

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
a two foot square or something take it

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.099 
a two foot square or something take it
all<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.489> together<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.239> then<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.840> other<00:03:22.019> thing

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
all in together and then the other thing

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.650 
all in together and then the other thing
is<00:03:22.560> it'll<00:03:23.069> just<00:03:23.370> sit<00:03:23.670> there<00:03:24.000> if<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.450> don't

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
is it'll just sit there if you don't

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.470 
is it'll just sit there if you don't

least for the first couple weeks and
then<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.280> just<00:03:32.459> let<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.060> do<00:03:33.180> its<00:03:33.359> thing<00:03:33.480> how

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019

hands
so<00:04:04.799> that's<00:04:05.069> easy<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.640> do<00:04:05.760> but<00:04:05.909> remember<00:04:06.269> the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
so that's easy to do but remember the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.770 
so that's easy to do but remember the
soil<00:04:06.780> mix<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.319> in<00:04:07.439> add<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.700> nitrogen<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.329> add

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
soil mix it in add the nitrogen and add

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.780 
soil mix it in add the nitrogen and add
the<00:04:09.900> water<00:04:10.109> or<00:04:10.829> put<00:04:11.129> it<00:04:11.249> down<00:04:11.370> as<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.519> mulch

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
the water or put it down as a mulch

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.129 
the water or put it down as a mulch
water<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.269> down<00:04:12.389> so<00:04:12.629> it<00:04:12.659> doesn't<00:04:12.989> blow<00:04:13.049> away

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
water it down so it doesn't blow away

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.440 
water it down so it doesn't blow away
and<00:04:13.680> then<00:04:14.010> let<00:04:14.189> it<00:04:14.219> slowly<00:04:14.549> decompose<00:04:15.120> there

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
and then let it slowly decompose there

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.120 
and then let it slowly decompose there
but<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.019> said<00:04:16.169> in<00:04:16.289> this<00:04:16.380> one<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.650> also<00:04:16.799> did

but you said in this one you also did
the<00:04:17.340> whole<00:04:17.579> composting<00:04:18.329> where<00:04:18.449> you<00:04:18.509> dig<00:04:18.750> a

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
the whole composting where you dig a

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.499 
the whole composting where you dig a
