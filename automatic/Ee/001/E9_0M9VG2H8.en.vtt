00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.380 
love this figure now I will make one
little<00:03:51.709> recommendation<00:03:52.519> for<00:03:52.700> you<00:03:52.790> guys<00:03:55.390> if

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
little recommendation for you guys if

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.960 
little recommendation for you guys if
you<00:03:56.570> want<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.870> give<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.170> Joker<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.590> weapon<00:03:58.130> this

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
you want to give the Joker a weapon this

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.490 
you want to give the Joker a weapon this
is<00:03:59.120> what<00:03:59.239> I<00:03:59.269> recommend<00:03:59.780> this<00:03:59.930> is<00:04:00.110> one<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.380> the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
is what I recommend this is one of the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.009 
is what I recommend this is one of the
pistol<00:04:01.160> pieces<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:01.820> think<00:04:02.630> this<00:04:02.750> is<00:04:02.900> an

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
pistol pieces I think this is an

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.199 
pistol pieces I think this is an
official<00:04:03.380> Lego<00:04:03.560> piece<00:04:03.890> I'm<00:04:04.070> not<00:04:04.220> too<00:04:04.489> sure<00:04:04.790> I

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
official Lego piece I'm not too sure I

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.270 
official Lego piece I'm not too sure I
bought<00:04:06.170> this<00:04:06.290> off<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.500> brick<00:04:06.830> link<00:04:07.070> so<00:04:07.190> I'm

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
bought this off a brick link so I'm

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.750 
bought this off a brick link so I'm
assuming<00:04:07.610> it<00:04:07.880> is<00:04:08.030> but<00:04:09.070> basically<00:04:10.070> I<00:04:10.370> believe

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
assuming it is but basically I believe

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.030 
assuming it is but basically I believe
the<00:04:10.940> gun<00:04:11.150> at<00:04:11.660> least<00:04:11.900> in<00:04:12.049> origins<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.739> believe

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
the gun at least in origins I believe

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.699 
the gun at least in origins I believe
it's<00:04:13.220> called<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.489> ace<00:04:13.610> of<00:04:13.820> spades<00:04:14.410> I'm<00:04:15.410> just

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
it's called the ace of spades I'm just

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:16.990 
it's called the ace of spades I'm just
gonna<00:04:15.830> go<00:04:16.010> ahead<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.340> give<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.820> him

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
gonna go ahead and give that to him

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.620 
gonna go ahead and give that to him
because<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.479> looks<00:04:18.729> Joker<00:04:19.729> ish<00:04:19.850> like<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.419> looks

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
because it looks Joker ish like it looks

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.469 
because it looks Joker ish like it looks
like<00:04:20.810> his<00:04:20.989> gun<00:04:21.260> from<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.620> arkham<00:04:22.010> verse<00:04:22.160> and

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479
