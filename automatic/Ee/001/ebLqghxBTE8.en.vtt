hello<00:00:12.510> youtube<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.020> Mach<00:00:13.470> speed<00:00:13.650> gaming<00:00:13.980> and

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
hello youtube this Mach speed gaming and

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.140 
hello youtube this Mach speed gaming and
today<00:00:14.309> we're<00:00:14.520> going<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.670> be<00:00:14.760> showing<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.120> how

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
today we're going to be showing you how

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.830 
today we're going to be showing you how
to<00:00:15.210> make<00:00:15.389> redstone<00:00:15.690> clock<00:00:17.360> the<00:00:18.360> building<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
to make redstone clock the building of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.300 
to make redstone clock the building of
the<00:00:18.930> actual<00:00:19.230> circuitry<00:00:19.830> for<00:00:19.860> a<00:00:20.040> redstone

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
the actual circuitry for a redstone

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.190 
the actual circuitry for a redstone
clock<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.820> actually<00:00:21.119> pretty<00:00:21.330> simple<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:21.840> then

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
clock is actually pretty simple but then

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.140 
clock is actually pretty simple but then
comes<00:00:22.590> complicated<00:00:23.310> part<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.730> let's<00:00:23.910> start

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
comes complicated part so let's start

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.230 
comes complicated part so let's start
out<00:00:24.480> with<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.660> easy<00:00:24.900> part<00:00:25.850> first<00:00:26.850> you<00:00:27.030> want<00:00:27.180> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
out with the easy part first you want to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.689 
out with the easy part first you want to
place<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> redstone<00:00:27.600> repeater<00:00:28.110> here<00:00:28.340> then<00:00:29.340> on

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
place a redstone repeater here then on

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.479 
place a redstone repeater here then on
the<00:00:30.030> other<00:00:30.060> side<00:00:30.619> opposite<00:00:31.619> way<00:00:31.770> going<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the other side opposite way going the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.040 
the other side opposite way going the
opposite<00:00:32.820> way<00:00:32.940> you're<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> want<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
opposite way you're going to want to

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.939 
opposite way you're going to want to
place<00:00:34.230> another<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:35.120> take<00:00:36.120> redstone<00:00:36.949> it's

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
place another one take redstone it's

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.719 
place another one take redstone it's
like<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.699> on<00:00:39.330> the<00:00:39.420> other<00:00:39.510> sizable<00:00:40.729> then

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:41.729 
like that and on the other sizable then

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.759 
like that and on the other sizable then
here<00:00:41.909> comes<00:00:42.089> the<00:00:42.180> tricky<00:00:42.330> part<00:00:42.659> its<00:00:43.320> power<00:00:43.530> 8

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
here comes the tricky part its power 8

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.189 
here comes the tricky part its power 8
you<00:00:43.890> put<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> redstone<00:00:44.280> torch<00:00:44.809> not<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.960> make<00:00:46.080> it

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
you put a redstone torch not to make it

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.680 
you put a redstone torch not to make it
pull<00:00:46.409> so<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> take<00:00:47.390> red<00:00:48.390> stone

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
pull so you have to take red stone

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.060 
pull so you have to take red stone
powder<00:00:49.640> break<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.909> of<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.089> corners<00:00:51.540> and<00:00:52.070> then

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
powder break one of the corners and then

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.780 
powder break one of the corners and then
replace<00:00:53.339> it<00:00:53.460> right<00:00:53.970> away<00:00:55.159> if<00:00:56.159> you<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.370> too<00:00:56.549> fast

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
replace it right away if you do too fast

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.369 
replace it right away if you do too fast
it<00:00:56.940> will<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.239> work<00:00:57.269> it's<00:00:57.570> very<00:00:57.839> buggy<00:00:58.049> because

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it will not work it's very buggy because

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.850 
it will not work it's very buggy because
it's<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.589> glitch<00:00:58.830> but<00:00:59.159> bear<00:00:59.909> with<00:00:59.940> me<00:01:00.710> there<00:01:01.710> we

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
it's a glitch but bear with me there we

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.700 
it's a glitch but bear with me there we
go<00:01:02.690> alright<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.320> made<00:01:04.530> your

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
go alright so there we made your

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.630 
go alright so there we made your
redstone<00:01:05.010> clock<00:01:06.440> that's<00:01:07.440> use<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.520> make

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
redstone clock that's use this and make

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760 
redstone clock that's use this and make
use<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.119> rather<00:01:09.270> than<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.810> being<00:01:10.020> looking

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
use of it rather than just being looking

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.090 
use of it rather than just being looking
pretty<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.190> something<00:01:12.170> simply<00:01:13.170> extend<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
pretty or something simply extend it and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.760 
pretty or something simply extend it and
play<00:01:14.730> something<00:01:15.120> on<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> power<00:01:15.480> like<00:01:15.660> a<00:01:15.690> door

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.270 

not<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.510> much<00:01:21.510> relaxing<00:01:22.290> thing<00:01:22.800> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.130> do

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
not the much relaxing thing you can do

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.890 
not the much relaxing thing you can do
with<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:24.470> mostly<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> most<00:01:25.800> annoying<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:27.780> an

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
with this mostly the most annoying is an

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.920 
with this mostly the most annoying is an
iron<00:01:28.110> door<00:01:28.700> excuse<00:01:29.700> my<00:01:29.880> texture<00:01:30.270> packs<00:01:30.480> a<00:01:30.750> bit

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
iron door excuse my texture packs a bit

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.440 
iron door excuse my texture packs a bit
weird

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
weird

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.640 
weird
please<00:01:34.930> or<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:36.159> piston

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.470 

it's<00:01:41.160> a<00:01:41.220> little<00:01:41.400> too<00:01:41.520> fast<00:01:41.730> for<00:01:41.940> two<00:01:42.000> pistons

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
it's a little too fast for two pistons

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.320 
it's a little too fast for two pistons
little<00:01:42.720> buggy

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:53.160 

alright<00:01:46.330> or<00:01:46.540> a<00:01:46.570> note<00:01:47.050> block<00:01:51.450> or<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.510> dispenser

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
alright or a note block or a dispenser

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.290 
alright or a note block or a dispenser
but<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.950> Spencer's<00:01:54.400> a<00:01:54.430> little<00:01:54.700> tricky<00:01:54.940> so<00:01:55.240> to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
but the Spencer's a little tricky so to

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.400 
but the Spencer's a little tricky so to
power<00:01:55.690> your<00:01:55.930> net<00:01:56.230> to<00:01:56.350> place<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.530> redstone<00:01:56.710> torch

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
power your net to place a redstone torch

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.570 
power your net to place a redstone torch
then<00:01:59.410> whenever<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.890> place<00:02:00.100> in<00:02:00.250> there<00:02:00.430> it'll

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
then whenever you place in there it'll

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.270 
then whenever you place in there it'll
ject<00:02:01.050> it'll<00:02:02.050> shoot<00:02:02.230> arrows<00:02:02.500> by<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.010> way<00:02:03.130> if

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
ject it'll shoot arrows by the way if

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.360 
ject it'll shoot arrows by the way if
you<00:02:03.430> know<00:02:03.700> that<00:02:03.730> already<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.890> there<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.340> have

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
you know that already so there you have

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.040 
you know that already so there you have
it<00:02:06.520> how<00:02:06.730> to<00:02:06.760> build<00:02:07.000> redstone<00:02:07.450> clock<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.900> can

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
it how to build redstone clock you can

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.740 
it how to build redstone clock you can
also<00:02:08.200> extend<00:02:08.710> it<00:02:09.070> out<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:11.160> like<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.400> um<00:02:12.750> place

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
also extend it out I like that um place

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.970 
also extend it out I like that um place
a<00:02:13.780> repeater<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.580> then<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:16.030> pulse<00:02:16.330> gets

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
a repeater and then the pulse gets

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.230 
a repeater and then the pulse gets
lengthens<00:02:18.930> if<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.230> adjust<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.400> will<00:02:21.880> as

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
lengthens if you adjust it it will as

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.180 
lengthens if you adjust it it will as
you<00:02:23.020> can<00:02:23.200> see<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.860> will<00:02:23.980> stop<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.310> pulse<00:02:26.190> so

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
you can see it will stop the pulse so

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.290 
you can see it will stop the pulse so
yeah<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.050> also<00:02:29.170> make<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:31.060> whole

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
yeah you can also make the the whole

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.130 
yeah you can also make the the whole
circuitry<00:02:32.020> bigger<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.590> add<00:02:32.710> more<00:02:33.130> redstone

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
circuitry bigger and add more redstone

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.270 
circuitry bigger and add more redstone
repeaters<00:02:35.140> there<00:02:35.380> if<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.620> want<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.010> and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
repeaters there if you want to and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.760 
repeaters there if you want to and
