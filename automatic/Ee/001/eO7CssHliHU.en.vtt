the<00:01:26.400> most<00:01:26.610> expensive<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.390> well<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.990> either

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the most expensive as well but either

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.990 
the most expensive as well but either
way<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.380> main<00:01:28.619> question<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.430> video<00:01:29.759> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
way the main question in this video is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330 
way the main question in this video is
what<00:01:30.360> types<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.780> weapons<00:01:30.960> will<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.100> red

this<00:01:36.570> moment<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.020> time<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.380> don't<00:01:37.560> exactly

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
this moment in time we don't exactly

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.520 
this moment in time we don't exactly
know<00:01:38.250> where<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.670> game<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:39.180> take<00:01:39.329> place

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
know where this game will take place

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.660 
know where this game will take place
meaning<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.890> still<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> late

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
meaning will it still be in the late

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.850 
meaning will it still be in the late
19th<00:01:42.119> century<00:01:42.600> or<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.110> actually<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.500> in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
19th century or will it actually be in

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.039 
19th century or will it actually be in
the<00:01:44.009> early<00:01:44.280> 20th<00:01:44.790> century<00:01:44.820> because<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the early 20th century because if it is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.960 
the early 20th century because if it is
in<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.350> early<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.710> 20th<00:01:47.189> century<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.729> would

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
in the early of 20th century we would

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.760 
in the early of 20th century we would
definitely<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> load<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.960> new<00:01:49.259> weapons

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
definitely have a load of new weapons

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.530 
definitely have a load of new weapons
whereas<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> late<00:01:51.090> 19th

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
whereas if it is in the late 19th

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.899 
whereas if it is in the late 19th
century<00:01:51.659> there<00:01:52.200> isn't<00:01:52.530> many<00:01:52.710> weapons<00:01:53.070> or<00:01:53.579> new

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
century there isn't many weapons or new

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.550 
century there isn't many weapons or new
weapons<00:01:54.299> should<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.509> say<00:01:54.750> about<00:01:55.079> Rockstar

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
weapons should I say about Rockstar

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.179 
weapons should I say about Rockstar
could<00:01:55.710> add

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
could add

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.920 
could add
but<00:01:56.430> either<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.149> weapons<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.600> would<00:01:57.780> love

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
but either way what weapons I would love

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.510 
but either way what weapons I would love
to<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.200> making<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.680> parents<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.130> Red<00:01:59.340> Dead

to see making a parents in Red Dead
Redemption<00:01:59.640> -<00:02:00.180> would<00:02:00.360> definitely<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.409> be

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
Redemption - would definitely have to be

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.859 
Redemption - would definitely have to be
a<00:02:01.590> chainsaw<00:02:02.130> chainsaws<00:02:03.090> are<00:02:03.119> probably<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.840> of

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
a chainsaw chainsaws are probably one of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870 
a chainsaw chainsaws are probably one of
my<00:02:04.049> all-time<00:02:04.229> favorite<00:02:04.920> melee<00:02:05.130> weapons<00:02:05.610> it's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
my all-time favorite melee weapons it's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.160 
my all-time favorite melee weapons it's
just<00:02:06.090> one<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.329> those<00:02:06.509> weapons<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.110> are

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
just one of those weapons that are

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.760 
just one of those weapons that are
really

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
really

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.469 
really
to<00:02:07.890> having<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.280> game<00:02:08.489> especially<00:02:08.759> when<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.360> are

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
to having a game especially when you are

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.029 
to having a game especially when you are
just<00:02:09.599> running<00:02:09.780> around<00:02:10.050> doing<00:02:10.560> random<00:02:10.920> stuff

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
just running around doing random stuff

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.949 
just running around doing random stuff
and<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:11.849> honestly<00:02:12.000> think<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.690> chainsaw

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
and I honestly think that a chainsaw

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.900 
and I honestly think that a chainsaw
would<00:02:13.290> fit<00:02:13.500> perfectly<00:02:13.980> into<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.489> read<00:02:14.700> their

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
would fit perfectly into a read their

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.820 
would fit perfectly into a read their
Redemption<00:02:15.180> -<00:02:15.629> I<00:02:15.930> had<00:02:16.200> sure<00:02:16.349> we<00:02:16.470> could<00:02:16.650> just

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
Redemption - I had sure we could just

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.740 
Redemption - I had sure we could just
see<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.459> game<00:02:17.640> probably<00:02:18.239> being<00:02:18.480> used

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
see it in the game probably being used

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.570 
see it in the game probably being used
as<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> torture<00:02:19.379> weapon<00:02:19.950> or<00:02:20.099> something<00:02:20.280> like

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
as a torture weapon or something like

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.369 
as a torture weapon or something like
that<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:21.030> don't<00:02:21.090> really<00:02:21.360> know<00:02:21.599> how<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.810> explain

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
that I don't really know how to explain

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.990 
that I don't really know how to explain
it<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.800> can<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.010> picture<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.580> being<00:02:23.610> used

it but I can just picture it being used

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.670 
it but I can just picture it being used
by<00:02:24.180> one<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.420> those<00:02:24.569> sort<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.019> people<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.560> like

throw<00:02:51.450> knives<00:02:51.720> around<00:02:52.079> was<00:02:52.230> just<00:02:52.410> really<00:02:52.709> fun

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950

I'm sure a lot of you guys will agree

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.240 
I'm sure a lot of you guys will agree
with<00:02:54.660> me<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.170> if<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.380> next<00:02:55.620> weapon<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.040> would

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
with me so if a next weapon that I would

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.039 
with me so if a next weapon that I would
like<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.610> see<00:02:56.760> would<00:02:56.940> have<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.329> be<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.599> tommy<00:02:57.930> gun

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
like to see would have to be a tommy gun

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.870 
like to see would have to be a tommy gun
now<00:02:58.650> like<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> said<00:02:59.099> at<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.340> beginning<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.790> the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
now like I said at the beginning of the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.940 
now like I said at the beginning of the
video<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.360> all<00:03:00.510> does<00:03:00.720> depend<00:03:01.170> where<00:03:01.440> this<00:03:01.680> will

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
video it all does depend where this will

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.589 
video it all does depend where this will
take<00:03:02.190> place<00:03:02.430> at<00:03:02.670> what<00:03:02.819> time<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.239> will<00:03:03.360> take

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
take place at what time it will take

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.199 
take place at what time it will take
place<00:03:03.840> if<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.500> around<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.069> 1930s<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.120> I

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
place if it is around in the 1930s and I

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.970 
place if it is around in the 1930s and I
think<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.540> tommy<00:03:06.780> gun<00:03:06.870> would<00:03:07.200> probably<00:03:07.709> fit

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
think a tommy gun would probably fit

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.860 
think a tommy gun would probably fit
perfectly<00:03:08.519> in<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.790> game<00:03:09.090> whereas<00:03:09.569> of<00:03:09.690> course

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
perfectly in the game whereas of course

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.270 
perfectly in the game whereas of course
if<00:03:10.019> it<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.170> still<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> late<00:03:10.799> 19th<00:03:11.190> century

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
if it is still in the late 19th century

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.250 
if it is still in the late 19th century
then<00:03:11.760> seen<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.000> tommy<00:03:12.299> gun<00:03:12.420> would<00:03:12.750> kind<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.109> be<00:03:13.230> a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
then seen a tommy gun would kind of be a

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.140 
then seen a tommy gun would kind of be a
bit<00:03:13.500> strange<00:03:13.950> but<00:03:14.400> either<00:03:14.549> way<00:03:14.730> I'm<00:03:14.850> not<00:03:14.880> too

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
bit strange but either way I'm not too

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.180 
bit strange but either way I'm not too
bothered<00:03:15.359> where<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.079> set<00:03:16.440> or<00:03:16.590> what<00:03:16.799> time<00:03:17.040> it

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
bothered where it is set or what time it

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.830 
bothered where it is set or what time it
is<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.609> just<00:03:17.700> want<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.030> see<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> tommy<00:03:18.450> gun<00:03:18.540> make

really cool-looking and powerful guns as
well<00:03:22.290> now<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.010> don't<00:03:23.160> know<00:03:23.370> about<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.700> guys<00:03:23.880> but

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
when I hear tommy guns I kind of think

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.250 
when I hear tommy guns I kind of think
of<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.190> Mafia<00:03:26.639> I<00:03:26.819> have<00:03:27.000> no<00:03:27.209> idea<00:03:27.600> why<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.049> would

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
of the Mafia I have no idea why I would

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.809 
of the Mafia I have no idea why I would
imagine<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.709> is<00:03:28.799> because<00:03:29.160> tommy<00:03:29.400> guns<00:03:29.670> were

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
imagine it is because tommy guns were

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.000 
imagine it is because tommy guns were
probably<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.510> most<00:03:30.720> popular<00:03:31.230> weapon<00:03:31.709> with

you hear revolvers you probably get the

that<00:04:38.539> is<00:04:38.660> definitely<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:39.139> must-have<00:04:39.530> weapon<00:04:39.979> in

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099

Red<00:04:40.280> Dead<00:04:40.430> Redemption<00:04:40.580> too<00:04:41.120> as<00:04:41.270> well<00:04:41.479> pick<00:04:42.139> us

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
Red Dead Redemption too as well pick us

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.839 
Red Dead Redemption too as well pick us
I'm<00:04:42.440> pretty<00:04:42.680> sure<00:04:42.830> we<00:04:42.979> did<00:04:43.160> get<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.460> use<00:04:43.610> one<00:04:43.639> in

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
I'm pretty sure we did get to use one in

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.400 
I'm pretty sure we did get to use one in
the<00:04:43.970> first<00:04:44.300> one<00:04:44.509> but<00:04:44.539> we<00:04:44.750> couldn't<00:04:45.080> just<00:04:45.139> run

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
the first one but we couldn't just run

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.050 
the first one but we couldn't just run
around<00:04:45.590> with<00:04:45.979> it<00:04:46.099> which<00:04:46.220> this<00:04:46.460> kind<00:04:46.669> of<00:04:46.880> suck

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
around with it which this kind of suck

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.909 
around with it which this kind of suck
but<00:04:47.419> hopefully<00:04:47.810> things<00:04:48.110> will<00:04:48.199> change<00:04:48.410> when

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
but hopefully things will change when

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.010 
but hopefully things will change when
Bay<00:04:49.220> released<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.729> second<00:04:50.120> one<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.449> apart<00:04:50.870> from

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
Bay released a second one and apart from

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.450

just<00:04:51.199> weapons<00:04:51.620> itself<00:04:52.039> all<00:04:52.159> would<00:04:52.280> like<00:04:52.400> to

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
just weapons itself all would like to

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.760 
just weapons itself all would like to
see<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.699> lot<00:04:52.880> of<00:04:52.970> customization<00:04:53.449> maybe<00:04:54.110> not<00:04:54.470> too

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
see a lot of customization maybe not too

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.740 
see a lot of customization maybe not too
much<00:04:55.069> but<00:04:55.400> just<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.729> basics<00:04:56.180> like<00:04:56.360> having<00:04:56.659> a
