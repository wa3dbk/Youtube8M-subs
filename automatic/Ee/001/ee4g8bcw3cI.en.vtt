00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.950
 so let's start in the left hand put a chord 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.950
 am 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.770
 in the right hand we will use 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.770
 bust 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.450
 there will be 5 string 3 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:42.329
 2 videos 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:45.739
 first opening so strings 1 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.739
 after all 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.769
 we start not to pass 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.800
 so still 1 5 2 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.220
 will be the first 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.220
 these 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.570
 because the ambassador 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.750
 anonymous 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.750
 what 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 and so we started with the Kurds A.M. 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.700
 there 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.130
 eagle 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.200
 further understood Courbet and I do not much 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 fistula kurds and 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.289
 c 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.120
 ship ni 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.920
 be 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.920
 she is not with us 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.170
 the word you scout them 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.280
 you 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.050
 need chords not so we play 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.880
 every couplet 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.790
 here we have 5 verses 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.680
 such a form is common 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.260
 when we have a couplet and after 4 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.060
 lines last two lines as 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.430
 chorus we repeat this is not 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.590
 sure you can do for example 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.500
 some verses to repeat the last 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.270
 two lines in some not repeat and in 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.830
 late last these last two 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.400
 lines that we repeat they will 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.140
 serve 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.140
 chorus so try to sing slowly 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.150
 catch fire 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.540
 the dawn 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.200
 my 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.100
 from the way we Sgiach 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.490
 perhaps 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.490
 vp 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.870
 so now I will play only a compliment 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.870
 try month 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.390
 but 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.900
 Yes 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.360
 and as usual here in every chord 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.990
 you should always remember how much 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.120
 time we play well, that is the sorting at 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.600
 how long do we keep one or the other 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.770
 a chord here will naturally help 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.900
 of course you hear well, I'll explain right away 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.690
 some moments mean at first 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:08.410
 goes about and we play 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.410
 two times once we take this 1 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.340
 tom e 1 time 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.020
 by the name of us 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.340
 Dalida and times 1 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.340
 g1 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.340
 f1 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.690
 twice 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.639
 a 5 1 1 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.110
 one 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.900
 I attach the German 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.889
 and repeat and here from this place 30 pens 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.180
 loop and 2 times 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.050
 his 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.050
 times 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.350
 I myself 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.350
 not 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:56.360
 thus feels the song can be played 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.360
 accompaniment in the right hand 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.650
 of 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.770
 conceived 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.030
 think 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.270
 with 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.629
 here we will no longer appliance brothers 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.629
 pinch 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.960
 of 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.380
 can choose for yourself what is convenient for you 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.250
 play brute with or without accompaniment 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.250
 her either tweaks
