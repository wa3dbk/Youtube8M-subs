are really important for us to talk
about<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.339> how<00:00:21.089> we've<00:00:21.749> designed<00:00:21.929> this<00:00:22.320> shoe

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
about is how we've designed this shoe

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.069 
about is how we've designed this shoe
from<00:00:22.919> the<00:00:23.009> bottom<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.429> and<00:00:23.550> we're<00:00:24.150> using<00:00:24.359> an

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
from the bottom up and we're using an

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.620 
from the bottom up and we're using an
existing<00:00:25.640> technology<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.939> we've<00:00:27.089> launched

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
existing technology that we've launched

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.319 
existing technology that we've launched
in<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.749> CP<00:00:28.050> 3.4<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> that's<00:00:29.550> using<00:00:29.849> paja<00:00:30.060> line

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
in the CP 3.4 and that's using paja line

where the harder film is located on
issue<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.930> we've<00:00:46.620> done<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:46.949> to<00:00:47.789> provide

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
issue and we've done that to provide

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.930 
issue and we've done that to provide
lightweight<00:00:49.140> proposed<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.429> phone<00:00:50.640> system

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
lightweight proposed in the phone system

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.009 
lightweight proposed in the phone system
to<00:00:51.660> give<00:00:52.079> CP<00:00:52.559> more<00:00:53.280> responsiveness<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.390> his

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
to give CP more responsiveness and his

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.319 
to give CP more responsiveness and his
product<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.399> was<00:00:56.699> first<00:00:56.940> introduced

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
product and so that was first introduced

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.160 
product and so that was first introduced
on<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.859> front<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> CP<00:00:59.579> three<00:00:59.879> work<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
on the front on the CP three work and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.000 
on the front on the CP three work and
we're<00:01:01.550> getting<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.480> there<00:01:03.870> too<00:01:04.739> quick

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
we're getting in here to there too quick

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.420 
we're getting in here to there too quick
so<00:01:06.290> very<00:01:07.290> important<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.009> this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
so very important here is that this

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.569 
so very important here is that this
areas<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.360> higher<00:01:09.630> than<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.680> blue<00:01:10.890> area<00:01:11.100> so

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
areas are higher than the blue area so

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.819 
areas are higher than the blue area so
that<00:01:11.610> when<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> step<00:01:12.210> down<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.990> feel<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
that when you step down you feel the

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.980 
that when you step down you feel the
responsiveness<00:01:14.759> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.270> phone<00:01:15.450> under<00:01:15.869> your

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
responsiveness of the phone under your

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
responsiveness of the phone under your
foot<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.740> that's<00:01:16.860> why<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.460> designed<00:01:17.840> we

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
foot and that's why that is designed we

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.050 
foot and that's why that is designed we
also<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.500> traction<00:01:20.009> pattern<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
also have this traction pattern here to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.510 
also have this traction pattern here to
provide<00:01:21.329> great<00:01:21.780> traction<00:01:22.079> for<00:01:22.380> CP<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.979> then

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
provide great traction for CP and then

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.310 
provide great traction for CP and then
when<00:01:23.850> i<00:01:23.880> turn<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.270> shoe<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.049> you

about it but the video games really i

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.580 
about it but the video games really i
believe<00:04:15.640> enhances<00:04:16.239> your<00:04:16.269> acuity<00:04:17.139> I<00:04:17.320> mean<00:04:17.470> it

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
believe enhances your acuity I mean it

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.830 
believe enhances your acuity I mean it
just<00:04:17.680> makes<00:04:17.950> it<00:04:18.070> amazing<00:04:18.280> so<00:04:18.790> he<00:04:19.510> can<00:04:19.630> read<00:04:19.780> the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
just makes it amazing so he can read the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.200 
just makes it amazing so he can read the
floor<00:04:20.079> like<00:04:20.260> no<00:04:20.290> one<00:04:20.590> right<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.609> playing<00:04:22.090> the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
floor like no one right and playing the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.840 
floor like no one right and playing the
game<00:04:22.419> I<00:04:22.660> think<00:04:23.290> heightens<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.830> ability<00:04:24.250> to

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
game I think heightens that ability to

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.930 
game I think heightens that ability to
just<00:04:25.090> be<00:04:25.240> aware<00:04:25.360> of<00:04:25.930> difference<00:04:26.860> or<00:04:27.070> not<00:04:27.490> only

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
just be aware of difference or not only

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.340 
just be aware of difference or not only
playing<00:04:28.240> styles<00:04:28.780> but<00:04:29.050> also<00:04:31.350> basketball

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
playing styles but also basketball

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.830 
playing styles but also basketball
formations<00:04:32.889> that<00:04:33.220> are<00:04:33.550> in<00:04:33.730> play<00:04:33.970> on<00:04:34.210> court<00:04:34.630> so

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
formations that are in play on court so

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.480 
formations that are in play on court so
just<00:04:35.080> before<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.380> reinforces<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.130> game<00:04:36.280> for

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
just before the reinforces the game for

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.430 
just before the reinforces the game for
him<00:04:36.580> right<00:04:37.450> but<00:04:37.690> he's<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.840> he's<00:04:38.050> a<00:04:38.080> huge<00:04:38.290> game

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
him right but he's a he's a huge game

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.550 
him right but he's a he's a huge game
who<00:04:38.740> loves<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:39.130> most
