 in less than five years between 1347 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.640
 and in 1351 the black death caught the 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.840
 pest one third of the european 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.840
 across the population 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.940
 in their fear and ignorance believed 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.930
 the people a punishment of god 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.420
 as the cause of these epidemics 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.450
 the true guilty the bacterium yes 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.880
 sinja pestis could go undetected and 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.510
 unhindered her deadly employment 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.510

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.660
 More than 300 years should pass 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.640
 dutch hand and live under pressure 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.370
 the microscope he developed in 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.120
 a drop of water smallest organisms 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.120
 watching 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.290
 but this strange miniature world became 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.860
 of the organisms not with disease and 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.900
 death associated until the year 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.570
 In 1835 the Italian Agostino Ba them 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.369
 discovered that a microscopic 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.780
 fungi the economically important 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.550
 silkworms fell ill for several years 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.130
 later recognized the French 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.810
 chemist louis pasteur the meaning of 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.830
 microorganisms government processes 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.360
 this and the employment with the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.280
 spots disease of the silkworm 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.170
 convinced him that 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.800
 microorganisms are the cause of 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.720
 Illnesses are fitting with him 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.399
 his views alone and long 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.830
 was doubted by many 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.289
 until the german doctor robert cooks the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.509
 anthrax bacillus as the cause of 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:09.910
 infectious disease recognized cook 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.100
 further research proved that many 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.190
 sorrowful diseases and epidemics like 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.319
 tuberculosis cholera malaria and the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.390
 sleeping sickness by contagion with 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.390
 emerged from living microorganisms 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.200
 according to the current state of knowledge 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.630
 we distinguish different types of 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.510
 pathogenic or pathogenic 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.550
 Germinate and parasitize the word pathogen 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.390
 stood out from the Greek word partners 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.610
 and means pathogenic or pathogenic 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.890
 pathogens vary greatly in 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.110
 their characteristic, however, they are 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.600
 all in or on one 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.010
 living will exist and him more 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.420
 or less harm 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.550
 when considering the individual 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.830
 Pathogens and parasites go 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:11.680
 we look for their size in front of macro parasites 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.430
 are many complex organisms of 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.430
 a few millimeters
