00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
it in a much faster rate I won't be

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.660

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
if the video would be hours in length

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.310 
if the video would be hours in length
now<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.150> model<00:04:31.450> didn't<00:04:31.720> take<00:04:31.870> me<00:04:31.990> hours<00:04:32.140> to

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
sinner ater it's going to take a lot

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.040 
sinner ater it's going to take a lot
