00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
down at the bottom there's a little

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.630 
down at the bottom there's a little
sticker<00:00:38.780> stating<00:00:39.379> this<00:00:39.500> for<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.859> new<00:00:40.100> iphone

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
but spec have got these cases out on the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.189 
but spec have got these cases out on the
market<00:00:43.309> very<00:00:43.579> quickly<00:00:43.699> so<00:00:44.510> we're<00:00:44.780> wondering

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
market very quickly so we're wondering

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:46.479 
market very quickly so we're wondering
if<00:00:45.230> perhaps<00:00:45.440> they<00:00:45.829> didn't<00:00:46.070> know<00:00:46.190> what<00:00:46.339> the

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
if perhaps they didn't know what the

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.000 
if perhaps they didn't know what the
name<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.699> new<00:00:47.239> iphone<00:00:47.690> was<00:00:47.809> going<00:00:48.019> to<00:00:48.140> be<00:00:48.289> so

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
name of new iphone was going to be so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.049 
name of new iphone was going to be so
they<00:00:49.309> thought<00:00:49.489> they'd<00:00:49.640> cover<00:00:49.850> themselves

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
they thought they'd cover themselves

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.180 
they thought they'd cover themselves
either<00:00:50.480> way<00:00:50.809> which<00:00:51.320> we<00:00:51.589> don't<00:00:51.679> blame<00:00:51.949> them<00:00:52.129> for

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
either way which we don't blame them for

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.489 
either way which we don't blame them for
at<00:00:52.460> all<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.120> case<00:00:53.690> manufacturers<00:00:54.379> have

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
at all so case manufacturers have

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:55.930 
at all so case manufacturers have
certainly<00:00:54.829> gone<00:00:54.980> ahead<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.429> game<00:00:55.579> on<00:00:55.789> this

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
certainly gone ahead of the game on this

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.860 
certainly gone ahead of the game on this
one<00:00:57.280> down<00:00:58.280> at<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.579> bottom<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:59.089> also<00:00:59.269> says<00:00:59.659> it's

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
one down at the bottom it also says it's

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.250 
one down at the bottom it also says it's
a<00:00:59.929> pixelskin<00:01:00.320> HD<00:01:00.409> and<00:01:01.339> they<00:01:02.329> described<00:01:03.230> the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
a pixelskin HD and they described the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.730 
a pixelskin HD and they described the
case<00:01:03.649> as<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:03.980> finely<00:01:04.489> tuned<00:01:04.960> low-profile<00:01:05.960> 14

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
case as a finely tuned low-profile 14

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.090 
case as a finely tuned low-profile 14
obviously<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.490> new<00:01:07.640> iphone<00:01:08.260> and<00:01:09.260> as<00:01:09.770> we<00:01:09.920> go<00:01:10.040> to

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
obviously the new iphone and as we go to

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
spec have done with it this time

to<00:01:43.370> what<00:01:43.460> I<00:01:43.520> do<00:01:43.670> but<00:01:44.360> like<00:01:44.540> I<00:01:44.570> say<00:01:44.870> I'm<00:01:45.050> lose<00:01:45.320> a

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
to what I do but like I say I'm lose a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.950 
to what I do but like I say I'm lose a
huge<00:01:45.740> fan<00:01:46.010> of<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.190> ones<00:01:46.430> for<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.700> 4<00:01:46.910> and<00:01:47.030> 4s<00:01:47.270> so

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
huge fan of the ones for the 4 and 4s so

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.570 
huge fan of the ones for the 4 and 4s so
had<00:01:48.110> no<00:01:48.140> worries<00:01:48.740> about<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.070> version<00:01:49.400> for<00:01:49.550> the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
which are much deeper on the back but

which are much deeper on the back but
this<00:02:02.690> one<00:02:02.960> they're<00:02:03.170> very<00:02:03.350> small<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.040> they're

this one they're very small and they're
very<00:02:04.520> flat<00:02:05.030> but<00:02:05.420> they<00:02:05.510> do<00:02:05.570> provide<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:06.050> nice

but<00:02:19.800> I'm<00:02:19.890> going<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.070> tell<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.430> little<00:02:20.490> bit

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
but I'm going to tell you a little bit

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.640 
but I'm going to tell you a little bit
more<00:02:21.150> about<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.570> smaller<00:02:21.840> cut<00:02:22.140> out<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> little

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
more about the smaller cut out a little

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.800 
more about the smaller cut out a little
bit<00:02:22.830> later<00:02:23.070> on<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> video<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.660> is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
bit later on in the video but this is

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.660 
bit later on in the video but this is
something<00:02:25.050> I'm<00:02:25.440> very<00:02:25.470> very<00:02:26.070> impressed<00:02:26.310> with

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
something I'm very very impressed with

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.180 
something I'm very very impressed with
and<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.540> perhaps<00:02:27.990> my<00:02:28.410> favorite<00:02:28.440> feature<00:02:29.010> of

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
and is perhaps my favorite feature of

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.090 
and is perhaps my favorite feature of
the<00:02:29.370> case<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.760> far<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.710> have<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> look<00:02:32.010> at

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
the case so far so as we have a look at

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.440 
the case so far so as we have a look at
the<00:02:32.160> side<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.640> case<00:02:32.820> you've<00:02:33.000> got<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.150> speck

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the side of the case you've got a speck

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.540 
the side of the case you've got a speck
logo<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> little<00:02:34.770> bit<00:02:34.980> hard<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.310> see<00:02:35.520> on

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
logo it is a little bit hard to see on

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.940 
logo it is a little bit hard to see on
the<00:02:35.760> video<00:02:36.080> moving<00:02:37.080> on<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.350> bottom<00:02:37.530> we've

the video moving on to the bottom we've

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.350 
the video moving on to the bottom we've
got<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.220> cutout<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.910> Lightning

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
got the cutout for the Lightning

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.880 
got the cutout for the Lightning
connector<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:40.020> well<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.440> headphone<00:02:40.860> jack

switch cut out and our volume buttons

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.620 
switch cut out and our volume buttons
and<00:02:49.680> then<00:02:50.460> up<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.940> top<00:02:51.120> we've<00:02:51.390> got<00:02:51.420> the

and then up on the top we've got the

wake<00:02:53.640> button<00:02:53.930> we<00:02:54.930> really<00:02:55.320> like<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.770> spec<00:02:56.010> of

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
wake button we really like the spec of

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.950 
wake button we really like the spec of
chosen<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.700> actually<00:02:57.000> place<00:02:57.180> buttons<00:02:57.660> built

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
chosen to actually place buttons built

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.230 
chosen to actually place buttons built
into<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.440> case<00:02:58.650> because<00:02:59.250> although<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.760> TPU

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
into the case because although the TPU

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.870 
into the case because although the TPU
case<00:03:00.570> like<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:01.080> isn't<00:03:01.470> too<00:03:01.620> thick<00:03:01.950> does<00:03:02.700> add

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
case like this isn't too thick does add

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.370 
case like this isn't too thick does add
a<00:03:02.910> little<00:03:03.180> bit<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.420> extra<00:03:03.570> bulk<00:03:03.960> around<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
a little bit of extra bulk around the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.740 
a little bit of extra bulk around the
sides<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:04.980> having<00:03:05.610> these<00:03:05.730> buttons<00:03:06.180> makes<00:03:06.570> it

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
sides so having these buttons makes it

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.810 
sides so having these buttons makes it
much<00:03:06.900> easier<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.650> press<00:03:07.920> then<00:03:08.370> if<00:03:08.490> there<00:03:08.640> was

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
much easier to press then if there was

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.500 
much easier to press then if there was
just<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.360> cut<00:03:09.570> out<00:03:09.780> for<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.910> let's<00:03:12.300> take<00:03:12.450> a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
just to cut out for it so let's take a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.720 
just to cut out for it so let's take a
look<00:03:12.720> at<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> inside<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.620> case<00:03:13.830> spec<00:03:14.580> have

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
look at the inside of the case spec have

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.370 
look at the inside of the case spec have
kept<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.060> really<00:03:15.240> really<00:03:15.510> simple<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.080> they've

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
kept it really really simple and they've
