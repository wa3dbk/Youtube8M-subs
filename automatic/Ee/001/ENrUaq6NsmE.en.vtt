00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.490
 if you want to use a cord with the 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.130
 alone suitably incorporated bisognino 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.950
 prepare the node of the only incorporated 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.150
 when closing the lanyard with 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.530
 open cord tie the heads yes 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:47.030
 carry the head about 20 cm further on 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:56.110
 it is folded and a knot is made 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:56.110
 simple in the realization of the node 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.190
 only one is incorporated in the known 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.500
 same that will constitute part of the summit 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:12.229
 of the parking place two karabiners 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.360
 on two horizontal anchors with the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.759
 rings properly turned towards 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:23.869
 outside the cord is inserted yes 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:28.040
 closes the ring nuts yes 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.940
 identifies half of the cord branch 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:38.240
 that connects the two anchors , yes 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:40.790
 leads to the summit of the stop and col 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.240
 carabiner can be identified at the top 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.900
 same in this way the award of 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.840
 lanyard closure always remains at 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.390
 summit stop and does not interfere 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.720
 in the flow near the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.720
 carabiners with a wide directionality 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.540
 at the same disadvantage of parking 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:11.660
 mobile in case of failure of a 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:14.110
 anchor the vertex is stretched e 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:20.079
 escapes the control of the operator 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:23.120
 in the event of breakage of the cord the stopover 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.220
 it collapses and also disassembles in this 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.380
 case you can turn a stop with 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:35.370
 slots incorporated in mobile parked seeds 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:40.660
 mobile realizing 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:47.140
 two simple motifs on the branches starting from 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.670
 summit go from the anchors one is one 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.400
 of the essential elements of the stops 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.580
 mobile home real estate is lost 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.819
 directionality therefore of the vertex both in 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.290
 traction case down that in 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.290
 case of overturning
