00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.260
 hi friends how are we now in this 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.360
 I bring you an application that is 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.010
 looks pretty interesting and it's called look 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.950
 away from this application we can 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.020
 find free in the appstore and good 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.360
 in what we will be in this 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.410
 application is that it will give us that 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:33.190
 effect or will you give us those as 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.590
 I could say good gestures for the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.380
 videos that samsung gives us in their 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.329
 high-end phones good now with 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.430
 this application we will be able to make a 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.680
 series of gestures for the videos we are going to 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.629
 to leave a video mode with 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.719
 simple gesture we will be able to stop a 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.210
 video stop watching the screen and good 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.539
 it will not be your preferred application for 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.399
 watching videos is not going to be your application 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.440
 default to watch videos but you 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.910
 you are going to have a good time trying and 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.079
 seeing what this application is about 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.670
 okay 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.630
 well here he tells us that they give us the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.320
 gestures for controls 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.539
 to silence it there would be another side to pause 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.049
 what here tells us how we have to do 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:18.329
 so that what the muse of the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.369
 volume or so that you see the 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.710
 sound and here tells us how we can 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.329
 make him to come in pause the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.640
 application and to get it back to 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.110
 play the video ok 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.110
 here it tells us that the vision is in 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.640
 control off and ready that more than more than 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 more and good here we already have what they are 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.840
 the sensitivity and the settings 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.700
 we give in start and ready 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.130
 here they will give us and what they are are the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.170
 popular videos for them obvious they're going 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.050
 to give priority to samsung do not believe that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.850
 they will give priority 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.010
 apple to several indeed look here is 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.380
 the back of the iphone 5 c good 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.770
 supposed rear of the iPhone 5 is and 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.630
 the rest 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.950
 ok unfortunately here they do not give us a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.150
 seeker you just have to go 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.280
 Searching according as you are seeing 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.930
 some interesting video does not and that's why you 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.120
 I say it will not be your search engine 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.950
 default you can search here some 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.750
 a video you want is not as accurate 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.240
 because they are not based on whether in the search engine 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.420
 YouTube is looking to rely more on the 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.760
 seeker and how is it called I do not remember 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.030
 but it's not google it's another search engine 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.170
 you work but not one hundred what 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.300
 you'll have to battle it out there 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.330
 little bit good let's try what it is 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.380
 itself yes yes in what is the gestures and 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.260
 well let's put this video a video 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.650
 Random randomly and let's try for 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.240
 example 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.100
 what is the good option of the volume 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.630
 we can see that I make the good gesture not 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.130
 you can see it but I'm doing the 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.130
 gesture and ready 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.260
 I remove my finger and re-enter what 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.800
 is the volume 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.550
 I put the gesture I remove the gesture 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.860
 and between the volume ok to see now I 'm going 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.110
 to lower the whole volume and now 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.170
 Let is that the camera is quite 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.740
 hard 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.140
 and now let's try to make this happen 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.310
 see good that the video is paused we are going to 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.310
 try to look the other way 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.010
 and be paused now let's go back the 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.670
 look 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:32.640
 and start what is the video again 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:36.390
 that's a bit easier the truth 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.690
 come back that ok let's go again to remove 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.690
 the look 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.820
 no, it's not detecting me 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.590
 is that if the truth with the camera is 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.150
 quite difficult since it detects me two 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.010
 lenses now yes I'm seeing for another 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.710
 side and I have paused the video I returned the 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:57.110
 look and do not put the video ok it's more 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.810
 easy so 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.850
 the image does not look so good but we can 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.270
 see that now if it detects me easier 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.560
 I turn around I look back and the 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.350
 video ok 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.480
 you try it friends without in the 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.880
 camera logically so they can see what is 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.040
 much more exact as I tell you it's not going 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.660
 to be a search engine or a 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.920
 video player that will be your 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.500
 favorite and that you will not want 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.910
 change but it will look interesting 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.060
 be seeing these functions that 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.620

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.880
