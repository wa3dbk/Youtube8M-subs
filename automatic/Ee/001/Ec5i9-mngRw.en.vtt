performance<00:01:47.540> Khan<00:01:48.540> did<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> victory<00:01:49.530> in

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
performance Khan did get the victory in

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.789 
performance Khan did get the victory in
Molina's<00:01:50.430> hometown<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.600> was<00:01:52.200> pretty<00:01:52.619> much

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
Molina's hometown but it was pretty much

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.969 
Molina's hometown but it was pretty much
expected<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.869> hard<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.140> say<00:01:55.259> where<00:01:55.829> he

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
expected so it's hard to say where he

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.840 
expected so it's hard to say where he
goes<00:01:56.159> from<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.990> personally<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.850> him

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
goes from here I personally think him

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.760 
goes from here I personally think him
