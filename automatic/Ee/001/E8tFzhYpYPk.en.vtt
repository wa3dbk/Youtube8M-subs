00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
the combo off and I would finish it with

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.940 
the combo off and I would finish it with
something<00:02:13.600> fucked<00:02:13.840> up<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.500> wasn't<00:02:14.800> right

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
something fucked up that wasn't right

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.790 
something fucked up that wasn't right
and<00:02:15.790> he<00:02:16.239> would<00:02:16.330> just<00:02:16.480> punish<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.050> shadow<00:02:17.320> I

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.190 

think<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.070> key<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.700> Mortal<00:02:22.690> Kombat<00:02:23.080> is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
think the key to Mortal Kombat is

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.110 
think the key to Mortal Kombat is
blocking<00:02:23.650> really<00:02:24.570> because<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.880> game

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
blocking really because this game

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.520 
blocking really because this game
actually<00:02:28.300> has<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.570> block<00:02:28.870> button<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.410> you

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
actually has a block button that you

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.250 
actually has a block button that you
have<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.830> push<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.190> can't<00:02:30.430> just<00:02:30.610> hold<00:02:30.760> back<00:02:31.260> on

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
have to push you can't just hold back on

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.310 
have to push you can't just hold back on
the<00:02:32.350> analog<00:02:32.739> stick<00:02:33.040> on<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.280> d-pad<00:02:33.750> block<00:02:34.750> you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
the analog stick on the d-pad block you

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.130 
the analog stick on the d-pad block you
actually<00:02:35.620> have<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.799> push<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.190> button<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.820> block

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
actually have to push a button to block

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.300 
actually have to push a button to block
so<00:02:39.360> yeah<00:02:40.420> just<00:02:40.989> blocking<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.560> key<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:42.040> then

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
so yeah just blocking is key and then

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
so yeah just blocking is key and then
when<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.730> block<00:02:42.940> higher<00:02:43.780> low<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:45.549> predict

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
when the block higher low and predict

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.560 
when the block higher low and predict
see<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.739> he<00:02:47.980> wasn't<00:02:48.280> expecting<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.360> I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
see that he wasn't expecting that and I

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.729 
see that he wasn't expecting that and I
wasn't<00:02:49.840> actually<00:02:49.959> expect<00:02:50.320> them<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.440> hit<00:02:50.650> him

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
wasn't actually expect them to hit him

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.370 
wasn't actually expect them to hit him
with<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.000> didn't<00:02:52.299> get<00:02:52.660> my<00:02:52.720> calm<00:02:53.049> well

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
with it so I didn't get my calm well

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.990 
with it so I didn't get my calm well
that<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:53.950> was<00:02:54.100> looking<00:02:54.310> for
