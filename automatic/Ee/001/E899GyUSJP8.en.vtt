another country and I tried this is

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.080 
another country and I tried this is

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
there's no way to do it so what you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.640 
there's no way to do it so what you
needed<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> buy<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.260> some<00:01:13.470> place

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
needed to do is buy it at some place

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.200 
needed to do is buy it at some place
like<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> airport<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> saw<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.180> was

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
like the airport so I saw this I was

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.200 
like the airport so I saw this I was
like<00:01:15.330> mine<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.140> took<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.159> risk<00:01:17.369> i<00:01:17.670> smuggled

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.980 
on it this one since it's not made here
was<00:01:50.850> already<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.149> milliliter<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.720> converted

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
was already a milliliter so I converted

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.080 
was already a milliliter so I converted
it<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.590> myself<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.399> we're<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:53.820> one

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
it for myself so we're going to do one

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.600 
it for myself so we're going to do one
in<00:01:54.329> two<00:01:54.540> thirds<00:01:54.810> ounces<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.579> apple<00:01:56.579> juice

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
in two thirds ounces of apple juice

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.539 
in two thirds ounces of apple juice
right<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:57.990> we're<00:01:58.439> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.310> half

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
right here we're going to do a half

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.520 
right here we're going to do a half
ounce<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.149> apple<00:02:00.509> accord<00:02:01.049> we're<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.439> do

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
ounce of apple accord we're going to do

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.010 
ounce of apple accord we're going to do
an<00:02:01.649> ounce<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.100> half<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:03.479> havana<00:02:03.780> club

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
an ounce and a half of the havana club

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.249 
an ounce and a half of the havana club
and<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.040> guess<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> now<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and I guess that's really it now the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.740 
and I guess that's really it now the
measurements<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:07.979> 50ml<00:02:08.550> 20<00:02:08.819> ml<00:02:09.000> 45<00:02:09.450> ml

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
measurements are really 50ml 20 ml 45 ml

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.030 
measurements are really 50ml 20 ml 45 ml
so<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.989> did<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:10.349> best<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> conversion

so I did my best to do the conversion

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.990 
so I did my best to do the conversion
be<00:02:12.189> perfect<00:02:12.579> we're<00:02:13.000> also<00:02:13.209> going<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.540> put<00:02:13.719> a<00:02:13.900> tsp
