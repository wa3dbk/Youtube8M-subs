00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello dear friends with you raki in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.029
 hangar now I want to tell you about 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.150
 one of my favorite cards in the game 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.950
 map shiloh playing a lot of battles on it 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.630
 having tested a large number of tactics I 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.519
 I want to show them in my opinion the most 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.519
 effective and so let's get started 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.990
 cards he went I conditionally divided into 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.070
 four zones 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.200
 lowland center town and mountain mezina 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 here it is preferable to go to 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.680
 heavy tanks 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.540
 or well -armored fri-sau as in 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.170
 skirmish with the enemy on a small 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.510
 distance armor will not hurt you 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.820
 center is dominated by medium tanks 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.379
 giving highlight at the beginning of the battle center in your 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.390
 the team will receive information about 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.730
 the location of almost all combat vehicles 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.949
 the enemy then taking a comfortable position 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.030
 You will be able to shoot opponents by 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.829
 its town is also great 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.510
 strategic position for heavy 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.580
 tanks because it is located in the city 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.899
 base and at every opportunity you 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.820
 be able to get on 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.890
 from the town also shoot at 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.759
 opponents who stand at the entrance to 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.979
 lowland there most preferably 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.140
 drive medium or heavy tanks 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.149
 Soon, the great one is very good 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.470
 part of the base but as noted on the mountain 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.039
 rarely anyone goes 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.600
 now as for the position for Fri-Sau 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.549
 top and bottom of a large card 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.159
 number of hills from 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.229
 shooting through the nisin and center as well 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.740
 a small part of the city on which 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.450
 specifically climb climb you decide well 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.860
 and let's look at one of the most 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.540
 standard battles for me on this map 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.280
 I'm on an average tank comic start 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.130
 highlight the center to understand what 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.049
 positions are taken by our opponents my 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.909
 sovzvodny turn on a heavy tank 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.909
 from pushing the lowlands 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.540
 is highlighted kv-3 further from the side 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:20.810
 I am trying to try someone else 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:23.420
 flash see that help my 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.319
 sovzvodnogo not hurt and successfully 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.319
 pick up square-3 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.050
 then I very badly rolled out we 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.030
 traded for light with Churchill and I 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.670
 caught a few shells from the enemy 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.100
 tanks standing in the area of ​​the railway 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.200
 without thinking twice I turn around and go to 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.200
 a detour of hope to highlight someone else 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.790
 appeared in the light of the tiger and then after 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.780
 shots lit up like in 4 which 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.780
 I began to disassemble 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.959
 an enemy tiger rolls onto me 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.269
 he shoots back into the void and this is my 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.750
 his chance for the carousel that I have excellent 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.750
 it turns out 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.510
 further the enemy’s glimmer glows to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.510
 which too soon go to the hangar 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.740
 in the end medal watchman first degree 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.470
 decisive contribution in general this tactic 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.030
 did its job here in principle and everything
