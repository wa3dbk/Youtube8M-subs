00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
have these splash guards so I had to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.910

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
be using that unless I need to so I

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.910 
be using that unless I need to so I
thought<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.120> would<00:02:19.270> be<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> good<00:02:19.660> way<00:02:19.810> to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
thought this would be a good way to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:34.020 
thought this would be a good way to
store<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.100> keep<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.550> out<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.880> way<00:02:33.030> over

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
store it keep it out of the way over

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.030 
store it keep it out of the way over
time<00:02:34.240> I<00:02:34.390> didn't<00:02:34.600> wanted<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.870> tear<00:02:35.800> through<00:02:35.950> the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
time I didn't wanted to tear through the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.710 
time I didn't wanted to tear through the
cable<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.820> thought<00:02:37.300> this<00:02:37.390> was<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.600> good

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
cable so I thought this was a good

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.090 
cable so I thought this was a good
solution<00:02:37.930> just<00:02:38.350> putting<00:02:38.560> me<00:02:38.650> through<00:02:38.680> here

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
solution just putting me through here

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.950 
solution just putting me through here
and<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.640> whenever<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.180> want<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.450> tell<00:02:43.600> I'll<00:02:43.780> just

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
and so whenever I want to tell I'll just

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.260 
and so whenever I want to tell I'll just
take<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.530> out<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:45.010> drape<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.030> over<00:02:46.120> the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
take it out and drape it over the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.610 
take it out and drape it over the
tailgate<00:02:46.600> here<00:02:47.020> someone<00:02:47.980> was<00:02:48.160> able<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:49.620> kind

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
tailgate here someone was able to kind

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.190 
tailgate here someone was able to kind
of<00:02:50.740> rig<00:02:50.890> up<00:02:51.040> like<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.340> little<00:02:51.700> bit<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.880> little<00:02:52.630> a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
of rig up like a little bit a little a

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.280 
of rig up like a little bit a little a
hanger<00:02:54.100> attach<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.330> end<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.630> this<00:02:55.750> and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
hanger attach it to the end of this and

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.740 
hanger attach it to the end of this and
the<00:02:56.770> instructions<00:02:57.280> call<00:02:58.120> for<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.390> like<00:02:58.660> I

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
the instructions call for you like I

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.840 
the instructions call for you like I
said<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.050> remove<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.470> bumper<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.250> what<00:03:00.700> that

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
said to remove the bumper and what that

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.350 
said to remove the bumper and what that
does<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.360> exposes<00:03:02.080> this<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.940> there's<00:03:04.210> the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
does is exposes this so there's the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.120 
does is exposes this so there's the
bumper<00:03:04.660> right<00:03:04.780> there<00:03:04.990> there's<00:03:05.710> a<00:03:05.830> little

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
bumper right there there's a little

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.810 
bumper right there there's a little
rubber<00:03:06.430> gasket<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.560> can<00:03:08.770> take<00:03:09.280> out<00:03:09.459> here

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
rubber gasket that you can take out here

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.300 
rubber gasket that you can take out here
and<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:11.050> guess<00:03:11.200> normally<00:03:11.620> you'd<00:03:11.830> have<00:03:11.860> being<00:03:12.280> a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
and I guess normally you'd have being a

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.310 
and I guess normally you'd have being a
full<00:03:12.610> access<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.300> back<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.750> bumper<00:03:13.900> so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
full access to the back of the bumper so

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.040 
full access to the back of the bumper so
you<00:03:15.010> would<00:03:15.190> slide<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.390> through<00:03:17.320> about<00:03:18.870> six<00:03:19.870> to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
you would slide it through about six to

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.040 
you would slide it through about six to
12<00:03:20.290> inches<00:03:20.620> of<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:21.700> bumper<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.630> then<00:03:22.810> come

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
12 inches of the bumper and then come

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.170 
12 inches of the bumper and then come
out<00:03:23.080> here<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.709> then<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.459> come<00:03:24.610> down<00:03:24.670> below<00:03:27.180> so

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
out here and then you come down below so

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.090 
out here and then you come down below so
that's<00:03:28.300> what<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.540> did<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.620> guess<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:32.980> guy

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
that's what I did and I guess the guy

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.520 
that's what I did and I guess the guy
like<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.459> said<00:03:33.640> he<00:03:33.820> used<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.630> hanger<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.290> route<00:03:35.500> it

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
like I said he used a hanger to route it

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.410 
like I said he used a hanger to route it
through<00:03:35.860> here<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:38.380> spent<00:03:38.770> a<00:03:38.890> couple<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.420> I'm

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
through here and I spent a couple I I'm

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.699 
through here and I spent a couple I I'm
a<00:03:40.510> little<00:03:40.720> bit<00:03:40.810> embarrassed<00:03:40.930> but<00:03:41.380> I<00:03:41.470> spent

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
a little bit embarrassed but I spent

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.170 
a little bit embarrassed but I spent
like<00:03:41.950> an<00:03:42.100> hour<00:03:42.220> or<00:03:42.340> two<00:03:42.610> trying<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:42.940> get<00:03:43.060> that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
like an hour or two trying to get that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.290 
like an hour or two trying to get that
to<00:03:43.239> work<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.080> gave<00:03:44.680> up<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.150> an

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
to work so I gave up and this is an

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.780 
to work so I gave up and this is an
elegant<00:03:46.750> eloquent<00:03:47.290> solution<00:03:47.950> for<00:03:48.160> me<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.640> that

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
elegant eloquent solution for me so that

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.090 
elegant eloquent solution for me so that
work<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:50.019> other<00:03:50.170> things<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.709> were<00:03:50.800> involved

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
work the other things that were involved

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.750 
work the other things that were involved
in<00:03:51.810> installing<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:53.769> actually<00:03:54.070> took<00:03:54.250> me<00:03:54.489> I'm

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
in installing it actually took me I'm

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.160 
in installing it actually took me I'm
really<00:03:55.180> slow<00:03:55.450> when<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.630> comes<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.900> this<00:03:55.989> stuff

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
really slow when it comes to this stuff

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.620 
really slow when it comes to this stuff
it<00:03:56.380> took<00:03:56.530> me<00:03:56.739> like<00:03:57.670> say<00:03:57.910> probably<00:03:58.269> like<00:03:58.330> three

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
it took me like say probably like three

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.370 
it took me like say probably like three
hours<00:03:59.370> so<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.400> was<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.850> first<00:04:01.380> section

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
hours so that was the first section

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.930 
hours so that was the first section
there's<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.709> little<00:04:02.890> cable<00:04:02.980> there<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.459> then

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
there's a little cable there and then

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.870 
there's a little cable there and then
they<00:04:04.030> give<00:04:04.150> you<00:04:04.239> another<00:04:04.420> wiring<00:04:04.870> harness<00:04:05.260> and

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
they give you another wiring harness and

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.500 
they give you another wiring harness and
you<00:04:06.880> actually<00:04:07.150> have<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.540> remove<00:04:08.190> all

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
you actually have to remove all

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.539 
you actually have to remove all
this<00:04:10.200> side<00:04:10.439> panel<00:04:10.680> here<00:04:10.860> which<00:04:11.220> was<00:04:11.340> really

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
this side panel here which was really

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:25.610 
this side panel here which was really
not<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:11.879> hard<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.299> this<00:04:12.390> panel<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:24.440> so<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.500> had

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
not that hard in this panel and so I had

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.279 
not that hard in this panel and so I had
to<00:04:25.650> actually<00:04:26.419> pick<00:04:27.419> up<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.720> seat<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.080> remove

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
to actually pick up the seat to remove

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.590 
to actually pick up the seat to remove
all<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.530> bolts<00:04:28.949> on<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.220> seat<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.580> then<00:04:30.360> pull

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
all the bolts on the seat and then pull

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.379 
all the bolts on the seat and then pull
up<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:30.840> carpet<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.800> little<00:04:32.039> bit<00:04:32.190> yr<00:04:33.030> up<00:04:33.270> to

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
up this carpet a little bit yr up to

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:40.580 
up this carpet a little bit yr up to
here<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.660> then<00:04:38.720> it's<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.870> little<00:04:40.110> confusing

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
here and then it's a little confusing

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.430 
here and then it's a little confusing
because<00:04:40.830> there<00:04:41.250> is<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.760> plug-in<00:04:42.660> port<00:04:43.199> you<00:04:43.320> know

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
because there is a plug-in port you know
