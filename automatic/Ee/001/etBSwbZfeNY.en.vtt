00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
obviously to get the flash off the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010 
obviously to get the flash off the
camera<00:00:53.430> well<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.270> flash<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.690> no<00:00:54.809> longer

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
camera well the flash is no longer

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
camera well the flash is no longer
connected<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.620> camera<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.430> know<00:00:56.520> how<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
connected the camera so you know how the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.150 
connected the camera so you know how the
hell<00:00:57.000> are<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.149> going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.390> fire<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.840> thing

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
hell are we going to fire this thing

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
hell are we going to fire this thing
well<00:00:59.160> there's<00:00:59.430> several<00:00:59.550> options<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:01.020> first

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
well there's several options the first

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.740 
well there's several options the first
and<00:01:01.829> most<00:01:02.010> cheapest<00:01:02.460> option<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.969> obviously<00:01:03.420> if

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and most cheapest option is obviously if

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.620 
and most cheapest option is obviously if
you<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.110> multiple<00:01:04.769> flashes<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.880> could<00:01:06.450> use

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
you have multiple flashes you could use

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.890 
you have multiple flashes you could use
nikons<00:01:07.110> built-in<00:01:07.560> CLS<00:01:08.100> system<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:09.210> shoots

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
nikons built-in CLS system that shoots

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.289 
nikons built-in CLS system that shoots
optical<00:01:10.619> or<00:01:10.890> should<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.670> say<00:01:11.820> infrared

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
optical or should I say infrared

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.020

messages<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> flash<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:14.100> lot<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.640> flashes

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
messages to the flash a lot of flashes

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.609 
messages to the flash a lot of flashes
do<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:15.479> optical<00:01:15.840> mode<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.320> them<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
do you have an optical mode on them to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.060 
do you have an optical mode on them to
where<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> flash<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.479> your<00:01:18.630> camera

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
where if you have a flash on your camera

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.890 
where if you have a flash on your camera
it'll<00:01:20.070> it'll<00:01:20.460> fire<00:01:20.939> when<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> take<00:01:21.750> your

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it'll it'll fire when you take your

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.990 
it'll it'll fire when you take your
picture<00:01:22.229> it'll<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> fire

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
picture it'll if I can get it to fire

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.469 
picture it'll if I can get it to fire
it'll<00:01:24.450> fire<00:01:24.810> send<00:01:25.799> information<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.150> flash

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
it'll fire send information to the flash

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.399 
it'll fire send information to the flash
that's<00:01:27.659> off-camera

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that's off-camera

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.429 
that's off-camera
and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.159> simply<00:01:29.729> fire<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.960> off-camera

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and then simply fire the off-camera

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.310 
and then simply fire the off-camera
flash<00:01:32.000> well<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.600> way<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
flash well that's one way to do it the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.370 
flash well that's one way to do it the
problem<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.869> sensor

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
problem is with that is that the sensor

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.050 
problem is with that is that the sensor
just<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> remote<00:01:38.310> control<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
just like on a remote control or the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
just like on a remote control or the
little<00:01:39.210> spot<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:39.840> TV<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.770> unless

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
little spot on your TV you know unless

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.590 
little spot on your TV you know unless
you<00:01:41.159> aim<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.579> right<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> right<00:01:42.360> way

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
you aim it right at it the right way

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.450 
you aim it right at it the right way
it's<00:01:43.259> not<00:01:43.409> always<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> get<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.159> light

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it's not always going to get that light

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.210 
it's not always going to get that light
so<00:01:45.210> obviously<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> flashes<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.070> in

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
so obviously the flashes have to be in

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.999 
so obviously the flashes have to be in
visual<00:01:47.729> range<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:48.360> actually<00:01:48.750> see<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.799> light

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
visual range or actually see the light

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.010 
visual range or actually see the light
coming<00:01:50.310> from<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.640> first<00:01:50.820> flash<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.600> fire<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
coming from the first flash to fire the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.050 
coming from the first flash to fire the
one<00:01:52.170> off-camera<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.490> can't<00:01:53.729> go<00:01:53.880> behind

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
one off-camera so it can't go behind

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.539 
one off-camera so it can't go behind
walls<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.710> turned<00:01:55.979> away<00:01:56.100> from<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
walls if it's turned away from the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.280 
walls if it's turned away from the
camera<00:01:56.969> or<00:01:57.119> maybe<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.719> hair<00:01:57.930> light<00:01:58.170> if

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
camera or maybe if it's a hair light if

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.530 
camera or maybe if it's a hair light if
it's<00:01:58.409> aimed<00:01:58.680> straight<00:01:58.860> down<00:01:59.250> and<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.299> can't

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
it's aimed straight down and you can't

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.090 
it's aimed straight down and you can't
you<00:02:00.899> know<00:02:01.020> can't<00:02:01.170> cool<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.649> light<00:02:01.829> can't

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
you know can't cool the light can't

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
need to get rid of but it's simple it

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.570

built<00:02:50.459> into<00:02:50.880> them<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.690> what<00:02:51.900> you'd<00:02:52.050> have<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.530> do

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
built into them so what you'd have to do

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.460 
built into them so what you'd have to do
is<00:02:53.100> actually<00:02:54.090> buy<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.480> little<00:02:54.930> hot<00:02:55.200> shoe

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
is actually buy a little hot shoe

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.620 
is actually buy a little hot shoe
adapter<00:02:55.820> which<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> little<00:02:57.330> adapter

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
adapter which is like a little adapter

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.690 
adapter which is like a little adapter
height<00:02:58.110> slides<00:02:58.530> into<00:02:58.709> your<00:02:58.890> hot<00:02:59.070> shoe<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
height slides into your hot shoe and

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.540 
height slides into your hot shoe and
then<00:02:59.820> that<00:02:59.970> actually<00:03:00.180> has<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.600> PC<00:03:00.959> port<00:03:01.170> on<00:03:01.380> it

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
then that actually has the PC port on it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.020 
then that actually has the PC port on it
so<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.930> best<00:03:04.080> way<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> most<00:03:04.820> way<00:03:05.820> that

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
so the best way in the most way that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.210 
so the best way in the most way that
most<00:03:06.180> professionals<00:03:06.810> use<00:03:06.990> now<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.920> simply

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
most professionals use now is simply

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.060 
most professionals use now is simply
wireless<00:03:09.000> triggering<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:10.590> when<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:10.800> talk

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
wireless triggering and when I talk

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.560 
wireless triggering and when I talk
about<00:03:11.100> wireless<00:03:11.760> trigger<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.450> simply<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.680> a

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
about wireless trigger I simply have a

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.979 
about wireless trigger I simply have a
transmitter<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:15.780> my<00:03:15.990> camera<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:17.750> sends<00:03:18.750> out

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
transmitter on my camera that sends out

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.229 
transmitter on my camera that sends out
a<00:03:19.170> radio<00:03:19.620> signal<00:03:19.980> through<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.000> air

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
a radio signal through the air

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.570 
a radio signal through the air
wirelessly<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.560> receiver<00:03:22.980> that's<00:03:23.250> mounted

wirelessly to a receiver that's mounted

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.360 
wirelessly to a receiver that's mounted
to<00:03:23.730> my<00:03:23.850> flash<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.800> what's<00:03:25.800> great<00:03:26.070> about<00:03:26.100> that

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
to my flash and what's great about that

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.810 
to my flash and what's great about that
is<00:03:26.580> that<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.570> can<00:03:28.140> put<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.530> hind<00:03:28.769> walls<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.459> can<00:03:29.610> put

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
is that I can put a hind walls I can put

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.190 
is that I can put a hind walls I can put
up<00:03:29.910> from<00:03:30.390> great<00:03:30.630> distances<00:03:31.050> far<00:03:31.440> away<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:33.200> it

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
up from great distances far away and it

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.110 
up from great distances far away and it
works<00:03:34.470> great<00:03:34.620> I'm<00:03:35.130> not<00:03:35.340> tripping<00:03:35.670> over<00:03:35.730> wires

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
works great I'm not tripping over wires

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.900 
works great I'm not tripping over wires
and<00:03:36.890> it's<00:03:37.890> just<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.250> best<00:03:38.430> way<00:03:38.640> all<00:03:38.790> around

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
and it's just the best way all around

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.210 
and it's just the best way all around
now<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.930> problem<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.440> with<00:03:40.620> wireless<00:03:40.920> trigger

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
now the problem is with wireless trigger

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.949 
now the problem is with wireless trigger
is<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.459> since<00:03:41.880> they<00:03:42.030> are<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.330> best<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.900> they

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
is that since they are the best and they

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.410 
is that since they are the best and they
eat<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.440> best<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.769> use<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:45.209> they

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
eat and the best to use is that they

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.530 
eat and the best to use is that they
cost<00:03:45.690> money<00:03:46.610> some<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.760> big<00:03:48.090> name<00:03:48.269> brands

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
cost money some of the big name brands

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.420 
cost money some of the big name brands
out<00:03:48.720> there<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:49.019> like<00:03:49.170> pocket<00:03:49.620> wizards<00:03:49.980> in<00:03:50.160> fact

could<00:06:33.300> say<00:06:33.480> but<00:06:33.690> my<00:06:34.410> reasoning<00:06:34.830> for<00:06:34.860> that<00:06:35.039> is

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
could say but my reasoning for that is

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.510 
could say but my reasoning for that is
that<00:06:35.910> instead<00:06:36.900> of<00:06:37.110> using<00:06:37.200> velcro<00:06:37.890> to<00:06:38.490> attach

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
that instead of using velcro to attach

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.220 
that instead of using velcro to attach
my<00:06:39.090> stuff<00:06:39.450> to<00:06:39.630> my<00:06:39.660> flashes
