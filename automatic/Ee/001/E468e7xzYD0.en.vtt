so yeah let's get into the video you're

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.519 
so yeah let's get into the video you're
the<00:00:17.910> reasons<00:00:18.270> why<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> don't<00:00:18.930> own<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> point<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the reasons why I don't own a point to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.130 
the reasons why I don't own a point to
camera<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.100> even<00:00:20.789> if<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.939> did<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.390> prefer<00:00:21.810> taking

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
camera and even if I did I prefer taking

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.980 
camera and even if I did I prefer taking
pictures<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:23.010> my<00:00:23.279> iPhone<00:00:23.699> anyway<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.720> first

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
pictures with my iPhone anyway the first

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.410 
pictures with my iPhone anyway the first
reason<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.590> convenience<00:00:26.250> since<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.359> your

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
reason is convenience since it's your

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.939 
reason is convenience since it's your
phone<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.080> always<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.500> your<00:00:28.560> phone

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
phone and you always have your phone

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.950 
phone and you always have your phone
with<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.220> well<00:00:30.119> you're<00:00:30.449> always<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
with you well you're always going to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.290 
with you well you're always going to
have<00:00:31.019> your<00:00:31.289> camera<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.850> tend<00:00:33.239> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
have your camera with you and I tend to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.900 
have your camera with you and I tend to
keep<00:00:33.510> my<00:00:33.690> iphone<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.110> my<00:00:34.230> pocket<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.640> very

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
keep my iphone in my pocket so it's very

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
keep my iphone in my pocket so it's very
convenient<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.290> know<00:00:37.320> pull<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.890> my

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
convenient I just you know pull it on my

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.920 
convenient I just you know pull it on my
pocket<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.550> take<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> picture<00:00:39.000> when<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.750> see

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
pocket and take a picture when I see

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.209 
pocket and take a picture when I see
something<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.739> take<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> picture

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
something that I want to take a picture

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.459 
something that I want to take a picture
of<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:42.090> not<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> kind<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.660> person<00:00:42.780> who<00:00:43.110> plans

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
of I'm not the kind of person who plans

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.920 
of I'm not the kind of person who plans
like<00:00:43.770> okay<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.340> am<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.539> out<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.719> I'm

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
like okay I am going to go out and I'm

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.900 
like okay I am going to go out and I'm
going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.110> take<00:00:46.289> pictures<00:00:46.590> today<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.250> lot<00:00:47.789> of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
going to take pictures today a lot of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.750 
going to take pictures today a lot of
times<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.510> more<00:00:48.930> spontaneous<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.129> that's

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
times it's more spontaneous and that's

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.090 
times it's more spontaneous and that's
really<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.750> main<00:00:51.870> reason<00:00:52.350> why<00:00:52.469> using<00:00:52.829> your

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
really the main reason why using your

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.240 
really the main reason why using your
phone<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:54.030> camera<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.680> convenient

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
phone as a camera is so convenient

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.279 
phone as a camera is so convenient
because<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.180> necessarily<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.930> when

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
because you don't necessarily know when

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.389 
because you don't necessarily know when
you're<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> want<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.949> take<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> picture

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you're going to want to take a picture

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
you're going to want to take a picture
but<00:00:59.760> your<00:01:00.180> phone's<00:01:00.390> always<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.050> on

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
but your phone's always going to be on

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.189 
but your phone's always going to be on
you<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:01.890> mere<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.480> somehow<00:01:03.480> another<00:01:03.960> thing

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you or mere you somehow another thing

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.080 
you or mere you somehow another thing
about<00:01:04.320> convenience<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.309> an<00:01:05.549> iphone<00:01:05.970> is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
about convenience is that an iphone is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.399 
about convenience is that an iphone is
going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.420> lighter<00:01:06.659> than<00:01:06.810> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
going to be lighter than a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
going to be lighter than a
point-and-shoot<00:01:07.830> camera<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.729> definitely

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
point-and-shoot camera it's definitely

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.670 
point-and-shoot camera it's definitely
thinner<00:01:09.479> than<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.750> point<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.170> camera<00:01:10.500> there's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
thinner than a point to camera there's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.950 
thinner than a point to camera there's
no<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> point<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.119> camera<00:01:12.510> could<00:01:12.689> fit

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
no way that a point to camera could fit

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.310 
no way that a point to camera could fit
in<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.560> pocket<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.420> girls<00:01:15.420> pants<00:01:15.930> because<00:01:16.170> they

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
in a pocket on girls pants because they

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.219 
in a pocket on girls pants because they
make<00:01:16.470> pocket<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.040> small<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.030> yeah<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.840> iphones

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
make pocket so small so yeah the iphones

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.590 
make pocket so small so yeah the iphones
definitely<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:20.250> convenient<00:01:20.790> i<00:01:20.880> also<00:01:21.060> argue

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
definitely more convenient i also argue

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.530 
definitely more convenient i also argue
that<00:01:21.630> taking<00:01:22.350> pictures<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:23.490> an<00:01:23.850> iphone<00:01:24.299> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that taking pictures with an iphone is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.630 
that taking pictures with an iphone is
more<00:01:24.840> convenient<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.619> easier<00:01:25.979> than<00:01:26.220> taking

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
more convenient and easier than taking

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.429 
more convenient and easier than taking
pictures<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> point<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.140> well

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
pictures of the point you because well

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.929 
pictures of the point you because well
pull<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.220> pocket<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.670> wherever

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
pull it out of your pocket or wherever

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.640 
pull it out of your pocket or wherever
you<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.750> access<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> camera

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you have it you can access the camera

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.010 
you have it you can access the camera
from<00:01:32.040> your<00:01:32.159> home<00:01:32.340> screen<00:01:32.490> by<00:01:33.119> sliding<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.810> on

the<00:03:14.989> time<00:03:15.019> it's<00:03:15.980> great<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.120> third<00:03:17.329> reason

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
the time it's great so the third reason

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.539 
the time it's great so the third reason
really<00:03:17.900> goes<00:03:18.199> along<00:03:18.530> with<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.919> first<00:03:19.190> two<00:03:19.430> and

I guess they all go along with the first

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.220 
I guess they all go along with the first
one<00:03:21.709> which<00:03:21.889> was<00:03:22.040> convenience<00:03:22.639> but<00:03:23.389> anyway<00:03:24.049> the

internet<00:03:28.040> access<00:03:28.069> you<00:03:28.549> don't<00:03:28.970> have<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.359> worry

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
internet access you don't have to worry

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.899

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
device to share them you can share them

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.229 
device to share them you can share them
immediately<00:03:36.530> after<00:03:37.159> you<00:03:37.310> take<00:03:37.639> them<00:03:37.849> from

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
immediately after you take them from

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.849 
immediately after you take them from
wherever<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.840> are<00:03:38.989> as<00:03:39.199> long<00:03:39.379> as<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.680> have

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859

wherever you are as long as you have
internet<00:03:40.040> access<00:03:40.599> which<00:03:41.599> is<00:03:41.870> most<00:03:42.169> places<00:03:42.379> if

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
internet access which is most places if

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.899 
internet access which is most places if
you<00:03:42.829> have<00:03:43.340> cellular<00:03:44.120> data<00:03:44.590> enabled<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:46.250> that's

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
you have cellular data enabled so that's

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.119 
you have cellular data enabled so that's
great<00:03:47.419> I<00:03:47.780> used<00:03:48.109> to<00:03:48.199> take<00:03:48.379> so<00:03:48.709> many<00:03:48.799> pictures

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
great I used to take so many pictures

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.369 
great I used to take so many pictures
with<00:03:49.459> my<00:03:49.699> point<00:03:50.419> shoot<00:03:50.599> camera<00:03:50.629> or<00:03:51.049> even<00:03:51.260> with

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
with my point shoot camera or even with

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.069 
with my point shoot camera or even with
my<00:03:51.470> DSLR<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.310> then<00:03:52.849> I<00:03:53.090> wouldn't<00:03:53.510> really

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
my DSLR and then I wouldn't really

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.020 
my DSLR and then I wouldn't really
upload<00:03:54.739> them<00:03:54.949> to<00:03:54.979> the<00:03:55.220> internet<00:03:55.699> or<00:03:55.879> it<00:03:55.940> would

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
upload them to the internet or it would

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.879 
upload them to the internet or it would
take<00:03:56.269> me<00:03:56.479> a<00:03:56.510> really<00:03:56.690> long<00:03:56.780> time<00:03:56.989> and<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.799> was

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
take me a really long time and it was

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.640 
take me a really long time and it was
always<00:03:58.040> outdated<00:03:58.609> this<00:03:59.479> way<00:03:59.720> i<00:04:00.049> can<00:04:00.079> share

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
always outdated this way i can share

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.379 
always outdated this way i can share
everything<00:04:01.099> i<00:04:01.370> take<00:04:01.579> immediately<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.359> that's

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
everything i take immediately and that's

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.110 
everything i take immediately and that's
cool<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:03.680> let's<00:04:03.979> briefly<00:04:04.370> discuss<00:04:04.430> the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
cool so let's briefly discuss the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.409 
cool so let's briefly discuss the
consequences<00:04:05.629> of<00:04:06.139> using<00:04:06.799> an<00:04:07.190> iphone<00:04:07.579> as<00:04:07.849> your

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
consequences of using an iphone as your

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.129 
consequences of using an iphone as your
camera<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.530> first<00:04:09.799> one<00:04:10.129> is<00:04:10.459> do<00:04:11.299> you<00:04:11.870> can't

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
camera the first one is do you can't

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.589 
camera the first one is do you can't
really<00:04:12.409> zoom<00:04:12.829> on<00:04:13.129> an<00:04:13.340> iphone<00:04:13.669> camera<00:04:13.940> you<00:04:14.449> can

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
really zoom on an iphone camera you can

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.849 
really zoom on an iphone camera you can
do<00:04:14.720> digital<00:04:14.900> zoom<00:04:15.260> but<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.590> quality

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
do digital zoom but the quality

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.219 
do digital zoom but the quality
decreases<00:04:16.729> so<00:04:17.000> rapidly<00:04:17.510> when<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.900> do<00:04:18.049> that

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
decreases so rapidly when you do that

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.620 
decreases so rapidly when you do that
it's<00:04:18.409> just<00:04:18.560> not<00:04:18.889> even<00:04:19.220> worth<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:20.180> if<00:04:20.510> you

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
it's just not even worth it so if you

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.729 
it's just not even worth it so if you
know<00:04:20.840> that<00:04:20.870> you're<00:04:21.109> going<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.260> be<00:04:21.349> taking

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
know that you're going to be taking

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.409 
know that you're going to be taking
pictures<00:04:22.099> of<00:04:22.159> something<00:04:22.760> that's<00:04:22.940> really<00:04:23.180> far

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
pictures of something that's really far

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.629 
pictures of something that's really far
away<00:04:23.599> from<00:04:23.779> you<00:04:24.139> then<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:25.159> should<00:04:25.340> bring<00:04:25.520> a

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
away from you then you should bring a

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.080 
away from you then you should bring a
real

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
real

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.770 
real
real<00:04:26.870> camera<00:04:27.710> along<00:04:28.460> with<00:04:28.730> you<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.419> do<00:04:29.600> that

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
real camera along with you to do that

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.379 
real camera along with you to do that
and<00:04:30.100> most<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.400> time<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.820> don't<00:04:32.060> really<00:04:32.180> need

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
and most of the time I don't really need

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.180 
and most of the time I don't really need
the<00:04:32.570> zoom<00:04:32.750> I'm<00:04:32.930> taking<00:04:33.230> pictures<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.620> like<00:04:33.980> a

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
the zoom I'm taking pictures of like a

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.550 
the zoom I'm taking pictures of like a
big<00:04:34.490> scene<00:04:34.880> or<00:04:35.210> people<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:35.750> are<00:04:35.990> up<00:04:36.110> close<00:04:36.260> to

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
big scene or people that are up close to

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.650 
big scene or people that are up close to
me<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.130> that's<00:04:37.280> not<00:04:37.460> really<00:04:37.610> an<00:04:37.790> issue<00:04:37.880> for<00:04:38.330> me

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
me so that's not really an issue for me

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.860 
me so that's not really an issue for me
but<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:39.770> definitely<00:04:40.430> will<00:04:41.120> come<00:04:41.180> up<00:04:41.540> for

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
but it definitely will come up for

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.360 
but it definitely will come up for
people<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.530> next<00:04:42.770> thing<00:04:42.889> is<00:04:42.949> low<00:04:43.190> light

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
people the next thing is low light

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.340 
people the next thing is low light
situations<00:04:44.030> if<00:04:44.270> you're<00:04:44.510> going<00:04:44.780> somewhere<00:04:45.050> at

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
situations if you're going somewhere at

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.960 
situations if you're going somewhere at
night<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:45.770> you're<00:04:45.919> going<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.130> be<00:04:46.220> outside<00:04:46.639> and

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.000 
night and you're going to be outside and
you<00:04:47.060> want<00:04:47.240> to<00:04:47.330> take<00:04:47.510> pictures<00:04:47.750> you<00:04:48.680> shouldn't

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
you want to take pictures you shouldn't

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.040 
you want to take pictures you shouldn't
rely<00:04:49.100> on<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.520> iphone's<00:04:49.880> camera<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.750> flash

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
rely on the iphone's camera the flash

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.170 
rely on the iphone's camera the flash
works<00:04:51.410> well<00:04:51.680> if<00:04:51.979> you're<00:04:52.250> taking<00:04:52.580> pictures<00:04:53.150> of

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
works well if you're taking pictures of

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.960 
works well if you're taking pictures of
things<00:04:53.690> that<00:04:53.930> are<00:04:54.020> very<00:04:54.199> close<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.830> you<00:04:54.949> but<00:04:55.760> I

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
things that are very close to you but I

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.629 
things that are very close to you but I
find<00:04:56.389> that<00:04:56.600> it<00:04:57.380> doesn't<00:04:57.919> really<00:04:58.190> give<00:04:58.490> an

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
find that it doesn't really give an

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.940 
find that it doesn't really give an
accurate<00:04:59.110> representation<00:05:00.110> of<00:05:00.710> what<00:05:00.800> you're

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
accurate representation of what you're

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.060 
accurate representation of what you're
looking<00:05:01.100> at<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.810> prefer<00:05:03.410> not<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:03.919> take

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
looking at so I prefer not to take

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.700 
looking at so I prefer not to take
pictures<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.550> things<00:05:05.450> with<00:05:05.990> my<00:05:06.110> iphone<00:05:06.500> at

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
pictures of things with my iphone at

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.400 
pictures of things with my iphone at
night<00:05:06.979> and<00:05:07.340> then<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.210> last<00:05:08.450> thing<00:05:08.690> is<00:05:08.840> battery

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
night and then the last thing is battery

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.350 
night and then the last thing is battery
life<00:05:09.500> if<00:05:10.070> you're<00:05:10.250> going<00:05:10.370> on<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.580> day<00:05:10.820> trip<00:05:10.850> and

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
life if you're going on a day trip and

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.090
