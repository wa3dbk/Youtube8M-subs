00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.380
 to everyone and welcome to a trick 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.599
 multiplayer Grand Theft 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 car 5 and this trick is to pass 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.439
 vehicles from campaign mode to online 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.300
 I must tell you that this trick has 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.130
 cost quite a bit of recording because 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.200
 I was testing with other vehicles not 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.340
 luxury because you can not luxury but 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.259
 I was testing it with some of 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.790
 lacalle and etcetera and the truth is that no 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.980
 has worked me person who was already 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.470
 has patched and not tell you that the trick 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.390
 it works with vehicles I think they have 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.610
 so to speak for sure I have no idea 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.810
 because the campaign I have no idea 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.730
 and I 've done it with the vehicle 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.250
 franklin I'm worth the character of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.230
 franklin and I've done the trick with the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.330
 franklin vehicles are worth I should tell you 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.400
 that the trick can not be with vehicles 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.960
 of luxury as I have told you so for the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.670
 people who have a lot of money this trick 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.770
 It's not going to help you 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.110
 we can pass some speed or I want some 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.970
 weird vehicle and so trolling a bit 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.250
 online and that's it but we can not 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.229
 put the insurance or put it in the garage 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.329
 or anything is worth then this trick more 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.880
 well it is so to speak one of money 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.520
 infinite in just because we will win then 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.619
 about ten about 100,000 or so 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.390
 go very well for people who have 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.299
 little money since this trick works 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.340
 for all the people who have a garage that 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.049
 do not have a garage that does not have money or 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.939
 have money is going to go very well 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.159
 so well then let's start with 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.960
 the tutorial of this trick so good 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.600
 everything first we have to do 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.939
 is to be in campaign mode with the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.979
 Well, I do not know if it works 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.659
 I suppose yes, but I have 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.399
 made with franklin's worth I 've 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.530
 made with the franklin vehicle 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.909
 I recommend doing it with this and good if 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.530
 you do not have much money and what to do 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.239
 is to tune it so they give me more money 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.340
 in online and not spend it is worth for the 

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:49.319
 time to sell it then I recommend that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.270
 bake it is if you do not have a lot of money 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.829
 Well, I just think that happening 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.599
 a bit the campaign they will give us 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.060
 quite money and good with this 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.739
 we can tune it if you already have it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.509
 tuned perfect what I 've done here 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.489
 I already had tuned it 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.860
 simply because I got crazy in the 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:07.289
 garage for good losantos just for 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.119
 modify it a bit more to see if 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.730
 I could put something else but good to 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.799
 I finally decided not and should not 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.019
 you have money and you want money and 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.730
 already already in the campaign mode then 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.030
 leave a video in the description 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.950
 put 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.720
 money in campaign with a program and everything 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.430
 this but if you do not want directly 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.810
 do campaign missions but because 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.910
 perhaps I leave it there in the description by 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.410
 if you want to inform you a little and if not 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.360
 I can search the internet for some know 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.240
 data that is complete in mod history 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.580
 of the gta campaign for both ps3 or 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.500
 xbox is good and well when we have 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.750
 the car ready me now what I'm going to 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.489
 to do is leave the custom saints 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.590
 because what I'm going to do is save the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.209
 starting here I'll save more than 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.010
 nothing because when you have studied 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.660
 the vehicle and you have done all these 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.430
 processes so I recommend that you save it 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.230
 so that when you come the vehicle in 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.239
 which in the online when you go to 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.250
 campaign you simply load this game 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.870
 and now you will have again the vehicle 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.640
 this position ready to do the trick 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.380
 again I recommend you do it like that if 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.269
 you want to do it like that and if not then not 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.950
 save the game is good when 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.500
 you have done this, now simply 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.810
 we get into the custom saints and we 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.550
 we were in the first menu is worth so much if 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.760
 tells you that if you want to repair the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.769
 vehicle or modify it vintage and everything 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.200
 this we just stay here you 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.019
 we give the start we go online and we create 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.760
 a game session by invitation when 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.050
 we are there because what we will do is 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.930
 just give it 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.150
 start we go online we give to 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.600
 activities we give you to host 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.130
 an activity and here you take any 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.830
 career is worth as it is from a friend 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.260
 as if it's yours created by you or another 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.090
 person is worth any career as if 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.130
 are rockstar me in my case to catch 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.890
 one of rockstar and what needs to be done 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.020
 is to pass the voucher is simply that 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.310
 As I say, only the races are worth 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.680
 they are worth missions or anything like that 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.890
 simply racing and when we make 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.780
 the race we finish it now 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.340
 simply what you have to do is 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.370
 when the menu comes out this if you want 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.740
 you vote the game in positive that I do not 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.450
 has liked or circle is worth and now 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.920
 we just give the circle and 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.370
 We cancel here, there is no need to do 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.130
 nothing more 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.200
 when we cancel, we will appear in 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.760
 the saints custom me the trick this 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.680
 tried a lot of times with others 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.060
 vehicles and it has not come up with any 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.530
 another vehicle so I recommend it 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.630
 do it with franklin's with the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.000
 franklin character also put 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.250
 It's worth it and it's already simply because now 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.080
 we give the little arrow on the right that 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.630
 I thought here that he was going to put the 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.330
 menu of the saints fair and now 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.120
 we can sell this vehicle for more 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.520
 of 100 thousand dollars and the best thing about this is 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.590
 we can do apart again 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.020
 trick ok let's go to campaign mode 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.990
 we load the game we do again 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.120
 it all over again and you're just 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.320
 you have to do this and if you do not leave it sells 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.900
 the vehicle because you have to wait longer 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.570
 of 45 minutes that I do not know if it will happen 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.430
 I suppose so, you just put 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.290
 the vehicle in your garage and so 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.240
 infinitely until you have a lot 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.950
 money and buy the other vehicles well 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.510
 that's good, this has been everything if 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.430
