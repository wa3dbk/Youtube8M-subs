is probably the own the least fun of the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.990 
is probably the own the least fun of the
program<00:00:20.910> there's<00:00:21.359> no<00:00:21.800> max<00:00:22.800> out<00:00:23.010> sets<00:00:23.340> it's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
program there's no max out sets it's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.880 
program there's no max out sets it's
just<00:00:24.240> basically<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.689> set<00:00:24.990> set<00:00:25.380> progression<00:00:25.800> of

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
just basically a set set progression of

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.099 
just basically a set set progression of
reps<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.519> first<00:00:26.820> off<00:00:27.000> you've<00:00:27.150> got<00:00:27.359> sixty

percent of your max four five reps now
I'm<00:00:40.290> basing<00:00:41.070> my<00:00:41.100> program<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.230> 100<00:00:43.230> kilo<00:00:43.860> max

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I'm basing my program on a 100 kilo max

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.190 
I'm basing my program on a 100 kilo max
so<00:00:45.149> I'm<00:00:45.329> using<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.629> bit<00:00:45.750> less<00:00:45.960> because<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
so I'm using a bit less because of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
so I'm using a bit less because of
experience<00:00:46.890> i<00:00:47.010> found<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.340> come<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
experience i found that come the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.209 
experience i found that come the
five-week<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.960> use<00:00:49.260> close<00:00:49.620> team<00:00:49.860> very

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
five-week if you use close team very

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.000 
five-week if you use close team very
close<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.760> max<00:00:50.969> or<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.329> actual<00:00:51.420> max<00:00:52.010> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
close to you max or your actual max you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.650 
close to you max or your actual max you
ten<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.370> tend<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> find<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.329> way<00:00:54.480> it's

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
ten we tend to find that the way it's

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.689 
ten we tend to find that the way it's
become<00:00:54.930> very<00:00:55.140> difficult<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> hit<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
become very difficult for you to hit the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.319 
become very difficult for you to hit the
scheduled<00:00:57.239> reps<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> program<00:00:58.469> so

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
scheduled reps on the program so

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.330 
scheduled reps on the program so
checking<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> back<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> notch<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.590> five<00:01:01.890> kilos

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
checking it back a notch so five kilos

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.920 
checking it back a notch so five kilos
or<00:01:02.460> maybe<00:01:02.609> even<00:01:02.670> 10<00:01:03.000> kilos<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.629> need<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
or maybe even 10 kilos if you need to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.820 
or maybe even 10 kilos if you need to
then<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.680> makes<00:01:05.670> all<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> difference<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:07.680> for

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
then it makes all the difference so for

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.469 
then it makes all the difference so for
me<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.340> 75<00:01:08.700> kilos<00:01:09.060> for

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
me this is going to be 75 kilos for

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.960 
me this is going to be 75 kilos for
eight<00:01:09.600> reps<00:01:09.920> next<00:01:10.920> two<00:01:11.040> point<00:01:11.280> five<00:01:11.430> kilos<00:01:11.820> for

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
eight reps next two point five kilos for

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.170 
eight reps next two point five kilos for
six<00:01:12.210> reps<00:01:12.510> 100<00:01:13.409> kilos<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.159> four<00:01:14.430> sets<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.880> five

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
six reps 100 kilos for four sets of five

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.300 
six reps 100 kilos for four sets of five
reps<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.799> two<00:01:16.950> point<00:01:17.189> five

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
seventy-five percent for six reps eighty

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.070 
seventy-five percent for six reps eighty
percent<00:03:24.100> for<00:03:24.850> three<00:03:25.120> sets<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.510> five<00:03:25.750> reps

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
percent for three sets of five reps

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.350 
percent for three sets of five reps
notice<00:03:26.560> how<00:03:26.650> you've<00:03:26.800> lost<00:03:26.980> one<00:03:27.220> set<00:03:27.520> and<00:03:27.640> then

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
notice how you've lost one set and then

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.780 
notice how you've lost one set and then
two<00:03:28.630> sets<00:03:28.990> of<00:03:29.230> seventy-five<00:03:29.740> percent<00:03:29.920> times<00:03:30.520> 5

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
two sets of seventy-five percent times 5

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.870 
two sets of seventy-five percent times 5
reps<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:32.470> basically<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.010> lose<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.430> bit<00:03:33.700> off<00:03:33.850> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
reps so basically you lose a bit off the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.000 
reps so basically you lose a bit off the
main<00:03:34.180> sets<00:03:34.540> but<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:35.410> add<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.560> little<00:03:35.740> bit<00:03:35.890> on

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
main sets but you add a little bit on

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.770 
main sets but you add a little bit on
the<00:03:36.310> end<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.760> what<00:03:36.940> you'll<00:03:37.090> find<00:03:37.240> is<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.480> as

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
the end you what you'll find is that as

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.690 
the end you what you'll find is that as
the<00:03:38.140> program<00:03:38.560> goes<00:03:38.709> on<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:38.950> start<00:03:39.190> doing<00:03:39.430> some

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
the program goes on you start doing some

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.199 
the program goes on you start doing some
max<00:03:40.390> rep<00:03:40.660> attempts<00:03:41.380> on<00:03:41.500> these<00:03:41.680> sets<00:03:42.090> now<00:03:43.090> if

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209
