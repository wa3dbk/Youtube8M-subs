basically they said they have a time
master<00:00:48.660> toro<00:00:49.110> time<00:00:49.350> master<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.270> they<00:00:51.270> had<00:00:51.420> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
master toro time master and they had to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.819 
master toro time master and they had to
change<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.230> drive<00:00:52.590> belt<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.270> twice

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
change the drive belt on it twice

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.130 
change the drive belt on it twice
because<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.160> kept<00:00:56.340> thinning<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:56.910> and<00:01:00.140> it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
because it kept thinning out and it's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.689 
because it kept thinning out and it's
one<00:01:01.379> thing<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.680> wanted<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> show<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.190> guys<00:01:02.430> and

I wanted to start it up so y'all can see

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.359 
I wanted to start it up so y'all can see
what<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> was<00:01:04.860> talking<00:01:04.949> about<00:01:05.869> but<00:01:07.369> essentially

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
I'm not a mechanic so I want to give

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.410 
I'm not a mechanic so I want to give
that<00:01:13.020> disclaimer<00:01:13.440> first<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.299> but<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> am

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420

semi<00:01:16.110> OCD<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.820> thing<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.150> noticed<00:01:18.510> when<00:01:18.600> I

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
semi OCD and one thing I noticed when I

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.910 
semi OCD and one thing I noticed when I
first<00:01:18.750> got<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.650> lawnmower<00:01:20.010> is<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:21.770> it's<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
first got this lawnmower is that it's a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.370 
first got this lawnmower is that it's a
very<00:01:23.130> powerful<00:01:23.369> engine<00:01:23.760> it's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.200> 8.75<00:01:25.200> I'm

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
very powerful engine it's a 8.75 I'm

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.870 
very powerful engine it's a 8.75 I'm
gonna<00:01:25.530> say<00:01:25.650> very<00:01:25.680> powerful<00:01:26.369> engine<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.640> it's

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
gonna say very powerful engine but it's

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.609 
gonna say very powerful engine but it's
powerful<00:01:27.320> than<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> regular<00:01:28.650> push<00:01:29.009> mower<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
powerful than a regular push mower and

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.520 
powerful than a regular push mower and
by<00:01:31.619> having<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.430> blade<00:01:33.150> stop<00:01:33.509> system<00:01:33.990> it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
by having the blade stop system it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.219 
by having the blade stop system it
starts<00:01:34.890> up<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:36.000> motor<00:01:36.240> starts<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.780> running

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
starts up the motor starts up running

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.539 
starts up the motor starts up running
full<00:01:37.650> rpms<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.619> with<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> blades<00:01:41.009> off<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
full rpms and with the blades off and

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.120 
full rpms and with the blades off and
once<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.270> engage<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:44.060> blade<00:01:45.060> bar<00:01:45.890> engage<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
once you engage the blade bar engage the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.569 
once you engage the blade bar engage the
blades<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:49.430> drive<00:01:50.430> belt<00:01:51.560> pulls<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
blades that drive belt pulls on to the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.910 
blades that drive belt pulls on to the
pulley<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.320> about<00:01:55.409> how<00:01:55.649> fast

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
pulley so if you think about how fast

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.109 
pulley so if you think about how fast
that<00:01:56.189> spindle<00:01:56.729> must<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.090> spinning<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.009> you

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
that spindle must be spinning and you

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.280 
that spindle must be spinning and you
pull<00:02:00.119> engage<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.310> blades<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.759> fast<00:02:03.290> it's

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
pull engage the blades really fast it's

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.429 
pull engage the blades really fast it's
going<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> put<00:02:05.100> strain<00:02:05.520> number<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
going to put strain number one on that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.630 
going to put strain number one on that
belt<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.509> it's<00:02:09.509> gonna<00:02:09.690> put<00:02:09.959> strain<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.640> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
belt and it's gonna put strain on the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.970 
belt and it's gonna put strain on the
motor<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.959> noticed<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.530> when<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.739> first

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
motor and so I noticed that when I first

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.979 
motor and so I noticed that when I first
started<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.850> my<00:02:15.030> first<00:02:15.269> time<00:02:15.450> starting<00:02:15.900> it

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
started it up my first time starting it

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.930 
started it up my first time starting it
up<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:18.349> pulled<00:02:19.349> back<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.800> bar<00:02:20.010> real<00:02:20.280> fast<00:02:20.580> and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
up I pulled back that bar real fast and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.970 
up I pulled back that bar real fast and
the<00:02:21.510> motor<00:02:21.720> almost<00:02:22.080> cut<00:02:22.260> off

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.220 

you<00:02:25.980> know<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.250> mean<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.519> like<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:27.569> like<00:02:27.780> almost

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
you know the mean to like it like almost

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.289 
you know the mean to like it like almost
start<00:02:28.590> out<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.489> said<00:02:29.700> well<00:02:29.819> I'm<00:02:30.060> not

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
start out and so I said well I'm not

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.500 
start out and so I said well I'm not
gonna<00:02:30.420> do<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.569> again<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.980> I'm<00:02:32.250> basically

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
gonna do that again so I'm basically

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.059 
gonna do that again so I'm basically
every<00:02:33.510> time<00:02:33.719> I<00:02:33.959> started<00:02:34.349> up<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.680> every<00:02:34.829> time<00:02:34.980> I

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
every time I started up and every time I

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.250 
every time I started up and every time I
engage<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.489> blades<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.030> make<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> conscious

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
engage the blades I make a conscious

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.580 
engage the blades I make a conscious
decision<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:38.060> pull<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.299> bar<00:02:39.599> back<00:02:39.900> as<00:02:40.170> slow

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
decision to pull that bar back as slow

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.520 
decision to pull that bar back as slow
as<00:02:40.799> possible<00:02:41.329> now<00:02:42.329> like<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.019> said<00:02:43.079> I'm<00:02:43.349> not<00:02:43.470> a

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
as possible now like I said I'm not a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.690 
as possible now like I said I'm not a
mechanic<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.790> don't<00:02:45.030> know<00:02:45.209> if<00:02:45.510> maybe<00:02:46.700> my

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
mechanic so I don't know if maybe my

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.460 
mechanic so I don't know if maybe my
drive<00:02:48.030> belts<00:02:48.420> will<00:02:48.569> need<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.959> be<00:02:49.109> replaced

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
drive belts will need to be replaced

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.089 
drive belts will need to be replaced
down<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.950> road<00:02:50.180> just<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.329> that<00:02:52.290> guys<00:02:52.500> drive

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
down the road just like that guys drive

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.949 
down the road just like that guys drive
belt<00:02:53.400> but<00:02:53.760> because<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.150> only<00:02:54.299> had<00:02:54.480> mine<00:02:54.689> since

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
belt but because I only had mine since

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.379 
belt but because I only had mine since
June<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.769> August<00:02:56.189> now<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:56.579> I<00:02:56.760> haven't

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
June and it's August now but I haven't

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.869 
June and it's August now but I haven't
had<00:02:57.540> any<00:02:57.750> problems<00:02:58.200> as<00:02:58.349> of<00:02:58.560> now<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.670> that's

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
had any problems as of now and so that's

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.909 
had any problems as of now and so that's
one<00:03:00.030> wanted<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.599> make<00:03:00.689> this<00:03:00.840> video<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.739> could

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
one wanted to make this video so I could

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.949 
one wanted to make this video so I could
show<00:03:02.129> y'all<00:03:04.939> what<00:03:05.939> it<00:03:06.060> sounds<00:03:06.419> like<00:03:06.450> when<00:03:06.840> it

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
show y'all what it sounds like when it

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.960 
show y'all what it sounds like when it
starts<00:03:07.379> up<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.799> how<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:07.980> engage<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.700> blades

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
starts up and how I engage the blades

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.569 
starts up and how I engage the blades
and<00:03:09.329> this<00:03:10.260> will<00:03:10.409> be<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> cold<00:03:10.829> start<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.280> haven't

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
and this will be a cold start I haven't

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.170 
and this will be a cold start I haven't
started<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.299> couple<00:03:13.019> days<00:03:13.319> so

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
started it for like a couple days so

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.599 
started it for like a couple days so
here's<00:03:15.180> ER<00:03:16.129> all<00:03:17.129> right

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
here's ER all right

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.039 
here's ER all right
let's<00:03:17.939> see<00:03:18.090> if<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.269> could<00:03:18.419> do<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.629> with<00:03:18.840> one

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
let's see if I could do this with one

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:29.000 
let's see if I could do this with one
hand<00:03:26.870> all<00:03:27.870> right<00:03:28.079> like<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.349> said<00:03:28.409> this<00:03:28.799> right

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
hand all right like I said this right

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:37.230 
hand all right like I said this right
here<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.699> blade

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.940 

pull<00:03:38.240> back<00:03:38.450> this<00:03:38.570> tab

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
pull back this tab

00:03:39.950 --> 00:04:08.640 
pull back this tab
and<00:03:40.190> slowly<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.390> use<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.840> blade

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.740 

so<00:04:09.760> like<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:10.849> said<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.090> probably<00:04:11.359> going<00:04:11.629> to

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
so like I said I probably going to

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.229 
so like I said I probably going to
eventually<00:04:12.140> have<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.409> change<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.920> belt<00:04:13.239> like

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
eventually have to change the belt like

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.349 
eventually have to change the belt like
my<00:04:14.420> man<00:04:14.659> but<00:04:15.340> hopefully<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.579> deters<00:04:17.000> that

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
my man but hopefully that deters that

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.439 
my man but hopefully that deters that
for<00:04:17.539> a<00:04:17.570> while<00:04:17.750> because<00:04:18.169> I<00:04:18.259> don't<00:04:18.410> feel<00:04:18.530> like

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
for a while because I don't feel like

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.570 
for a while because I don't feel like
taking<00:04:20.449> apart<00:04:20.959> hope<00:04:21.109> it's<00:04:21.440> easy<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.919> do<00:04:22.100> but<00:04:22.340> I

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580
