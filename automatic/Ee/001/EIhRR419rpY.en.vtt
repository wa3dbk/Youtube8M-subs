00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
already opened this box but let's go

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.990 
already opened this box but let's go
ahead<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:22.460> take<00:00:22.610> a<00:00:22.670> look<00:00:22.960> so<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:25.490> bundle<00:00:25.850> that

ahead and take a look so the bundle that

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.670 
ahead and take a look so the bundle that
I<00:00:26.060> selected<00:00:27.130> for<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.190> kid<00:00:28.520> here<00:00:29.680> consistent

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
I selected for the kid here consistent

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:40.619 
I selected for the kid here consistent
of<00:00:30.860> the<00:00:32.950> cell<00:00:33.950> Pro<00:00:37.719> got<00:00:38.719> this<00:00:39.070> PC<00:00:40.070> connector

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629

my nipples over to the connector that is

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:01.360 
my nipples over to the connector that is
the<00:00:55.839> compatible<00:00:56.839> 10s<00:00:57.409> and<00:00:59.620> a<00:01:00.620> couple<00:01:01.129> of<00:01:01.280> these

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
the compatible 10s and a couple of these

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.070 
the compatible 10s and a couple of these
here<00:01:01.550> banana<00:01:01.850> plugs<00:01:02.289> so<00:01:03.289> that<00:01:04.690> we<00:01:05.690> can<00:01:05.840> solder

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
here banana plugs so that we can solder

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.550 
here banana plugs so that we can solder
on<00:01:06.370> the<00:01:07.370> ends<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.659> connect<00:01:09.110> them<00:01:09.229> up<00:01:09.380> to

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
on the ends and connect them up to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.910 
on the ends and connect them up to
various<00:01:09.920> sources<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:11.600> I'll<00:01:12.500> show<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.740> the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
various sources and I'll show you the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.109 
various sources and I'll show you the
power<00:01:13.100> supply<00:01:13.430> in<00:01:13.610> first<00:01:13.850> of<00:01:13.969> all<00:01:14.619> so<00:01:15.619> let's<00:01:16.119> so

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
power supply in first of all so let's so

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.880 
power supply in first of all so let's so
again<00:01:17.329> here<00:01:17.540> we<00:01:17.659> have<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.079> tennis<00:01:19.869> charger

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
again here we have the tennis charger

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:31.260 
again here we have the tennis charger
from<00:01:21.890> FMA<00:01:22.899> 10s<00:01:23.899> charger<00:01:24.259> from<00:01:24.380> FMA<00:01:29.649> pigtails

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
from FMA 10s charger from FMA pigtails

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.380 
from FMA 10s charger from FMA pigtails
so<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.450> we<00:01:32.539> can<00:01:32.659> convert<00:01:33.049> over<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.390> lipuls

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
so that we can convert over the lipuls

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.740 
so that we can convert over the lipuls
that<00:01:35.539> I<00:01:35.659> have<00:01:37.270> compatible<00:01:38.270> 10s<00:01:40.270> got<00:01:41.270> some<00:01:41.450> soft

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
that I have compatible 10s got some soft

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.919 
that I have compatible 10s got some soft
big<00:01:42.020> here<00:01:44.829> couple<00:01:45.829> of<00:01:46.009> connectors<00:01:46.929> this

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929

interesting thing about this power

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.640 
interesting thing about this power
supply<00:05:16.210> is<00:05:16.270> that<00:05:16.599> you<00:05:17.200> can<00:05:17.440> use<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:18.479> power

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
supply is that you can use to power

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.450 
supply is that you can use to power

outputs at once if you need the high app
option<00:05:24.460> you'll<00:05:25.270> use<00:05:25.450> the<00:05:25.599> binding<00:05:25.900> post<00:05:26.140> if

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
option you'll use the binding post if

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.430 
option you'll use the binding post if
you<00:05:27.490> want<00:05:27.669> the<00:05:27.910> low<00:05:28.660> amp<00:05:30.270> output<00:05:31.270> then<00:05:32.080> you<00:05:32.320> can

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440
