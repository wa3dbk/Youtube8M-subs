get it installed get installed and then
just<00:02:23.290> skip<00:02:23.980> up<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.370> step<00:02:24.580> number<00:02:24.760> eight

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.789 

so<00:02:39.170> guys<00:02:39.319> this<00:02:39.469> is<00:02:39.650> what<00:02:39.859> it<00:02:40.189> says<00:02:40.519> with<00:02:40.730> step<00:02:40.969> 8

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
so guys this is what it says with step 8

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.770 
so guys this is what it says with step 8
use<00:02:42.799> link<00:02:43.069> number<00:02:43.189> 1<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.760> download<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.540> files

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
use link number 1 and download the files

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.229 
use link number 1 and download the files
the<00:02:44.989> fastboot<00:02:45.349> files<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:45.859> you<00:02:45.980> want<00:02:46.239> then

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
the fastboot files that you want then

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.509 
the fastboot files that you want then
that<00:02:47.510> those<00:02:47.659> are<00:02:47.810> required<00:02:48.139> and<00:02:48.409> unzip<00:02:49.099> add<00:02:49.280> to

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
that those are required and unzip add to

that those are required and unzip add to
see<00:02:49.909> drive<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:50.930> it's<00:02:51.170> easier<00:02:51.439> for<00:02:51.499> us<00:02:51.799> to

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
see drive so that it's easier for us to

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:58.319 
see drive so that it's easier for us to
enter<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:54.609> commands<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.989> once<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.379> unzip<00:02:57.680> it

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
enter the commands so once you unzip it

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.920 
enter the commands so once you unzip it
this<00:02:59.329> is<00:02:59.420> how<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.689> should<00:02:59.840> be<00:03:01.540> okay<00:03:02.540> guys<00:03:02.689> let's

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
this is how it should be okay guys let's

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:24.900 
this is how it should be okay guys let's
just<00:03:02.989> go<00:03:03.230> ahead<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.500> turn<00:03:03.799> off<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.099> phone<00:03:04.310> now

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.000 

so<00:03:25.510> once<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.840> phone<00:03:25.990> is<00:03:26.050> off<00:03:26.290> hold<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.830> down

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
now we are in the fastboot mode so right

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.770 
now we are in the fastboot mode so right
