 the friends of jesus episode four 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.750
 looting 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.259
 ain 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.769
 the name of looting 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.630
 in Hebrew it means fair 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.159
 but the protagonist of this episode were nothing fair 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.159
 but rather of a con man 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.689
 I was a tax collector 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.350
 and as it used to be done in its time 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.740
 he collected more money than he had to give to the emperor 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.240
 staying then with the leftovers 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400
 in this way he became very rich 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.070
 until a historic day 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.130
 one day Jesus said to the city 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.979
 and all the people came out unscathed 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.120
 4 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.200
 surround 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 and a paradise is squeezed 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.180
 Zacchaeus moved by curiosity 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.490
 joined the crowd 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.490
 increasing as it approached the square 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.610
 still not tiptoe the house 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 because it was a success 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.420
 stop passing me let me scream only and loot 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.750
 but none heard 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.840
 and even some insulted him 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.930
 by push pointed 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.030
 h 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.260
 then, among others, an amount that the city council meets 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.040
 the mayor 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.780
 in the middle of the square a scare was growing 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.200
 It was a big tree and we bought that they opted for the trunk almost because of the psoe 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.940
 so he plundered despite his low stature 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.349
 refused to the tree 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.439
 he suffered 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.439
 and perched on a sturdy branch 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.209
 from divided in the whole square 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.849
 and also to Jesus 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.439
 surrounded by a genocide with faces of all ages 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.539
 Jesus stopped under the rubble 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.539
 He looked up and said 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.649
 go down right away because today I want to stay at your house 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:43.099
 the people murmured surprised by the unesco after eating at Zacchaeus's house 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.040
 while he only knows that he is a publish a sinner 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.649
 Fakih was also surprised 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.079
 but at the same time contacts 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.719
 He quickly descended from the tree and went home to prepare everything necessary to 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.959
 it 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.769
 Takeo almost did not eat 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.510
 he was very attentive listening to the words that Jesus said about the 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.449
 kingdom of god and the poor 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.449
 jesus told a practice 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.679
 a rich man had his children buy 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.589
 one day the youngest son told him 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:22.589
 Give me my part because I want to leave home 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.309
 the father pleased him 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.199
 and he left the house 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:32.099
 lending itself infiesto if banquets all the money that had received until 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.219
 stay very poor 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:39.329
 then all those who had fun with him left him 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.269
 because they were not real friends 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.339
 they were only interested in their money 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.289
 although he could ask himself 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.469
 Then he went to a villager and asked for work 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.099
 the villager told me 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.509
 You will take my pigs to graze 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:01.069
 but if you eat a single acorn of the animals you will win a beating 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.069
 nomination 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.099
 then the young man thought 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.479
 my father's case and food to spare 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.719
 while I am dying of hunger here 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.719
 I can not eat even the acorns that give the dogs 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.079
 he understood that he had made a mistake by leaving home 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.050
 Then he decided to go back 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.050
 I will go back to my father and ask him for forgiveness 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.020
 his father who had stopped waiting for him 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.530
 and 60 every day on the highest terrace to expand the horizon 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.759
 I was running a lot at stake 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.110
 I have made a mistake 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.110
 they deal with how private data 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.360
 and had a party 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.559
 because I had found the son I had lost 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.559
 but that he had become repentant 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.980
 God also forgives those who repent of their sins add the 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.129
 farrapona 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.520
 Zacchaeus understood that that parable city 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.389
 subway 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.430
 I repent of my sins 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.430
 I'm going to give the list of goods to the poor confessed 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:18.749
 and if someone enthralled 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:21.719
 I will return four times stolen 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.210
 jesus embraced him 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.410
 I have come to look for the sinners son jesus so that no small 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.969
 the deaf 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.969
 and he put himself back in the world 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.069
 today God's salvation has entered my home 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.689
 -said looting 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.050
 with a heart full of joy
