second<00:05:22.570> low<00:05:22.690> part<00:05:22.960> now<00:05:23.110> keep<00:05:23.320> in<00:05:23.410> mind<00:05:23.440> with

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
second low part now keep in mind with

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.140 
second low part now keep in mind with
this<00:05:23.860> tactic<00:05:24.370> if<00:05:25.150> I<00:05:25.300> had<00:05:25.510> you<00:05:25.660> as<00:05:25.780> the

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
this tactic if I had you as the

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.250 
this tactic if I had you as the
prospector<00:05:28.980> why<00:05:29.980> am<00:05:30.100> i<00:05:30.810> video<00:05:31.810> just<00:05:31.960> minimize

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
prospector why am i video just minimize

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.110 
prospector why am i video just minimize
randomly<00:05:32.710> if<00:05:33.160> I<00:05:33.340> were<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.490> use<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.640> prospector

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
randomly if I were to use the prospector

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.730 
randomly if I were to use the prospector
aggressively<00:05:34.810> this<00:05:35.320> wouldn't<00:05:35.620> have<00:05:35.710> happened

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
aggressively this wouldn't have happened

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.650 
aggressively this wouldn't have happened
but<00:05:36.460> oh<00:05:36.760> well

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
but oh well

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.780 
but oh well
can't<00:05:37.930> win<00:05:38.020> them<00:05:38.080> all<00:05:38.230> I<00:05:38.290> guess<00:05:38.640> thanks<00:05:39.640> for

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
can't win them all I guess thanks for

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.000 
can't win them all I guess thanks for
