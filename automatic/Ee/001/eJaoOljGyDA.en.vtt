now keep practicing these steps slow as
I<00:04:53.220> showed<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:54.080> until<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.200> can<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:56.310> know<00:04:56.430> get

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
I showed you until you can you know get

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.400 
I showed you until you can you know get
the<00:04:56.820> momentum<00:04:57.120> not<00:04:57.630> gonna<00:04:57.750> say<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.020> momentum

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
the momentum not gonna say the momentum

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.840 
the momentum not gonna say the momentum
but<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.620> know<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:59.130> got<00:04:59.250> to<00:04:59.340> find<00:04:59.490> your<00:04:59.700> own

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
but you know you got to find your own

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.180 
but you know you got to find your own
little<00:05:00.210> flow<00:05:00.480> with<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.840> steps<00:05:01.140> and<00:05:01.440> then<00:05:01.920> try

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
little flow with the steps and then try

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.490 
little flow with the steps and then try
to<00:05:02.220> speed<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.580> up<00:05:02.820> and<00:05:03.090> then<00:05:03.930> add<00:05:04.080> your<00:05:04.260> little

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
to speed it up and then add your little

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.640 
to speed it up and then add your little
bounce<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.950> it<00:05:05.090> remember<00:05:06.170> there's<00:05:07.170> no<00:05:07.380> real

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
bounce to it remember there's no real

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.260 
bounce to it remember there's no real
certain<00:05:08.340> way<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.520> have<00:05:08.640> to<00:05:08.910> move<00:05:09.060> your<00:05:09.210> body

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
chest go free and that's basically it

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.760 
chest go free and that's basically it
alright<00:05:15.750> those<00:05:15.900> are<00:05:15.960> all<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.290> basic<00:05:16.620> steps

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
alright those are all the basic steps

down you're going to be able to you know

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.420 
down you're going to be able to you know
do<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.150> bunch<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.450> different<00:05:21.570> variations<00:05:22.430> you

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
do a bunch of different variations you

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.820 
do a bunch of different variations you
got<00:05:23.790> to<00:05:23.850> be<00:05:23.910> able<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.150> mix<00:05:24.600> all<00:05:25.200> your<00:05:25.230> steps<00:05:25.650> up

so let's do a little demonstration and

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.830 
so let's do a little demonstration and
how<00:05:32.640> it's<00:05:32.820> going<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.060> look<00:05:33.180> when<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.510> can<00:05:33.660> mix

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
how it's going to look when you can mix

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.390 
how it's going to look when you can mix
all<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.080> steps<00:05:34.350> alright<00:05:35.040> we're<00:05:35.250> going<00:05:35.340> to

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
all the steps alright we're going to
