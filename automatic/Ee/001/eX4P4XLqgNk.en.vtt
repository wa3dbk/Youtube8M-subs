to do is what you're gonna do is you're

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.350 
to do is what you're gonna do is you're
gonna<00:01:16.140> make<00:01:16.409> these<00:01:16.650> things<00:01:16.979> out<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.580> shown<00:01:18.000> so

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
gonna make these things out as shown so

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480 
gonna make these things out as shown so
you're<00:01:18.540> gonna<00:01:18.630> take<00:01:19.080> them<00:01:19.320> Center<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.159> blocks

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you're gonna take them Center to blocks

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.640 
you're gonna take them Center to blocks
like<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.840> you're<00:01:22.080> basically<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
like this and you're basically going to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.310 
like this and you're basically going to
expand<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.159> 8<00:01:23.369> blocks<00:01:23.700> including<00:01:24.049> this<00:01:25.049> block

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
expand out 8 blocks including this block

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.730 
expand out 8 blocks including this block
so<00:01:25.560> 1<00:01:25.860> 2<00:01:27.049> 3<00:01:28.049> 4<00:01:28.950> 5<00:01:29.520> 6<00:01:30.299> 7<00:01:30.960> 8

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.770 
so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
expand<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.369> exactly<00:01:33.090> 8<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.700> do<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.150> all

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
expand out exactly 8 and do that on all

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:47.060 
expand out exactly 8 and do that on all
four<00:01:36.810> corners

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.109 

alright<00:01:48.070> guys<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:48.520> when<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.760> have<00:01:48.880> finished

alright guys so when you have finished

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.240 
alright guys so when you have finished
your<00:01:49.540> fork<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.200> now<00:01:50.320> bottoms<00:01:50.920> what<00:01:51.070> you're

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
your fork and now bottoms what you're

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.910 
your fork and now bottoms what you're
gonna<00:01:51.340> want<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.760> do<00:01:51.970> is<00:01:52.420> expand<00:01:53.229> one<00:01:53.530> more<00:01:53.770> on

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
gonna want to do is expand one more on

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.960 
gonna want to do is expand one more on
the<00:01:54.070> end<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.610> build<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.270> wall<00:01:55.570> like<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.970> so

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
the end and build a wall like this so

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.460 
the end and build a wall like this so
we're<00:01:58.330> gonna<00:01:58.420> go<00:01:58.570> ahead<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.750> do<00:01:58.900> that<00:01:59.020> on<00:01:59.080> all

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
we're gonna go ahead and do that on all

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.270

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
complete as you can see now the last

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.560 
complete as you can see now the last
step<00:04:47.630> is<00:04:48.140> going<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.890> be<00:04:49.580> filling<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.180> canals

step is going to be filling the canals

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.000 
step is going to be filling the canals
with<00:04:50.840> water<00:04:51.080> but<00:04:51.350> before<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.740> want<00:04:51.890> to<00:04:51.950> do

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
that you want to create a little bit of

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.480 
that you want to create a little bit of
an<00:04:53.600> infinite<00:04:53.990> water<00:04:54.140> source<00:04:54.290> here<00:04:54.740> again

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
an infinite water source here again

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.310 
an infinite water source here again
placing<00:04:55.820> one<00:04:56.090> water<00:04:56.300> bucket<00:04:56.660> in<00:04:56.780> one<00:04:56.960> corner

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
placing one water bucket in one corner

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
and one on the other and you will have

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.190 
and one on the other and you will have
infinite<00:04:58.700> water<00:04:59.000> now<00:04:59.210> and<00:04:59.750> you<00:04:59.840> can<00:04:59.960> just<00:05:00.080> keep

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
infinite water now and you can just keep

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.200 
infinite water now and you can just keep
picking<00:05:00.440> buckets<00:05:00.980> up<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:01.430> but<00:05:01.640> I'm<00:05:01.729> on

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
picking buckets up of that but I'm on

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.120 
picking buckets up of that but I'm on
creative<00:05:02.600> so<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.720> do<00:05:02.780> not<00:05:02.990> need<00:05:03.140> to<00:05:03.229> do<00:05:03.350> that<00:05:03.500> so

cautious<00:05:29.909> now<00:05:30.330> I'm<00:05:30.449> gonna<00:05:30.599> come<00:05:30.840> back<00:05:30.960> when

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
cautious now I'm gonna come back when

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.540

I've cleared out all of the torches

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.879 
I've cleared out all of the torches

because it does take a while alright now
the<00:05:34.979> last<00:05:35.039> step<00:05:35.520> would<00:05:35.639> be<00:05:35.699> to<00:05:35.819> destroy<00:05:36.330> your
