00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello full of sports friends leone I have 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.670
 this time busy with what that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.770
 Wrestling is so going on, if all this is real 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.300
 or is it all just show though 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.529
 Teachers as I know you 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.630
 Do you believe what's on TV? 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.840
 but well I'll let you go 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.490
 Hey people today is called wrestling 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.670
 show or sport from me gets the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.099
 answer yes of course you have only times 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.570
 Of course it is already said in total 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.489
 a bit of a show and that does not have either 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.030
 more much with the original one 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.440
 little show so I think if the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.270
 stories are written for it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.190
 think prevails think the winner 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.239
 it's a bit of a show 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.460
 not much to do anymore 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.860
 Westling the ring to do the wrestlers 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.960
 just fight that too 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.449
 Olympic sport remains but it is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.070
 simply exciting at olympic sports 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.410
 is going to learn the real ring so that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.059
 which maybe 50 years ago 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.149
 the normal ring was viewed 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.549
 So the wrestling but wrestle with 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.040
 this double-double scrap has that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.560
 but having nothing to do with politics that is 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.049
 Everything is constructed but it does not matter 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.580
 it's fun athletic thinking 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.110
 cool stories turn out when I am 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.110
 Remember the days where I still remember 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.990
 much more cool story sven cool story 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.210
 then you want to go to the theater 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.430
 looked at the rey mysterio randy 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.229
 orton that were our heroes then gave 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.900
 it 's the etsch then there's niki the aero 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.780
 with yes for me, the whole hear 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.310
 name because of what old pokemon her 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780
 little cousin who has always fought 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.890
 for her honor and she says in a wheelchair 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.020
 it was just so great 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.170
 yes and the stories are from the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.460
 rtl2 what does that mean it has a lot to do with me 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.189
 Not much to do sports 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.540
 Because Sachs can feel the tension 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.890
 before, look at the results but what 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.439
 shall she give herself trouble 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.299
 it 's great it's a sporty kind 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.340
 daily soap and it just makes fun 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.969
 to watch each other 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.409
 chairs on the head so now it is 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.549
 probably everything too niveaulos though 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.649
 I do not really care anyway 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.289
 the bonus because that's just not with 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.630
 So do sports has that's the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.310
 There is no sport in any case 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.230
 daily soap that in any case with 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.880
 But if that's an argument now 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.090
 I do not know for you 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.140
 well the true opinion the true opinion 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.140
 Of course he has mine again 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.830
 always more important owe nice ex 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.720
 club kicked out of the ring and now 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.440
 Are you blind are you in pain 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.290
 give up if wrestling real asks her 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.670
 you really are not wrestling real 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.050
 of course, wrestling is real at the very least 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.640
 when it comes to the classic variant 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.660
 what in the 50 years even so 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.580
 was really practiced 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.870
 Wrestling means to bring translated and there 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.850
 I still really went to the fight and 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.140
 the power, even if it is with 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.450
 today if we compare that with today 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.040
 what is that double double you i was 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.560
 should the nonsense I mean there is yes 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.480
 probably not real so it's just been 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.040
 is true that one must live is remembered 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.380
 But what is sporty anyway? 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.630
 operate or become the bio 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.980
 completed as I said 69 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.950
 Tomorrow will be the first time before you 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.240
 say that it is not a real sport 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.650
 then pat the heads a 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.480
 in some repetition one sees yes 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.140
 really like those who miss it yes 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.540
 Well 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.160
 so i think if you are with yours 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.480
 three meters wide evening all the time 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.620
 would hit each other on the head 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.110
 then they would not be so many 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.700
 to endure struggles 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.080
 it's just that there are stories 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.820
 written only to the presentation of the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.520
 somehow to amuse people 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.900
 I already have it already 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.940
 It's a bit like the daily 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.740
 Soaps sport is natural is a lot 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.690
 but it is still sports 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.190
 In the process, characters are created 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.360
 and that's how you create it 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.190
 of course it can save somehow 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.300
 Also break it if you're wrestling 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.560
 fan is and everyone has been before 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.750
 look at results what actually 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.370
 does not make much sense if it's good 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.640
 is constructed but you can also 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.250
 just this beautiful this beautiful 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.870
 Above all, sport enjoys fighting 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.070
 who will be the winner and the 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.709
 all the other a bit 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.910
 improvisation by doing well and that 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.440
 only then what maybe still real 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.940
 is and the injury is because of that 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.620
 just as stupid and injured himself 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.209
 actually in these actions because he 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.920
 just kind of a stunt show 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.209
 or something left over and over on it 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.560
 fight me right when there 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.490
 injured it is not right here 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.280
 So at some point you have once you too 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.359
 intervene with real racing cup 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.359
 matches in any case nothing to do 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.540
 yes fine with the rings with the wrestling 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.250
 in the original sense as natural 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.690
 not much to do but that's it 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.940
 so far from me so far 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.650
 believe today when in germany from 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.150
 wrestling talk then understands 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.310
 no ring but there you understand 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.470
 beautiful abu dhabi if the places 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.560
 the trio that was one of mine 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.280
 first spot landing maybe the first 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.950
 probably done that clean 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.160
 and if I take you to the next of sticks 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:00.210
 a wall or just with 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.440
 decision spectator hashtag gens 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.240
 you get one now reigns for 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.919
 that you also built the sticks of 1 1 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.000
 I have the most hashtags 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.400
 probably retract 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.810
 yes I think I have you today 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.169
 was again very good on everyone 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.330
 funny, what else is there for you
