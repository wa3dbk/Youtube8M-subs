and the concrete pier here but what's
this<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.470> historic<00:01:20.040> part<00:01:21.530> what's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
this this is the historic part what's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.970 
this this is the historic part what's
that

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.850 

that's<00:01:25.980> a<00:01:26.250> modern<00:01:26.750> quote-unquote<00:01:27.860> surely

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that's a modern quote-unquote surely

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.660 
that's a modern quote-unquote surely
more<00:01:29.100> than<00:01:29.310> 50<00:01:29.700> years<00:01:29.730> old<00:01:32.150> concrete<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
more than 50 years old concrete here and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.400 
more than 50 years old concrete here and
this<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:38.540> rocks<00:01:39.540> slabs<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.280> regular<00:01:41.790> shape

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
this is rocks slabs of the regular shape

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.330 
this is rocks slabs of the regular shape
piled<00:01:43.410> together<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.340> held<00:01:44.670> by<00:01:45.830> not<00:01:46.830> concrete

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
piled together and held by not concrete

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.890 
piled together and held by not concrete
but<00:01:47.700> probably<00:01:48.120> mortar

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
but probably mortar

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.780 
but probably mortar
I'll<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.740> people<00:01:50.040> make<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.370> distinction

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
I'll just people make the distinction

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.920 
I'll just people make the distinction
doc<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.480> that<00:01:51.660> he's<00:01:51.780> being<00:01:52.020> too<00:01:52.260> scientific

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.630 

so<00:01:57.930> there's<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.680> other<00:01:58.710> pier<00:01:59.510> modern<00:02:00.510> and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
so there's the other pier modern and

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.120 
so there's the other pier modern and
then<00:02:02.640> if<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.000> look<00:02:03.330> right<00:02:04.080> there<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.830> Steve's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
then if you look right there the Steve's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.520 
then if you look right there the Steve's
finger<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.880> pointing<00:02:06.510> right<00:02:06.720> on<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.560> right

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
finger is pointing right on it right

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.690 
finger is pointing right on it right
there<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.860> bushes<00:02:11.100> you<00:02:11.610> see<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:14.310> more

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
there in the bushes you see it it's more

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:30.090 
there in the bushes you see it it's more
of<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:17.540> do<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.600> see<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:23.720> now<00:02:24.800> where<00:02:25.800> we<00:02:25.980> are

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.760 

is<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:31.060> back<00:02:31.330> here<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.870> can't<00:02:32.110> see<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.530> back

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
is that back here you can't see it back

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.270 
is that back here you can't see it back
in<00:02:32.980> there<00:02:33.280> was<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.850> mill<00:02:34.210> in<00:02:35.280> post-colonial

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
in there was a mill in post-colonial

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
in there was a mill in post-colonial
times<00:02:37.030> or<00:02:37.540> colonial<00:02:38.020> times<00:02:38.700> now<00:02:39.700> going<00:02:40.120> back

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
times or colonial times now going back

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.720 
times or colonial times now going back
almost<00:02:40.920> two<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.400> united<00:02:42.670> states

revolution in breaking free from Great
Britain<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:47.020> Raceway<00:02:47.560> came<00:02:47.980> out<00:02:48.190> it's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
Britain and the Raceway came out it's

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.100 
Britain and the Raceway came out it's
just<00:02:49.090> on<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.600> other<00:02:49.690> side<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.990> this

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
just on the other side of this

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.770 
just on the other side of this
vegetation<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.250> came<00:02:51.460> out<00:02:51.700> right<00:02:52.480> there

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
vegetation and it came out right there

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.940 
vegetation and it came out right there
and<00:02:53.820> undoubtedly<00:02:54.820> in<00:02:55.510> colonial<00:02:56.110> times<00:02:56.140> this

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
and undoubtedly in colonial times this

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.760 
and undoubtedly in colonial times this
was<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.280> road<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:59.040> came<00:03:00.040> across<00:03:00.400> here<00:03:01.740> on<00:03:02.740> a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
was a road that came across here on a

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:13.410 
was a road that came across here on a
low<00:03:03.190> bridge<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:10.740> because<00:03:11.740> of<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:12.010> creek<00:03:12.420> it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
low bridge and because of the creek it

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.830 
low bridge and because of the creek it
also<00:03:13.630> was<00:03:14.020> a<00:03:14.050> mill<00:03:14.410> for<00:03:14.440> grinding<00:03:14.800> grain<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:18.840> of

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
also was a mill for grinding grain so of

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.930 
also was a mill for grinding grain so of
the<00:03:20.050> sieve<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.500> almost<00:03:20.860> absolutely<00:03:21.460> certain

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
the sieve is almost absolutely certain

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.810 
the sieve is almost absolutely certain
that<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.520> very<00:03:25.150> old<00:03:26.040> bridge<00:03:27.040> pier<00:03:27.490> and

are<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.580> modern<00:03:33.790> replacements<00:03:36.090> that's<00:03:37.090> what

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
are the modern replacements that's what
