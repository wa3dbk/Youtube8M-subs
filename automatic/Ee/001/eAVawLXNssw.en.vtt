behind<00:02:20.129> that<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:23.390> tap<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.569> back<00:02:24.750> up

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
behind that I tap the back up

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:50.229 
behind that I tap the back up
screwdriver<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.370> comes<00:02:29.579> out<00:02:39.440> yeah<00:02:40.440> hold<00:02:40.769> up

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.600 

then<00:02:51.239> part<00:02:51.599> two<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:52.170> will<00:02:52.440> be<00:02:52.709> installing<00:02:53.250> new

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
then part two I will be installing new

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.030 
then part two I will be installing new
bearings
