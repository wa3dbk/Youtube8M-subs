00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
product ok in the touring version so

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.240 
product ok in the touring version so
it's<00:00:20.140> an<00:00:20.290> atmospheric<00:00:20.890> generator<00:00:22.770> haze<00:00:23.770> and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
it's an atmospheric generator haze and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.070 
it's an atmospheric generator haze and
fog<00:00:24.580> one<00:00:25.390> generator<00:00:25.930> one<00:00:26.740> output<00:00:27.630> ok<00:00:28.630> duel

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
fog one generator one output ok duel

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.200 
fog one generator one output ok duel
mode<00:00:29.289> so<00:00:30.280> we<00:00:30.580> will<00:00:30.760> go<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:32.070> atmosphere<00:00:33.070> so<00:00:33.730> haze

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
mode so we will go in atmosphere so haze

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.190 
mode so we will go in atmosphere so haze
mode<00:00:34.769> maximum<00:00:35.769> output

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.020 

then<00:00:39.800> a<00:00:39.830> little<00:00:40.070> fan<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.370> blow<00:00:40.460> everything<00:00:40.790> up

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
then a little fan to blow everything up

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.370 
then a little fan to blow everything up
yeah<00:00:41.390> that's<00:00:42.230> for<00:00:42.380> our<00:00:42.530> neighbors<00:00:42.970> sure

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
yeah that's for our neighbors sure

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.790 
yeah that's for our neighbors sure
middle<00:00:45.380> respect

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:57.200 

okay<00:00:50.710> changing<00:00:51.710> mode<00:00:51.920> from<00:00:53.140> hays<00:00:54.140> before

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.100 

maximum<00:00:58.170> output<00:00:59.000> and<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.360> takes<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.719> second<00:01:01.050> or

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
maximum output and it takes a second or

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:15.230 
maximum output and it takes a second or
two<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> clear<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:02.040> we<00:01:02.160> go

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.929 

now<00:01:15.780> how<00:01:16.380> long<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.890> they<00:01:17.009> run<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.399> either<00:01:17.579> mode

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
now how long can they run in either mode

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.020 
now how long can they run in either mode
well<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.290> haze<00:01:19.890> mow<00:01:20.189> over<00:01:21.530> 300<00:01:22.530> hours<00:01:22.649> of

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
roughly around 11,000 touring version

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.370 
roughly around 11,000 touring version
and<00:01:50.240> 650<00:01:51.679> you<00:01:52.679> know<00:01:53.030> 6500<00:01:54.030> standard<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:55.110> just

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and 650 you know 6500 standard for just

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.219 
and 650 you know 6500 standard for just
the<00:01:55.560> unit<00:01:55.890> yeah<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.520> unit<00:01:56.940> as<00:01:57.229> this

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the unit yeah just the unit as this

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.529 
the unit yeah just the unit as this
version<00:01:58.679> as<00:01:59.069> we<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.459> over<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.700> okay<00:02:00.299> and

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
version as we have over here okay and

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.430 
version as we have over here okay and
connected<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> computer<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:03.440> we're

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
connected on the computer for we're

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.870 
connected on the computer for we're
operating<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:06.179> one<00:02:06.450> oh<00:02:07.160> excuse<00:02:08.160> me<00:02:08.369> ACM

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
operating as this one oh excuse me ACM

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.110 
operating as this one oh excuse me ACM
patient<00:02:09.450> okay<00:02:09.750> great<00:02:10.380> also<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> first

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
patient okay great also it's the first

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.550 
patient okay great also it's the first
generator<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:15.110> networkable<00:02:16.110> that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
generator and that is networkable that

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.740 
generator and that is networkable that
work<00:02:16.739> for<00:02:16.920> all<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.030> first<00:02:18.269> generator

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
work for all so it's the first generator

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.849 
work for all so it's the first generator
that<00:02:19.470> voltage<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.730> from<00:02:21.090> 100<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.380> two<00:02:22.560> hundred

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
that voltage is from 100 the two hundred

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.370 
that voltage is from 100 the two hundred
and<00:02:22.950> fifty<00:02:23.130> fifty<00:02:24.060> sixty<00:02:24.510> years<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:25.350> that

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
and fifty fifty sixty years so that

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.440 
and fifty fifty sixty years so that
generator<00:02:25.950> operates<00:02:26.519> anywhere<00:02:27.000> anywhere<00:02:27.359> in

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
generator operates anywhere anywhere in

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.360 
generator operates anywhere anywhere in
the<00:02:27.540> world<00:02:27.720> what<00:02:28.049> up<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.739> just<00:02:28.769> want<00:02:29.310> an
