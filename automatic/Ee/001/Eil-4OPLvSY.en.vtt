ready<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.780> post-workout<00:00:58.379> I'd<00:00:58.620> add<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
ready for a post-workout I'd add a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.319 
ready for a post-workout I'd add a
little<00:00:58.980> maybe<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.550> love<00:00:59.699> apple<00:00:59.969> sauce<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
little maybe you love apple sauce to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.510 
little maybe you love apple sauce to
slow<00:01:00.780> down<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.410> absorption<00:01:01.649> rate<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> car

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
slow down the absorption rate of the car

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.369 
slow down the absorption rate of the car
or<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.760> rice<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.960> how<00:01:04.080> you've<00:01:04.260> been<00:01:04.320> doing

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
or the rice that's how you've been doing

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.109 
or the rice that's how you've been doing
some<00:01:04.650> interesting<00:01:04.860> thing<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.280> protein<00:01:05.729> tell

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
some interesting thing with protein tell

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.219 
some interesting thing with protein tell
me<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.360> you've<00:01:06.450> been<00:01:06.540> doing<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:06.810> proteins

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
me what you've been doing your proteins

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.600 
me what you've been doing your proteins
lowered<00:01:07.680> your<00:01:07.830> protein<00:01:08.189> he's<00:01:08.310> telling<00:01:08.580> me

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
lowered your protein he's telling me

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.640 
lowered your protein he's telling me
right<00:01:08.670> um<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.110> even<00:01:10.260> want<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> tell

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
right um I don't even want to tell

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.440 
right um I don't even want to tell
people<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> protein<00:01:11.490> treat<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.180> just

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
people of a protein treat but I just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.020 
people of a protein treat but I just
basically<00:01:12.659> lured<00:01:13.049> my<00:01:13.229> protein<00:01:13.820> because<00:01:14.820> at

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
basically lured my protein because at

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.289 
basically lured my protein because at
this<00:01:15.240> point<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.659> really<00:01:16.080> don't<00:01:16.200> need<00:01:16.409> protein

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
this point we really don't need protein

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.240 
this point we really don't need protein
volume<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.659> need<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> amino<00:01:19.170> acids<00:01:19.530> so

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
volume we just need the amino acids so

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.359 
volume we just need the amino acids so
I'm<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.240> mixing<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.380> amino<00:01:22.710> acids<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.250> my

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
I'm just mixing so amino acids with my

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.760 
I'm just mixing so amino acids with my
carb<00:01:23.610> carb<00:01:24.240> loading<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.229> even<00:01:25.500> less

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
carb carb loading and then even less

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.320 
carb carb loading and then even less
volume<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.820> used<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> go<00:01:27.210> from

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
volume you know like we used to go from

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.270 
volume you know like we used to go from
eating<00:01:27.540> eight<00:01:28.140> ounces<00:01:28.500> chicken<00:01:28.920> down<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
eating eight ounces chicken down to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.490 
eating eight ounces chicken down to
three<00:01:29.460> or<00:01:29.520> four<00:01:29.640> ounces<00:01:29.880> per<00:01:30.090> meal<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.439> I

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
three or four ounces per meal and so I

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.530 
three or four ounces per meal and so I
mean<00:01:31.950> less<00:01:32.220> than<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.759> eating<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.240> food

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
mean less than that here eating one food

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
mean less than that here eating one food
meal<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> day<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.290> protein<00:01:34.740> meal<00:01:34.950> effect

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
meal a day one protein meal effect

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.120 
meal a day one protein meal effect
exactly<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.210> now<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:38.070> know

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
exactly so now I'm just so you know

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.859 
exactly so now I'm just so you know
having<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.610> little<00:01:38.820> bit<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.000> ahi<00:01:39.270> tuna<00:01:39.659> that'd

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
having a little bit of ahi tuna that'd

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.190 
having a little bit of ahi tuna that'd
be<00:01:39.900> my<00:01:40.079> next<00:01:40.320> meal<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:42.000> some<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:43.170> more

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
be my next meal and and some some more

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.999 
be my next meal and and some some more
carbs<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.670> amino<00:01:45.060> acids<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.420> between

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
carbs and then amino acids in between

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.350

where<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.229> know<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.500> morning<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
where you know that morning I was a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.359 
where you know that morning I was a
little<00:01:56.310> flat<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.820> will<00:01:57.000> try

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
little flat that I will try

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.919 
little flat that I will try
eat<00:01:57.490> up<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:58.060> food<00:01:58.270> just<00:01:58.299> doesn't<00:01:58.570> have

eat up and that food just doesn't have
time<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.289> process<00:01:59.500> so<00:01:59.950> I'm<00:02:00.399> just<00:02:00.670> trying<00:02:00.850> to

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
time to process so I'm just trying to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.880 
time to process so I'm just trying to
eliminate<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.450> situation<00:02:02.020> just<00:02:02.049> keep<00:02:02.619> the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
eliminate that situation just keep the

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.950 
eliminate that situation just keep the
Middle's<00:02:03.189> frequent<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:04.390> keep<00:02:04.570> going<00:02:04.869> up

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
Middle's frequent and just keep going up

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.289 
Middle's frequent and just keep going up
slowly<00:02:05.289> and<00:02:05.710> it's<00:02:06.429> worked<00:02:06.640> pretty<00:02:06.700> well<00:02:07.000> let's

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
slowly and it's worked pretty well let's

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.380 
slowly and it's worked pretty well let's
see<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.569> waste<00:02:08.670> probably<00:02:09.670> Wow

yes<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.920> it's<00:02:12.849> probably<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.180> measured<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:13.660> for

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
yes it's it's probably I measured it for
