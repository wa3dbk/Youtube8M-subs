00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
angry and so I started writing the blog

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.259 
angry and so I started writing the blog
I<00:02:48.080> thought<00:02:48.290> these<00:02:48.500> people<00:02:48.920> are<00:02:49.040> jerks<00:02:49.400> for

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
I thought these people are jerks for

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.300 
I thought these people are jerks for
setting<00:02:50.810> such<00:02:51.110> a<00:02:51.140> bad<00:02:51.620> example<00:02:51.860> of

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
setting such a bad example of

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.690 
setting such a bad example of
enlightenment<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.360> know<00:02:53.480> they<00:02:53.810> they<00:02:54.140> they

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
enlightenment you know they they they

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.080 
enlightenment you know they they they
render<00:02:55.700> themselves<00:02:56.260> living<00:02:57.260> saints<00:02:57.980> based<00:02:58.819> on

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
render themselves living saints based on

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.860 
render themselves living saints based on
what<00:02:59.630> people<00:03:00.370> expect<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.519> light<00:03:02.180> statehood

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
what people expect of light statehood

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.220 
what people expect of light statehood
and<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.650> has<00:03:03.920> almost<00:03:04.489> nothing<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.329> do<00:03:05.540> with

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
and that has almost nothing to do with

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.319 
and that has almost nothing to do with
enlightenment<00:03:06.680> as<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.370> exists<00:03:07.819> as<00:03:08.030> an

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
enlightenment as it exists as an

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.530 
enlightenment as it exists as an
ordinary<00:03:08.690> truth<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.440> everyone<00:03:09.799> now<00:03:10.610> this

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
ordinary truth and everyone now this

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.080 
ordinary truth and everyone now this
seems<00:03:11.750> like<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:13.250> fact<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:13.880> is

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
seems like this the fact that this is

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.270 
seems like this the fact that this is
happening<00:03:14.299> comes<00:03:14.810> from<00:03:14.989> two<00:03:15.200> sides<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.799> mean

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
happening comes from two sides I mean
