 lucky to bring them and be able to 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.030
 enjoy this fact that many countries 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.990
 around you will not be able to do it if 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.530

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.650
 the radio puts your classes 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.420
 for that time there was no mp3 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.860

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.200

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.909

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.569
 moment they were part of life 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.159
 of one's knowledge and history 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.069
 they basically influence one's life 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.689

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.980
