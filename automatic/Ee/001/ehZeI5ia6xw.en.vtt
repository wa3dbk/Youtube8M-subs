apart<00:02:54.079> and<00:02:54.349> clean<00:02:54.530> inside<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:55.099> there<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.459> didn't

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
apart and clean inside of there I didn't

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.479 
apart and clean inside of there I didn't
find<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.329> necessary<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.870> do<00:02:57.049> that<00:02:57.079> it<00:02:58.069> seems

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
find it necessary to do that it seems

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.430 
find it necessary to do that it seems
like<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.940> part<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.569> is<00:02:59.659> sealed<00:02:59.959> up<00:03:00.170> pretty

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
like that part of it is sealed up pretty

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.699 
like that part of it is sealed up pretty
good<00:03:00.680> most<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.700> dirt<00:03:02.000> gets<00:03:02.450> between<00:03:02.959> from

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
good most of the dirt gets between from

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.750 
good most of the dirt gets between from
the<00:03:03.859> front<00:03:04.189> between<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.540> second<00:03:06.109> and<00:03:06.140> third

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
the front between the second and third

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.059 
the front between the second and third
element<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:08.540> third<00:03:08.569> what<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.319> call<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.829> third

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
element the third what I call the third

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.520 
element the third what I call the third
element<00:03:10.310> is<00:03:10.700> actually<00:03:10.879> the<00:03:11.269> one<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:11.569> does

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
element is actually the one that does

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.129 
element is actually the one that does
your<00:03:12.709> zooming<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.519> out<00:03:13.670> moves<00:03:14.180> forward

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
your zooming in and out moves forward

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.160 
your zooming in and out moves forward
and<00:03:15.260> backwards<00:03:15.709> in<00:03:15.889> there<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:17.750> may<00:03:17.930> not<00:03:17.959> be

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
and backwards in there that may not be

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.259 
and backwards in there that may not be
what<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:18.739> actually<00:03:18.889> called<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:20.060> that's

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
what it's actually called but that's

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.960 
what it's actually called but that's
what<00:03:20.450> I'm<00:03:20.569> calling<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:24.430> lot<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:25.459> people<00:03:25.819> may

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
what I'm calling so a lot of people may

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.690 
what I'm calling so a lot of people may
say<00:03:26.329> this<00:03:26.540> isn't<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.870> way<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.079> do<00:03:27.379> it<00:03:27.560> or<00:03:27.709> that

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
say this isn't the way to do it or that

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.430 
say this isn't the way to do it or that
I<00:03:28.790> shouldn't<00:03:29.150> do<00:03:29.329> it<00:03:29.359> or<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:29.989> shouldn't

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
I shouldn't do it or that you shouldn't

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.619 
I shouldn't do it or that you shouldn't
do<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.709> I'm<00:03:31.250> not<00:03:31.459> saying<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.909> should<00:03:32.180> I'm<00:03:32.450> not

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
do it I'm not saying you should I'm not

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.750 
do it I'm not saying you should I'm not
saying<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.049> shouldn't<00:03:33.349> I'm<00:03:33.859> just<00:03:34.310> saying<00:03:34.549> it

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
saying you shouldn't I'm just saying it

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.080 
saying you shouldn't I'm just saying it
worked<00:03:35.030> for<00:03:35.329> me<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.750> took<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.919> off<00:03:37.099> to<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.790> part

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
worked for me I took it off to the part

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.780 
worked for me I took it off to the part
cleaned<00:03:39.019> it<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.500> marked<00:03:40.190> where<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.459> screws

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
cleaned it I marked where the screws

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.020 
cleaned it I marked where the screws
were<00:03:41.150> in<00:03:41.680> relationship<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:43.699> where<00:03:43.910> the

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
were in relationship to to where the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.330 
were in relationship to to where the
front<00:03:44.269> element<00:03:44.540> was<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.349> put<00:03:46.069> it<00:03:46.160> back<00:03:46.280> on

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
front element was and put it back on

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.470 
front element was and put it back on
there<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:48.819> reason<00:03:49.819> why<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:50.000> did<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.269> was

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
there and reason why I did it was

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.580 
there and reason why I did it was
because<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:50.900> was<00:03:51.049> having<00:03:51.349> a<00:03:51.379> little<00:03:51.440> trouble

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
because I was having a little trouble

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.909 
because I was having a little trouble
with<00:03:51.919> low<00:03:52.190> light<00:03:52.489> and<00:03:53.319> when<00:03:54.319> I<00:03:54.349> looked<00:03:54.680> at<00:03:54.829> the

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
with low light and when I looked at the

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.470 
with low light and when I looked at the
front<00:03:55.160> of<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.280> lens<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.730> actually<00:03:56.120> had<00:03:56.269> so

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
front of the lens it actually had so

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.830 
front of the lens it actually had so
much<00:03:56.629> dust<00:03:56.959> in<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.349> that<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.519> was<00:03:58.760> cutting<00:03:59.599> back

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
much dust in it that it was cutting back

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.990 
much dust in it that it was cutting back
the<00:04:00.079> amount<00:04:00.379> of<00:04:00.470> light<00:04:00.709> to<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.519> lens<00:04:01.730> would

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
the amount of light to it the lens would

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.089 
the amount of light to it the lens would
allow<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.239> come<00:04:02.599> in<00:04:02.780> there<00:04:02.989> to<00:04:03.739> get<00:04:03.889> to<00:04:04.010> the

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
allow to come in there to get to the

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.780 
allow to come in there to get to the
sensor<00:04:04.549> say<00:04:04.849> my<00:04:05.560> theory<00:04:06.560> was<00:04:06.889> to<00:04:07.160> clean<00:04:07.519> that

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
sensor say my theory was to clean that

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.159 
sensor say my theory was to clean that
and<00:04:07.849> that<00:04:08.269> would<00:04:08.449> increase<00:04:08.959> my<00:04:10.090> low-light

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
and that would increase my low-light

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.240 
and that would increase my low-light
expectations<00:04:12.190> as<00:04:13.190> far<00:04:13.519> as<00:04:13.639> for<00:04:13.910> focusing

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
expectations as far as for focusing

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.610 
expectations as far as for focusing
that's<00:04:16.250> where<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.459> was<00:04:16.669> having<00:04:16.940> my<00:04:17.060> problem<00:04:17.620> so

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
that's where I was having my problem so

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.610 
that's where I was having my problem so
anyway<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:19.280> haven't<00:04:19.669> tested<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.449> yet<00:04:20.720> but<00:04:21.470> I'm

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
anyway I haven't tested it yet but I'm

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.140 
anyway I haven't tested it yet but I'm
hoping<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.949> will<00:04:25.190> remedy<00:04:25.699> a<00:04:25.820> lot

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
hoping that that that will remedy a lot

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.260 
hoping that that that will remedy a lot
of<00:04:26.300> my<00:04:26.449> problem<00:04:27.699> because<00:04:28.699> I<00:04:28.820> hadn't<00:04:29.120> had<00:04:29.210> that

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
of my problem because I hadn't had that

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.290 
of my problem because I hadn't had that
problem<00:04:29.630> before<00:04:29.800> this<00:04:30.820> particular<00:04:31.820> camera

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
problem before this particular camera

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.200 
problem before this particular camera
and<00:04:32.780> lens<00:04:33.349> is<00:04:33.680> generally<00:04:34.099> very<00:04:34.400> fast<00:04:34.699> and<00:04:35.060> look

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
and lens is generally very fast and look

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.040 
and lens is generally very fast and look
like<00:04:35.449> for<00:04:36.020> what<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:36.860> so<00:04:37.130> 2.8

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.680 

so<00:04:41.650> anyway<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.310> just<00:04:42.520> wanted<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.180> kind<00:04:43.330> of<00:04:43.480> share

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
so anyway I just wanted to kind of share

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.030 
so anyway I just wanted to kind of share
that<00:04:43.750> a<00:04:43.990> little<00:04:44.200> bit<00:04:44.290> of<00:04:44.380> information<00:04:44.590> with

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
that a little bit of information with

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.360 
that a little bit of information with
you<00:04:45.190> because<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:46.600> know<00:04:46.750> YouTube<00:04:47.470> is<00:04:47.710> just<00:04:47.770> an

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
you because you know YouTube is just an

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.970 
you because you know YouTube is just an
awesome<00:04:48.580> source<00:04:49.240> of<00:04:49.450> information<00:04:49.780> for<00:04:50.410> me<00:04:50.590> for

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
awesome source of information for me for

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.120 
awesome source of information for me for
various<00:04:51.880> different<00:04:52.030> things<00:04:52.480> that<00:04:52.600> I've

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
various different things that I've

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.850 
various different things that I've
wanted<00:04:54.130> to<00:04:54.340> venture<00:04:54.550> NT<00:04:55.030> so<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:56.260> think<00:04:56.650> it's

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
wanted to venture NT so I think it's

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.740 
wanted to venture NT so I think it's
important<00:04:57.640> that<00:04:57.670> we<00:04:57.940> all<00:04:58.120> try<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.480> give

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
important that we all try to give

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.020 
important that we all try to give
something<00:04:59.260> back<00:04:59.340> even<00:05:00.340> if<00:05:00.460> it's<00:05:00.670> something

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
something back even if it's something
