you<00:00:16.650> want<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> really<00:00:17.039> focus<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> grain<00:00:17.940> of

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
you want to really focus on the grain of

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.269 
you want to really focus on the grain of
the<00:00:18.330> board<00:00:18.660> where<00:00:19.590> you're<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> look<00:00:19.980> for

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the board where you're going to look for

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.390 
the board where you're going to look for
on<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> good-quality<00:00:21.029> bow<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.920> straight

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
on a good-quality bow is the straight

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.490 
on a good-quality bow is the straight

to<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.710> as<00:00:25.830> straight<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.160> possible<00:00:26.220> without

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
to be as straight as possible without

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.240 
to be as straight as possible without
much<00:00:27.180> runoff<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.930> runoff<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.439> where<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
much runoff and a runoff is where the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.980 
much runoff and a runoff is where the
grain<00:00:29.429> actually<00:00:29.789> starts<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.119> tilt<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:30.539> over

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
grain actually starts to tilt up over

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.269 
grain actually starts to tilt up over
this<00:00:31.080> edge<00:00:31.349> that's<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.830> make<00:00:31.980> your<00:00:32.130> bow

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
this edge that's going to make your bow

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.680 
this edge that's going to make your bow
weaker<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.480> make<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
weaker and it's going to make the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.330 
weaker and it's going to make the
tillering<00:00:33.989> process<00:00:34.500> which<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> process

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
tillering process which is the process

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.819 
tillering process which is the process
of<00:00:35.460> bending<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.910> bow<00:00:36.090> much<00:00:36.420> harder<00:00:36.840> these<00:00:37.620> are

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
of bending the bow much harder these are

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.049 
of bending the bow much harder these are
the<00:00:37.890> tools<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.520> using<00:00:38.730> today

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the tools are going to be using today

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:39.799 
the tools are going to be using today
we're<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.329> start<00:00:39.450> off<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
we're going to start off with the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
we're going to start off with the
Stanley<00:00:40.200> shear<00:00:40.379> form<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.399> use

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
Stanley shear form we're going to use

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.340 
Stanley shear form we're going to use
this<00:00:41.820> actually<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.360> remove<00:00:42.510> most<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> wood

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this actually to remove most of the wood

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.630 
this actually to remove most of the wood
on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> bow<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> tool<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.399> we'll<00:00:44.520> be

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
on the bow it's the tool that we'll be

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.060 
on the bow it's the tool that we'll be
using<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.059> most<00:00:45.170> we<00:00:46.170> use<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.469> actually<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
using the most we use it actually like a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.920 
using the most we use it actually like a
plane<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:47.820> instead<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.300> plane<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.719> actually

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
plane but instead of a plane we actually

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.450 
plane but instead of a plane we actually
have<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> lot<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.410> little<00:00:49.620> small<00:00:49.800> cutting

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
have a lot of little small cutting

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.610 
have a lot of little small cutting
surfaces<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.350> cut

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
surfaces what this is going to do is cut

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.590 
surfaces what this is going to do is cut
little<00:00:52.920> slivers<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.370> wood<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.910> bring<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.449> up

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
little slivers of wood and bring them up

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.119 
little slivers of wood and bring them up
through<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> plane<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.620> spiraling<00:00:56.070> motion

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
through the plane in a spiraling motion

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
through the plane in a spiraling motion
now<00:00:57.000> next<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> farriers<00:00:58.199> rasp<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
now next we have the farriers rasp and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.900 
now next we have the farriers rasp and
the<00:00:58.829> only<00:00:58.980> thing<00:00:59.219> we're<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> use<00:00:59.730> this

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the only thing we're going to use this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.720 
the only thing we're going to use this
for<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.449> file<00:01:00.989> down<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.350> tips<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.550> bow

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
for is to file down the tips of the bow

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.200 
for is to file down the tips of the bow
after<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> knocks<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.820> now<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> next

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
after we put the knocks on now the next

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.300 
after we put the knocks on now the next
three<00:01:06.390> tools<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:08.010> ruler

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
three tools that we have are the ruler

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.920 
three tools that we have are the ruler
the<00:01:08.580> straightedge<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> flap<00:01:09.510> instantly

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the straightedge and the flap instantly

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
the straightedge and the flap instantly
and<00:01:10.110> finally<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> rat<00:01:11.310> tail<00:01:11.549> file

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and finally we have the rat tail file

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.100 
and finally we have the rat tail file
and<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> only<00:01:12.299> thing<00:01:12.510> we're<00:01:12.630> using<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.049> for

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and the only thing we're using this for

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.230 
and the only thing we're using this for
today<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:14.220> file<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> knocks<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
today is to file in the knocks and the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.370 
today is to file in the knocks and the
knocks<00:01:15.479> are<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> string<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.140> actually

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
knocks are what the string is actually

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.499 
knocks are what the string is actually
going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> rest<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.950> while<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> bow<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.240> during

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
going to rest on while the bow is during

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.940 
going to rest on while the bow is during
up<00:01:20.900> when<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.930> actually<00:01:22.080> start<00:01:22.380> making<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.830> bow

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
up when I actually start making the bow

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
up when I actually start making the bow
man<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.340> through<00:01:23.430> some<00:01:23.970> terms<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.720> using

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
man going through some terms and using

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
man going through some terms and using
some<00:01:25.259> phrases<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.710> people<00:01:25.890> might<00:01:26.310> not

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
some phrases that people might not

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.710 
some phrases that people might not
understand<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.299> ahead<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
understand so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.090 
understand so I'm going to go ahead and
explain<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.020> couple<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.409> those<00:01:28.470> before<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:28.979> get

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
explain a couple of those before we get

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490 
explain a couple of those before we get
going<00:01:29.400> first<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.659> segment<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> bow<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
going first the segment of the bow that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.990 
going first the segment of the bow that
actually<00:01:31.829> faces<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> shooter<00:01:32.759> when<00:01:32.909> he's

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
actually faces the shooter when he's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.880 
actually faces the shooter when he's
shooting<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.390> called<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> belly<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.110> what's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
shooting is called the belly and what's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.109 
shooting is called the belly and what's
important<00:01:35.220> about<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.430> belly<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> it

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
important about the belly is that it

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.789 
important about the belly is that it
needs<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> strong<00:01:36.720> compression<00:01:37.560> force

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
needs to have a strong compression force

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
needs to have a strong compression force
and<00:01:38.009> compression<00:01:38.430> means<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.030> pull

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and compression means that as you pull

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.679 
and compression means that as you pull
it<00:01:39.270> back

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it back

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.170 
it back
it<00:01:39.990> doesn't<00:01:40.380> splinter<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.890> next<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.090> go

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
it doesn't splinter up next we can go

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.429 
it doesn't splinter up next we can go
with<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> back<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.840> bow<00:01:42.990> now<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.229> back<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
with the back of the bow now the back is

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
with the back of the bow now the back is
what<00:01:43.770> does<00:01:43.950> most<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.430> work<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
what does most of the work and it's the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060 
what does most of the work and it's the
most<00:01:45.119> important<00:01:45.689> part<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> bow<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.829> has

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
most important part of the bow it has

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.190 
most important part of the bow it has
the<00:01:47.310> most<00:01:47.460> tension<00:01:48.450> under<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.020> that's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the most tension under and that's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.899 
the most tension under and that's
actually<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.619> tensile<00:01:50.220> strength<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.579> we

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
actually the tensile strength that we

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.450 
actually the tensile strength that we
need<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.329> correct<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> bow<00:01:52.560> finally

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
need to have correct on the bow finally

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.370 
need to have correct on the bow finally
we<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> handle<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.140> see<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
we have the handle and you can see a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.319 
we have the handle and you can see a
couple<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.710> lines<00:01:55.920> still<00:01:56.219> from<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.700> bow<00:01:56.909> this

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
couple of lines still from this bow this

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.389 
couple of lines still from this bow this
was<00:01:57.509> actually<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.960> Plains<00:01:58.259> Indian<00:01:58.829> bow<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.310> I

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
was actually a Plains Indian bow that I

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.069 
was actually a Plains Indian bow that I
made<00:01:59.579> this<00:02:00.329> won't<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.659> what<00:02:00.810> we're<00:02:00.960> making

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
made this won't be what we're making

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.969 
made this won't be what we're making
we're<00:02:01.290> making<00:02:01.469> American<00:02:01.860> longbow

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.320 

our<00:02:09.979> very<00:02:10.220> first<00:02:10.310> step<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.940> bow<00:02:11.030> making

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
our very first step in the bow making

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.940 
our very first step in the bow making
process<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:11.840> called<00:02:11.990> laying<00:02:12.350> out<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.770> bow

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
process is called laying out the bow

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.500 
process is called laying out the bow
laying<00:02:13.580> out<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.790> bow<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.030> actually<00:02:14.300> where<00:02:14.420> you

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
laying out the bow is actually where you

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.180 
laying out the bow is actually where you
draw<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.780> real<00:02:15.230> dimensions<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> bow<00:02:16.160> and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
draw the real dimensions of the bow and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.440 
draw the real dimensions of the bow and
you<00:02:16.490> kind<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.790> figure<00:02:17.030> out<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.180> mathematics

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
you kind of figure out the mathematics

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.210 
you kind of figure out the mathematics
of<00:02:17.990> how<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.290> going<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.500> look<00:02:18.620> I've<00:02:18.950> already

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
of how it's going to look I've already

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.440 
of how it's going to look I've already
made<00:02:19.370> some<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.760> lines<00:02:20.000> for<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.330> bow

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
made some of the lines for the bow

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.670 
made some of the lines for the bow
making<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.990> we're<00:02:21.080> going<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.260> start<00:02:21.440> with<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
making and we're going to start with the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.290 
making and we're going to start with the
centerline<00:02:22.130> now<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.459> is<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.730> line<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:22.940> is

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
centerline now this is the line that is

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.610 
centerline now this is the line that is
probably<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.690> most<00:02:23.810> important<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.470> whole

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
probably the most important in the whole

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.199 
probably the most important in the whole
bow<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.040> kind<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.250> gives<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.700> balance<00:02:25.910> and

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
bow it kind of gives you the balance and

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.430 
bow it kind of gives you the balance and
the<00:02:26.270> measurement<00:02:26.690> process<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.290> need

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
the measurement process that you need

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.070 
the measurement process that you need
this<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> 72<00:02:28.790> inch<00:02:28.819> long<00:02:29.180> stave<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
this is a 72 inch long stave in the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.930 
this is a 72 inch long stave in the
center<00:02:30.319> line<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.650> exactly<00:02:31.040> 36<00:02:31.400> inches<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
center line is exactly 36 inches in the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.729 
center line is exactly 36 inches in the
bow<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.300> it's<00:02:32.420> right<00:02:32.660> in<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.840> middle<00:02:32.989> from

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
bow so it's right in the middle from

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:34.990 
bow so it's right in the middle from
that<00:02:33.920> point<00:02:34.220> we're<00:02:34.430> going<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.580> move<00:02:34.730> two

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
that point we're going to move two

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000 
that point we're going to move two
inches<00:02:35.209> out<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.600> right<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.620> handle

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
inches out to the right for the handle

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.229 
inches out to the right for the handle
and<00:02:37.160> two<00:02:37.280> inches<00:02:37.489> out<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.850> left<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.150> we're

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
and two inches out to the left so we're

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.509 
and two inches out to the left so we're
gonna<00:02:38.330> have<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> four<00:02:38.810> inch<00:02:39.110> long<00:02:39.410> handle<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
gonna have a four inch long handle the

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.949 
gonna have a four inch long handle the
next<00:02:40.700> line<00:02:40.910> I'm<00:02:41.060> going<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.269> talk<00:02:41.390> about<00:02:41.420> is

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
next line I'm going to talk about is

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.750 
next line I'm going to talk about is
called<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.350> mid<00:02:42.530> limb<00:02:42.709> this<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.519> going<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.700> be

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
called the mid limb this is going to be

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.220 
called the mid limb this is going to be
very<00:02:43.880> important<00:02:44.300> in<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.450> tapering<00:02:44.780> process

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
very important in the tapering process

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.080 
very important in the tapering process
of<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.470> whole<00:02:45.590> bow<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.070> it's<00:02:46.160> exactly<00:02:46.430> 17

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
of the whole bow and it's exactly 17

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.210 
of the whole bow and it's exactly 17
inches<00:02:47.360> from<00:02:47.720> where<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.350> handle<00:02:48.650> ends<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.130> the

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
inches from where the handle ends to the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.729 
inches from where the handle ends to the
knocks<00:02:49.430> which<00:02:50.030> are<00:02:50.180> up<00:02:50.300> here<00:02:50.500> now<00:02:51.500> where<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
knocks which are up here now where the

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.080 
knocks which are up here now where the
taper<00:02:51.980> is<00:02:52.100> actually<00:02:52.430> going<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.610> begin<00:02:52.820> on<00:02:52.970> this

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
taper is actually going to begin on this

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.509 
taper is actually going to begin on this
bow<00:02:53.269> is<00:02:53.480> eight<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.290> half<00:02:54.320> inches<00:02:54.739> from<00:02:54.950> the

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
bow is eight and a half inches from the

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.729 
bow is eight and a half inches from the
Midland<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.239> we're<00:02:56.540> actually<00:02:56.660> dividing<00:02:57.290> the

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
Midland so we're actually dividing the

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.800 
Midland so we're actually dividing the
distance<00:02:58.070> from<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.310> Midland<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.570> end<00:02:59.720> of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
distance from the Midland to the end of

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.420 
distance from the Midland to the end of
the<00:02:59.870> handle<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.320> half<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.800> that's<00:03:01.280> where

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
the handle in half and that's where

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.699 
the handle in half and that's where
we're<00:03:01.519> going<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.670> start<00:03:01.850> our<00:03:02.030> side<00:03:02.269> taper<00:03:02.540> down

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
we're going to start our side taper down

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.880 
we're going to start our side taper down
to<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.800> points

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.840 

now<00:03:08.890> we're<00:03:09.070> actually<00:03:09.160> going<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.490> start

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
now we're actually going to start

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.610 
now we're actually going to start
removing<00:03:10.030> some<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.690> wood<00:03:10.840> now<00:03:11.410> what<00:03:11.500> we're

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
removing some of the wood now what we're

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.140 
removing some of the wood now what we're
going<00:03:11.710> to<00:03:11.770> do<00:03:11.920> with<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.160> Shira<00:03:12.370> form<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.820> we're

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
going to do with the Shira form is we're

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.640 
going to do with the Shira form is we're
actually<00:03:13.210> going<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.510> take<00:03:13.780> off<00:03:13.990> wood<00:03:14.320> on<00:03:14.530> the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
actually going to take off wood on the

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.140 
actually going to take off wood on the
side<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.190> we're<00:03:15.640> going<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.790> further<00:03:16.060> that

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
side and we're going to further that

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.330 
side and we're going to further that
process<00:03:16.690> by<00:03:16.960> actually<00:03:17.290> tilting<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.770> up<00:03:17.890> on<00:03:18.100> its

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
process by actually tilting it up on its

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.040 
process by actually tilting it up on its
corner<00:03:18.580> we're<00:03:19.210> going<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.390> do<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.900> both

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
corner we're going to do that on both

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.050 
corner we're going to do that on both
sides<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.590> make<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.740> pyramid<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.400> then<00:03:21.850> we<00:03:21.940> will

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
sides to make a pyramid and then we will

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.640 
sides to make a pyramid and then we will
take<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.360> pyramid<00:03:22.810> down<00:03:22.990> flatter<00:03:23.410> and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
take that pyramid down flatter and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.290 
take that pyramid down flatter and
you'll<00:03:23.830> do<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.190> process<00:03:24.430> all<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:25.030> way<00:03:25.060> down

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
you'll do this process all the way down

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.790 
you'll do this process all the way down
to<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.540> tips<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:25.960> you<00:03:26.020> can<00:03:26.050> see<00:03:26.320> as<00:03:26.560> we<00:03:26.710> get

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
to the tips and you can see as we get

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.900 
to the tips and you can see as we get
tapered<00:03:27.130> more<00:03:27.280> you're<00:03:27.400> going<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.580> be<00:03:27.670> doing<00:03:27.790> a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
tapered more you're going to be doing a

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.670 
tapered more you're going to be doing a
lot<00:03:28.060> more<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.270> it<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.570> farther<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.990> get<00:03:29.110> to

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
lot more of it the farther you get to

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:41.600 
lot more of it the farther you get to
the<00:03:29.800> end<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.130> bow

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.770 

now<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.730> we've<00:03:42.820> taken<00:03:42.910> wood<00:03:43.240> off<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
now that we've taken wood off of the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.030 
now that we've taken wood off of the
sides<00:03:44.020> of<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.320> bow<00:03:44.440> we're<00:03:44.650> going<00:03:44.770> to<00:03:44.830> start

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
sides of the bow we're going to start

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.680 
sides of the bow we're going to start
taking<00:03:45.310> wood<00:03:45.430> off<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.760> belly<00:03:45.970> on<00:03:46.120> each<00:03:46.420> limb

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
taking wood off the belly on each limb

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.090 
taking wood off the belly on each limb
and<00:03:46.930> what<00:03:47.110> I'm<00:03:47.200> shooting<00:03:47.380> for<00:03:47.530> on<00:03:47.770> each<00:03:47.890> limb

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
and what I'm shooting for on each limb

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.740 
and what I'm shooting for on each limb
is<00:03:48.250> just<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.490> little<00:03:48.700> bit<00:03:48.790> over<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.030> half<00:03:49.300> inch<00:03:49.510> in

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
is just a little bit over a half inch in

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.600 
is just a little bit over a half inch in
width<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.140> once<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:50.980> get<00:03:51.100> down<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.340> point

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
width and once I get down to that point

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.920 
width and once I get down to that point
I'm<00:03:51.670> gonna<00:03:51.760> start<00:03:51.850> taking<00:03:52.150> more<00:03:52.330> care<00:03:52.600> on<00:03:52.840> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
I'm gonna start taking more care on the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.180 
I'm gonna start taking more care on the
amount<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.200> wood<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.410> I<00:03:53.530> take<00:03:53.740> off<00:03:53.920> and

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
amount of wood that I take off and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.980 
amount of wood that I take off and
checking<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.700> bend<00:03:54.940> on<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.270> bow<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.660> that's

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
checking the bend on the bow and that's

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.330 
checking the bend on the bow and that's
when<00:03:56.170> we<00:03:56.260> begin<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.620> whole<00:03:56.830> process<00:03:57.070> of

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
when we begin the whole process of

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.680 
when we begin the whole process of
tailoring<00:03:57.640> we're<00:03:57.970> going<00:03:58.270> to<00:03:58.330> try<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.510> shoot

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
tailoring we're going to try to shoot

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.150 
tailoring we're going to try to shoot
for<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.870> pretty<00:03:59.050> equal<00:03:59.440> thickness<00:03:59.650> all<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.070> way

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
for a pretty equal thickness all the way

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:09.780 
for a pretty equal thickness all the way
through<00:04:07.710> on<00:04:08.710> both<00:04:09.220> limbs<00:04:09.430> we're<00:04:09.610> going<00:04:09.730> to

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
through on both limbs we're going to

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.940 
through on both limbs we're going to
shoot<00:04:09.940> for<00:04:10.000> kind<00:04:10.450> of<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.570> slow<00:04:10.870> slow<00:04:11.200> taper<00:04:11.620> down

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
shoot for kind of a slow slow taper down

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.280 
shoot for kind of a slow slow taper down
to<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.490> tip<00:04:12.700> it's<00:04:13.390> going<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.570> be<00:04:13.630> pretty<00:04:13.870> equal

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
to the tip it's going to be pretty equal

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.600 
to the tip it's going to be pretty equal
all<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.620> way<00:04:14.770> but<00:04:15.070> we're<00:04:15.190> actually<00:04:15.310> going<00:04:15.520> to

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
all the way but we're actually going to

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.850 
all the way but we're actually going to
take<00:04:15.730> off<00:04:15.940> more<00:04:16.180> wood<00:04:16.450> down<00:04:17.050> by<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.440> tip<00:04:17.710> so

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
take off more wood down by the tip so

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.410 
take off more wood down by the tip so
it's<00:04:17.980> just<00:04:18.070> going<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.400> slightly<00:04:18.700> curve<00:04:19.120> down

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
it's just going to slightly curve down

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:26.590 
it's just going to slightly curve down
all<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.960> way

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.640 

next<00:04:27.600> we're<00:04:27.690> going<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.050> floor<00:04:28.229> tailoring

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
next we're going to the floor tailoring

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.050 
next we're going to the floor tailoring
stage<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.460> see<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.669> authority

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
stage and you can see the authority

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.370 
stage and you can see the authority
taken<00:04:30.330> off<00:04:30.419> quite<00:04:30.449> a<00:04:30.720> bit<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:30.960> wood<00:04:31.139> on<00:04:31.290> the

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
taken off quite a bit of wood on the

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.930 
taken off quite a bit of wood on the
belly<00:04:31.590> we're<00:04:32.130> going<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.310> go<00:04:32.400> into<00:04:32.699> what's

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
belly we're going to go into what's

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.580 
belly we're going to go into what's
called<00:04:33.030> floor<00:04:33.690> tailoring<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.259> it's<00:04:34.440> not

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
called floor tailoring and it's not

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.560 
called floor tailoring and it's not
extremely<00:04:34.979> technical<00:04:35.310> but<00:04:36.180> what<00:04:36.300> we're<00:04:36.419> doing

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
extremely technical but what we're doing

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.090 
extremely technical but what we're doing
is<00:04:36.660> just<00:04:36.780> kind<00:04:36.900> of<00:04:36.990> testing<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.470> initial<00:04:37.830> Bend

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
is just kind of testing the initial Bend

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.590 
is just kind of testing the initial Bend
of<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.340> bow<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:38.850> now<00:04:39.150> we're<00:04:39.270> going<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.419> do

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
of the bow and now we're going to do

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.820 
of the bow and now we're going to do
that<00:04:39.750> is<00:04:39.990> you're<00:04:40.199> just<00:04:40.320> going<00:04:40.440> to<00:04:40.470> put<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.710> on

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
that is you're just going to put it on

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.290 
that is you're just going to put it on
the<00:04:40.919> ground<00:04:41.100> right<00:04:41.520> next<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:41.789> your<00:04:41.910> foot<00:04:42.150> on

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
the ground right next to your foot on

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.120 
the ground right next to your foot on
each<00:04:42.570> limb<00:04:42.810> just<00:04:43.289> going<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.530> press<00:04:43.740> around<00:04:43.979> a

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
each limb just going to press around a

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.379 
each limb just going to press around a
little<00:04:44.220> bit<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.490> kind<00:04:44.639> of<00:04:44.669> get<00:04:44.789> a<00:04:44.820> feel<00:04:45.180> for

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
little bit and kind of get a feel for

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.540 
little bit and kind of get a feel for
where<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.259> bow<00:04:46.410> is<00:04:46.590> bending<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.039> most<00:04:47.250> and

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
where the bow is bending the most and

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.090 
where the bow is bending the most and
just<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:48.210> strength<00:04:48.479> overall<00:04:49.080> do<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:49.830> couple

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
just the strength overall do this couple

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.950 
just the strength overall do this couple
times<00:04:50.250> on<00:04:50.400> each<00:04:50.580> limb<00:04:50.850> just<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.750> get<00:04:51.870> an

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
times on each limb just to get an

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.650 
times on each limb just to get an
initial<00:04:52.169> feel<00:04:52.880> and<00:04:53.880> see<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.180> can<00:04:54.240> already<00:04:54.479> tell

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
initial feel and see I can already tell

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.120 
initial feel and see I can already tell
that<00:04:54.720> this<00:04:54.960> limb<00:04:55.199> here<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.590> a<00:04:55.650> little<00:04:55.860> bit<00:04:55.949> more

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
that this limb here is a little bit more

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.260 
that this limb here is a little bit more
bhindi<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.699> I'm<00:04:56.759> going<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:56.940> go<00:04:57.030> ahead<00:04:57.120> and

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
bhindi and I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.689 
bhindi and I'm going to go ahead and
designate<00:04:57.690> this<00:04:57.900> limb<00:04:58.169> as<00:04:58.320> my<00:04:59.070> top<00:04:59.310> limb<00:04:59.550> you

designate this limb as my top limb you

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.670 
designate this limb as my top limb you
want<00:04:59.850> your<00:05:00.000> bottom<00:05:00.240> limb<00:05:00.389> to<00:05:00.539> be<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:01.380> also<00:05:01.530> you

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
want your bottom limb to be and also you

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.960 
want your bottom limb to be and also you
want<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:01.860> be<00:05:01.919> um<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.190> know<00:05:02.340> you<00:05:02.490> want<00:05:02.760> them<00:05:02.850> to

want to be um you know you want them to

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.400 
want to be um you know you want them to
be<00:05:03.090> fairly<00:05:03.419> equal<00:05:03.780> but<00:05:03.960> if<00:05:04.139> you're<00:05:04.229> going<00:05:04.350> to

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
be fairly equal but if you're going to

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.480 
be fairly equal but if you're going to
have<00:05:04.500> one<00:05:04.620> that's<00:05:04.740> just<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:05.070> little<00:05:05.280> bit

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
have one that's just a little bit

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.920 
have one that's just a little bit
stiffer<00:05:05.760> it's<00:05:06.000> going<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.180> be<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:06.360> bottom<00:05:06.539> and

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
stiffer it's going to be the bottom and

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.210 
stiffer it's going to be the bottom and
since<00:05:07.139> it's<00:05:07.260> already<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:07.620> that<00:05:07.770> position<00:05:08.100> I'm

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
since it's already in that position I'm

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.379 
since it's already in that position I'm
going<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.400> go<00:05:08.490> ahead<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.729> designate<00:05:09.060> this<00:05:09.240> one

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
going to go ahead and designate this one

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.740 
going to go ahead and designate this one
right<00:05:09.539> here<00:05:09.720> is<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.960> bottom<00:05:11.570> now<00:05:12.570> we're<00:05:12.660> going

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
right here is the bottom now we're going

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.540 
right here is the bottom now we're going
to<00:05:12.840> move<00:05:12.930> on<00:05:13.050> into<00:05:13.289> the<00:05:13.440> Knox<00:05:13.710> segment<00:05:14.430> what

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
to move on into the Knox segment what

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.300 
to move on into the Knox segment what
I've<00:05:14.639> done<00:05:14.880> is<00:05:15.150> drawn<00:05:15.630> a<00:05:15.660> line<00:05:16.380> about<00:05:16.680> 3/4<00:05:17.250> of

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
I've done is drawn a line about 3/4 of

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.659 
I've done is drawn a line about 3/4 of
an<00:05:17.430> inch<00:05:17.550> down<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.599> tip<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.590> next<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.340> actually

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
an inch down the tip and next I actually

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.939 
an inch down the tip and next I actually
made<00:05:21.090> a<00:05:21.120> line<00:05:21.330> about<00:05:21.539> a<00:05:21.599> half<00:05:21.870> inch<00:05:22.050> down<00:05:22.349> and<00:05:22.590> I

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
made a line about a half inch down and I

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.860 
made a line about a half inch down and I
drew<00:05:23.130> a<00:05:23.160> cross<00:05:23.430> on<00:05:23.699> the<00:05:23.759> belly<00:05:23.940> now<00:05:24.630> I<00:05:24.660> do<00:05:24.780> the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
drew a cross on the belly now I do the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.390 
drew a cross on the belly now I do the
same<00:05:24.900> thing<00:05:25.080> on<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.380> back<00:05:25.560> except<00:05:26.250> for<00:05:26.370> I

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
same thing on the back except for I

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.249 
same thing on the back except for I
moved<00:05:26.580> everything<00:05:27.000> up<00:05:27.210> about<00:05:27.449> a<00:05:27.750> quarter<00:05:28.229> of

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
moved everything up about a quarter of

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.800 
moved everything up about a quarter of
an<00:05:28.410> inch<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:28.800> from<00:05:29.669> those<00:05:29.849> lines<00:05:30.150> on<00:05:30.419> the<00:05:30.599> side

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
an inch and from those lines on the side

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.900 
an inch and from those lines on the side
here<00:05:31.139> I<00:05:31.320> drew<00:05:32.010> the<00:05:32.190> difference<00:05:32.520> down<00:05:32.699> and

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
here I drew the difference down and

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.219 
here I drew the difference down and
that's<00:05:33.030> where<00:05:33.240> your<00:05:33.360> file<00:05:33.599> is<00:05:33.810> actually<00:05:34.139> going

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
that's where your file is actually going

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.779 
that's where your file is actually going
to<00:05:34.320> take<00:05:34.410> places<00:05:34.830> right<00:05:35.039> in<00:05:35.099> that<00:05:35.340> area<00:05:35.610> now

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
to take places right in that area now

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.250 
to take places right in that area now
we're<00:05:35.970> not<00:05:36.030> going<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.210> go<00:05:36.330> extremely<00:05:36.780> deep<00:05:37.080> in

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
we're not going to go extremely deep in

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.450 
we're not going to go extremely deep in
here<00:05:37.440> but<00:05:37.650> we're<00:05:37.800> probably<00:05:37.889> to<00:05:38.130> go<00:05:38.220> about<00:05:38.400> a

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
here but we're probably to go about a

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.659 
here but we're probably to go about a
quarter<00:05:38.760> of<00:05:39.000> an<00:05:39.090> inch<00:05:39.240> into<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:39.960> wood<00:05:40.199> and

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
quarter of an inch into the wood and

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.070 
quarter of an inch into the wood and
when<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:41.760> get<00:05:41.880> down<00:05:42.030> closer<00:05:42.419> to<00:05:42.659> that<00:05:42.780> quarter

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
when you get down closer to that quarter

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.300 
when you get down closer to that quarter
inch<00:05:43.139> you're<00:05:43.440> actually<00:05:43.650> going<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:43.830> tail<00:05:44.039> in

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
inch you're actually going to tail in

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.920 
inch you're actually going to tail in
the<00:05:44.580> file<00:05:44.849> here<00:05:45.180> because<00:05:45.599> you<00:05:45.690> want<00:05:45.870> the

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
the file here because you want the

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.899 
the file here because you want the
string<00:05:46.139> to<00:05:46.169> come<00:05:46.500> down<00:05:46.830> as<00:05:47.130> it's<00:05:47.490> being<00:05:47.639> pulled

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
string to come down as it's being pulled

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.909 
string to come down as it's being pulled
so<00:05:48.510> we're<00:05:48.690> actually<00:05:48.810> going<00:05:49.020> to<00:05:49.080> tilt<00:05:49.620> in<00:05:49.740> each

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
so we're actually going to tilt in each

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.029 
so we're actually going to tilt in each
knock<00:05:50.220> towards<00:05:50.789> the<00:05:50.909> belly<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.740> then<00:05:52.740> remove

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
knock towards the belly and then remove

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.350 
knock towards the belly and then remove
wood<00:05:53.190> you<00:05:53.340> just<00:05:53.460> keep<00:05:53.580> doing<00:05:53.729> that<00:05:53.849> pyramid

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
wood you just keep doing that pyramid

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.670 
wood you just keep doing that pyramid
and<00:05:54.800> angle<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:56.010> then<00:05:56.159> flap<00:05:56.400> and<00:05:57.409> never<00:05:58.409> use

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
and angle and then flap and never use

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.439 
and angle and then flap and never use
the<00:05:58.830> rasp<00:05:59.010> to<00:05:59.580> actually<00:05:59.880> smooth<00:06:00.150> out<00:06:00.330> and

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
the rasp to actually smooth out and

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.390 
the rasp to actually smooth out and
round<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:01.139> very<00:06:01.349> tips<00:06:01.680> of<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:01.979> wood<00:06:02.159> down

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
round the very tips of the wood down

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.399 
round the very tips of the wood down
here<00:06:02.639> just<00:06:03.419> going<00:06:03.599> to<00:06:03.690> take<00:06:03.780> both<00:06:04.020> index

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
here just going to take both index

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.210 
here just going to take both index
fingers<00:06:04.940> get<00:06:05.940> a<00:06:05.970> small<00:06:06.389> angle<00:06:06.780> on<00:06:06.930> it<00:06:07.220> using

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
fingers get a small angle on it using

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.010 
fingers get a small angle on it using
the<00:06:08.430> flat<00:06:08.639> side<00:06:08.880> of<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.000> rasp

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.700 

next<00:06:15.020> we're<00:06:15.110> going<00:06:15.199> to<00:06:15.289> go<00:06:15.349> into<00:06:15.530> what's

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
next we're going to go into what's

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.110 
next we're going to go into what's
called<00:06:15.800> the<00:06:16.039> loose<00:06:16.250> steering<00:06:16.490> tiller<00:06:16.819> phase

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
called the loose steering tiller phase

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.480 
called the loose steering tiller phase
of<00:06:17.479> the<00:06:17.599> bow<00:06:17.720> making<00:06:17.930> process<00:06:18.440> got<00:06:18.949> the<00:06:19.099> bow<00:06:19.280> on

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
of the bow making process got the bow on

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.339 
of the bow making process got the bow on
here<00:06:19.699> it's<00:06:19.819> not<00:06:19.940> actually<00:06:20.240> clamped<00:06:20.569> on<00:06:20.690> but

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
here it's not actually clamped on but

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:22.930 
here it's not actually clamped on but
it's<00:06:21.470> on<00:06:21.560> here<00:06:21.710> pretty<00:06:21.860> secure<00:06:22.280> we've<00:06:22.789> got<00:06:22.909> a

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
it's on here pretty secure we've got a

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.230 
it's on here pretty secure we've got a
hook<00:06:23.150> and<00:06:23.330> a<00:06:23.389> pole<00:06:24.250> loosely<00:06:25.250> somewhere<00:06:26.150> in

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
hook and a pole loosely somewhere in

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.159 
hook and a pole loosely somewhere in
between<00:06:26.330> the<00:06:26.569> 14<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.139> the<00:06:27.229> 18<00:06:27.560> inch<00:06:27.710> mark<00:06:29.169> you

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
between the 14 and the 18 inch mark you

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.600 
between the 14 and the 18 inch mark you
can<00:06:30.289> see<00:06:30.409> right<00:06:30.590> here<00:06:30.650> the<00:06:30.919> left<00:06:31.069> limb<00:06:31.400> is

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
can see right here the left limb is

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.950 
can see right here the left limb is
bending<00:06:31.909> more<00:06:32.060> than<00:06:32.210> the<00:06:32.300> right<00:06:32.419> limb<00:06:32.659> so<00:06:32.900> I'm

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
bending more than the right limb so I'm

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.270 
bending more than the right limb so I'm
going<00:06:33.080> to<00:06:33.110> go<00:06:33.229> ahead<00:06:33.409> and<00:06:33.590> make<00:06:33.680> a<00:06:33.710> pencil<00:06:34.129> mark

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
going to go ahead and make a pencil mark

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.930 
going to go ahead and make a pencil mark
on<00:06:34.520> the<00:06:35.740> right<00:06:36.740> limb<00:06:38.889> and<00:06:39.889> with<00:06:40.610> that<00:06:40.759> pencil

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
on the right limb and with that pencil

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.309 
on the right limb and with that pencil
mark<00:06:41.210> what<00:06:41.330> that<00:06:41.449> means<00:06:41.629> is<00:06:41.780> I<00:06:41.870> need<00:06:41.900> to<00:06:42.050> remove

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
mark what that means is I need to remove

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.360 
mark what that means is I need to remove
wood<00:06:42.680> off<00:06:42.860> the<00:06:42.979> entire<00:06:43.280> limb<00:06:45.130> so<00:06:46.130> I've<00:06:46.250> gone

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
wood off the entire limb so I've gone

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.439 
wood off the entire limb so I've gone
ahead<00:06:46.430> and<00:06:46.580> removed<00:06:46.729> some<00:06:47.030> of<00:06:47.120> the<00:06:47.210> wood<00:06:47.330> off

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:47.449 
ahead and removed some of the wood off

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.820 
ahead and removed some of the wood off
the<00:06:47.569> right<00:06:47.750> limb<00:06:47.930> like<00:06:48.110> we<00:06:48.259> talked<00:06:48.500> about<00:06:48.620> I'm

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
the right limb like we talked about I'm

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.379 
the right limb like we talked about I'm
going<00:06:48.979> to<00:06:49.069> go<00:06:49.159> ahead<00:06:49.220> and<00:06:49.370> check<00:06:49.610> the<00:06:50.000> Taylor

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
going to go ahead and check the Taylor

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:51.820 
going to go ahead and check the Taylor
on<00:06:50.630> both<00:06:50.870> limbs<00:06:51.139> I'm<00:06:51.349> going<00:06:51.500> to<00:06:51.560> pull<00:06:51.650> back<00:06:51.680> to

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
on both limbs I'm going to pull back to

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.640 
on both limbs I'm going to pull back to
about<00:06:52.130> 23<00:06:52.669> 24<00:06:53.120> inches<00:06:53.479> well<00:06:54.289> it<00:06:54.440> looks<00:06:54.590> like

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
about 23 24 inches well it looks like

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.080 
about 23 24 inches well it looks like
the<00:06:54.919> left<00:06:55.069> limb<00:06:55.340> is<00:06:55.490> just<00:06:55.639> a<00:06:55.699> little<00:06:56.000> bit

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
the left limb is just a little bit

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.490 
the left limb is just a little bit
stiffer<00:06:56.419> than<00:06:56.630> the<00:06:56.690> right<00:06:56.900> limb<00:06:57.139> there's<00:06:57.409> a

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
stiffer than the right limb there's a

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.080 
stiffer than the right limb there's a
small<00:06:58.009> weak<00:06:58.220> point<00:06:58.460> over<00:06:58.699> there<00:06:58.819> so<00:06:59.000> we're

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
small weak point over there so we're

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.159 
small weak point over there so we're
going<00:06:59.180> to<00:06:59.240> take<00:06:59.360> a<00:06:59.419> little<00:06:59.569> bit<00:06:59.750> of<00:06:59.810> wood<00:06:59.990> off

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169 
going to take a little bit of wood off

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.170 
going to take a little bit of wood off
the<00:07:00.680> left<00:07:00.889> limb<00:07:01.099> and<00:07:01.340> when<00:07:01.789> we<00:07:01.880> do<00:07:01.970> that<00:07:02.060> we're

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
the left limb and when we do that we're

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.249 
the left limb and when we do that we're
going<00:07:02.270> to<00:07:02.330> be<00:07:02.419> ready<00:07:02.690> to<00:07:02.810> go<00:07:02.900> ahead<00:07:02.960> and<00:07:03.139> shoot

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.259 
going to be ready to go ahead and shoot

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.920 
going to be ready to go ahead and shoot

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
it all together the boat took about six

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.689 
it all together the boat took about six
hours<00:07:06.259> to<00:07:06.440> make<00:07:06.469> we're<00:07:07.310> going<00:07:07.340> to<00:07:07.460> put<00:07:07.610> the

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:07.699 
hours to make we're going to put the

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:09.129 
hours to make we're going to put the
finish<00:07:07.969> on<00:07:08.150> and<00:07:08.389> that's<00:07:08.780> going<00:07:08.930> to<00:07:08.990> conclude
