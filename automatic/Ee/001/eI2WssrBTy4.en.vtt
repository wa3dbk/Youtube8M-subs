00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
is going to work page 0 so this is what

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.490 
is going to work page 0 so this is what
the<00:02:27.599> first<00:02:27.810> page<00:02:28.019> is<00:02:28.170> going<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.440> look<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:32.450> and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
the first page is going to look like and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.940 
the first page is going to look like and
the<00:02:34.500> second<00:02:34.920> page<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:36.599> look<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:36.959> this<00:02:37.200> third

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
the second page and look like this third

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.220 
the second page and look like this third
page<00:02:38.330> fourth<00:02:39.330> page<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:41.690> guess<00:02:42.690> that's<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.019> fourth

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.789 
page fourth page I guess that's a fourth
page<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.930> now<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.769> the
