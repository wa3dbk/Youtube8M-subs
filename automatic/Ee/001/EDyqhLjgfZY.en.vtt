 to the act from there are if it makes you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.109
 represent sinni for speed and rum 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.290
 now a top career desafÃ­o way 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.860
 of the flight or if you too 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:20.220
 but pulls to 176 of valles is a time 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:22.880
 given this this meat hopes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.700
 teaching hides beating with 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.270
 this for gender mobility 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.550
 wait until it deals with the 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.969
 true esteem for those who should 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:40.510
 that is, my question in this is a little 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.510
 real because black and we were 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.539
 le figaro 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.539
 my team has changed 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.920
 a people 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.210
 cannot see in the left painting 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.800
 in conclusion 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.340
 he is not at risk 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.610
 The tuning in churches 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.750
 I just need to start doing it 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.640
 be silent 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.080
 a little inspiration 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.080
 perhaps it was a good part of them 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.180
 a little talk about bar in san marino 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.260
 there is not 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.530
 we discover Jewish state 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.530
 we know nothing 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.340
 from menezes such a way left 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.430
 and there is also a levada speed 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.950
 however ceder 31 second then that the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.060
 the aberrant flavor phrase is like that 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.790
 done 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.140
 want 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.140
 a company not only in the summer 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.950

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.090
 the shit 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
 beautiful 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.860
 simone is disparate with him 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.130
 that goes perhaps saying in the way of history 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.430
 how much you never have to win 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.430

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.620

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.959
 heaven to tell 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.959
 money that they favor 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.220
 who knows the garzanti and do you command the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.220

 that of the marsi 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.350
 also heard 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.520
 I 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.520
 when read simple to do 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.200
 will still deliver with the suspect 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.200
 Yes, OK 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:14.050

 the experience years never really hurts 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.740

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.460
 a little graphic announcement the 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.460
 inapplicability 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.600
 however, the realist years are not fictitious 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.430
 but we are there more than ever 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.860
 show libraries 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.300
