00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
so some people have said in my previous

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.870 
so some people have said in my previous
video<00:00:06.649> comparing<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.740> macbook<00:00:08.130> air<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.670> the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
video comparing the macbook air to the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.680 
video comparing the macbook air to the
64gb<00:00:09.510> ipad<00:00:10.460> that<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:13.610> ipad<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.210> lot<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.389> ways

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
64gb ipad that the ipad in a lot of ways

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.140 
64gb ipad that the ipad in a lot of ways
was<00:00:16.139> more<00:00:16.350> versatile<00:00:16.890> more<00:00:17.730> flexible<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:20.150> i

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
was more versatile more flexible and i

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.700 
was more versatile more flexible and i
also<00:00:21.330> went<00:00:21.600> ahead<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.900> pulled<00:00:22.080> up<00:00:22.170> an<00:00:22.320> article

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
also went ahead and pulled up an article

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.769 
also went ahead and pulled up an article
just<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.039> usual<00:00:23.400> question<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> when<00:00:24.150> tablets

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
just the usual question of when tablets

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.920 
just the usual question of when tablets
would<00:00:24.960> replace<00:00:25.320> laptops<00:00:25.949> or<00:00:26.130> if<00:00:26.599> now<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> lot<00:00:27.900> of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
would replace laptops or if now a lot of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
would replace laptops or if now a lot of
you<00:00:28.260> are<00:00:28.529> thinking<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> ipad<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you are thinking that the ipad is a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.359 
you are thinking that the ipad is a
media<00:00:30.480> consumption<00:00:30.960> device<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.189> is

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
media consumption device and this is

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430 
media consumption device and this is
true<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:33.540> let's<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:33.809> say<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.079> sake<00:00:34.380> of

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
true but let's just say for sake of

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.639 
true but let's just say for sake of
argument<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:36.020> tablets<00:00:37.020> eventually

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
argument that that tablets eventually

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.119 
argument that that tablets eventually
would<00:00:37.860> replace<00:00:38.399> laptops<00:00:39.469> in<00:00:40.469> regards<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
would replace laptops in regards to the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.400 
would replace laptops in regards to the
ipad<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:42.329> would<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
ipad what would I like to see in the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.290 
ipad what would I like to see in the
next<00:00:43.530> version<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.340> would<00:00:44.579> essentially<00:00:45.000> help

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
next version that would essentially help

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.500 
next version that would essentially help
it<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.480> replace<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> laptop<00:00:46.050> now<00:00:47.180> all<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.390> these

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
it to replace a laptop now all of these

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.680 
it to replace a laptop now all of these
are<00:00:48.870> software<00:00:49.289> related<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:51.360> order<00:00:51.510> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
are software related because in order to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.770 
are software related because in order to

get the only hardware feature I want I

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.880 
get the only hardware feature I want I
would<00:00:54.780> essentially<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.469> able<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
would essentially be able to get it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.040 
would essentially be able to get it
through<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.250> through<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> dongle<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.899> would

through it through a dongle that would

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.020

native file system and the reason is
because<00:01:23.850> um<00:01:25.640> right<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.090> none

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
because um right now there is none

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.780 
because um right now there is none
there's<00:01:28.140> some<00:01:28.650> bit<00:01:29.310> there<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.640> some

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
there's some bit there are some

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.149 
there's some bit there are some
productivity<00:01:30.210> apps<00:01:30.680> but<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> lot<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> them

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
productivity apps but a lot of them

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.440 
productivity apps but a lot of them
require<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:34.670> utilize<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> cloud<00:01:36.090> service

these that's what happened to a friend
of<00:02:17.130> mine<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> other<00:02:17.490> day<00:02:17.580> um<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:20.060> what<00:02:21.060> will

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
of mine the other day um and what will

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.910 
of mine the other day um and what will
be<00:02:21.210> nice<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.810> instead<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.230> doing<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.590> now

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
be nice is instead of doing that now

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.950 
be nice is instead of doing that now
this<00:02:23.100> would<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.880> an<00:02:24.060> iPad<00:02:24.420> exclusive

the YouTube video that I did with

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.230 
the YouTube video that I did with
facetime<00:04:29.010> it'll<00:04:29.640> be<00:04:29.700> an<00:04:29.790> option<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:30.150> could

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
facetime it'll be an option you could

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.960 
facetime it'll be an option you could
turn<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.510> on<00:04:30.570> or<00:04:30.720> off<00:04:30.860> but<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.640> have<00:04:32.910> it

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
turn it on or off but to have it

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.770 
turn it on or off but to have it
minimized<00:04:33.570> say<00:04:34.380> in<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.620> corner<00:04:35.070> or<00:04:35.250> being

migrated to the app switcher but have

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.910

the<00:04:38.880> video<00:04:39.060> still<00:04:39.540> in<00:04:39.810> operation<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:42.860> I<00:04:43.860> think

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
the video still in operation and I think

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.130 
the video still in operation and I think
that<00:04:44.160> if<00:04:44.340> we<00:04:44.430> were<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.670> get<00:04:44.850> those<00:04:45.180> things<00:04:45.600> um

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
that if we were to get those things um

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.530 
that if we were to get those things um
that<00:04:49.140> I<00:04:49.410> think<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.580> ipad<00:04:50.700> could<00:04:51.330> in

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
that I think that the ipad could in

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.580 
that I think that the ipad could in
could<00:04:52.110> pretty<00:04:52.710> much<00:04:52.800> replace<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:53.550> laptop<00:04:53.880> and

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
could pretty much replace a laptop and

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.650 
could pretty much replace a laptop and
again<00:04:55.590> let's<00:04:55.800> go<00:04:55.950> over<00:04:56.220> those<00:04:56.570> really<00:04:57.570> the

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
again let's go over those really the

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.970 
again let's go over those really the
only<00:04:57.750> hardware<00:04:58.230> feature<00:04:58.410> like<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:58.620> said<00:04:58.860> would

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
only hardware feature like I said would

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.070 
only hardware feature like I said would
be<00:04:59.070> a<00:04:59.100> 30<00:04:59.520> pin<00:04:59.790> to<00:04:59.910> USB<00:05:00.000> dongle<00:05:00.450> for<00:05:00.750> things

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
be a 30 pin to USB dongle for things

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.750 
be a 30 pin to USB dongle for things
like<00:05:01.170> card<00:05:01.590> readers<00:05:01.920> and<00:05:02.100> thumb<00:05:02.310> drives<00:05:02.580> and

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
like card readers and thumb drives and

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.390 
like card readers and thumb drives and
whatnot<00:05:03.410> which<00:05:04.410> would<00:05:04.590> lead<00:05:04.770> into<00:05:04.980> the

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
whatnot which would lead into the

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.550 
whatnot which would lead into the
software<00:05:06.270> features<00:05:06.720> beginning<00:05:07.140> with<00:05:07.350> a

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
software features beginning with a

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.710 
software features beginning with a
native<00:05:07.830> file<00:05:08.370> system<00:05:08.880> with<00:05:09.480> drag-and-drop

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
native file system with drag-and-drop

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:18.740 
native file system with drag-and-drop
capabilities<00:05:10.710> um<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:15.860> YouTube<00:05:17.750> video

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
capabilities um the YouTube video

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.360 
capabilities um the YouTube video
miniaturization<00:05:19.500> while<00:05:19.950> you're<00:05:20.250> doing

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
miniaturization while you're doing

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:27.440 
miniaturization while you're doing
something<00:05:20.820> else<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.270> also<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:25.220> and<00:05:26.300> also<00:05:27.300> the

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
something else and also the and also the

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.840 
something else and also the and also the
facetime<00:05:28.310> miniaturization<00:05:29.310> while<00:05:29.580> you<00:05:29.670> doing

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
facetime miniaturization while you doing

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.740 
facetime miniaturization while you doing
something<00:05:30.090> else<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.300> again<00:05:30.540> these<00:05:30.690> are

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
something else and again these are

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.690 
something else and again these are
primarily<00:05:31.260> software<00:05:31.770> features<00:05:32.130> my<00:05:32.310> ideas

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
primarily software features my ideas

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.770 
primarily software features my ideas
that<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:32.970> would<00:05:33.090> have<00:05:33.240> an<00:05:33.390> on<00:05:33.510> and<00:05:33.660> off<00:05:33.720> switch

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
that you would have an on and off switch

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.480 
that you would have an on and off switch
so<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.230> if<00:05:34.440> you<00:05:34.530> wanted<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.890> activate<00:05:35.310> them

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
so that if you wanted to activate them

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.100 
so that if you wanted to activate them
you<00:05:35.610> could<00:05:38.060> but<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.270> processor<00:05:39.780> i<00:05:39.810> think<00:05:40.050> is

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
you could but the processor i think is

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.659 
you could but the processor i think is
more<00:05:40.290> than<00:05:40.440> capable<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.980> handling<00:05:41.070> this<00:05:43.669> it's

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
more than capable of handling this it's

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:45.980 
more than capable of handling this it's
just<00:05:44.910> a<00:05:44.970> matter<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.240> building<00:05:45.480> it<00:05:45.660> into<00:05:45.840> the

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
just a matter of building it into the

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.780 
just a matter of building it into the
software<00:05:46.470> oh<00:05:48.560> and<00:05:49.560> ichat<00:05:49.980> i<00:05:50.010> forgot<00:05:50.400> and<00:05:50.580> um

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
software oh and ichat i forgot and um

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.930 
software oh and ichat i forgot and um
yes<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:51.450> i<00:05:51.510> chat<00:05:51.810> with<00:05:52.310> their<00:05:53.310> screen<00:05:53.700> sharing

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
yes and i chat with their screen sharing

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.340 
yes and i chat with their screen sharing
feature<00:05:54.210> just<00:05:54.390> basically<00:05:54.780> a<00:05:54.900> native<00:05:55.169> version

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
feature just basically a native version

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.500 
feature just basically a native version
of<00:05:55.560> ichat<00:05:55.890> from<00:05:56.130> apple<00:05:56.460> for<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.640> ipad<00:05:57.090> i<00:05:57.120> think

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
of ichat from apple for the ipad i think

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.790 
of ichat from apple for the ipad i think
that<00:05:57.660> would<00:05:57.750> be<00:05:57.870> really<00:05:57.900> really<00:05:58.169> nice<00:05:58.440> if<00:05:58.680> they

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
that would be really really nice if they

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.670 
that would be really really nice if they
went<00:05:58.950> ahead<00:05:59.040> and<00:05:59.220> put<00:05:59.370> that<00:05:59.400> in<00:05:59.930> so<00:06:00.930> what<00:06:01.620> do

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
went ahead and put that in so what do

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.270 
went ahead and put that in so what do
you<00:06:01.770> guys<00:06:01.950> think<00:06:02.010> and<00:06:03.050> yes<00:06:04.050> again<00:06:04.290> let's<00:06:04.830> recap

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
you guys think and yes again let's recap

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.159 
you guys think and yes again let's recap
I<00:06:05.490> know<00:06:05.550> that<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.000> ipad<00:06:06.150> is<00:06:06.600> primarily<00:06:07.020> a

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
I know that the ipad is primarily a

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.020 
I know that the ipad is primarily a
media<00:06:07.650> consumption<00:06:08.070> device<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:08.640> that<00:06:08.669> Apple

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
media consumption device and that Apple

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.260 
media consumption device and that Apple
has<00:06:09.060> positioned<00:06:09.630> it<00:06:09.750> as<00:06:09.900> such<00:06:10.669> but<00:06:11.669> given

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
has positioned it as such but given

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.140 
has positioned it as such but given
consumer<00:06:12.720> demand<00:06:13.080> um<00:06:13.669> well<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:14.760> mac<00:06:14.940> sales

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
consumer demand um well the mac sales

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.590 
consumer demand um well the mac sales
have<00:06:15.419> wrote<00:06:15.660> the<00:06:16.020> mac<00:06:16.260> sales<00:06:16.770> have<00:06:17.100> risen<00:06:17.600> pc

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
have wrote the mac sales have risen pc

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.380 
have wrote the mac sales have risen pc
failed<00:06:18.930> sales<00:06:19.470> have<00:06:19.710> fallen<00:06:19.770> in<00:06:20.460> favor<00:06:21.270> of

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
failed sales have fallen in favor of

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.060 
failed sales have fallen in favor of
tablet<00:06:21.930> sales<00:06:23.030> that's<00:06:24.030> interesting<00:06:25.070> anyway

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
tablet sales that's interesting anyway

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.260 
tablet sales that's interesting anyway
the<00:06:26.190> market<00:06:26.490> will<00:06:26.580> dictate<00:06:26.790> where<00:06:27.120> we're

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
the market will dictate where we're

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.690 
the market will dictate where we're
going<00:06:27.570> but<00:06:27.600> let's<00:06:27.930> just<00:06:28.020> save<00:06:28.350> in<00:06:28.680> theory<00:06:29.460> and

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
going but let's just save in theory and

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.490 
going but let's just save in theory and
just<00:06:30.480> for<00:06:30.630> sake<00:06:30.780> of<00:06:30.810> argument<00:06:30.960> that<00:06:31.320> the

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
just for sake of argument that the

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.040 
just for sake of argument that the
tablet<00:06:31.890> was<00:06:31.940> going<00:06:32.940> to<00:06:33.000> replace<00:06:33.330> a<00:06:33.630> laptop

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
tablet was going to replace a laptop

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.500 
tablet was going to replace a laptop
that's<00:06:34.950> basically<00:06:35.430> what<00:06:35.610> I<00:06:35.640> think<00:06:36.030> would<00:06:36.180> need

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
that's basically what I think would need

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.330 
that's basically what I think would need
to<00:06:36.690> happen<00:06:36.900> in<00:06:37.380> order<00:06:37.470> to<00:06:37.680> make<00:06:37.890> that<00:06:38.070> happen

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
to happen in order to make that happen

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.640 
to happen in order to make that happen
what<00:06:39.000> you<00:06:39.060> guys<00:06:39.240> think<00:06:39.479> thank<00:06:40.410> you<00:06:40.500> for

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
what you guys think thank you for

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.570 
what you guys think thank you for
watching<00:06:40.800> comments<00:06:41.310> or<00:06:41.370> walk
