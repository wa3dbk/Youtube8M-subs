choose the right brake fluid for your
particular<00:00:34.170> application<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:35.100> know<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.399> you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
particular application you know what you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.490 
particular application you know what you
shouldn't<00:00:35.760> shouldn't<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.329> why<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.290> mix

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
shouldn't shouldn't do why you can mix

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
shouldn't shouldn't do why you can mix
some<00:00:37.739> products<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.219> not<00:00:38.309> others<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.969> think

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
some products and not others so I think

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.910 
some products and not others so I think
the<00:00:39.570> most<00:00:39.690> important<00:00:40.079> thing<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:40.290> should<00:00:40.469> speak

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the most important thing we should speak

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.979 
the most important thing we should speak
about<00:00:40.950> first<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.360> brake<00:00:42.570> fluid<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
about first is the brake fluid is the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
about first is the brake fluid is the
hydraulic<00:00:43.020> fluid<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.010> resulting<00:00:44.520> when

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
hydraulic fluid that is resulting when

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.619 
hydraulic fluid that is resulting when
you<00:00:44.730> put<00:00:44.879> your<00:00:45.000> foot<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.270> brake<00:00:45.300> pedal

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
you put your foot on the brake pedal

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.720 
you put your foot on the brake pedal
that<00:00:45.930> squashes<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:47.160> heads<00:00:47.309> against

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that squashes there your heads against

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.810 
that squashes there your heads against
the<00:00:47.789> writer<00:00:48.140> but<00:00:49.140> why<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.160> people<00:00:50.579> need<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the writer but why do people need to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.069 
the writer but why do people need to
change<00:00:51.059> their<00:00:51.270> brake<00:00:51.449> fluid<00:00:51.719> John<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> mean

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
change their brake fluid John I mean

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.389 
change their brake fluid John I mean
it's<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.350> pretty<00:00:52.469> obvious<00:00:52.620> question<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> some

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
it's a pretty obvious question to some

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.500 
it's a pretty obvious question to some
people<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.789> someone<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.120> people<00:00:54.360> might

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
people with someone that people might

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.819 
people with someone that people might
not<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:55.140> start<00:00:55.379> brake<00:00:55.559> fluid

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
not know for start brake fluid

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.619 
not know for start brake fluid
hydroscopic<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:57.059> something<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:57.420> omae's

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
hydroscopic for something with omae's

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.580 
hydroscopic for something with omae's
absorbs<00:00:58.410> absorbs<00:00:58.980> moisture<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.660> over<00:01:01.350> time

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
absorbs absorbs moisture so over time

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.260 
absorbs absorbs moisture so over time
basically<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.280> boiling<00:01:02.609> point<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> fluid

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
basically the boiling point of the fluid

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.789 
basically the boiling point of the fluid
and<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> heat<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.780> capability<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:04.650> can

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and the heat can capability they can

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.920 
and the heat can capability they can
have<00:01:05.309> love<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.119> lows<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.450> lows<00:01:06.570> saves

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
have love with some lows and lows saves

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.859 
have love with some lows and lows saves
time<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> road<00:01:07.860> car<00:01:08.450> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.720> away

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
time so on a road car you can get away

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.149 
time so on a road car you can get away
with<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> normal<00:01:10.530> fluid<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
with a normal fluid because the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.590 
with a normal fluid because the
temperature<00:01:11.549> zone<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.510> it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
temperature zone you see that but it

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
temperature zone you see that but it
should<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.810> flushed<00:01:13.049> every<00:01:13.320> 12<00:01:13.530> months<00:01:13.680> when

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
should be flushed every 12 months when

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.530 
should be flushed every 12 months when
you're<00:01:14.549> starting<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.909> high-performance<00:01:15.450> car

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you're starting a high-performance car

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.140 
you're starting a high-performance car
see<00:01:16.080> more<00:01:16.290> speed<00:01:16.640> braking<00:01:17.640> later<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
see more speed braking later and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.429 
see more speed braking later and
especially<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.540> track<00:01:18.750> day<00:01:18.900> care<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.229> need<00:01:19.350> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
especially on track day care you need to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.380 
especially on track day care you need to
look<00:01:19.560> at<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.770> performance<00:01:20.159> fluid<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> think

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
look at a performance fluid so I think

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.580 
look at a performance fluid so I think
what<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.540> should<00:01:21.570> start<00:01:21.960> at<00:01:22.110> from<00:01:22.320> our<00:01:22.439> point

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
what we should start at from our point

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.899 
what we should start at from our point
of<00:01:22.680> view<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:22.920> might<00:01:23.070> say<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.430> recommend

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
of view they might say we recommend

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.210 
of view they might say we recommend
obviously<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.810> AP<00:01:25.140> Racing<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:26.130> know

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
obviously you're the AP Racing you know

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.109 
obviously you're the AP Racing you know
the<00:01:26.400> 600<00:01:26.880> fluid<00:01:27.799> how<00:01:28.799> does<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.189> compare<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the 600 fluid how does that compare to a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.170 
the 600 fluid how does that compare to a

draw<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> boiling<00:01:50.670> point<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.960> both<00:01:52.079> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
draw the boiling point so that both of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.840 
draw the boiling point so that both of
those<00:01:52.380> properties<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.369> higher<00:01:53.579> than<00:01:53.790> what

those properties are higher than what

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.539 
those properties are higher than what
you're<00:01:54.030> seeing<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.299> standard<00:01:54.630> fluid<00:01:55.399> you<00:01:56.399> can

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
you're seeing a standard fluid you can

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.550 
you're seeing a standard fluid you can
start<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:56.969> something<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
start with something like this one and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.270 
start with something like this one and
that<00:01:58.799> has<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> boiling<00:01:59.189> point<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.700> 220<00:02:00.360> degrees

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
that has a boiling point of 220 degrees

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
that has a boiling point of 220 degrees
hot<00:02:02.280> that's<00:02:03.030> sorry<00:02:03.180> wet<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.990> two

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
hot that's sorry wet and it's a two

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.780 
hot that's sorry wet and it's a two
hundred<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.649> sixty<00:02:04.950> degree<00:02:05.219> dry<00:02:05.460> boiling

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
hundred and sixty degree dry boiling

hundred and sixty degree dry boiling
point<00:02:06.030> instead<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.930> suitable<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.320> guy

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
point instead to be suitable for a guy

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.499 
point instead to be suitable for a guy
that<00:02:07.740> does<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:08.940> bit<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.179> spirit<00:02:09.360> of

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
that does you know bit of spirit of

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.830 
that does you know bit of spirit of
driving<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.020> light<00:02:10.979> track<00:02:11.280> work<00:02:11.489> so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
driving and light track work so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.470 
driving and light track work so
next<00:02:13.380> up<00:02:13.530> Kingston<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.430> one<00:02:14.640> yep<00:02:15.090> which

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
next up Kingston so this one yep which

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.960 
next up Kingston so this one yep which
has<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.870> drive<00:02:16.050> line<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.530> 300<00:02:16.740> degrees<00:02:17.100> and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
has the drive line of 300 degrees and

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.550 
has the drive line of 300 degrees and
then<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.420> go<00:02:18.570> up<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.840> your<00:02:18.930> fluids<00:02:19.290> like<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
then you go up in your fluids like the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.740 
then you go up in your fluids like the
Brembo<00:02:19.890> he<00:02:20.040> has<00:02:20.310> 319<00:02:21.200> another<00:02:22.200> ap<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:22.770> has<00:02:23.750> 320

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
Brembo he has 319 another ap one has 320

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.810 
Brembo he has 319 another ap one has 320
and<00:02:24.960> then<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.680> endless<00:02:26.400> one<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.670> actually

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
and then the endless one is actually

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.550 
and then the endless one is actually
higher<00:02:27.120> again<00:02:27.420> from<00:02:27.660> there<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:28.320> something<00:02:28.500> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
higher again from there it's something a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.490 
higher again from there it's something a
little<00:02:28.740> bit<00:02:28.830> higher<00:02:29.010> at<00:02:29.190> his<00:02:29.340> home<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:31.350> we're

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
little bit higher at his home and we're

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.830 
little bit higher at his home and we're
talking<00:02:32.209> incremental<00:02:33.209> changes<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.720> mean

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
talking incremental changes I mean

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.060 
talking incremental changes I mean
obviously<00:02:33.959> as<00:02:34.320> we<00:02:34.470> go<00:02:34.620> up<00:02:34.800> they're<00:02:34.980> getting

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
obviously as we go up they're getting

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.430 
obviously as we go up they're getting
better<00:02:35.459> but<00:02:35.640> when<00:02:35.760> I'm<00:02:35.850> talking<00:02:36.150> huge<00:02:36.600> like

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
better but when I'm talking huge like

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.930 
better but when I'm talking huge like
this<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.770> not<00:02:37.890> twice<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.370> good<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.790> it's

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
this is not twice as good in it's

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.390 
this is not twice as good in it's
boiling<00:02:39.120> point<00:02:39.330> that's<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.320> nice<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:41.370> good

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
boiling point that's this nice is good

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.430 
boiling point that's this nice is good
but<00:02:41.820> in<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.090> brake<00:02:42.390> temperature<00:02:42.900> you're<00:02:43.320> not

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
but in a brake temperature you're not

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.410 
but in a brake temperature you're not
saying<00:02:43.800> twice<00:02:44.160> as<00:02:44.370> much<00:02:44.489> temperature<00:02:44.850> ideally

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
saying twice as much temperature ideally

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.000 
saying twice as much temperature ideally
want<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.600> keep<00:02:45.750> your<00:02:45.840> calipers<00:02:46.230> around<00:02:46.530> 200

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
want to keep your calipers around 200

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.470 
want to keep your calipers around 200
degrees<00:02:47.040> anything<00:02:47.700> over<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.120> you've<00:02:48.330> really

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
degrees anything over that you've really

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.780 
degrees anything over that you've really
got<00:02:48.810> problems<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:50.010> you're<00:02:50.190> trying<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.489> keep<00:02:50.670> it

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
got problems so you're trying to keep it

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.330 
got problems so you're trying to keep it
in<00:02:50.880> there<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:51.290> 10<00:02:52.290> degrees<00:02:52.650> can<00:02:52.890> make<00:02:53.040> quite<00:02:53.280> a

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
in there but 10 degrees can make quite a

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.770 
in there but 10 degrees can make quite a
difference<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.910> pedal<00:02:54.209> feel<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.690> other

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
difference to the pedal feel the other

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.180 
difference to the pedal feel the other
thing<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.530> talk<00:02:55.709> about<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.040> brake

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
thing that the talk about and brake

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.199 
thing that the talk about and brake
fluid<00:02:56.220> compressibility<00:02:57.440> different<00:02:59.209> fluids

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
fluid compressibility different fluids

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.370 
fluid compressibility different fluids
have<00:03:00.330> prepared<00:03:00.690> different<00:03:00.989> compensability

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
have prepared different compensability

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.110 
have prepared different compensability
so<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:01.770> can<00:03:01.890> actually<00:03:02.160> improve<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.880> pedal

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
so it can actually improve the pedal

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.900 
so it can actually improve the pedal
feel<00:03:03.360> by<00:03:03.870> changing<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.410> fluid<00:03:04.820> because<00:03:05.820> we

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
feel by changing the fluid because we

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.760 
feel by changing the fluid because we
people<00:03:06.180> talk<00:03:06.450> about<00:03:06.600> having<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.170> woody<00:03:07.440> brake

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
people talk about having a woody brake

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.850 
people talk about having a woody brake
pedal<00:03:08.130> yep<00:03:08.489> or<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.120> dull<00:03:09.720> yep<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.500> obviously

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
pedal yep or the dull yep and obviously

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.440 
pedal yep or the dull yep and obviously
some<00:03:11.310> people<00:03:11.550> say<00:03:11.670> I've<00:03:11.790> got<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.940> long<00:03:12.180> break

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
some people say I've got a long break

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.780 
some people say I've got a long break
pill<00:03:12.690> which<00:03:13.260> can<00:03:13.470> be<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.860> combination<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
pill which can be a combination of the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.850 
pill which can be a combination of the
condition<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.360> fluid<00:03:15.810> also<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.500> quality

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
condition of the fluid also the quality

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.620 
condition of the fluid also the quality
the<00:03:16.980> top<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> floor<00:03:17.459> absolutely<00:03:18.299> another

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
the top the floor absolutely another

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.940 
the top the floor absolutely another
thing<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.959> some<00:03:19.320> fluids<00:03:19.650> are<00:03:19.739> different

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
thing to some fluids are different

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.410 
thing to some fluids are different
viscosity<00:03:20.070> as<00:03:20.549> well<00:03:20.760> which<00:03:20.910> just<00:03:21.120> means<00:03:21.299> that

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
viscosity as well which just means that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.390 
viscosity as well which just means that
the<00:03:22.170> thickness<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.830> floor<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.040> guess<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.370> a

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
the thickness of the floor I guess is a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.220 
the thickness of the floor I guess is a
word<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.150> they<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:24.480> take<00:03:24.840> different

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
can be a stretch but it just it ruins a

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.090

hundreds of dollars mo track day and
yeah<00:04:14.790> might<00:04:14.970> be<00:04:15.000> 95<00:04:15.420> dollars<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.739> have<00:04:16.859> a

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
really good - not Hawaii problem so but

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.860 
really good - not Hawaii problem so but
you<00:04:19.140> know<00:04:19.260> after<00:04:19.650> research<00:04:20.099> a<00:04:20.220> youngin

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.300 
you know after research a youngin
for<00:04:21.019> bottle<00:04:21.260> probably<00:04:21.380> just<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.769> do<00:04:21.889> that<00:04:22.070> just

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
for bottle probably just to do that just

for bottle probably just to do that just
to<00:04:22.520> flush<00:04:22.729> out<00:04:23.060> what's<00:04:23.389> in<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.660> caliper<00:04:23.930> so

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
to flush out what's in the caliper so

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.710 
to flush out what's in the caliper so
how<00:04:25.520> would<00:04:25.580> someone<00:04:25.910> then<00:04:26.150> decide<00:04:26.419> whether

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
how would someone then decide whether

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.330 
how would someone then decide whether
they<00:04:26.870> really<00:04:27.050> need<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.410> go<00:04:27.530> up<00:04:27.740> in<00:04:27.889> the<00:04:27.949> reins<00:04:28.160> I

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
they really need to go up in the reins I

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.890 
they really need to go up in the reins I
mean<00:04:28.460> what<00:04:28.580> are<00:04:28.610> we<00:04:28.699> talking<00:04:29.060> about<00:04:29.120> as<00:04:29.570> far<00:04:29.780> as

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
mean what are we talking about as far as

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.900 
mean what are we talking about as far as
benefit<00:04:30.320> looking<00:04:31.280> benefit

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.770 
benefit looking benefit
I<00:04:31.940> guess<00:04:32.479> this<00:04:32.900> all<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:34.070> these<00:04:34.190> aren't

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
I guess this all of these aren't

I guess this all of these aren't

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690

are fluids out there that are synthetic

generally nine times out of ten this

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.350 
generally nine times out of ten this
will<00:04:52.940> suit<00:04:53.180> your<00:04:53.360> mark<00:04:53.650> on<00:04:54.650> a<00:04:54.710> car<00:04:55.010> that's<00:04:55.360> like

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
will suit your mark on a car that's like

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.670 
will suit your mark on a car that's like
I<00:04:56.389> say<00:04:56.630> weight<00:04:56.840> fill<00:04:57.050> park<00:04:57.289> where<00:04:57.500> we<00:04:57.530> are

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
I say weight fill park where we are

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.680 
I say weight fill park where we are
today<00:04:57.860> it's<00:04:58.460> not<00:04:58.610> very<00:04:58.880> hard<00:04:59.090> on<00:04:59.210> brakes<00:04:59.449> we

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
today it's not very hard on brakes we

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.730 
today it's not very hard on brakes we
should<00:04:59.840> go<00:04:59.930> somewhere<00:05:00.169> like<00:05:00.350> Queensland

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
should go somewhere like Queensland

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.290 
should go somewhere like Queensland
Raceway<00:05:00.889> which<00:05:01.250> is<00:05:01.370> very<00:05:01.550> hard<00:05:01.760> brake<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:02.240> you

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
Raceway which is very hard brake so you

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.060 
Raceway which is very hard brake so you
might<00:05:02.479> find<00:05:02.750> that<00:05:02.990> that's<00:05:03.350> slightly<00:05:03.680> extra

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
might find that that's slightly extra

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.129 
might find that that's slightly extra
temperature<00:05:04.430> ability<00:05:04.699> of<00:05:04.760> those<00:05:04.940> three<00:05:05.270> will

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
temperature ability of those three will

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.439 
temperature ability of those three will
just<00:05:06.289> keep<00:05:06.949> the<00:05:07.100> pedal<00:05:07.250> firm<00:05:07.520> and<00:05:07.760> also<00:05:07.880> the

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
just keep the pedal firm and also the

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:09.730 
just keep the pedal firm and also the
other<00:05:08.570> things<00:05:08.750> playing<00:05:09.020> what<00:05:09.260> type<00:05:09.440> of<00:05:09.560> tires

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
other things playing what type of tires

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.360 
other things playing what type of tires
you're<00:05:09.979> running

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
you're running

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.700 
you're running

what sort of brake pads of different
brake<00:05:12.889> pads<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:13.430> put<00:05:13.580> more<00:05:13.699> temperature<00:05:14.150> into

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
brake pads you put more temperature into

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.909 
brake pads you put more temperature into
the<00:05:14.330> calipers<00:05:14.720> yes<00:05:15.080> which<00:05:15.380> increases<00:05:15.830> the

can<00:05:23.030> all<00:05:23.210> those<00:05:23.389> fluids<00:05:23.720> be<00:05:23.930> mixed<00:05:24.229> together

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
can all those fluids be mixed together

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.379 
can all those fluids be mixed together
if<00:05:24.830> someone<00:05:25.190> really<00:05:25.340> has<00:05:25.550> to<00:05:25.760> someone<00:05:26.270> really

together<00:05:28.780> ideally<00:05:29.780> though<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.080> would<00:05:30.200> be<00:05:30.380> the

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
together ideally though it would be the

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.320 
together ideally though it would be the
last<00:05:30.770> resort<00:05:30.950> viewed<00:05:31.430> one<00:05:31.610> okay<00:05:31.880> you<00:05:32.090> touched

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
last resort viewed one okay you touched

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.089 
last resort viewed one okay you touched
on<00:05:32.479> one<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:32.750> them<00:05:32.840> having<00:05:33.050> some<00:05:33.620> silicon

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
on one of them having some silicon

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.740 
on one of them having some silicon
content<00:05:34.520> in<00:05:34.639> it<00:05:34.729> hasn't<00:05:35.240> it<00:05:35.330> this<00:05:35.419> one<00:05:35.599> doesn't

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
content in it hasn't it this one doesn't

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.680 
content in it hasn't it this one doesn't
have<00:05:36.130> silicon<00:05:37.130> base<00:05:37.310> but<00:05:37.639> a<00:05:37.849> synthetic<00:05:38.360> base

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
have silicon base but a synthetic base

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.450 
have silicon base but a synthetic base
but<00:05:39.020> basically<00:05:39.500> it<00:05:39.770> can<00:05:39.979> mix<00:05:40.250> with<00:05:40.370> a

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
but basically it can mix with a

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.060 
but basically it can mix with a
silicon-based<00:05:40.880> okay<00:05:41.720> so<00:05:42.380> let's<00:05:42.710> just<00:05:42.889> quickly

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
silicon-based okay so let's just quickly

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.680 
silicon-based okay so let's just quickly
talk<00:05:43.340> about<00:05:43.400> silicon<00:05:43.970> brake<00:05:44.150> fluids<00:05:44.479> yeah

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
talk about silicon brake fluids yeah

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.110 
talk about silicon brake fluids yeah
there<00:05:45.680> is<00:05:45.800> a<00:05:45.830> lot<00:05:46.130> of<00:05:46.160> misinformation<00:05:46.490> out

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
there is a lot of misinformation out

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.790 
there is a lot of misinformation out
there<00:05:47.180> to<00:05:47.630> put<00:05:47.810> silicon<00:05:48.169> brake<00:05:48.380> fluid<00:05:48.650> in<00:05:48.710> a

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
there to put silicon brake fluid in a

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.409 
there to put silicon brake fluid in a
car<00:05:48.979> for<00:05:49.130> my<00:05:49.280> knowledge<00:05:49.669> you<00:05:50.270> have<00:05:50.389> to

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
car for my knowledge you have to

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.270 
car for my knowledge you have to
completely<00:05:50.900> flush<00:05:51.229> the<00:05:51.410> system<00:05:51.440> your<00:05:52.099> muse

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
completely flush the system your muse

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.879 
completely flush the system your muse
seals<00:05:52.610> absolutely<00:05:53.419> dry<00:05:53.960> systems<00:05:54.500> start<00:05:54.770> from

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
seals absolutely dry systems start from

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.430 
seals absolutely dry systems start from
scratch<00:05:55.130> no<00:05:55.460> because<00:05:55.699> you<00:05:55.820> can't<00:05:56.030> have<00:05:56.180> any

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
scratch no because you can't have any

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.020 
scratch no because you can't have any
residual<00:05:57.440> leftovers<00:05:58.280> of<00:05:58.310> any<00:05:58.669> of<00:05:58.789> the<00:05:58.880> aisle

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
residual leftovers of any of the aisle

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.490 
residual leftovers of any of the aisle
braking<00:05:59.419> flaw<00:05:59.570> in<00:05:59.690> the<00:05:59.780> system<00:05:59.900> and<00:06:00.139> otherwise

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
braking flaw in the system and otherwise

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.900 
braking flaw in the system and otherwise
you're<00:06:00.740> basically<00:06:00.770> wasted<00:06:01.490> your<00:06:01.610> money<00:06:01.639> on

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
you're basically wasted your money on

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.100 
you're basically wasted your money on
the<00:06:02.000> silicon<00:06:02.300> that's<00:06:02.479> all<00:06:02.570> right

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
the silicon that's all right

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.900 
the silicon that's all right
so<00:06:03.440> like<00:06:03.979> I<00:06:04.010> said<00:06:04.130> that's<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:04.370> only<00:06:04.460> flow<00:06:04.729> that

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
so like I said that's the only flow that

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.240 
so like I said that's the only flow that
will<00:06:05.060> mix<00:06:05.570> with<00:06:05.780> that<00:06:05.949> whereas<00:06:06.949> the<00:06:07.039> others

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
will mix with that whereas the others

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.770 
will mix with that whereas the others
wine<00:06:07.490> so<00:06:07.760> yeah<00:06:07.910> you<00:06:07.970> basically<00:06:08.360> do<00:06:08.570> have<00:06:08.690> to

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
wine so yeah you basically do have to

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.089 
wine so yeah you basically do have to
flush<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.110> system<00:06:09.139> and<00:06:09.620> to<00:06:09.680> start<00:06:09.919> from

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
flush the system and to start from

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:11.740 
flush the system and to start from
scratch<00:06:10.310> without<00:06:10.729> so<00:06:10.970> is<00:06:11.210> this<00:06:11.330> brake

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
scratch without so is this brake

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.800 
scratch without so is this brake

yeah<00:06:22.849> it's<00:06:23.419> it's<00:06:23.690> quite<00:06:24.020> a<00:06:24.110> good<00:06:24.229> fluid<00:06:24.590> its

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
yeah it's it's quite a good fluid its

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.710 
yeah it's it's quite a good fluid its
main<00:06:25.460> benefit<00:06:25.789> is<00:06:25.880> that<00:06:25.910> it<00:06:26.090> has<00:06:26.210> a<00:06:26.240> very<00:06:26.539> high

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
main benefit is that it has a very high

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.120 
main benefit is that it has a very high
wet<00:06:26.960> boiling<00:06:27.320> point<00:06:27.500> compared<00:06:27.889> to<00:06:27.979> other

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
wet boiling point compared to other

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.100 
wet boiling point compared to other
fluids<00:06:28.550> so<00:06:28.940> from<00:06:29.090> a<00:06:29.150> long-term<00:06:29.390> point<00:06:29.900> of<00:06:30.020> view

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
fluids so from a long-term point of view

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.390 
fluids so from a long-term point of view
if<00:06:30.289> for<00:06:30.440> someone<00:06:30.650> wants<00:06:30.890> to<00:06:30.979> live<00:06:31.099> a<00:06:31.219> long<00:06:31.370> time

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
if for someone wants to live a long time

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.500 
if for someone wants to live a long time
but<00:06:31.820> it's<00:06:31.969> sort<00:06:32.150> of

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
but it's sort of

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.510 
but it's sort of
losses<00:06:32.960> that<00:06:33.110> benefit<00:06:33.680> in<00:06:34.130> a<00:06:34.220> motorsport

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
losses that benefit in a motorsport

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.100 
losses that benefit in a motorsport
environment<00:06:35.480> because<00:06:35.720> you<00:06:35.750> should<00:06:36.020> be

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
environment because you should be

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.200 
environment because you should be
flushing<00:06:36.530> it<00:06:36.650> so<00:06:36.920> you're<00:06:37.700> sort<00:06:37.850> of<00:06:37.970> out

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
flushing it so you're sort of out

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.750 
flushing it so you're sort of out
weighing<00:06:38.510> the<00:06:38.690> cost<00:06:39.100> I've<00:06:40.100> been<00:06:40.280> out<00:06:40.400> 11th<00:06:40.700> in

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
weighing the cost I've been out 11th in

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.860 
weighing the cost I've been out 11th in
there<00:06:40.910> when<00:06:41.030> you're<00:06:41.120> flushing<00:06:41.360> all<00:06:41.600> the<00:06:41.690> time

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
there when you're flushing all the time

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.340 
there when you're flushing all the time
anyway<00:06:42.080> you<00:06:42.200> should<00:06:42.710> be<00:06:42.860> at<00:06:42.950> least<00:06:43.180> yeah<00:06:44.350> so

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
anyway you should be at least yeah so

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.920 
anyway you should be at least yeah so
any<00:06:46.070> other<00:06:46.280> technical<00:06:47.030> tricks<00:06:47.420> or<00:06:47.630> things

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
any other technical tricks or things

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.170 
any other technical tricks or things
that<00:06:47.990> you<00:06:48.140> can't<00:06:48.830> say<00:06:49.040> on<00:06:49.070> video<00:06:49.520> that<00:06:49.760> maybe

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
that you can't say on video that maybe

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.700 
that you can't say on video that maybe
some<00:06:50.600> people<00:06:50.720> more<00:06:50.930> not<00:06:51.110> one<00:06:51.140> yeah<00:06:51.470> look<00:06:51.680> just

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
some people more not one yeah look just

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.860 
some people more not one yeah look just
my<00:06:52.250> guess<00:06:52.400> brakes<00:06:52.850> can<00:06:53.210> be<00:06:53.360> taken<00:06:53.690> for<00:06:53.810> granted

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
my guess brakes can be taken for granted

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.840 
my guess brakes can be taken for granted
and<00:06:54.350> they're<00:06:54.650> a<00:06:54.680> vital<00:06:55.010> part<00:06:55.310> of<00:06:55.370> the<00:06:55.460> car<00:06:55.640> and

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
and they're a vital part of the car and

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.160 
and they're a vital part of the car and
they<00:06:56.060> should<00:06:56.240> be<00:06:56.360> looked<00:06:56.540> after<00:06:56.690> so

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.170 
they should be looked after so

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.470 
they should be looked after so
definitely<00:06:58.130> just<00:06:58.700> it<00:06:58.970> doesn't<00:06:59.240> take<00:06:59.330> much

00:06:59.470 --> 00:06:59.480 
definitely just it doesn't take much

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.670 
definitely just it doesn't take much
just<00:06:59.720> to<00:06:59.810> give<00:06:59.930> them<00:07:00.050> a<00:07:00.110> little<00:07:00.230> bleed<00:07:00.500> after

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
just to give them a little bleed after

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.940 
just to give them a little bleed after
each<00:07:00.980> track<00:07:01.250> day<00:07:01.600> okay<00:07:02.600> so<00:07:02.860> for<00:07:03.860> more
