00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.090
 sea â€‹â€‹towards the arrested group who 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.610
 were searching without shelter for 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.610
 shelters all 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.590

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:17.860
 net in rolls in the air and 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.610
 the whole is everywhere in a junk 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:25.140
 to open up our line up down under under 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.140
 that to the earth and the sky forms and more 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:56.160

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.220

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.140
 finished the lines of people 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.710
