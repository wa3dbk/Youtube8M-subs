really<00:02:02.310> learn<00:02:02.549> how<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.759> stop<00:02:03.180> crossing

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
really learn how to stop crossing

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.889 
really learn how to stop crossing
patterns<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.850> need<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> learn<00:02:06.299> how<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.509> stop

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
patterns and I need to learn how to stop

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.410 
patterns and I need to learn how to stop
out<00:02:07.170> patterns<00:02:07.680> those<00:02:08.099> two<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.819> killed<00:02:09.239> me

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
out patterns those two really killed me

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.229 
out patterns those two really killed me
this<00:02:09.539> game<00:02:09.840> he<00:02:10.770> was<00:02:10.890> able<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.280> exploit<00:02:11.700> those<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
this game he was able to exploit those a

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.670 
this game he was able to exploit those a
lot<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.230> then<00:02:13.319> when<00:02:13.440> I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
lot and then when I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.289 
lot and then when I
start<00:02:13.859> dropping<00:02:14.250> more<00:02:14.430> people<00:02:14.730> into<00:02:14.909> coverage

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
start dropping more people into coverage

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.270 
start dropping more people into coverage
he<00:02:15.959> had<00:02:16.049> run<00:02:16.230> drawers<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.859> things<00:02:17.069> like<00:02:17.219> that

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
he had run drawers and things like that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.039 
he had run drawers and things like that
and<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.849> would<00:02:18.000> throw<00:02:18.180> my<00:02:18.329> defense<00:02:18.689> all<00:02:18.870> off

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
and that would throw my defense all off

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.910 
and that would throw my defense all off
so<00:02:20.420> point<00:02:21.420> taken<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:22.109> I<00:02:22.140> really<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:22.709> need

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
so point taken that I really just need

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.860 
so point taken that I really just need
to<00:02:23.069> play<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.819> game<00:02:23.969> a<00:02:24.000> little<00:02:24.180> bit<00:02:24.390> more<00:02:24.629> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
to play the game a little bit more and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.619 
to play the game a little bit more and
get<00:02:25.109> better<00:02:25.290> defensively<00:02:26.120> for<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.209> most<00:02:27.359> part

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
get better defensively for the most part

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.270 
get better defensively for the most part
I<00:02:27.719> was<00:02:27.840> able<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.230> stop<00:02:28.469> him

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
I was able to stop him

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.149 
I was able to stop him
it<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.060> when<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.780> needed<00:02:31.109> a<00:02:31.290> big<00:02:31.500> stuff<00:02:31.799> I

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
it just when I needed a big stuff I

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.629 
it just when I needed a big stuff I
wasn't<00:02:32.459> able<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.819> do<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.409> second<00:02:34.409> thing<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.950> was

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
wasn't able to do it second thing I was

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.129 
wasn't able to do it second thing I was
able<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:35.909> move<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.239> ball<00:02:36.389> pretty<00:02:36.659> effectively

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139 
able to move the ball pretty effectively

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.270 
able to move the ball pretty effectively
I<00:02:37.260> used<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.829> lot<00:02:38.099> of<00:02:39.230> misdirection<00:02:40.230> run<00:02:40.620> plays<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
I used a lot of misdirection run plays a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.690 
I used a lot of misdirection run plays a
lot<00:02:41.579> of<00:02:41.930> slant<00:02:42.930> type<00:02:43.200> patterns<00:02:43.709> out<00:02:44.280> patterns

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
lot of slant type patterns out patterns

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.110 
lot of slant type patterns out patterns
cut<00:02:45.799> crossings<00:02:46.799> things<00:02:47.099> like<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.730> was

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
cut crossings things like that I was

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.610 
cut crossings things like that I was
able<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.359> move<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.659> ball<00:02:48.780> pretty<00:02:48.989> effectively

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
able to move the ball pretty effectively

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.050 
able to move the ball pretty effectively
the<00:02:49.799> problem<00:02:50.159> was<00:02:50.310> when<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.579> started<00:02:50.939> getting

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the problem was when I started getting

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.149 
the problem was when I started getting
down<00:02:51.269> on<00:02:51.419> the<00:02:51.510> red<00:02:51.659> zone<00:02:51.930> started<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.799> get<00:02:52.859> into

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
down on the red zone started to get into

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.849 
down on the red zone started to get into
field<00:02:53.639> goal<00:02:53.730> territory<00:02:54.389> I<00:02:54.689> ended<00:02:55.349> up<00:02:55.439> shooting

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
field goal territory I ended up shooting

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.190 
field goal territory I ended up shooting
myself<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.400> foot<00:02:56.489> with<00:02:57.419> either<00:02:57.569> dumb

unfortunately I'm running back albeit

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.990 
unfortunately I'm running back albeit
very<00:03:21.540> speedy<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.229> an<00:03:22.349> elusive<00:03:22.859> it's<00:03:23.790> not<00:03:23.970> a

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
very speedy and an elusive it's not a

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
really good between the tackle style

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.539 
really good between the tackle style
running<00:03:26.699> back<00:03:26.909> and<00:03:27.180> unfortunately<00:03:27.629> I<00:03:28.590> tried

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
running back and unfortunately I tried

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.159 
running back and unfortunately I tried
to<00:03:29.699> use<00:03:29.849> them<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> little<00:03:30.180> bit<00:03:30.449> too<00:03:30.689> much<00:03:30.900> in

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
to use them a little bit too much in

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.009 
to use them a little bit too much in
that<00:03:31.229> way<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:33.239> kind<00:03:33.479> of<00:03:33.540> hurt<00:03:33.689> me<00:03:33.840> because

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
that way and it kind of hurt me because

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.170 
that way and it kind of hurt me because
I<00:03:34.349> was<00:03:35.419> basically<00:03:37.099> trying<00:03:38.099> to<00:03:38.400> run<00:03:38.609> on<00:03:38.639> short

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
I was basically trying to run on short

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.509 
I was basically trying to run on short
yardage<00:03:39.359> situations<00:03:40.260> like<00:03:40.500> I'm<00:03:40.709> third<00:03:40.979> down

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
yardage situations like I'm third down

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.550 
yardage situations like I'm third down
and<00:03:41.609> it<00:03:42.030> really<00:03:42.180> failed<00:03:42.540> me<00:03:42.750> most<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.259> the<00:03:43.349> game

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
and it really failed me most of the game

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.939 
and it really failed me most of the game
so<00:03:43.919> I<00:03:44.159> just<00:03:45.120> had<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.329> learn<00:03:45.479> that<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.349> had<00:03:46.620> what

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
so I just had to learn that I had what

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.009 
so I just had to learn that I had what
my<00:03:47.189> offense<00:03:47.609> can<00:03:47.849> do<00:03:48.000> obviously<00:03:48.569> this<00:03:48.689> is<00:03:48.840> only

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
my offense can do obviously this is only

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.539 
my offense can do obviously this is only
the<00:03:49.169> first<00:03:49.349> game<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.650> played<00:03:50.009> with<00:03:50.189> them<00:03:50.370> I

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
the first game I played with them I

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.699 
the first game I played with them I
played<00:03:51.000> one<00:03:51.239> practice<00:03:51.750> game<00:03:51.959> just<00:03:52.290> before

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
played one practice game just before

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.610 
played one practice game just before
that<00:03:53.449> with<00:03:54.449> them<00:03:54.629> just<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:54.989> kind<00:03:55.199> of<00:03:55.290> get<00:03:55.439> used

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
that with them just to kind of get used

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.729 
that with them just to kind of get used
to<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:56.009> who's<00:03:56.669> on<00:03:56.879> my<00:03:56.909> team<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.709> how<00:03:58.709> they

situation which then forces me into

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.100 
situation which then forces me into
throwing<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.240> ball<00:04:45.419> where<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.690> should've
