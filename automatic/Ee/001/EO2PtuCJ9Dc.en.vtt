this toner really would need shaking

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.390 
this toner really would need shaking
before<00:02:12.930> use<00:02:14.150> all<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> need<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.569> do<00:02:15.720> now<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:17.010> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
before use all I need to do now is to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.320 
before use all I need to do now is to
decant<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:18.120> into<00:02:18.540> my<00:02:18.690> bottle<00:02:19.880> give<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.090> shake

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
decant it into my bottle give it a shake

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.880 
decant it into my bottle give it a shake
but<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.600> would<00:02:21.810> shake<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.230> before<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.530> use<00:02:22.740> it

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
but I would shake it before I use it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.250 
but I would shake it before I use it
each<00:02:23.069> time<00:02:23.490> but<00:02:24.120> that's<00:02:24.240> how<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.630> make<00:02:25.020> a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
each time but that's how you make a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.040 
each time but that's how you make a
natural<00:02:25.800> toner
