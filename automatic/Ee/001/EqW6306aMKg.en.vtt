00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
about this picture a little bit that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
about this picture a little bit that
permeate<00:00:31.560> kind<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.890> looks<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:33.120> back<00:00:33.360> end

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
permeate kind of looks like the back end

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.600 
permeate kind of looks like the back end
looks<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.559> very<00:00:34.710> much<00:00:34.890> influenced<00:00:35.489> by

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
looks like it's very much influenced by

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
looks like it's very much influenced by
the<00:00:35.670> tumbler<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.329> although<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.260> can't<00:00:37.620> see

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the tumbler and although we can't see

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.040 
the tumbler and although we can't see
the<00:00:38.040> rest<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:39.180> shape<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> tarp

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the rest of it the shape of the tarp

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.630 
the rest of it the shape of the tarp
kind<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.590> makes<00:00:40.739> me<00:00:40.920> think<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> front

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
kind of makes me think that the front

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.360 
kind of makes me think that the front
end<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.420> car<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.829> call<00:00:44.129> very

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
end of the car is what I call very

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.700 
end of the car is what I call very
Keaton<00:00:44.879> II<00:00:44.969> very<00:00:45.629> Michael<00:00:45.870> Keaton<00:00:46.320> Batman

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
Keaton II very Michael Keaton Batman

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.650 
Keaton II very Michael Keaton Batman

both worlds I think this is really the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.680 
both worlds I think this is really the
first<00:00:51.500> real<00:00:52.500> physical<00:00:53.460> practical<00:00:54.390> thing
