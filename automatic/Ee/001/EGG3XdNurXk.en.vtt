that's okay and this is basically what

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.750 
that's okay and this is basically what
it<00:03:18.000> looks<00:03:18.239> like<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.659> spent<00:03:19.379> about<00:03:19.590> 10<00:03:20.040> out<00:03:20.190> or<00:03:20.459> 10

it looks like I spent about 10 out or 10

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.300 
it looks like I spent about 10 out or 10
minutes<00:03:21.260> kind<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.349> just<00:03:22.500> scraping<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.980> edges

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
minutes kind of just scraping the edges

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.339 
minutes kind of just scraping the edges
and<00:03:23.579> cleaning<00:03:24.209> off<00:03:24.329> that<00:03:24.599> inside<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.049> little

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
and cleaning off that inside a little

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.569 
and cleaning off that inside a little
bit<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.849> managed<00:03:26.849> slick<00:03:27.269> it's<00:03:27.659> a<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:29.280> turned

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
bit and managed slick it's a it turned

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.349 
bit and managed slick it's a it turned
out<00:03:29.760> really<00:03:30.450> really<00:03:30.840> nicely<00:03:31.819> um<00:03:32.819> I<00:03:32.970> did<00:03:33.150> drill

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
out really really nicely um I did drill

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.629 
out really really nicely um I did drill
some<00:03:33.540> holes<00:03:33.569> in<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.140> top<00:03:34.170> here<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.739> that's

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
some holes in the top here and that's

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.550 
some holes in the top here and that's
for<00:03:35.909> my<00:03:36.120> tube<00:03:36.659> that<00:03:36.870> I'm<00:03:36.989> going<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.200> be<00:03:37.319> putting

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
for my tube that I'm going to be putting

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.710 
for my tube that I'm going to be putting
on<00:03:37.769> here<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.209> also<00:03:39.290> welded<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.590> flange<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.400> the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
on here I also welded a flange on the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.099 
on here I also welded a flange on the
top<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.900> my<00:03:43.079> hopper<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:44.720> didn't<00:03:45.720> tell<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:45.989> this

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
top of my hopper I didn't tell you this

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.259 
top of my hopper I didn't tell you this
in<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.379> other<00:03:46.440> video<00:03:46.620> but<00:03:46.829> basically<00:03:47.489> from

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
in the other video but basically from

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.470 
in the other video but basically from
this<00:03:48.480> piece<00:03:48.750> forwards<00:03:49.379> all<00:03:49.530> stainless<00:03:50.129> steel

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
this piece forwards all stainless steel

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.530 
this piece forwards all stainless steel
including<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.569> hopper<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:54.030> recycled

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
including the hopper so just recycled

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.860 
including the hopper so just recycled
stainless<00:03:55.049> this<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:55.709> actually<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.129> back<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.519> a

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
stainless this is actually the back of a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.050 
stainless this is actually the back of a
industrial<00:03:57.870> keyboard<00:03:58.709> these<00:03:59.310> welds<00:03:59.849> look

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
industrial keyboard these welds look

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.689 
industrial keyboard these welds look
terrible<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.310> that's<00:04:02.310> because<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.549> had<00:04:02.669> a

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
terrible and that's because I had a

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.460 
terrible and that's because I had a
really<00:04:02.790> hard<00:04:03.150> time<00:04:03.359> welding<00:04:03.959> upside<00:04:04.260> down

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
really hard time welding upside down

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.430 
really hard time welding upside down
like<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.769> was<00:04:04.919> trying<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.250> do<00:04:05.430> anyway<00:04:06.329> so<00:04:06.900> I'm

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
like I was trying to do anyway so I'm

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.869 
like I was trying to do anyway so I'm
going<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.620> put<00:04:07.799> this<00:04:07.889> together<00:04:08.099> and<00:04:08.549> then<00:04:08.760> I

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
going to put this together and then I

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.110 
going to put this together and then I
have<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> piece<00:04:09.449> of<00:04:09.829> polycarbonate<00:04:10.829> tube<00:04:11.669> I

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
have a piece of polycarbonate tube I

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.240 
have a piece of polycarbonate tube I
believe<00:04:12.389> it's<00:04:12.569> polycarbonate<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.500> I've<00:04:14.010> done

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
believe it's polycarbonate and I've done

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.120 
believe it's polycarbonate and I've done
pre<00:04:14.609> drilled<00:04:14.970> some<00:04:15.269> holes<00:04:15.590> but<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.620> didn't

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
pre drilled some holes but I didn't

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.870 
pre drilled some holes but I didn't
drill<00:04:17.669> them<00:04:17.940> all<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.449> way<00:04:18.599> through

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
drill them all the way through

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.400 
drill them all the way through
probably<00:04:20.880> not<00:04:21.030> yellow<00:04:21.269> focus<00:04:21.690> well<00:04:21.900> right

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
probably not yellow focus well right

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.189 
probably not yellow focus well right
there<00:04:22.710> on<00:04:22.889> the<00:04:23.039> tip<00:04:23.539> see<00:04:24.539> it's<00:04:24.660> not<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:25.050> not

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
there on the tip see it's not it's not

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.689 
there on the tip see it's not it's not
all<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.560> way<00:04:25.650> through<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:25.979> just<00:04:26.280> drilled<00:04:26.550> them

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
all the way through I just drilled them

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.279 
all the way through I just drilled them
so<00:04:26.880> that<00:04:27.030> they're<00:04:27.210> kind<00:04:27.449> of<00:04:27.479> like<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.690> set<00:04:28.050> and

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
so that they're kind of like a set and

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.400 
so that they're kind of like a set and
then<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.669> drilled<00:04:30.240> these<00:04:30.449> holes<00:04:30.510> so<00:04:31.380> that

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
then I drilled these holes so that

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.770 
then I drilled these holes so that
they're<00:04:31.860> all<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:33.000> way<00:04:33.120> through<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:33.660> then

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
they're all the way through and then

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.260 
they're all the way through and then
I'll<00:04:33.930> be<00:04:34.080> able<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.349> thread<00:04:35.000> one<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.030> these

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
I'll be able to thread one of these

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.350 
I'll be able to thread one of these

why they replaced it so we'll do some

00:05:37.259 --> 00:06:02.680 
why they replaced it so we'll do some
time-lapse<00:05:37.889> there<00:05:38.699> we<00:05:38.819> go

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.030 

alright<00:06:03.690> I'm<00:06:04.110> just<00:06:04.320> going<00:06:04.500> to<00:06:04.590> hand<00:06:04.770> tighten

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
alright I'm just going to hand tighten

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.790 
alright I'm just going to hand tighten
those<00:06:05.340> but<00:06:06.110> kind<00:06:07.110> of<00:06:07.169> see<00:06:07.230> what<00:06:07.350> it<00:06:07.440> looks<00:06:07.590> like

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
those but kind of see what it looks like

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.430 
those but kind of see what it looks like
here<00:06:08.240> that's<00:06:09.240> a<00:06:09.389> three<00:06:09.630> inch<00:06:09.840> opening

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
here that's a three inch opening

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.590 
here that's a three inch opening
actually<00:06:11.430> it's<00:06:11.520> slightly<00:06:11.760> less<00:06:12.090> than<00:06:12.120> three

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
actually it's slightly less than three

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.760 
actually it's slightly less than three
inch<00:06:12.750> opening<00:06:13.169> and<00:06:13.320> it<00:06:14.220> drops<00:06:14.490> down<00:06:14.639> into<00:06:15.210> the

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
inch opening and it drops down into the

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.909 
inch opening and it drops down into the
into<00:06:16.770> that<00:06:16.949> bigger<00:06:17.300> open<00:06:18.300> area<00:06:18.680> hoping<00:06:19.680> that

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
into that bigger open area hoping that

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.650 
into that bigger open area hoping that
some<00:06:20.190> of<00:06:20.280> the<00:06:20.370> open<00:06:20.790> area<00:06:21.060> down<00:06:21.210> here<00:06:21.419> kind<00:06:21.570> of

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
some of the open area down here kind of

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.840 
some of the open area down here kind of
relieves<00:06:21.990> some<00:06:22.290> of<00:06:22.350> the<00:06:22.440> pressure<00:06:22.729> it's<00:06:23.729> going

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
relieves some of the pressure it's going

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.930 
relieves some of the pressure it's going
to<00:06:23.910> be<00:06:24.000> on<00:06:24.090> top<00:06:24.300> of<00:06:24.360> here<00:06:25.130> so<00:06:26.130> let's<00:06:26.639> put<00:06:26.850> the

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
to be on top of here so let's put the

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:57.780 
to be on top of here so let's put the
tube<00:06:27.090> on

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.180 

there<00:06:58.390> you<00:06:58.510> go<00:07:00.210> now<00:07:01.210> uh<00:07:01.440> yeah<00:07:02.440> it's<00:07:02.860> a<00:07:03.070> little

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
there you go now uh yeah it's a little

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.080 
there you go now uh yeah it's a little
overkill<00:07:03.820> that<00:07:03.880> you<00:07:04.150> get<00:07:04.300> the<00:07:04.420> idea<00:07:06.090> I'm

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
overkill that you get the idea I'm

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.490 
overkill that you get the idea I'm
probably<00:07:07.300> gonna<00:07:07.480> be<00:07:07.630> cutting<00:07:07.900> this<00:07:07.990> down<00:07:08.260> to

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
probably gonna be cutting this down to

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.860 
probably gonna be cutting this down to
about<00:07:08.850> two<00:07:09.850> foot<00:07:11.790> maybe<00:07:12.790> even<00:07:13.180> like<00:07:13.420> a<00:07:13.450> foot

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
about two foot maybe even like a foot

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.660 
about two foot maybe even like a foot
and<00:07:14.020> a<00:07:14.050> half<00:07:14.080> that's<00:07:14.710> probably<00:07:15.220> a<00:07:15.370> good

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.670 
and a half that's probably a good

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.480 
and a half that's probably a good
distance<00:07:16.090> right<00:07:16.360> there<00:07:17.160> probably<00:07:18.160> walk<00:07:18.310> it

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
distance right there probably walk it

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.740 
distance right there probably walk it
off<00:07:18.610> right<00:07:18.790> there<00:07:19.090> but<00:07:19.570> you<00:07:19.870> get<00:07:20.110> the<00:07:20.260> idea<00:07:20.320> and

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
off right there but you get the idea and

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.030 
off right there but you get the idea and
this<00:07:22.750> is<00:07:22.930> video<00:07:23.080> number<00:07:23.230> two<00:07:23.710> in<00:07:23.860> this<00:07:23.980> series

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040 
this is video number two in this series

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.030 
this is video number two in this series
we'll<00:07:24.910> see<00:07:25.060> if<00:07:25.150> I<00:07:25.210> can<00:07:25.330> keep<00:07:25.450> up<00:07:25.660> with<00:07:25.840> them<00:07:26.040> but

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.040 
we'll see if I can keep up with them but

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.770 
we'll see if I can keep up with them but
yeah<00:07:27.250> hope<00:07:27.550> you<00:07:27.640> enjoyed<00:07:27.880> the<00:07:28.000> time-lapse<00:07:28.390> and

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:33.340 
that turned out it actually turned out

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.300 
that turned out it actually turned out
very<00:07:33.940> very<00:07:34.180> well<00:07:34.600> and<00:07:35.970> fits<00:07:36.970> right<00:07:37.090> on<00:07:37.240> there

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
very very well and fits right on there

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.890 
very very well and fits right on there
designed<00:07:39.310> to<00:07:39.580> fit<00:07:39.790> right<00:07:39.970> on<00:07:40.180> there<00:07:40.210> because<00:07:40.720> I

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:40.900 
designed to fit right on there because I

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.770 
designed to fit right on there because I
drew<00:07:41.200> it<00:07:41.350> up<00:07:41.470> in<00:07:42.100> Google<00:07:42.460> Sketchup<00:07:42.640> in<00:07:43.540> about

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:43.780 
drew it up in Google Sketchup in about

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.780 
drew it up in Google Sketchup in about
an<00:07:43.930> hour<00:07:44.080> took<00:07:45.010> me<00:07:45.130> a<00:07:45.160> little<00:07:45.280> longer<00:07:45.400> than<00:07:45.730> I

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:45.790 
an hour took me a little longer than I

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.040 
an hour took me a little longer than I
expected<00:07:45.910> but<00:07:46.570> uh<00:07:47.040> you<00:07:48.040> get<00:07:48.190> the<00:07:48.220> idea<00:07:49.050> all

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.050 
expected but uh you get the idea all

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.750 
expected but uh you get the idea all
right<00:07:50.200> we're<00:07:50.800> pretty<00:07:50.950> much<00:07:51.130> ready<00:07:51.340> for<00:07:51.460> some
