00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.879
 ah 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.439
 do not 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.910
 hello hello a sesame bread forgive but 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.820
 I had a little problem with the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.980
 video where he explained the ingredients well 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.200
 that swims down in the description box 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.989
 soft soft I leave the link to my blog 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.429
 where you can see the ingredients today 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.129
 I bring a recipe typical of my city 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.960
 sevilla pestiño in my house is made in 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.239
 Christmas is also done in Holy Week 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.309
 so the first thing we do we expose 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.640
 to fry the lemon peel in the oil 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.199
 with kills the grape that is anise we know 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.989
 that the lemon peel is fried because 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.640
 as you see in the image shrinks what 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.470
 we do what we went through a colander and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.900
 we reserve the oil 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.490
 has to be tempered does not have to 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.280
 be hot you can use it cold 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.060
 also but good I in this case and of 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 I 've always used tempered 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.300
 in a pretty big bowl what are we going to 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.640
 to do is add the cinnamon 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.590
 If we like cinnamon a lot, you can 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.140
 I have done more because in my 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.310
 I really like the house, we add the 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.009
 sesame and flour a part 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.479
 then we add the white wine and three 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.479
 quarters of the oil where we have 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.280
 fried the lemon and kills the grape like my 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.590
 oil I have already said that I use it while 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.509
 a bit warm at first for 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.399
 mix everything well what I do is use 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.500
 a spoon until all the 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.500
 ingredients start to take a ball 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.070
 When everything starts to join we add 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.200
 another part of the flour is like this is a 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.390
 of those flour recipes until 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.670
 admit so good with the quantities 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.950
 I give you here I show you what I 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.390
 I make the oil as you can see 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.189
 I added to the whole principle but 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.740
 I keep a little bit and we are going to add 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.030
 both oil and flour little to 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.189
 little we take the dough and if we see that still 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.150
 It needs a little more flour 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.340
 a little more is added 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.320
 we know that the mass needs a little 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.300
 more than flour because it stays stuck 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.920
 in the hands so when I've 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.590
 added the other little bit if you give 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.390
 account begins to make a ball and already at 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.700
 see that it does not stick on the walls is 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.560
 when he took it out of the bowl with the flour that 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.050
 I've been left to sprinkle it on the table 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.300
 I have added that little bit I have not 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.100
 added all the flour this dough like 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.590
 many others you need to work 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.810
 As you can see, the movements are always 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.120
 taking the dough and throwing the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.990
 in joining it with the middle and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.540
 volleying like that for 34 more minutes or 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.310
 less if the dough you notice that it is moist 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.800
 or it stays stuck on the table 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.990
 added a little more flour but now 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.580
 I say to me at this time he did not make me 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.980
 lack 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.830
 we keep kneading 34 minutes we see that 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.470
 everything stays well compact and perfect 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.840
 nothing comes out of that ball and we're going to leave it 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.880
 rest for 30 minutes we cover it 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.880
 important so that the dough does not dry out 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.190
 what I do is that the dough once 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.530
 who has rested took some balls and what 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.480
 covered all the large mass and all the 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.370
 little ball that I have separated and now I'm going to 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.069
 teach the different ways that there are of 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.080
 make small recipes from small I have 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.370
 very many this is the one that I have always 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.500
 done in my house I have some more 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.390
 elastic I have others with yeasts I have 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.430
 Many are the ones that I like 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.230
 This is what is done in my house and this 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.360
 in which they teach I will teach you more 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.920
 do not worry, good as you are 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.190
 I caught watching the ball beech 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.130
 crushed well on the countertop and so 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.650
 is one of the ways to make one of the 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.230
 pestiños we go to the next we take 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.819
 little ball you see the mass is perfect is not 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.790
 they stick their hands they do not stick the countertop 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.180
 without any problem 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.439
 once we extend that little ball by the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.569
 countertop you see that it does not stick to the 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:01.540
 take it off is good for me is the 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.340
 better shape once we have rolled 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.530
 we make a little button in the middle and 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.200
 we squeeze because in the oil always 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.900
 is going to open like that we do that pretty much 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.170
 retains a little the form this other 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.730
 shape making the ball and a curler 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.459
 crushing well 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.650
 Well, as many people do now 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.919
 things at home if you use both the roller 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.380
 Well, if it suits you, look here 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.889
 I teach another way that I learned this 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.750
 thanks to a stick for what cost this 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.030
 is another one of the ways I also think that in 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.949
 córdoba they become more like this the first 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.240
 way that I have taught are more typical of 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.160
 Seville 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.590
 another one of the form that you have seems the 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.930
 small 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.810
 and in the oil where I'm going to fry the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.630
 previously cold pestiños the skin of 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.390
 an orange or a lemon or both 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.430
 and it will taste fried once the 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.860
 retirement and I'm starting to put the 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.140
 pestiños do not mate much quantity I 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.440
 Look, you see the pot that I have is not very 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.630
 It is great and normal household current 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.660
 At most 4 pestiños there is no need 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.840
 move it a lot you leave it in the oil and 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.520
 from time to time from bottom to top 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.370
 you move it a little and especially to see 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.340
 the color and when you see that color 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.680
 You can already take it out what I do 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.190
 it's once he got it out of the oil what 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.920
 I put on a plate with absorbent paper 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.140
 the bathroom theme and I heat the honey and 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.030
 the bathrooms once the pestiños are 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.250
 cool eye I let them cool like a 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.190
 when there are people who take a little 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:39.150
 water to honey so it is not so dense 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.070
 in short, it's comfortable there are people here 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.740
 I also show you that you like it a lot 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.870
 the subject of sugar with cinnamon also 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.040
 you can do it in my case they are taken with 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.580
 hot honey 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.800
 it hides there well and is pulled out and most 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.710
 important thing about this recipe is that it's made 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.980
 the day before consuming them well is how 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.410
 there are the pestiños let's go 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.440
 incredible remember we make pestiños 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.080
 we make the dough fried 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.750
 we bathed we keep well in a tupper 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.020
 closed and we take the day after 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.449
 truly exquisite 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.360
 I'm sorry that there is no video of the 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:19.520
 cut but I made them and they flew like that 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.470
 that I'm not happy to share 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.710
 this recipe with you because it takes in 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.750
 my recipe book all my life I love and 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.509
 I hope you like it as much as I like it 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.110
 to me a greeting and thanks for watching my 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.110
 recipe video
