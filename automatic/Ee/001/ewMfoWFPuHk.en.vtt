00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.330
 This is the great breaker 4 a new game from 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.369
 gameloft that will arrive this week 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.130
 for android 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.070
 it is an action RPG the franchise is in the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.540
 Fourth episode was already going to play that reunites 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.190
 have the best in both the 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.830
 single player campaign with a story 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.500
 very cool in multiplayer mode 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.000
 here you will see on the map of the game 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.489
 has several different regions for 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.120
 explore what implies that the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.699
 adventure will be very long and here in 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.070
 up the main menu of the game with several 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.480
 options the inventory skills 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.730
 character 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.710
 By the time you open the game you can 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.540
 create the character you have four 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.000
 class options and I chose to create a 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.010
 barbarian 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.480
 depending on the skin of the class you 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.510
 choose it it will be better in combat 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.640
 melee or in ranged combat 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.729
 that can be cast spells or throwing 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.530
 arrows for example you can choose the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.090
 sex of your character only does not give 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.399
 to do no further customization 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.369
 it would be legal to suddenly change the 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:19.490
 clothes color these things but this is not 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.140
 possible to burn items that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.729
 I'll explain to you that this game 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.890
 works as follows a firm game 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.720
 one that you 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.729
 although it is free to download and 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.429
 play you need to spend real money 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.920
 with some items that is the case of gems 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.599
 here that are appearing here is with 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.179
 they can improve my weapons 

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:41.090
 and accelerate this process because sometimes 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.039
 you can enhance for example a 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.319
 her sword and she will take several 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.149
 minutes to get better 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.319
 so if I use this gems I can 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.500
 accelerate this process 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.399
 are very important measures which is a 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.429
 practically impossible to achieve 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.979
 playing this game kind of 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.020
 force to spend money sometimes to 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.099
 I can follow the gems I said we are 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.590
 Golden coins 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.989
 here, you have 197 for consuming these 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.670
 coins by defeating enemies and they 

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:12.380
 to be able to buy new items 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.890
 also show some of the gameplay 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.530
 for you here the commands all nation 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.540
 touchscreen plus the directional win 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.860
 it adapts according to the position of the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.320
 month 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.670
 The finger is cool because sometimes you 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.260
 is playing the second a bit of 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.840
 position if you lose a people who are looking 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.360
 for the scenario the character but the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.020
 control of the company so you do not 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.970
 Do not get lost in this, it's really cool. 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.790
 these other buttons here are the powers 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.090
 that I can use during 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.090
 battles 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.890
 as they killed my friends 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.250
 I get a gold line and also 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.860
 skill points I get 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.030
 play for new new new albums 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.840
 attacks 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.840
 when leveling up 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.800
 I can even cast maggi spells 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.070
 serve very destructive 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.890
 has some very good enemies serve in the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.450
 game including eventually I go 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.160
 receive help from other characters 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.760
 with different skills what will be 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.760
 very useful 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.989
 eventually the enemies will put 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.489
 some token items that I got 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.799
 a little for example that the equipment 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:31.959
 to help my defense and if you do not want 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.489
 use these items in case they are 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.660
 repeated what will happen with a 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.459
 certain frequency 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.610
 I can sell them to win some more. 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.799
 playing pennies also inventory 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.370
 so everything I have equipped is with 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.560
 this green symbol on the side here, me 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.170
 I have a cap that is repeated that she 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.970
 has not been improved so it will not 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.769
 serve me because if I equip myself I'll 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.650
 lose six health points then I can 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.239
 sell if I earn more coins is 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.790
 cool I can do this directly from 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.530
 inventory interface do not need to go 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.190
 to any specific point of the game 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.930
 to carry out this type of activity 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.880
 here my screen is the rooms are the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.070
 my skills that I can improve 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.359
 by acquiring new skills as you 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:19.209
 that I level up the character who 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.390
 I created a map that I already showed to 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.280
 You and the store that lets me buy 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.280
 gems and also other weapons 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.780
 there are enough options that are legal 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.330
 to the extent that you equip and have 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.180
 difference between the character it changes 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.020
 visual in game also just like you 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.340
 making the most gems and 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.880
 They are not easy to achieve unless 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.240
 that you spend a good 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.630
 get up to 99 dollars start at 99 one 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.960
 pack of 200 gems and goes up to 99 dollars 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.110
 with 15,000 gems so the game does not 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.250
 much easier because really much 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.160
 difficult almost impossible 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.250
 get these items being and spending 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.250
 money 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.990
 another detail is that we come alone 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.340
 three servings at a time to recover it 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.960
 so if you are in a very battle 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.370
 It's difficult, you end up using all three 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.639
 You will have to wait for a 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.680
 time to recover those positions or 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.840
 then spend real money to buy 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.759
 new positions also 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.030
 So what happens despite the game is 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.650
 little linear will not have large yes 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.409
 puzzles and such 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.889
 it turns out to be very challenging for 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:42.289
 because of the scarcity of good items because 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.720
 if you do not shell out money from 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:48.530
 Truth you're probably going to stick with 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.930
 very weak weapons and will be 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.210
 positions missing when you need them 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.259
 then you either manage your 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.289
 functions 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:59.770
 you'll probably have to spend the 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.000
 your hard earned money 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:07.580
 another way of contracting Teresinenses 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.759
 chests here are also not very good I 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.120
 have to improve them is always a 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:16.780
 fun cool game that has adapted well 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.400
 controls for the touch screen 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.759
 all translated into Portuguese which is well 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.400
 nice too 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:26.810
 he has some achievements that you can 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.250
 move as you play with 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.560
 purchase certain goals you 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.810
 unlock these achievements here so much 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.770
 in the individual campaign and in the 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.080
 multiplayer 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.820
 You can also share your 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.949
 achievements in social networks both in 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.430
 facebook as well as its own network 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.430
 gameloft 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.210
 This was not our featured app. 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.840
 of the week 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.840
 to the next
