in<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:05.160> video<00:00:05.370> we're<00:00:05.640> just<00:00:05.670> going<00:00:05.819> to

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
in this video we're just going to

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.589 
in this video we're just going to
compare<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.569> physical<00:00:07.290> size<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.599> dimensions

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
compare the physical size and dimensions

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.860 
compare the physical size and dimensions
of<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.870> Sony<00:00:10.110> Xperia<00:00:10.200> S<00:00:10.710> against<00:00:11.070> some<00:00:11.370> other

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
of the Sony Xperia S against some other

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.820 
of the Sony Xperia S against some other
smartphones<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.019> are<00:00:13.170> available<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
smartphones that are available on the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.310 
smartphones that are available on the
market<00:00:13.860> today<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:15.150> let's<00:00:15.269> start<00:00:15.660> by<00:00:15.839> taking<00:00:16.109> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
market today so let's start by taking a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.019 
market today so let's start by taking a
look<00:00:16.350> at<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.550> original<00:00:17.670> xperia<00:00:18.660> arc<00:00:18.869> which

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
look at the original xperia arc which

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.840 
look at the original xperia arc which
the<00:00:21.029> xperia<00:00:21.720> s<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:22.109> sort<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.350> evolved<00:00:22.890> from<00:00:23.070> so

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the xperia s are sort of evolved from so

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.370 
the xperia s are sort of evolved from so
there's<00:00:24.269> about<00:00:24.420> point<00:00:24.810> 1<00:00:24.990> inch<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
there's about point 1 inch of a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.900 
there's about point 1 inch of a
difference<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> screen<00:00:26.310> size<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:26.820> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
difference in the screen size but you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.150 
difference in the screen size but you
can<00:00:27.060> see<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.480> overall<00:00:27.930> body<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.590> fairly

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
can see the overall body is fairly

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.490 
can see the overall body is fairly
similar<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.939> size<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.449> Xperia<00:00:30.900> S<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.199> slightly

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
similar in size the Xperia S is slightly

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.620 
similar in size the Xperia S is slightly
longer<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.610> square<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.180> hasn't<00:00:33.450> got<00:00:33.540> this

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
longer this square it hasn't got this

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.010 
longer this square it hasn't got this
sort<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.870> curvature<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.840> Xperia<00:00:36.840> Arc

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
sort of curvature that the Xperia Arc

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.369 
sort of curvature that the Xperia Arc
has<00:00:37.730> when<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.760> comes<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.210> thickness<00:00:39.719> there's

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
has when it comes to thickness there's

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.180 
has when it comes to thickness there's
no<00:00:40.590> doubt<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.250> Ark<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:42.120> indeed

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
no doubt that the Ark is indeed

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.799 
no doubt that the Ark is indeed
considerably<00:00:44.190> thinner<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:45.059> got<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.510> nicer

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
considerably thinner it's got the nicer

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.910 
considerably thinner it's got the nicer
design<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.820> arcing<00:00:47.820> back<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
design with the arcing back to it so the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.439 
design with the arcing back to it so the
Xperia<00:00:52.920> S<00:00:53.190> has<00:00:53.550> quite<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> few<00:00:54.480> more<00:00:54.809> features

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
Xperia S has quite a few more features

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.330 
Xperia S has quite a few more features
so<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.079> slight<00:00:58.590> difference<00:00:59.129> in

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
so because of that slight difference in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.900 
so because of that slight difference in
character<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.270> height<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.899> Xperia<00:01:01.590> S<00:01:02.430> is

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
character the height of the Xperia S is

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.509 
character the height of the Xperia S is
that<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.750> bit<00:01:03.930> bigger<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.799> terms<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that little bit bigger in terms of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.070 
that little bit bigger in terms of
actual<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.240> 10<00:01:07.049> thickness<00:01:07.740> there<00:01:08.580> really

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
actual and 10 thickness there really

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.039 
actual and 10 thickness there really
isn't<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.110> much<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.939> there's<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.030> bit<00:01:13.020> more

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
isn't that much in it there's a bit more

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
isn't that much in it there's a bit more
of<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.470> bulge<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.869> XPS<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
of a bulge on the XPS so that it is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.420 
of a bulge on the XPS so that it is
fractionally<00:01:19.140> thicker<00:01:19.799> when<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.100> comes<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
fractionally thicker when it comes to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.520 
fractionally thicker when it comes to
this<00:01:20.520> piece<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.450> there's<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:22.200> an<00:01:22.320> awful

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
this piece here but there's not an awful

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
this piece here but there's not an awful
lot<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.600> could<00:01:24.750> easily

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
lot in it and I think you could easily

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.320 
lot in it and I think you could easily
switch<00:01:25.590> between<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.189> two<00:01:26.220> bearing<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.299> mind

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
switch between the two bearing in mind

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.850 
switch between the two bearing in mind
the<00:01:27.570> side<00:01:27.840> although<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.320> feels<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.710> little

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the side although this feels a little

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.350 
the side although this feels a little
bit<00:01:29.040> square<00:01:29.479> let's<00:01:30.479> bring<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:32.360> Samsung

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
bit square let's bring in the Samsung

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.440 
bit square let's bring in the Samsung
Galaxy<00:01:33.740> Nexus<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:36.000> got<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> much

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
Galaxy Nexus so this has got a much

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.410 
Galaxy Nexus so this has got a much
bigger<00:01:36.750> display<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> absolute<00:01:38.420> profile

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
bigger display but the absolute profile

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.219 
bigger display but the absolute profile
of<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> machine<00:01:39.930> isn't<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.710> much<00:01:41.159> bigger

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
of the machine isn't that much bigger

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.060 
of the machine isn't that much bigger
all<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.530> all<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> experience<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:45.740> square<00:01:46.740> in

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
all in all the experience is square in

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.539 
all in all the experience is square in
places<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.560> kind<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.829> make<00:01:50.009> up<00:01:50.250> for

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
places and kind of what you make up for

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
places and kind of what you make up for
the<00:01:50.850> Nexus<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.840> doesn't<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.200> all<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.470> this

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the Nexus it doesn't have all of this

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.100 
the Nexus it doesn't have all of this
bit<00:01:52.860> down<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.460> which<00:01:53.670> adds<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.180> little<00:01:54.720> bit<00:01:54.869> in

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
bit down here which adds a little bit in

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.700 
bit down here which adds a little bit in
terms<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.500> length<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.159> terms<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.820> thickness

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
terms of length in terms of thickness

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.370 
terms of length in terms of thickness
really<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.829> quite<00:01:59.399> comparable<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.689> know<00:02:01.229> it's

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
really it's quite comparable I know it's

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.330 
really it's quite comparable I know it's

there<00:03:33.669> the<00:03:34.359> iphone<00:03:34.810> wins<00:03:35.349> it<00:03:35.560> just<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.769> bit

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
there the iphone wins it just a bit

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.089 
there the iphone wins it just a bit
because<00:03:36.129> there's<00:03:36.400> no<00:03:36.659> curvature<00:03:38.699> weight<00:03:39.699> wise

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.199 
because there's no curvature weight wise
very<00:03:42.099> difficult<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.609> tell<00:03:42.790> probably<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
very difficult to tell probably the

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.830 
very difficult to tell probably the
spirit<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:44.079> just<00:03:44.470> that<00:03:44.769> bit<00:03:45.040> heavier<00:03:46.000> as<00:03:46.540> well

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840

so<00:03:51.699> you<00:03:51.760> can<00:03:52.000> see<00:03:52.150> they<00:03:52.299> do<00:03:52.359> have<00:03:52.720> quite<00:03:52.959> a

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
you don't have some of this sort of more
