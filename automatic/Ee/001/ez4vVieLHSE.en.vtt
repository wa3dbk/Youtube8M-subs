00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.179
 century for 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.340
 Now I will show you how to do it. 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.109
 ship on the radio remote control to it 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.010
 radius of action which is sick guests 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.140
 onslaught of the century and so to make such 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.539
 the ship itself needs the body 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.599
 this is a toy boat 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.179
 servo motor and the board arduino 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:36.329
 us two radio board 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:38.340
 and 2401 one board in 298 young it 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.489
 motor driver two bottle caps 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.129
 and battery compartments first covers 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.129
 need to make slots for blades 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.899
 make the necessary holes in the covers and 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.899
 in the ship 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.350
 the shelf must be bent like this 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.350
 way and now all together we collect 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.340
 you should have two wreaths like this 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.770
 it should be such a system 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.770
 motor and clamped screw threesomes 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.200
 to the back of the boat in the done 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.360
 the hole must be fixed to all 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.430
 hi, that's right, I'll fix it 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.600
 propellers shaft gear reducer fang with 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.950
 just screw using cold welding 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.360
 I drive unscrewed screws tightened 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.399
 battery boxes soldered 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.830
 consistently and attach so 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.440
 so that the load is distributed 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.810
 evenly so as the battery and 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.819
 heavy enough now is necessary 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.730
 program in aberdeen 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:23.510
 first connect to the mini connector 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:25.780
 and put in the description under the video there are links 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.470
 on the sleeping receiver and transmitter 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.340
 now you need tools to click 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.860
 com3 port 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.830
 and choose the arduino nano board then 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.140
 ship 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.890
 same way is programmed and 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.040
 other fee 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.510
 now it is necessary to assemble a cult scheme and 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.510
 electronics on the ship 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.540
 fly as you need to get together 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.740
 check the performance of the circuit monitor 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.270
 for everything inside the water 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:11.900
 blades and joystick is a twist and 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:14.150
 movement of my ship is narrow before 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.610
 so that he does not roll over I screwed 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.410
 two bottles on each side swivel system 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.810
 arranged as follows servo 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.810
 will turn such nonsense 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.570
 by the way last video I was making a typewriter on 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:39.090
 radio control and remote control from it 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.090
 suitable for controlling ships 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.069
 here 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.259
 because 

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:53.159
 as you can see friends ship turn 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:56.349
 confident enough 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:05:00.069
 speed good swims forward backward 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:02.169
 left right results of work this is me 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.419
 I was satisfied in one of the following: 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.229
 video will make the ship besh compression 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.969
 bottles and on one single screw 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.549
 as always links to accessories you 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.889
 find in the description subscribe to 

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:17.049
 channel put there will be many more 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.649
 interesting crafts and experiments to 

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:19.649
 new meetings
