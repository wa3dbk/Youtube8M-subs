00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.619
 the small question mark 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:55.559
 the most useful and sooner 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:56.860
 in the videos 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.249
 see the video 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:59.520
 but with age 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.739
 we are caught 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.549
 a lawsuit opposing the points 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.820
 I killed him during the decade a safari culture 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.569
 for prohibited action 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.530
 if I would have you poet fitch

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:14.709
 we even had rings 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.090
 then in the settings 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.549
 the novelty is that we have the nose the word farewell party 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.110
 that makes baysse thibodeau everything 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.059
 the bladder 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:27.770
 alas I was born in tunis music 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.479
 if the same price range 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.960
 moment his teacher m

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.800
 it is not strong 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.919
 how much point to be completed since a screen is needed 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.749
 mineral 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:55.749

 according to 89 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.930
 photo m6 and then question 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.700
 to say what is it was not obvious 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.330
 here 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.419

 we have a battery level 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:23.059
 bus network of Indian tourists colonization 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.529

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.580
 and he's in volume I panicked 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.289
 and equalized come like this and that 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.639
 this decrease is 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.210
 after 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.999
 we saw horrors 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:51.999

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.050
 the minimal ones 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.469
 it is as much prevent but what do you want

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.520
 unpacking% 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.629
