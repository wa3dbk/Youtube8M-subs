00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
show you the sternum about here where

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.020 
show you the sternum about here where
the<00:00:07.610> chain<00:00:08.610> plate<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.230> traveler<00:00:10.969> by<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the chain plate is the traveler by the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.089 
the chain plate is the traveler by the
way<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.780> three-quarter<00:00:13.469> bolt<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
way this is a three-quarter bolt that I

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.129 
way this is a three-quarter bolt that I
recommend<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.910> replacing<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> socket

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
recommend you replacing it with a socket

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.550 
recommend you replacing it with a socket
cap<00:00:16.560> because<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:17.010> need<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.300> really<00:00:18.300> long

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
cap because you need a really long

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.470 
cap because you need a really long
socket<00:00:19.560> wrench<00:00:19.830> with<00:00:20.580> an<00:00:20.730> extension<00:00:21.560> property

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
socket wrench with an extension property

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.650 
socket wrench with an extension property
extension<00:00:25.400> somewhere<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> neighborhood

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
extension somewhere in the neighborhood

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.509 
extension somewhere in the neighborhood
you<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.590> go<00:00:28.740> down<00:00:29.099> into<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
you have to go down into the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030 
you have to go down into the
three-quarter<00:00:30.090> effort<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:31.470> probably<00:00:31.859> need

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
three-quarter effort you probably need

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.160 
three-quarter effort you probably need
something<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> 21<00:00:33.270> inch<00:00:33.300> socket

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
something like a 21 inch socket

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590 
something like a 21 inch socket
let<00:00:34.440> me<00:00:34.530> put<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.920> bunched<00:00:35.190> ours<00:00:35.579> together<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
let me put all bunched ours together to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110 
let me put all bunched ours together to
flop<00:00:37.020> around<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.280> really<00:00:38.940> need

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
flop around like this so you really need

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.959 
flop around like this so you really need
one<00:00:39.420> solid<00:00:39.899> socket<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.790> just

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
one solid socket and then you can just

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.270 
one solid socket and then you can just
put<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.140> what's<00:00:43.350> called<00:00:43.620> an<00:00:43.770> allen

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
put you know what's called an allen

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.450 
put you know what's called an allen
wrench<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.930> stick<00:00:46.350> right<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
wrench and stick right up in there and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
wrench and stick right up in there and
it'll<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.910> set<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> then<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.899> spin<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it'll just set and then you just spin it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.779 
it'll just set and then you just spin it
around<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:51.320> air<00:00:52.789> socket

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
around if you have like a air socket

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.189 
around if you have like a air socket
wrench<00:00:55.399> goes<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.719> copper<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
wrench goes right in the copper you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.430 
wrench goes right in the copper you
don't<00:00:58.350> strip<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.030> yeah<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.239> kind<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.260> nasty

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
don't strip it yeah that's kind of nasty

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.009 
don't strip it yeah that's kind of nasty
putting<00:01:02.280> back<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.120> bed<00:01:03.390> replace<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
putting back in so you bed replace it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.330 
putting back in so you bed replace it
with<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> socket<00:01:04.530> cap<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:07.010> that's<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
with a socket cap so that's for the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.300 
with a socket cap so that's for the
traveler<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.680> chain<00:01:10.950> plate

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
traveler this here is the chain plate

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.450 
traveler this here is the chain plate
and<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.840> was<00:01:13.049> where<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> stanchion<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
and this was where the stanchion was and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.920 
and this was where the stanchion was and
it<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.630> much<00:01:15.869> stress<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.430> all

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
it was so much stress here this was all
