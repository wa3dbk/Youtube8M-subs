00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.120
 and there is the rance tadeu them the revenue of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.589
 Today, they have met the requests for quite some time. 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.080
 People asking us to make tarê sauce. 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.630
 People already done here on hollywood channel goes 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.219
 join the afternoon the hand who has done temaki 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.170
 and all your revenue times are cool 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.300
 put the monitor and monetary one that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.070
 sweet sauce on top of the batch 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.869
 will be stolen at the Japanese restaurant 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.410
 today I learn it here from the currency of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.410
 my son 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.079
 the revenue you are going to make today is delayed 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.239
 It's easier then that time has the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.219
 variations if you go searching if you 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.469
 I want to send the comments they made 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.670
 another explanation I'll do the step 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.370
 that is good everyone everywhere 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.129
 can even make three ingredients 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:01:00.030
 We have here 500ml of soy sauce 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.989
 where it rained 500ml of sake and half a kilo 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.149
 of sugar 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.559
 I'll make this basic recipe if you 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.450
 to increase we can put 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.340
 a piece of ginger to boil together 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.470
 has a Japanese fish seasoning that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 hondashi flame can put a little bit 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.939
 the pozinho but there goes variation that I am 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.799
 doing what you will find easy 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.320
 Anywhere there you have sauce 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.880
 shoyu sugars that got there the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.710
 Simone's main course will be very 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.750
 cool a good preparation to fire 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.759
 the revenue yields reasonably well 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 gives you making sushi several times 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.710
 You try to do more, you only have to fold by yourself. 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.200
 this to do with a liter of it here is 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.180
 rubbish and a pound of sugar just touch 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.299
 to work anyway is a reduction in 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.890
 true, I 'll start here I'll put 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.890
 the soy sauce that I cry for 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.810
 the sake 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.360
 the sugar 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:19.290
 ever move here I need to solve is 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.489
 next patience is medium low fire 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.890
 below 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.780
 This is going to boil for an hour. 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.390
 an hour and a half first of the quantity 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.180
 there depending on the position if it had an air 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.120
 cooler is hotter and was 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.349
 making a syrup point wants to be with 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.390
 that consistency of the world italy 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.680
 Even if you know, we take the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.590
 panela tells a little bit more 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.640
 when it cools thick and I 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.269
 I'll show you how it goes. 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.590
 stay 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.880
 the recipe is just that we will go 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.880
 accompanying there she spoke 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.080
 after 40 minutes it starts to 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.080
 make bubbles 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:17.390
 the fire is at least this point here already 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:19.660
 is close to what will also be 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.620
 liquid 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.620
 it already has a certain consistency 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.710
 when he gets to that point of 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.940
 Watch the pot height only 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.530
 starts to do well in school and needs 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.680
 pay attention because if it can have 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:47.040
 place from here have to stay 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:50.940
 eye has already passed ten more minutes 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.980
 When will I turn off the fire? 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.260
 off and defined the awareness that 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:03.959
 delay to go back now is the following me 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.580
 I'll get a little here and wait 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.020
 Cool to put here in the pool house 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.420
 of the woman 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:16.500
 we will see the consistency already 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:18.570
 find out if the problem is in the repair 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.489
 taré sauce is ready now I'll wait 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.260

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.820
 How's that sauce with something? 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.370
 monetary policy plus a ready -made 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.310
 You asshole you asked the people already 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.890

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.340
