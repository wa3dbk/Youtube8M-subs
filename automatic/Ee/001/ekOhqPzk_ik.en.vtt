00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.200
 good day my ladies and gentlemen my 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.470
 name is serious mocha and cordial 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.160
 welcome back last play lutum the 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.780
 28 today take a look at tour 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.590
 something is the interesting thing about this 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.619
 game 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.940
 the interesting thing about this game is 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.369
 that it was not done by a human 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.320
 So far as I have this description of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.250
 , game themselves understand but by a 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.949
 algorithm of a student 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.400
 a university in london 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.669
 has been 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.500
 the quasi- ending engine program 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.920
 what can she do after that? 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.350
 Thematic specifications of elements in the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.719
 internet and elsewhere and with unity 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.450
 then create a game of it yourself and 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.719
 it was almost now for this lutum 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.410
 the 28 based on the motto you only get 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.140
 one made and I'm curious what 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.539
 right here this irony get one 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730
 means in this place i believe it 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 the algorithm has one in mind 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.680
 bit cheated in the sense that he 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.080
 just said yes you actually get 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.119
 only one level further is the game 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.710
 from a level so incidentally what need 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.220
 we'll have to do it all over here 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.409
 Dodge these statues and go out 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.700
 Sensitivity is very high at this 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.060
 imagine it is a bit hard to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.250
 navigate and we need these boats 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.070
 or the boat we just picked up 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.590
 have collect and pick up and this 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.229
 statue dug into the earth what 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.770
 okay too i think i am what i am 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.560
 really has to say is how unbelievable 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.290
 how number this game really works 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.540
 not only the statues lying here 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.820
 stuck in the ground whiz through the area 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.520
 also the figures here themselves this 3d 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.530
 models i believe other video game 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.790
 characters are 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.590
 I do not really see exactly 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.540
 somehow it reminds me somehow 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.100
 what dynasty warriors but me 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.460
 do not have your story stevens anymore 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.950
 tasted 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.659
 even now the soundtrack in the background 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.729
 that's what I really do here 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.440
 it is interesting to find one with it 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.080
 automatic generation has succeeded 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.170
 a self-contained at least on 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.130
 an aesthetic basically take 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.810
 closed system to form what 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.760
 actually at least somewhere from one 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.870
 conveyed and very bizarre impression 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.489
 and I actually find that 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.650
 very interesting if you are the 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.709
 can think that one can say so 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.570
 An algorithm for that uses bizarre 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.310
 to create worlds and maybe also 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.470
 in this sense, aware of the algorithm 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.300
 to use it for bizarre 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.430
 to create selected I find 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.200
 actually quite from the idea 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.980
 interesting and quasi easy to say 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.720
 okay plays those pretenses you have power 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.030
 something from it just to look at 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.739
 how then the algorithm again the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.640
 algorithms themselves something together 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.390
 you have to connect naturally 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.470
 look that way possible 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.910
 varied, there are actually 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.799
 I want to get out interesting samba 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.090
 I think I have collected all boats and 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.070
 now we have to go into this yellow here 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.780
 go and play the game for me 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.459
 currently have two points total 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.070
 moment maybe there is yes it is here 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.360
 so to speak score attack or something else 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.320
 Let's have a look around 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.850
 I think I was not really 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.860
 in the corner what I would wish 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.110
 would be if the states would be in a position 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.220
 to actually pursue me that is 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.660
 Not really 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.740
 because it's natural right now 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.390
 not a really big one 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.800
 challenge burns because the parts 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.320
 fly through the area but it can 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.700
 of course, the whole thing a bit scary 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.200
 if things are so piece by piece 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.970
 are behind one and maybe one 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.920
 try to push the corner or something 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.770
 in the art and that can actually 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.320
 even just enough from the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.300
 play something from one of them now 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.980
 tension degree albers relaxation bath 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.780
 As interesting to make what 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.580
 right now it is but I believe we around 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.560
 and look at it and think that you are there 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.880
 but strange if now me 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.410
 suddenly run around and me that 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.580
 Look think that looks strange 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.320
 and suddenly I realize that the 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.570
 things me bit by bit in the corner 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.200
 jostle and me in some form 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.820
 actually threaten and do that 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.280
 they indeed currently not so can the 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.160
 dodge relatively easily and I think 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.690
 then that could actually be something 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.910
 be what you look at more often 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.050
 could just because of the result 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.340
 if of course it's cool if that 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.290
 level any shape at random 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.660
 whoever generates but I wish you 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.510
 too much and still do not think so 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.489
 that's all prototypes, though 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.049
 I think it's an exciting thing 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.370
 if you look in which considers that 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.400
 The angel was taken in the reason 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.140
 from specifications what could you build yourself 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.460
 of course in the sense of thinking about whether one 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.640
 that maybe not even then 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.390
 certain games actively uses quasi 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.280
 then this is the rock guiding principle 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.050
 principle in the sense of perfect on the 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.720
 tip to drive by basically 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.700
 taken ok says i randomly generate 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.460
 a form of play from these elements 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.530
 and, as it were, the possibility for the player 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.620
 give yourself to set the parameters 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.530
 elements which come in in the game 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.450
 and in that sense one to a certain extent 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.530
 point more freedom to give yourself 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.660
 then to realize it yourself 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.300
 but then still one in 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.880
 to play a closed game though 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.080
 yes let's go this way what happens 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.970
 escape to exit now I hope not 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.020
 that it should be in any form 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.120
 Full screen mode changed and it is me 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.440
 crashed 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.760
 which I think is a good possibility 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.290
 just to finish who apologizes 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.729
 please the black screen finally 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.560
 the short duration but it is it in 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.720
 Prototypes looked at only briefly and 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.789
 Remember to see if you are yourselves 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.110
 the whole part wants to look normal 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.650
 and you also the description and 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.770
 more information about this program 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.570
 By the way, angelina means to look 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.740
 I grab link to the game itself in 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.320
 the description of the video included 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.789
 to the homepage of the lotus and the like 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.320
 more information so if you guys 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.270
 interested take a look at it 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.620
 and have a look yourself 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.380
 players from the list are there to it 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.970
 forever many and it is definitely one 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.530
 look worth going further with these 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.509
 It is only to deal with things 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.180
 that you would find something like that I would have thought 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.560
 that there are such things so many 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.520
 Thanks for watching and I see you 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.520
 Goodbye next time
