 arrive 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.790
 regarding the method it comes to me from 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.270
 someone I really appreciate 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.670
 job 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.860
 the vision of nutrition and the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.610
 results it was or fitness put 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.579
 point fr 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.079
 I just bought his ebook readers 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.660
 in which he gives advice for 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.449
 to dry and the method that use it 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.309
 it's the diet it's cyclic eugene 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.530
 so what is diet and eugenics 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.539
 cyclical and for six days for 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.330
 total booster or and glycines it's up to 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.700
 say more fruits or more starchy foods and 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.159
 at the end of these six days for 24 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.229
 hours we'll do one or two meals of 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.630
 carbohydrate rebound ie one or 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.570
 two meals in which we will put 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.820
 carbohydrates like that the body does not slow down 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.700
 not too much his metabolism it is relaunched 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.340
 and then we leave for another six 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.259
 days without carbs and strength 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.560
 so the body drew its energy 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.750
 only in proteins and lipids 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.500
 duct zone is also in the mass 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.290
 adipose 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.600
 this protocol is repeated for six 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.820
 weeks before 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.159
 gradually produce carbohydrates 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.700
 so that's the method I can 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.340
 use 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.170
 you have seen the goal that I wish 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.330
 will reach within 16 weeks 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.770
