now four keys
this<00:02:12.209> has<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.599> be<00:02:12.660> one<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> most

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
this has to be one of the most

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.479 
this has to be one of the most
comfortable<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.620> mean<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.860> really<00:02:14.190> found<00:02:14.310> this

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
comfortable I mean I really found this

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.220 
comfortable I mean I really found this
very<00:02:14.849> comfortable<00:02:15.480> for<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.750> keys<00:02:15.959> they

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
very comfortable for the keys they

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.860 
very comfortable for the keys they
didn't<00:02:16.530> they<00:02:17.370> didn't<00:02:17.640> feel<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.330> know<00:02:18.510> I

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
didn't they didn't feel like you know I

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.869 
didn't they didn't feel like you know I
would<00:02:19.290> say<00:02:19.470> when<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.250> iPad<00:02:20.640> Mini

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
would say when you get to the iPad Mini

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.850 
would say when you get to the iPad Mini
you<00:02:21.060> had<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.540> have<00:02:21.690> like<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.989> few<00:02:22.230> smaller<00:02:22.560> keys

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
you had to have like a few smaller keys

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.830 
you had to have like a few smaller keys
or<00:02:23.069> positioning<00:02:23.700> that's<00:02:23.879> different

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
or positioning that's different

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.270 
or positioning that's different
but<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.170> didn't<00:02:25.410> feel<00:02:25.530> like<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.860> was<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.160> was

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
but I didn't feel like this was that was

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.420 
but I didn't feel like this was that was
sacrificed<00:02:26.489> which<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.239> actual<00:02:27.569> keys<00:02:28.430> spacing

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
sacrificed which the actual keys spacing

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.949 
sacrificed which the actual keys spacing
slightly<00:02:29.879> different<00:02:30.269> because<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.750> see

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
slightly different because if you see

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.390 
slightly different because if you see
here<00:02:31.260> like<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.590> know<00:02:31.620> usually<00:02:32.040> when<00:02:32.310> I'm

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
here like you know usually when I'm

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.850 
here like you know usually when I'm
typing<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> madwoman<00:02:33.269> I'm<00:02:33.690> hitting<00:02:34.530> tab

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
typing like a madwoman I'm hitting tab

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.220 
typing like a madwoman I'm hitting tab
but<00:02:35.549> tab<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.120> right<00:02:36.299> just<00:02:36.540> over<00:02:36.750> over<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
but tab is right just over over to the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.630 
but tab is right just over over to the
side<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.680> you're<00:02:37.860> just<00:02:37.980> doing<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.340> little<00:02:38.489> bit

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
side so you're just doing a little bit

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.570 
side so you're just doing a little bit
of<00:02:38.819> an<00:02:38.910> adjustment<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.690> that's<00:02:39.930> about<00:02:40.170> it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
of an adjustment but that's about it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.479 
of an adjustment but that's about it
some<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.760> fun<00:02:42.000> features<00:02:42.480> which<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.930> love

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
some of the fun features which I love

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.740 
some of the fun features which I love
function<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.730> then<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.120> actually<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.569> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
function and then you actually have the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.410 
function and then you actually have the
backlit<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.620> if<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.860> can<00:02:47.040> see<00:02:47.459> let's<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.299> we

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
backlit so if you can see let's see we

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.620 
backlit so if you can see let's see we
can<00:02:48.599> see<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> light<00:02:49.049> here<00:02:50.000> function<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.480> you

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
can see the light here function and you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.140 
can see the light here function and you
can<00:02:51.660> take<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> look<00:02:52.860> at<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.069> red<00:02:53.250> if<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:53.910> you

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
can take a look at the red if not you

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.550 
can take a look at the red if not you
know<00:02:54.239> actually<00:02:54.750> try<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:54.989> say<00:02:55.079> take<00:02:55.319> some<00:02:55.470> more

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
know actually try and say take some more

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.770 
know actually try and say take some more
pictures<00:02:55.620> too<00:02:56.160> but<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.060> actually<00:02:57.209> toggle

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
pictures too but you can actually toggle

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.210 
pictures too but you can actually toggle
through<00:02:57.959> different<00:02:58.440> colors<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.099> can

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
through different colors so you can

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.000 
through different colors so you can
actually<00:02:59.489> have<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> purple<00:03:00.209> backlit<00:03:00.629> keyboard

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
actually have a purple backlit keyboard

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.369 
actually have a purple backlit keyboard
green<00:03:02.010> yellow<00:03:02.430> red<00:03:02.910> for<00:03:03.390> Valentine's<00:03:03.420> Day<00:03:04.140> and

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
green yellow red for Valentine's Day and

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.170 
green yellow red for Valentine's Day and
so<00:03:04.620> on<00:03:04.799> but<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.549> can<00:03:05.760> also<00:03:05.879> turn<00:03:06.120> the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
so on but you can also turn the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.750 
so on but you can also turn the
backlight<00:03:06.450> off<00:03:06.840> if<00:03:07.079> you<00:03:07.200> want<00:03:07.379> so<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.340> just

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
backlight off if you want so I just

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.069 
backlight off if you want so I just
think<00:03:08.849> that's<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.120> nice<00:03:09.269> extra<00:03:09.599> little<00:03:09.840> feature

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
think that's a nice extra little feature

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.259 
think that's a nice extra little feature
that<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:10.829> don't<00:03:11.010> necessarily<00:03:11.160> find<00:03:11.849> on<00:03:12.060> some

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
that you don't necessarily find on some

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.839 
that you don't necessarily find on some
of<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.540> smaller<00:03:13.140> keyboards<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:14.700> then

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
of the the smaller keyboards and then

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.670 
of the the smaller keyboards and then
you<00:03:14.970> also<00:03:15.120> have<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> lot<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.870> command<00:03:16.440> keys

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
you also have a lot of the command keys

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.370 
you also have a lot of the command keys
right<00:03:17.040> at<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> top<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.819> have<00:03:17.910> home<00:03:18.380> this

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
right at the top so you have home this

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.199 
right at the top so you have home this
is<00:03:19.530> your<00:03:19.680> lock<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.549> can<00:03:20.700> actually<00:03:20.970> use

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
is your lock and you can actually use

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.970

actual<00:05:10.640> keyboard<00:05:10.880> hinge<00:05:11.570> but<00:05:12.140> this<00:05:12.350> is<00:05:12.500> all

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
actual keyboard hinge but this is all

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.130 
actual keyboard hinge but this is all
enclosed<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:13.820> you<00:05:13.910> actually<00:05:14.300> don't<00:05:14.870> have<00:05:14.960> to

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
enclosed so you actually don't have to

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.840 
enclosed so you actually don't have to
worry<00:05:15.380> about<00:05:15.410> it<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:15.860> know<00:05:15.980> you<00:05:16.400> know<00:05:16.460> falling

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
worry about it you know you know falling

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.510 
worry about it you know you know falling
off<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.210> keyboard<00:05:17.890> and<00:05:18.890> then<00:05:19.310> when<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:19.490> open

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
off the keyboard and then when you open

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.730 
off the keyboard and then when you open
it<00:05:19.880> up<00:05:19.970> you<00:05:20.150> actually<00:05:20.270> have<00:05:20.600> up<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:20.960> 135

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
it up you actually have up to 135

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.159 
it up you actually have up to 135
degrees<00:05:22.190> of<00:05:22.460> range<00:05:23.210> so<00:05:23.600> you<00:05:23.630> can<00:05:23.990> really

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
degrees of range so you can really

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.380 
degrees of range so you can really
position<00:05:24.680> this<00:05:24.800> however<00:05:24.979> you<00:05:25.220> want<00:05:25.340> so<00:05:26.090> the

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
position this however you want so the

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.060 
position this however you want so the
flexibility<00:05:27.140> but<00:05:27.530> then<00:05:27.680> you're<00:05:27.860> combining

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
flexibility but then you're combining

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.360 
flexibility but then you're combining
the<00:05:28.820> protection<00:05:29.450> that<00:05:29.720> means<00:05:30.710> a<00:05:30.860> lot<00:05:31.040> I<00:05:31.070> mean<00:05:31.280> I

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
the protection that means a lot I mean I

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.580 
the protection that means a lot I mean I
hate<00:05:31.910> again<00:05:32.479> I<00:05:32.510> hate<00:05:32.780> seeing<00:05:33.110> like<00:05:33.320> cracked

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
hate again I hate seeing like cracked

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.980 
hate again I hate seeing like cracked
tablets<00:05:34.070> out<00:05:34.160> everywhere<00:05:34.610> so<00:05:35.060> my<00:05:35.660> big<00:05:35.840> thing

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
tablets out everywhere so my big thing

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.480 
tablets out everywhere so my big thing
was<00:05:36.020> protection<00:05:36.590> but<00:05:36.740> also<00:05:36.830> they<00:05:37.130> can<00:05:37.160> feat

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
was protection but also they can feat

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.150 
was protection but also they can feat
convenience<00:05:38.150> for<00:05:38.390> her<00:05:38.720> and<00:05:39.020> function<00:05:39.590> really

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
convenience for her and function really

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.890 
convenience for her and function really
made<00:05:40.460> a<00:05:40.490> big<00:05:40.700> difference<00:05:40.760> and<00:05:41.330> again<00:05:41.780> they

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
made a big difference and again they

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.050 
made a big difference and again they
come<00:05:42.080> in<00:05:42.229> black<00:05:42.410> and<00:05:42.710> white<00:05:42.890> and<00:05:43.190> actually<00:05:44.000> if

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
come in black and white and actually if

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.460 
come in black and white and actually if
you<00:05:44.120> take<00:05:44.390> a<00:05:44.419> look<00:05:44.630> here<00:05:44.960> if<00:05:45.050> you're<00:05:45.169> wondering

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
you take a look here if you're wondering

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.860 
you take a look here if you're wondering
why<00:05:45.650> I<00:05:45.680> actually<00:05:45.979> have<00:05:46.370> this<00:05:47.000> off<00:05:47.300> I<00:05:47.720> actually

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
why I actually have this off I actually

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.800 
why I actually have this off I actually
have<00:05:48.169> the<00:05:48.520> screen<00:05:49.520> protector<00:05:49.700> if<00:05:50.360> this<00:05:50.540> is<00:05:50.690> the

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
have the screen protector if this is the

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.030

man<00:05:51.169> visit<00:05:51.530> invisible<00:05:52.250> shield<00:05:52.580> by<00:05:53.210> zag<00:05:53.600> and

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
man visit invisible shield by zag and

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.909 
man visit invisible shield by zag and
here<00:05:55.040> we<00:05:55.130> go<00:05:55.310> this<00:05:56.000> particular<00:05:56.800> you<00:05:57.800> know

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
here we go this particular you know

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.980 
here we go this particular you know
model<00:05:58.400> it's<00:05:58.550> actually<00:05:58.850> their<00:05:59.330> original<00:05:59.750> and

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
model it's actually their original and

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.900 
model it's actually their original and
this<00:06:00.560> is<00:06:00.710> what<00:06:00.860> I<00:06:00.890> love<00:06:01.160> it's<00:06:01.340> supposed<00:06:01.790> to<00:06:01.850> be

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
this is what I love it's supposed to be

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.340 
this is what I love it's supposed to be
scratched<00:06:02.180> protection<00:06:02.750> it's<00:06:02.930> nano

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
scratched protection it's nano

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.100 
scratched protection it's nano
technology<00:06:04.010> obviously<00:06:04.570> military-grade<00:06:05.570> and

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
technology obviously military-grade and

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.770 
technology obviously military-grade and
guarantee<00:06:06.950> so<00:06:07.280> if<00:06:07.310> you<00:06:07.640> actually<00:06:07.850> get<00:06:08.720> a

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
guarantee so if you actually get a

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.260 
guarantee so if you actually get a
scratch<00:06:09.229> on<00:06:09.500> this<00:06:09.830> this<00:06:10.130> screen<00:06:11.090> protector

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
scratch on this this screen protector

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.750 
scratch on this this screen protector
they'll<00:06:12.200> actually<00:06:12.380> replace<00:06:12.979> it<00:06:13.160> for<00:06:13.280> free<00:06:13.340> for

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
they'll actually replace it for free for

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.930 
they'll actually replace it for free for
you<00:06:13.910> but<00:06:14.510> with<00:06:15.020> the<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:15.470> nano<00:06:15.740> technology<00:06:16.400> it

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
you but with the the nano technology it

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.640 
you but with the the nano technology it
actually<00:06:17.419> adjusts<00:06:17.870> to<00:06:17.900> itself<00:06:18.290> so<00:06:18.470> if<00:06:18.530> you

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
actually adjusts to itself so if you

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.010 
actually adjusts to itself so if you
have<00:06:18.860> dings<00:06:19.190> it<00:06:19.820> actually<00:06:20.270> morphs<00:06:20.720> and<00:06:20.840> then

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
have dings it actually morphs and then

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.420 
have dings it actually morphs and then
like

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
like

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.210 
like
moves<00:06:21.730> the<00:06:22.000> dings<00:06:22.390> and<00:06:22.750> scratches<00:06:22.780> so<00:06:23.620> it'll

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
moves the dings and scratches so it'll

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.570 
moves the dings and scratches so it'll
actually<00:06:24.310> Ramez<00:06:25.060> some<00:06:25.300> memory<00:06:25.780> so<00:06:26.590> doesn't

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
actually Ramez some memory so doesn't

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.920 
actually Ramez some memory so doesn't
that<00:06:27.700> intellectually<00:06:28.060> you<00:06:28.390> see<00:06:28.540> why<00:06:28.690> I<00:06:28.720> have<00:06:28.900> a

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
that intellectually you see why I have a

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.360 
that intellectually you see why I have a
little<00:06:29.140> extra<00:06:29.470> shield<00:06:29.800> on<00:06:30.010> you're<00:06:30.160> supposed
