00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.959 
before you try and go public and create
a<00:00:31.980> trickshot<00:00:32.189> montage<00:00:32.460> because<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.480> is

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
a trickshot montage because that is

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.139 
a trickshot montage because that is
essential<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.649> making<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:38.070> good<00:00:38.430> trick<00:00:38.940> shot

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
start spinning around you've got to get

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.440 
start spinning around you've got to get
your<00:00:41.940> 360<00:00:42.450> s<00:00:42.570> right<00:00:42.750> got<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> practice<00:00:43.590> your

your 360 s right got to practice your

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.740 
your 360 s right got to practice your
technique<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.610> you<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.820> got<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> know<00:00:48.480> what

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
technique and you just got to know what

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660 
technique and you just got to know what
makes<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.320> look<00:00:49.559> good<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.160> let's<00:00:50.399> get<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.640> with

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
makes it look good so let's get on with

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.529 
makes it look good so let's get on with
this<00:00:50.850> video<00:00:52.670> okay<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.300> first<00:00:54.480> thing

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
this video okay so then the first thing

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.270 
this video okay so then the first thing
I<00:00:54.660> want<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:54.960> practice<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.559> 360<00:00:56.010> s<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
I want to do is practice your 360 s in a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.670 
I want to do is practice your 360 s in a
private<00:00:56.460> match<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.510> whether<00:00:57.870> finding

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
private match so this is whether finding

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.330 
private match so this is whether finding
a<00:00:58.890> spot<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> map<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.410> spinning<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:02.100> get

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
a spot on the map and spinning to get

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.539 
a spot on the map and spinning to get
used<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.579> your<00:01:02.699> sensitivity<00:01:03.329> until<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.549> are

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
used to your sensitivity until you are

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.030 
used to your sensitivity until you are
comfortable<00:01:05.760> doing<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.689> full<00:01:07.229> 360<00:01:07.950> or<00:01:08.130> 720<00:01:10.040> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
comfortable doing a full 360 or 720 so

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
pool as you'll see in one moment the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
pool as you'll see in one moment the
hybrid<00:01:48.060> site<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.840> holographic<00:01:49.500> sight

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
hybrid site is on the holographic sight

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.730 
hybrid site is on the holographic sight
and<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.640> jump<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> 360<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.560> while

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and you jump you do a 360 and while

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.910 
and you jump you do a 360 and while
you're<00:01:52.890> doing<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.399> pull<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.920> scope

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you're doing that you pull the scope

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.190 
you're doing that you pull the scope
back<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.600> looks<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:57.960> they're

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
back on and it looks like they're

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.399 
back on and it looks like they're
pulling<00:01:58.380> out<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:58.939> your<00:01:59.939> sniper<00:02:00.570> rifle<00:02:00.960> so
