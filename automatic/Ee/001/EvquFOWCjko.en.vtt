00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.250
 using the autostart 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.230
 a test of a fairly average level in 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.239
 set with favorites and a base 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.660
 unavoidable to detach and in this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.730
 test 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.170
 let's start with the number one base it 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.340
 this is two so haufor 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.600
 competitors that you know 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.629

 quintés on the small track at each 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 time but this mare trained by 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.270
 christian bigeon answered this in 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.109
 winning once and finishing 2nd 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.940
 the previous time so much haufor who 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.460
 will be entrusted to christian office 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.920
 bigeon charles who won his

 even in this quinté monday in vincennes 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.310
 with is so haufor it is the base 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.290
 absolutely solid from what they 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.939
 were more then behind this 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.040
 mare will be able to decline others 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.320
 possibilities with our favorite 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.500
 it is called tissi ten cities it

 stays on several disqualification 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.090
 but you will see during a test 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.790
 reference played on the small track 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.009

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.950
 quality 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.170
 topaz jeff which offered a very very 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.509
 beautiful duel has so haufor our base 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.009
 in this quinté rate pass jeff so 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.890
 haufor fight is so for the victory 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.960
 jean michel bazire keep a minimal 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.399
 advantage to the passage of the pole on 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.110
 christian bigeon is back on 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.240
 find is here ten cities over 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.159
 third after being at fault during 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630
 the first part 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.700
 of the course she had done a 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.920
 excellent the last kilometers 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.230
 were sidi city ​​who has already trotted a 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.450
 12.3 on the 2100 meters of the big 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.819
 track by intersecting in September 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.830
 last between uma the rib and aida has 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.720
 many playing that will certainly 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.519
 remained applied from one end of the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.430
 course but if so it will take 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.799
 absolutely count with it the number 8 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.170
 turquoise blue depends on the training 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.879
 in great shape of stéphane provost the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.010
 casaque of the stable danover and jean 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.319
 michel bazire at the controls of his mare 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.000
 which this time will be deferré of the four 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.440
 feet she evolves in her category and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.420
 logically part of the chances 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.299
 of this event with the 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.459
 number 4 4 amilly sarine advanced ski 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.500
 previously under their responsibility to 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.209
 yann moreau niskanen this time and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.280
 now it's valery goetz -which manages 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.870
 his career tony le beller 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.870
 she will be in command of this mare 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.530
 prepared for this ordeal she inherited 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.910
 a good number 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.010
 since she will start from the corridor 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.209
 number 4 it will be deferrée 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.859
 posterior a chance of the most 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.230
 regular for the places 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.489
 the number 9 of the units in the world that 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.349
 show a little bit the category on 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.329
 saw her doing well in the category 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.950
 apprentices and amateurs last 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.079
 instead they will have to laugh graffin 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.880
 dial with number 9 is behind 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.340
 the wings of the autostart but his luck 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.430
 seems pretty solid behind we do 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.880
 also trust with at number 10 gold 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.099
 two orders of their io dia gold dellerie 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.840
 it's hard to pronounce and presented 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.599
 by sophie aronson and it's stone 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.040
 lévesque who will be associated with this 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.530
 competitor who will perform his 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.950
 first steps in the hexagon at the end of 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.900
 combination 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.150
 we can possibly remember the number 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.590
 5 farmer's julia who in a good day to 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.139
 quite right to claim 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.180
 to dispute the arrival of a test of this 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.000
 kind and then at the end of combination 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.410
 the number 13 who is kevin of the 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.209
 number 13 is this a number 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.599
 good luck percent of rivers stone 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.620
 vercruysse 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:00.919
 listen to his answer as a number 13 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.030
 it's almost a very nice goal in 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.290
 the the mare ran very well the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.139
 last time we did the little 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.889
 rope course we finished fourth 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.169
 she gave the maximum 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.270
 a filly welcomes a lot given in 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:13.700
 carrier start 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.160
 it gets a little harder we will try 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.850
 to scratch a place 6th the 4/5 then 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.549
 fulfilled his contract 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.720
 absolutely so stone tales the number 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.850
 so much haufor the base 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.530
 unavoidable 50 of this quinté you 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.620
 will have understood the number 11 at taissy 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.690
 ten cities the 8 turquoise bloul 4 and 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.320
 sarine of friends lists the number 9 trinity 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.450
 dumont say it or the number 5 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.870
 farmers julia and at the end of combination 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:42.860
 the 13 year old who is kevin regret leader 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.030
 to report the number 3 natalina wise who 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.830
 has already had the opportunity to perform at 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.970
 vsn not necessarily a lot of margin of 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.500
 maneuver but why not consider it 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.960
 for a fourth or fifth place and 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.160
 and then royal topaz who if she had been 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.560
 at the roof for a first chance at 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.450
 defend in this type of category but 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.280
 according to matthieu abrivard his trainer 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.960
 driver she is currently very far 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.760
 of his best level and then a 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.380
 deadlock is also number 6 the 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.160
 sieve kb j that seems far away 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.630
 also of his best and who 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.850
 would generously garnish the 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.130
 reports by participating in the arrival of 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.290
 this test a traditional board of 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.070
 game with possibly two out of four 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.680
 to propose to you 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.420
 the number1 so haufor with our 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.400
 crushes were civilians and then a 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.440
 kart also with three las bases the 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.380
 11 and 8, and then we decline 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.660
 other possibilities from 4 on 9 on 10 on 5 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.060
 and the 13 hoping to have been complete 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.210
 thank you for being faithful to us and hello to 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.210
