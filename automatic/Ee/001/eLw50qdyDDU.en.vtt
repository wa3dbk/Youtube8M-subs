00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.730 

okay<00:00:00.510> update<00:00:01.170> number<00:00:01.380> four<00:00:02.090> the<00:00:03.740> biggest

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
okay update number four the biggest

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.120 
okay update number four the biggest
change<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.130> have<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.029> gun<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.770> this<00:00:07.770> little

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
change I have on the gun is this little

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.509 
change I have on the gun is this little
mechanism<00:00:08.639> right<00:00:08.760> here<00:00:12.559> the<00:00:13.559> mechanism<00:00:13.799> stops

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
mechanism right here the mechanism stops

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.640 
mechanism right here the mechanism stops
the<00:00:14.759> bullets<00:00:15.150> from<00:00:15.450> falling<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.199> if<00:00:16.500> you're

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the bullets from falling out if you're

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.109 
the bullets from falling out if you're
aiming<00:00:16.949> down<00:00:17.539> and<00:00:19.070> it<00:00:20.070> works<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.789> that's<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
aiming down and it works so that's a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.679 
aiming down and it works so that's a
good<00:00:21.240> thing<00:00:21.529> also<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:23.119> have<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> little<00:00:24.390> thing

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
good thing also I have a little thing

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.509 
good thing also I have a little thing
that<00:00:25.310> unlocks<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:27.949> ante<00:00:28.949> reversal<00:00:29.369> latch

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that unlocks the ante reversal latch

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.849 
that unlocks the ante reversal latch
that's<00:00:29.699> inside<00:00:30.060> there<00:00:30.470> right<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
that's inside there right here on the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.319 
that's inside there right here on the
other<00:00:31.980> side<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.610> wheel<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.120> can

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
other side to have this wheel that I can

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.869 
other side to have this wheel that I can
spin<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.500> when<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.710> spin<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.510> it<00:00:36.510> goes<00:00:36.660> back

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
spin and when I spin it it goes back

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.819 
spin and when I spin it it goes back
this<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.030> important<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:39.500> without<00:00:40.500> doing

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
this is important because without doing

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.170 
this is important because without doing
that<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.070> can't<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.489> take<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> clip

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that you can't really take out the clip

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.639 
that you can't really take out the clip
so<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:42.899> they're<00:00:43.050> kind<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.260> stuck<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.559> this

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
so if they're kind of stuck in this

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.990 
so if they're kind of stuck in this
position<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.190> can't<00:00:44.399> take<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> clip<00:00:44.820> up

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
position you can't take a clip up

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.869 
position you can't take a clip up
because<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.989> piece<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.289> stuck<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:46.879> but

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
because that piece is stuck in there but

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.439 
because that piece is stuck in there but
when<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> rotate<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.020> piece<00:00:49.320> backwards<00:00:50.449> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
when you rotate this piece backwards the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.439 
when you rotate this piece backwards the
whole<00:00:51.629> mechanism<00:00:51.840> goes<00:00:52.440> back<00:00:53.239> now<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
whole mechanism goes back now on the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
whole mechanism goes back now on the
other<00:00:54.539> side<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:55.680> right<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> lever

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
other side it's right there at the lever

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.520 
other side it's right there at the lever
so<00:00:57.239> right<00:00:57.420> inside<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.440> if

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
so right inside there I don't know if

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.459 
so right inside there I don't know if
you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.190> well<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.670> there

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
you can see it so well but it's there

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.680 
you can see it so well but it's there
and<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.620> gonna<00:01:01.770> rotate<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.570> goes

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
and I'm gonna rotate it and then it goes

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.399 
and I'm gonna rotate it and then it goes
back<00:01:05.060> as<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:10.170> thing<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
back as you can see this little thing I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
back as you can see this little thing I
took<00:01:10.470> off<00:01:10.770> before<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.310> started<00:01:11.610> filming<00:01:11.820> so

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
took off before I started filming so

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
took off before I started filming so
that<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.600> could<00:01:13.229> show<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> little<00:01:14.070> door

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
that I could show you the little door

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.910 
that I could show you the little door
mechanism<00:01:15.200> but<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.740> looks

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
mechanism but that's what this looks

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.730 
mechanism but that's what this looks
like<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.299> there's<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.930> little<00:01:19.530> bit<00:01:19.710> of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
like and then there's a little bit of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.219 
like and then there's a little bit of
room<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.369> add<00:01:20.490> any<00:01:20.759> barrel<00:01:21.479> size<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:21.990> I

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
room here to add any barrel size one I

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.600 
room here to add any barrel size one I
made<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.390> really<00:01:24.390> long<00:01:24.780> barrel

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
made a really long barrel

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.670 
made a really long barrel
I<00:01:26.670> tried<00:01:27.450> testing<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.560> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
I tried testing it with this and it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.200 
I tried testing it with this and it
really<00:01:28.860> slows<00:01:29.310> down<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> bullet<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.909> lot<00:01:30.030> but

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
really slows down the bullet a lot but

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.120 
really slows down the bullet a lot but
it<00:01:30.329> does<00:01:30.450> work<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.950> just

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
it does work all you have to do is just

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.730 
it does work all you have to do is just
clip<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.820> into<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> side

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.919 

it's<00:01:36.740> very<00:01:36.859> difficult<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.490> do<00:01:37.609> it<00:01:42.039> there<00:01:43.039> we<00:01:43.159> go

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
it's very difficult to do it there we go

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.709 
it's very difficult to do it there we go
that's<00:01:44.929> clipped<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:45.319> the<00:01:45.380> side<00:01:46.509> let's<00:01:47.509> still

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
that's clipped in the side let's still

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.899 
that's clipped in the side let's still
fire<00:01:47.960> bullets<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.590> know<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.609> looks<00:01:49.759> really

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
fire bullets I know that looks really

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.059 
fire bullets I know that looks really
cool<00:01:50.920> okay

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
cool okay

00:01:52.069 --> 00:02:05.380 
cool okay
