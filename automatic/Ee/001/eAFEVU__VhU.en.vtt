walkthrough of Silent Hill and I liked

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.340 
walkthrough of Silent Hill and I liked
how<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.520> didn't<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.479> much<00:01:12.510> violence

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
how it didn't really have much violence

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.310 
how it didn't really have much violence
