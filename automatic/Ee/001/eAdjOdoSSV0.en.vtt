00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
countries so the first method guys as

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.530 
countries so the first method guys as
you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.470> 30<00:01:04.830> seconds<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.240> player

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you know on 30 seconds the player

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.109 
you know on 30 seconds the player
actually<00:01:06.930> ends<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.619> reset<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> tire

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
actually ends up reset like the tire

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.880 
actually ends up reset like the tire
mittens<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.510> resetting<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.320> someone<00:01:10.590> bids

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
mittens or resetting so if someone bids

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620 
mittens or resetting so if someone bids
on<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.130> 15<00:01:11.580> year<00:01:11.729> i'll<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:11.939> back<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.390> 30

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
on like 15 year i'll go back up to 30

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.810 
on like 15 year i'll go back up to 30
seconds<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> usually<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.549> wait

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
seconds so what I usually do is wait

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.060 
seconds so what I usually do is wait
till<00:01:15.030> 30<00:01:15.330> seconds<00:01:15.869> dead<00:01:16.049> I'm<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.590> bid<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
till 30 seconds dead I'm then bid and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
till 30 seconds dead I'm then bid and
then<00:01:17.430> he<00:01:17.549> doesn't<00:01:17.790> reset<00:01:18.330> again<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.990> people

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
then he doesn't reset again so people

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
then he doesn't reset again so people
will<00:01:19.470> end<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:19.860> thinking<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.369> you've

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
will end up thinking that you've

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.580 
will end up thinking that you've
obviously<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:21.210> been<00:01:21.360> outbid<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
obviously not been outbid and then you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
obviously not been outbid and then you
can<00:01:22.740> end<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.130> winning<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.610> deal<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
can end up winning the deal and I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.450 
can end up winning the deal and I
recommend<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.229> guys<00:01:25.380> doing<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> lot

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460

a bid on you want to time it right so

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.760 
a bid on you want to time it right so
let's<00:02:05.969> say<00:02:06.119> 30<00:02:06.420> seconds<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.229> second

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
let's say 30 seconds is one second

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.010 
let's say 30 seconds is one second
you'll<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.270> went<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> like<00:02:09.750> 30

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
you'll do like this you went to like 30

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.449 
you'll do like this you went to like 30
seconds<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.530> were<00:02:10.649> buying<00:02:10.950> put<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> bit<00:02:11.430> on

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
seconds and you were buying put a bit on

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.900 
seconds and you were buying put a bit on
there

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
there

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.430 
there
and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.330> obviously<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:12.840> reset<00:02:13.230> what

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and then obviously it will reset what

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
and then obviously it will reset what
people<00:02:13.710> think<00:02:13.890> well<00:02:14.130> if<00:02:14.310> someone<00:02:14.610> secondly<00:02:15.210> go

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
people think well if someone secondly go

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.120 
people think well if someone secondly go
