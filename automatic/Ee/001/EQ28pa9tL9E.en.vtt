just perfectly but besides that is
everything<00:01:54.360> lines<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.570> real<00:01:54.720> well<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.110> there's

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
everything lines up real well so there's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.420

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
here it's not flat C so it's kind of

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.210 
here it's not flat C so it's kind of
like<00:03:48.900> after<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.319> while<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.500> know<00:03:49.709> what<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.069> liver

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.860 
like after a while I know what the liver
gets<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.430> little<00:03:50.549> softer<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.030> such<00:03:51.239> it's<00:03:51.720> not

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
gets a little softer and such it's not

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.080 
gets a little softer and such it's not
too<00:03:52.049> bad<00:03:52.079> but<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:53.370> don't<00:03:53.669> know<00:03:53.730> that's<00:03:53.970> just

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
too bad but I don't know that's just

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.580 
too bad but I don't know that's just
kind<00:03:54.329> of<00:03:54.359> me<00:03:54.450> being<00:03:54.599> picky<00:03:54.810> if<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.290> take<00:03:55.560> a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
kind of me being picky if you take a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.710 
kind of me being picky if you take a
stylus<00:03:55.980> out<00:03:56.160> it's<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.519> much<00:03:56.700> flatter<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.299> folds

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
stylus out it's a much flatter and folds

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.900 
stylus out it's a much flatter and folds
right<00:03:57.840> into<00:03:58.049> place<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.579> little<00:03:59.639> over

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
right into place and it's a little over

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.039 
right into place and it's a little over
you<00:04:00.060> still<00:04:00.299> see<00:04:00.419> how<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.540> bumps<00:04:00.780> up<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.900> little

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
you still see how it bumps up a little

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.659 
you still see how it bumps up a little
bit<00:04:01.139> for<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.260> pad<00:04:01.470> right<00:04:01.650> there<00:04:01.680> by<00:04:02.069> then<00:04:02.310> it's

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
bit for the pad right there by then it's

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.479 
bit for the pad right there by then it's
not<00:04:03.030> as<00:04:03.180> it's<00:04:03.389> not<00:04:03.540> as<00:04:03.660> bulky<00:04:03.870> right<00:04:04.139> there<00:04:04.489> but

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
not as it's not as bulky right there but

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.099 
not as it's not as bulky right there but
it's<00:04:06.030> still<00:04:06.239> it's<00:04:06.599> kind<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.810> one<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:06.959> things

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
it's still it's kind of one of things

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.390 
it's still it's kind of one of things

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
with this though is quite

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.920 
with this though is quite
Linda<00:04:26.910> magnet<00:04:27.240> I'm<00:04:27.389> not<00:04:27.509> sure<00:04:27.630> if<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:27.810> guys

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
Linda magnet I'm not sure if you guys

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.240 
Linda magnet I'm not sure if you guys
can<00:04:28.080> see<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.319> on<00:04:28.410> camera<00:04:28.440> but<00:04:28.830> there's<00:04:29.039> quite<00:04:29.220> a

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
can see it on camera but there's quite a

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.879 
can see it on camera but there's quite a
bit<00:04:29.340> of<00:04:29.569> little<00:04:30.569> pieces<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.319> lint<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.650> things

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
bit of little pieces of lint and things

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.469 
bit of little pieces of lint and things
on<00:04:32.039> there<00:04:32.190> I<00:04:32.340> didn't<00:04:32.729> notice<00:04:32.850> that<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.090> edges

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
on there I didn't notice that the edges

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.200 
on there I didn't notice that the edges
slightly<00:04:33.690> frail<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:35.160> little<00:04:35.880> hairs<00:04:36.060> on

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
slightly frail it to the little hairs on

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.330 
slightly frail it to the little hairs on
the<00:04:36.330> edge<00:04:36.500> after<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.530> while<00:04:37.650> if<00:04:37.830> you've<00:04:38.069> used<00:04:38.190> it

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the edge after a while if you've used it

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.920 
the edge after a while if you've used it
for<00:04:38.490> quite<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.639> bit<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.090> notice<00:04:39.569> it<00:04:39.660> starts<00:04:39.870> to

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
for quite a bit and notice it starts to

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.540 
for quite a bit and notice it starts to
peel<00:04:40.110> up<00:04:40.199> a<00:04:40.289> little<00:04:40.470> bit<00:04:40.590> not<00:04:40.889> too<00:04:40.919> much<00:04:41.099> but

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
peel up a little bit not too much but

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.550 
peel up a little bit not too much but
you<00:04:42.060> know<00:04:42.180> just<00:04:42.389> something<00:04:43.229> I<00:04:43.319> kind<00:04:43.470> of

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
you know just something I kind of

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.950 
you know just something I kind of
noticed<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.889> little<00:04:43.979> bit<00:04:44.190> while<00:04:44.310> using<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.960> so

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
noticed a little bit while using it so

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.089 
noticed a little bit while using it so
while<00:04:46.110> it's<00:04:46.229> in<00:04:46.349> here<00:04:46.470> let<00:04:46.680> me<00:04:46.740> show<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:46.889> guys

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
while it's in here let me show you guys

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.540 
while it's in here let me show you guys
what<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.400> can<00:04:47.490> do<00:04:47.610> with<00:04:48.509> the<00:04:49.280> so<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.340> can

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
what you can do with the so you can

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.740 
what you can do with the so you can
still<00:04:50.759> even<00:04:51.000> though<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.240> does<00:04:51.389> have<00:04:51.509> that<00:04:51.599> one

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
still even though it does have that one

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.029 
still even though it does have that one
flapping<00:04:52.080> here<00:04:52.199> you<00:04:52.289> can<00:04:52.440> still<00:04:52.650> use<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.800> to

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
flapping here you can still use it to

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.469 
flapping here you can still use it to
prop<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.280> up<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:53.699> if<00:04:53.849> you<00:04:53.940> are<00:04:54.090> watching<00:04:54.300> the

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
prop it up so if you are watching the

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.210 
prop it up so if you are watching the
video<00:04:54.720> or<00:04:54.930> something<00:04:55.050> if<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.860> pop<00:04:56.039> up<00:04:56.069> like

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
video or something if you pop up like

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.150 
video or something if you pop up like
that<00:04:56.509> no<00:04:57.509> problem<00:04:57.810> right<00:04:57.900> there<00:04:57.960> 20<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:58.889> a<00:04:58.949> for

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
that no problem right there 20 is a for

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.740 
that no problem right there 20 is a for
typing<00:04:59.699> you<00:04:59.820> put<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.180> down<00:05:00.270> with<00:05:00.389> this<00:05:00.539> you

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
typing you put it down with this you

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.600 
typing you put it down with this you
could<00:05:00.870> type<00:05:01.050> on<00:05:01.229> it<00:05:01.259> like<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.650> keep<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:02.550> on

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
could type on it like that keep it on

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.430 
could type on it like that keep it on
this<00:05:02.729> angle<00:05:03.060> this<00:05:03.449> pipe<00:05:03.750> has<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:04.050> stay<00:05:04.199> up<00:05:04.320> this

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
this angle this pipe has to stay up this

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.990 
this angle this pipe has to stay up this
way<00:05:04.620> in<00:05:04.800> or<00:05:04.949> refer<00:05:05.190> these<00:05:05.340> these<00:05:05.669> different

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
way in or refer these these different

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.820 
way in or refer these these different
things<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.240> function<00:05:06.990> like<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.139> but<00:05:07.410> it

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
things to function like that but it

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.140 
things to function like that but it
still<00:05:08.099> is<00:05:08.220> able<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.520> do<00:05:08.610> they<00:05:08.729> even<00:05:08.880> though<00:05:09.060> it

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
still is able to do they even though it

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.790 
still is able to do they even though it
has<00:05:09.240> this<00:05:09.389> one<00:05:09.599> center<00:05:09.960> piece<00:05:10.560> right<00:05:10.770> here

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
has this one center piece right here

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.980 
has this one center piece right here
this<00:05:10.919> division<00:05:11.340> so<00:05:12.240> guys<00:05:12.360> overall<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.750> think

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
this division so guys overall I think

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.510 
this division so guys overall I think
this<00:05:13.169> is<00:05:13.229> a<00:05:13.349> ruinous<00:05:13.710> case<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.160> retails<00:05:14.490> for

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
this is a ruinous case it retails for

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.469 
this is a ruinous case it retails for
one<00:05:14.820> 1995<00:05:15.599> so<00:05:15.870> 120<00:05:16.590> dollars<00:05:17.180> definitely<00:05:18.180> an

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
one 1995 so 120 dollars definitely an

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.629 
one 1995 so 120 dollars definitely an
expensive<00:05:19.320> case<00:05:19.590> that<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.099> would<00:05:20.370> think<00:05:20.490> this

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
expensive case that I would think this

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.129 
expensive case that I would think this
is<00:05:20.820> target<00:05:21.000> more<00:05:21.330> for<00:05:21.539> those<00:05:21.659> there<00:05:21.900> are

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
is target more for those there are

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.350 
is target more for those there are
executives<00:05:22.770> business<00:05:23.039> people<00:05:23.550> that<00:05:24.240> are

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
executives business people that are

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
functional as well this isn't going to

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.700 
functional as well this isn't going to
be<00:05:29.759> something<00:05:30.000> you<00:05:30.389> know<00:05:30.509> that<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:31.139> high<00:05:31.409> school

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
be something you know that a high school

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.899 
be something you know that a high school
is<00:05:31.830> going<00:05:31.949> to<00:05:32.039> want<00:05:32.159> to<00:05:32.220> buy<00:05:32.370> and<00:05:32.580> take<00:05:32.729> and

is going to want to buy and take and

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:33.860 
is going to want to buy and take and
throw<00:05:33.030> it<00:05:33.120> in<00:05:33.210> their<00:05:33.330> backpack<00:05:33.659> unless

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
throw it in their backpack unless

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.060 
throw it in their backpack unless
they're<00:05:34.050> willing<00:05:34.139> to<00:05:34.289> spend<00:05:34.470> twenty<00:05:34.889> dollars

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.350 
they're willing to spend twenty dollars
which<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:35.340> don't<00:05:35.400> think<00:05:35.610> they<00:05:35.880> probably<00:05:36.090> would

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
which I don't think they probably would

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.029 
which I don't think they probably would
