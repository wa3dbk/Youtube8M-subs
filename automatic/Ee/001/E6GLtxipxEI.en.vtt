00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.439
 simple all those who enjoy music want to know how to conserve its usability 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.379
 perfect adding up while the most agree in your look 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.249
 when the first of the year was released with the thickness of a pencil more or less 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.689
 everyone was amazed he was very thin with a brilliant finish 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.189
 colored star displaying photos 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.430
 the second generation doors only a cosmetic change in the parliament won 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.040
 a metal housing with rounded corners 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.080

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.520
 two inches the device more square but much thinner than his 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.720
 predecessor victor produce video still persists 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.500
 finally we arrive at this little one here that seems to return to the origins by the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.990
 to view videos and photos just connect the device horizontally 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.230
 Moreover, it has a ccb accelerometer, for example, to automatically 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.220
 comef crazy play nobody says or even swap songs randomly 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.240
 is equal to your given side 580 hp that you do not need to push any button 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.190
 just give a stronger shaking 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.330
 for this to happen unintentionally it's just you work at the top 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.760
 the accent is the same and with easy and intuitive unemployment but if you want 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.260

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.540
 interest 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.560
 the wealth of adjustments really well and even by the variety of options of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.160
 watching videos here is pretty quiet maybe because the size of the screen is a 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.640
 impression that it is not worth wasting time on this but the resolution 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.260
 and the brightness are so good what it is that I can lose track of time 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.060
