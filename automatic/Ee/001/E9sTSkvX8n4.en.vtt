00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.099
 overcome doubts during the summer and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.869
 the first matches in the ricky nba 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.119
 blond showed that he was made to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.250
 play in the best league in the world his 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 adaptation to the city â€‹â€‹his peers and 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.120
 rick adelman's playing style was 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.100
 total at the moment where 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.460
 where the creative thing you have to leave a 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.180
 little band and it's more to forge 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.400
 give on the street or something like that to do 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.850
 everything is effective but within 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.480
 this 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.640
 you can also be creative not always 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.489
 in a pass in the back or a pass 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.410
 between the legs is because you want 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.570
 like you 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.699
 you want to bring shows if it's not 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.739
 because it is also very effective I hope 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.540
 that sometimes it's better to pass at that moment 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.880
 and good is that not find a little the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.229
 creativity within affectivity the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.240
 ricky's impact not only came in 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.590
 Minnesota many were the companions 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.259
 by profession they spoke well of him 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.850
 even old glories of basketball are 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.060
 they paid tribute to the young man going to 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.060
 be 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.710
 now 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.410
 the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.270
 his reward came soon in February 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.830
 here I would be with players like 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.950
 jeremy lin blake griffin kemba walker 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.710
 option world the bbv to racing star chance 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.780
 of the weekend all-star there in between 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.250
 many talent were the focuses that 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.100
 they were close to a player who 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.500
 I was literally throwing 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.259
 that you do have more desire had to see it 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.570
 in person their parents were good at 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.700
 hard principle at the beginning for me was 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.890
 very hard 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.740
 and what is still happening 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.860
 thanks to technology is that we 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.300
 we talk every day we see each other every day 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.890
 but good yesterday for example when 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.500
 I arrived I wanted to hit him 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.140
 shrugged so it was not computer that 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.690
 Well, thanks to that, we keep 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.099
 in contact and it's not so hard good you 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.540
 I wonder if he has slept well 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.610
 rested well he has taken the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.130
 vitamins has been eaten well as 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.590
 finds tells me and mom every day what 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.100
 same but good also I know 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.220
 I would ask if I was in Barcelona 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.390
 if mothers do not control everything and 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.260
 they always try to drink tea, but not 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:48.640
 be there they call you they care about you 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.090
 and it is important 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.100
 feel the warmth of the family 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.410
 let's not forget that ricky barely has 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.330
 21 years is very far from yours by 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.569
 first time for a long time and that 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.950
 the family is essential in your life is not 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:09.670
 the first time I leave home no and yes 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.540
 that the family is missed 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.720
 friends and when at a professional level I had 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.270
 the luck of being in Barcelona city 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.410
 natal for 20 years and now be a 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:26.140
 time in durable not outside the home is 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.160
 something that you miss them at 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.590
 another family 's side more 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.420
 important after having fun as a child 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.830
 in the party of rookies and sophomores and 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.140
 continue to prove its worth in the month of 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.030
 February at the beginning of March the worst came 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.880
 of the moments of his sports career 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.290
 a knee injury this varies with your 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.739
 season 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.739
 Y 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.849
 good is a lesson that takes time 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.790
 the slow recoveries and I wait and 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.579
 I wish that 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.409
 that can be many summers with the 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.579
 selection but yes that is a shame 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.579
 miss olympics
