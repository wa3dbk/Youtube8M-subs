00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.719
 set and various models 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.469

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.250
 and mouse 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.539
 So, Alex, let's go. 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.170
 It is my first box spoken that they consider 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:01:01.190
 any fault of our own and that's it. 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:06.990
 box is microsoft is an ahp box 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:10.290
 I do not understand why the store is sent to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.030
 hp box is a very good store and I 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.729
 I really trust and I love to buy 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.560
 she that image of the computer store 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.560
 That was very good. 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.520
 I always take care with the blade of the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.360
 twitter is there is one of the products that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:46.260
 do own wheels already opened the box and I 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:02:00.110
 I really like this rule as I already said 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:02:00.110
 the legal stuff 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.500
 really is the box is too big and the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.320
 product itself a waterfall 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:17.430
 finished a tip that I give is you not 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.410
 playing cards outside its focus on business 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.530
 but the company uses a lot but I 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.770
 also the icasa stolen some boxes 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.300
 that is the name you would save to use in 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:33.209
 other occasions 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:36.600
 so here is cool microsoft product 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.350
 microsoft mouse keyboard for me is the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.350
 best brand 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:03:10.130
 here looks there u of course very cool 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.130
 it comes with this protective film 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.700
 black, this guys are the way I told them 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.700
 you 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:35.250
 the desktop and arles microsoft nÃ© 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:39.450
 malta of course 2000 is almost pop the top is 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.100
 the 3 thousand in the then 2000 is already good 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.920
 size for anyone who wants quality and 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.360
 then I did not say goodbye, baby. 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.959
 so that's it he has the cool man here 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.560
 it has the cracked the backing too much 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.680
 but it has all the shortcut keys 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.019
 What are you going to need in the thousand? 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.840
 Do not you see, this has nothing to do with 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:08.940
 details like these one thousand and two thousand 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:13.500
 already have so it is very interesting 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.380
 In addition, the wing also has a signal 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.329
 here is something that in the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.010
 2010 generation had no warning 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.830
 when the battery is low 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.289
 this was one of the problems detected and 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.039
 mouses that do not warn you then 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:34.770
 do not know when he's giving 100% 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:37.320
 efficiency even though it is running 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:43.340
 so that's what the back of it 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:47.040
 have the two cards as always 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:52.340
 microsoft comes to organize in everything 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:55.830
 this law was already already finished 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.310
 hosted house shows for you, right? 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.250
 all differential it is very cool 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.450
 then it works there differently than others 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.460
 keyboards 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:14.910
 it works like two batteries aaa that 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.530
 part running is a thing 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.850
 interesting I wanted to show you 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.160
 here o 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.260
 he has a little space in case you want 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.640
 carry your key bag something 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:30.420
 so to save his island to the 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:35.450
 rock and the adapter or eyes on it 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.450
 transmits much better signal here 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:46.070
 here is evil already predicts our business 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.820
 the mouse is ball show 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.820
 cracked cast that on the side I learned 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:00.540
 nothing very good 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:04.550
 he also has is life when the battery 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:10.080
 is bad're already need change 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:13.500
 he has here and behind him too. 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.900
 have a little support so you can take the 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.740
 adapter that transmits the signal 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.020
 wireless here also the usb and it has a 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.470
 the power button because the other 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.360
 mice from previous versions of 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:30.570
 desktop do not yet have this 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.010
 free option this saves a lot 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.580
 battery with you is not using the 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.090
 Mouse 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:41.280
 So it's very cool, too. 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:46.200
 box islands duracell us and see that the 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:53.400
 default keyboard and 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:54.810
 mouse keyboard does not need to enter 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:00.060
 in this black 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:01.500
 law and without alone I told you my 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.840
 size 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:08.610
 so this is personal I hope you 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:11.840
 have enjoyed the stall and until the next 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.840
