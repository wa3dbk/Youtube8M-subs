discussed on a couple other videos
that's<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.710> BK<00:00:11.120> 15<00:00:12.120> now<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.380> modeled

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
that's a BK 15 now this one is modeled

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.919 
that's a BK 15 now this one is modeled
after<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.519> Giri<00:00:14.790> fist<00:00:15.059> design<00:00:15.330> now<00:00:15.540> one<00:00:15.719> thing<00:00:15.750> I

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
after a Giri fist design now one thing I

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.510 
after a Giri fist design now one thing I
had<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.080> say<00:00:16.199> off<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.379> bat<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.279> has

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
had to say off the bat is this has

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.370 
had to say off the bat is this has
already<00:00:17.699> been<00:00:17.820> modified<00:00:18.270> by<00:00:18.300> myself<00:00:18.900> I've

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
already been modified by myself I've

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.810 
already been modified by myself I've
actually<00:00:19.590> taken<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.010> coating<00:00:20.400> off<00:00:20.490> because

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
actually taken the coating off because

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.070 
actually taken the coating off because
we<00:00:20.939> did<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.420> video<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:21.840> took<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
we did that in a video we took the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.259 
we did that in a video we took the
coating<00:00:22.350> off<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> BK<00:00:22.830> 16<00:00:23.279> because<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.060> course

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
coating off the BK 16 because of course

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.849 
coating off the BK 16 because of course
we<00:00:24.330> had<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> little<00:00:24.810> trouble<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> coding

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
we had a little trouble with the coding

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.130 
we had a little trouble with the coding
at<00:00:25.949> first<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.490> regards<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> 16<00:00:27.420> tests<00:00:28.019> and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
at first in regards to the 16 tests and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.450 
at first in regards to the 16 tests and
review<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.529> once<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.769> took<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.010> coating<00:00:29.340> off

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
review but once we took that coating off

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.669 
review but once we took that coating off
it<00:00:29.910> performed<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> lot<00:00:30.539> better<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.380> was<00:00:31.500> up

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
it performed a lot better and it was up

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.410 
it performed a lot better and it was up
to<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.130> expect<00:00:32.579> from<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.790> k<00:00:32.969> bar<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
to what we expect from the k bar and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 
to what we expect from the k bar and
ethan<00:00:34.110> becker<00:00:34.320> team<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.040> all<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
ethan becker team that we all know and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370 
ethan becker team that we all know and
love<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.510> thing<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.750> very<00:00:36.960> interesting

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
love now one thing is very interesting

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.540 
love now one thing is very interesting
about<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.770> knife<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
about this knife this one is the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
about this knife this one is the
furthest<00:00:38.879> variant<00:00:39.270> compared<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> 16<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
furthest variant compared to the 16 and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
furthest variant compared to the 16 and
17<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> blade<00:00:42.329> length<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> little

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
17 because a blade length is a little

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.600 
17 because a blade length is a little
bit<00:00:43.170> longer<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.739> course<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
bit longer and of course we have a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.430 
bit longer and of course we have a
little<00:00:44.879> bit<00:00:44.940> different<00:00:45.300> grind<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.020> tapered

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
little bit different grind and a tapered

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
little bit different grind and a tapered
spine<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.789> some<00:00:47.940> closer<00:00:48.180> look<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
spine so you have some closer look to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.819 
spine so you have some closer look to
this<00:00:48.660> now<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.899> say<00:00:49.050> again<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.559> does<00:00:49.680> not

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
this now I say again this one does not

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.229 
this now I say again this one does not
have<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> coating<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> buy<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> new<00:00:50.940> one

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
have the coating so if you buy a new one

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.090 
have the coating so if you buy a new one
it<00:00:51.390> will<00:00:51.480> not<00:00:51.629> look<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.890> course

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it will not look like this but of course

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.229 
it will not look like this but of course
we<00:00:53.219> will<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.460> given<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:53.910> away<00:00:54.090> after

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
we will be given this one away after

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.150 
we will be given this one away after
we're<00:00:54.480> done<00:00:54.600> our<00:00:54.750> test<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.140> review<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.860> this

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
we're done our test and review so this

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.880 
we're done our test and review so this
modified<00:00:56.610> BK<00:00:57.059> 15<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.379> will<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:58.800> of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
modified BK 15 can and will be one of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.770 
modified BK 15 can and will be one of
yours<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.309> its<00:01:00.000> brethren<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.510> one's<00:01:00.690> gonna

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
yours like its brethren this one's gonna

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
yours like its brethren this one's gonna
be<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> price<00:01:01.109> point<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> same<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.430> MSRP

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
be a price point about the same the MSRP

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.750 
be a price point about the same the MSRP
is<00:01:03.030> about<00:01:03.329> 107<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.129> has<00:01:05.280> been<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.580> as

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is about 107 but this has been going as

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.469 
is about 107 but this has been going as
low<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.119> about<00:01:06.409> $73<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.369> internet<00:01:08.939> so

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
low as about $73 on the internet so

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.539 
low as about $73 on the internet so
check<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.380> course<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
check that out of course we do have the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.219 
check that out of course we do have the
double<00:01:12.060> scales<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.540> come<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.140> you

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
double scales that come with it if you

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.690 
double scales that come with it if you
want<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> tan<00:01:13.770> ones<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.430> want<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.610> keep

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
about previously now this one is going

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.260 
about previously now this one is going
to<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> little<00:01:52.680> bit<00:01:52.799> longer<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> was

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
to be a little bit longer so I was

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.060 
to be a little bit longer so I was
concerned<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> bought<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.680> them

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
concerned that if you bought all of them

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.249 
concerned that if you bought all of them
you<00:01:56.159> might<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.549> looking<00:01:57.420> at<00:01:57.689> different<00:01:57.990> chief

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you might be looking at different chief

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.050 
you might be looking at different chief
options<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.310> actually<00:01:59.640> they're<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
options but actually they're all the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.760 
options but actually they're all the
same<00:02:00.090> sheet<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.810> don't<00:02:00.990> worry<00:02:01.110> about<00:02:01.229> mixing

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
same sheet so don't worry about mixing

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.810 
same sheet so don't worry about mixing
those<00:02:01.920> up<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.460> course<00:02:02.850> another<00:02:03.060> 5<00:02:03.360> 30<00:02:03.689> seconds

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
those up of course another 5 30 seconds

those up of course another 5 30 seconds
thickness<00:02:05.820> stock<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
thickness stock and this one like the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.350 
thickness stock and this one like the
other<00:02:07.829> ones<00:02:08.039> does<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.729> decent-sized

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
other ones does have a decent-sized

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.630 
other ones does have a decent-sized
choil<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.679> want<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.890> grab<00:02:11.039> up<00:02:11.220> there<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
choil if you want to grab up there and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.610 
choil if you want to grab up there and
get<00:02:12.030> some<00:02:12.239> clothes<00:02:12.420> or<00:02:12.599> cuts<00:02:12.840> now

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
get some clothes or cuts now

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.470 
get some clothes or cuts now
this<00:02:13.709> one<00:02:13.890> actually<00:02:14.069> at<00:02:14.430> first<00:02:15.060> sight<00:02:15.299> I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
this one actually at first sight I

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.940 
this one actually at first sight I
didn't<00:02:15.840> think<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> would<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.650> at<00:02:16.769> all

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
didn't think that I would like it at all

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.470 
didn't think that I would like it at all
and<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.340> would<00:02:17.459> be<00:02:17.549> immediately<00:02:18.000> drawn<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.299> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
and I would be immediately drawn to the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.330 
and I would be immediately drawn to the
BK<00:02:18.780> 16<00:02:19.230> but<00:02:19.440> my<00:02:19.560> personal<00:02:20.040> preference

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
BK 16 but my personal preference

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.430 
BK 16 but my personal preference
actually<00:02:21.299> has<00:02:21.390> been<00:02:21.510> more<00:02:21.659> drawn<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.260> I

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
actually has been more drawn to this I

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.350 
actually has been more drawn to this I
like<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.799> blade<00:02:23.010> geometry<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.030> I

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
like the blade geometry on this and I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.309 
like the blade geometry on this and I
think<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:24.690> just<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.870> little<00:02:24.989> bit<00:02:25.170> better

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
think it's just a little bit better

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.259 
think it's just a little bit better
slicer<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.489> think<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.760> could<00:02:26.879> do<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> little

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
slicer and I think you could do a little

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.869 
slicer and I think you could do a little
bit<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:28.049> regards<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.739> camp<00:02:29.280> kitchen<00:02:29.549> and

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
bit more in regards to camp kitchen and

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.670 
bit more in regards to camp kitchen and
and<00:02:30.000> general<00:02:30.510> purpose<00:02:30.900> wilderness<00:02:31.560> survival

and general purpose wilderness survival

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.890 
and general purpose wilderness survival
we<00:02:32.250> will<00:02:32.400> see<00:02:32.549> a<00:02:32.579> few<00:02:32.790> more<00:02:33.000> videos<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.540> regards

we will see a few more videos in regards

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.750 
we will see a few more videos in regards
this<00:02:34.140> test<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.590> review<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:35.310> only<00:02:35.489> thing<00:02:35.640> that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
this test and review the only thing that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.399 
this test and review the only thing that
I'm<00:02:35.849> kind<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.090> disappointed<00:02:36.360> in<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:36.989> because

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
I'm kind of disappointed in is because

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.869 
I'm kind of disappointed in is because
of<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.739> tapered<00:02:38.159> edge<00:02:38.370> we<00:02:38.640> don't<00:02:38.790> really

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
of this tapered edge we don't really

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.670 
of this tapered edge we don't really
have<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> good<00:02:39.360> right<00:02:39.629> angle<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.500> use<00:02:40.650> a

have a good right angle to use a
firesteel<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.180> jumping<00:02:42.540> also

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
firesteel on this and the jumping also

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.020 
firesteel on this and the jumping also
takes<00:02:43.019> away<00:02:43.290> some<00:02:43.829> of<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.519> don't<00:02:44.940> know

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
takes away some of that so I don't know

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.059 
takes away some of that so I don't know
if<00:02:45.150> we're<00:02:45.299> able<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.629> put<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.989> spot<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:46.799> maybe

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
if we're able to put a spot here maybe

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.650 
if we're able to put a spot here maybe
in<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.549> finger<00:02:47.819> choil<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.329> we<00:02:48.420> don't<00:02:48.540> want

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
in the finger choil but we don't want

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.270 
in the finger choil but we don't want
anything<00:02:48.810> too<00:02:49.140> sharp<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.709> purpose<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.129> this

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
anything too sharp the purpose of this

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.130 
anything too sharp the purpose of this
being<00:02:50.609> able<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.819> choke<00:02:51.000> up<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.269> blade<00:02:51.569> for
