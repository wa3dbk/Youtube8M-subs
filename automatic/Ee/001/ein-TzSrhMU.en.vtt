Singapore<00:00:16.740> it's<00:00:17.740> based<00:00:18.009> on<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:18.400> import

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
Singapore it's based on the import

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.190 
Singapore it's based on the import
requirements<00:00:19.300> from<00:00:19.419> the<00:00:19.660> importing<00:00:20.169> country

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
requirements from the importing country

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.350 
requirements from the importing country
so<00:00:20.800> there's<00:00:20.980> a<00:00:21.070> series<00:00:21.400> of<00:00:21.610> blood<00:00:21.790> tests<00:00:22.240> and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
so there's a series of blood tests and

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.390 
so there's a series of blood tests and
procedures<00:00:22.960> you've<00:00:23.470> got<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:23.710> observe<00:00:24.070> and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
procedures you've got to observe and

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.550 
procedures you've got to observe and
there's<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.630> restriction<00:00:25.630> of<00:00:25.869> movement<00:00:26.320> on<00:00:26.410> the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
there's a restriction of movement on the

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.950 
there's a restriction of movement on the
property<00:00:27.039> in<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.490> confinement<00:00:28.210> with<00:00:28.840> the

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
property in the confinement with the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.540 
property in the confinement with the
grid<00:00:29.170> forces<00:00:29.740> away<00:00:29.859> from<00:00:30.310> all<00:00:30.429> the<00:00:30.519> other

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
grid forces away from all the other

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.850 
grid forces away from all the other
horses<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.750> work<00:00:31.960> involved<00:00:32.439> with<00:00:32.529> these<00:00:32.650> has

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
horses the work involved with these has

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.810 
horses the work involved with these has
been<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:33.100> probably<00:00:33.460> a<00:00:33.519> little<00:00:33.610> bit<00:00:33.790> more

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
been a probably a little bit more

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.340 
been a probably a little bit more
because<00:00:34.150> their<00:00:34.570> horse<00:00:34.750> is<00:00:34.930> going<00:00:35.230> into

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
because their horse is going into

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.470 
because their horse is going into
competition<00:00:35.940> straightaway<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:37.120> little<00:00:37.360> bit

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
competition straightaway a little bit

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.389 
competition straightaway a little bit
like<00:00:37.629> racehorses<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:38.650> these<00:00:38.800> horses<00:00:39.010> got<00:00:39.280> it

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
like racehorses and these horses got it

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.729 
like racehorses and these horses got it
and<00:00:39.670> they<00:00:40.030> go<00:00:40.149> exercise<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:41.020> have<00:00:41.530> that
