going forward so just stand back here
and<00:00:55.940> wait<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:56.969> them<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.270> come<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.809> between

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
and wait for them to come in between

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.709

this<00:00:58.289> tree<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:59.039> rock<00:00:59.250> face<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.359> it'll<00:01:00.690> be

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this tree and that rock face so it'll be

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.290 
this tree and that rock face so it'll be
quite<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.710> bottleneck<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.460> you'll<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.180> able

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
quite the bottleneck and you'll be able

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.120 
quite the bottleneck and you'll be able
to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.899> ease<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.950> might

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
to do it with ease the you but you might

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
to do it with ease the you but you might
get<00:01:08.310> fooled<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.270> bit<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.659> once<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
get fooled a little bit because once you

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.039 
get fooled a little bit because once you
get<00:01:10.920> spotted<00:01:11.460> it'll<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.180> very<00:01:12.360> easy<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.840> tell

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
get spotted it'll be very easy to tell

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.370 
get spotted it'll be very easy to tell
and<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:14.250> want<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.610> walk<00:01:14.790> your<00:01:14.939> treatment

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
and you want to walk your treatment

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.810 
and you want to walk your treatment
whatever<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:16.979> move<00:01:17.310> forward<00:01:17.700> from

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
whatever you do do not move forward from

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.940 
whatever you do do not move forward from
this<00:01:18.030> spot<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.530> move<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> little

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
this spot you get you can move a little

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.100 
this spot you get you can move a little
bit<00:01:20.100> forward<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.549> I've<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> safest

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
bit forward but I've this is the safest

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
bit forward but I've this is the safest
spot<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.799> from<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.549> you'll<00:01:23.820> never

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
spot to do it from because you'll never

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.770 
spot to do it from because you'll never
get<00:01:24.180> spotted<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.850> bit<00:01:27.090> coming<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.540> where<00:01:27.750> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
get spotted the bit coming up where I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.480 
get spotted the bit coming up where I
move<00:01:28.049> forward<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> little<00:01:28.619> bit<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.280> far

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
move forward a little bit that's as far

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.359 
move forward a little bit that's as far
as<00:01:29.549> you'll<00:01:29.820> probably<00:01:30.060> want<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> go<00:01:31.369> otherwise

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
as you'll probably want to go otherwise

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
as you'll probably want to go otherwise
you're<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> stay<00:01:33.540> back<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you're going to stay back here for the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.830 
you're going to stay back here for the
duration<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> achievement<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.840> you'll

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
duration of the achievement and you'll

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.429 
duration of the achievement and you'll
be<00:01:36.960> fine<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.390> doing<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.930> legendary

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
be fine so I was doing this on legendary

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.440 
be fine so I was doing this on legendary
so<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.070> might<00:01:41.369> explain<00:01:41.700> why

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
so that might explain why

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.039 
so that might explain why
a<00:01:42.479> few<00:01:42.869> extra<00:01:43.079> hits<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.770> kill<00:01:43.799> certain<00:01:44.219> enemies

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
a few extra hits to kill certain enemies

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.539 
a few extra hits to kill certain enemies
otherwise<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.280> pretty<00:01:47.399> easy

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
otherwise it's going to be pretty easy

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.359 
otherwise it's going to be pretty easy
if<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.229> normal<00:01:49.649> easy<00:01:49.890> or

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
if you can go for all normal easy or

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.749 
if you can go for all normal easy or
here<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.740> use<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.130> night<00:01:56.310> vision<00:01:56.340> of

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
here I you can use the night vision of

detected I haven't tested this out but
it<00:02:52.769> most<00:02:53.609> certainly<00:02:53.760> will<00:02:54.150> work<00:02:54.450> because

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
it most certainly will work because

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.690 
it most certainly will work because
skulls<00:02:55.170> don't<00:02:55.440> negate<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:56.010> achievements

even if they are in your favor so the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.800 
even if they are in your favor so the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
best way to tell this is as far as you

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.440 
best way to tell this is as far as you
want<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.139> go<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.470> cliff<00:03:04.680> side<00:03:05.450> there's
