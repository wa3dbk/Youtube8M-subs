see those to some kind of a parabolic
the<00:01:54.509> antenna<00:01:55.079> area<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.680> guess<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.490> that's<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the antenna area I guess and that's to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.100 
the antenna area I guess and that's to
the<00:01:57.060> left<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.610> Manzano<00:02:00.110> underground

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the left is the Manzano underground

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.109 
the left is the Manzano underground
storage<00:02:01.530> area<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:04.009> yes<00:02:05.009> that's<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
storage area is that so yes that's the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.389 
storage area is that so yes that's the
the<00:02:06.869> month<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> base<00:02:07.710> area<00:02:08.039> there<00:02:08.280> were

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the month on a base area there were

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.449 
the month on a base area there were
these<00:02:08.840> store<00:02:09.840> all<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.259> nuclear<00:02:11.039> material

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
these store all the nuclear material

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.490 
these store all the nuclear material
there<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.030> mountain<00:02:12.330> itself

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
there in the mountain itself

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.000 
there in the mountain itself
you<00:02:13.740> go<00:02:13.890> from<00:02:14.100> there<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.730> training<00:02:15.180> area<00:02:15.480> now

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
you go from there it's training area now

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.980 
you go from there it's training area now
to<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.130> left<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.490> got<00:02:17.640> some<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> radar

concrete building edges nine stories is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.449 
concrete building edges nine stories is
where<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.300> Sandia<00:02:52.260> Labs<00:02:52.500> originally<00:02:53.190> did

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
where the Sandia Labs originally did

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.280 
where the Sandia Labs originally did
their<00:02:53.640> solar<00:02:54.030> testing<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:54.930> a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
their solar testing and it's a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.710 
their solar testing and it's a
nine-story<00:02:56.160> building<00:02:56.280> out<00:02:56.760> there<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.570> have

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
nine-story building out there you have

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.530 
nine-story building out there you have
two<00:02:57.959> water<00:02:58.230> towers<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.610> then<00:02:59.730> again<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
two water towers and then again to the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.240 
two water towers and then again to the
right<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.140> where<00:03:01.170> Lovelace<00:03:01.890> has<00:03:02.130> their

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
right is where Lovelace has their

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.120 
right is where Lovelace has their
inhalation<00:03:05.480> testing<00:03:06.480> facility<00:03:07.050> for<00:03:07.380> gases

and<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.670> up<00:03:08.850> there<00:03:09.709> almost<00:03:10.709> directly

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
and so on up there almost directly

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.870 
and so on up there almost directly
behind<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.209> solar<00:03:13.110> tower<00:03:13.410> though<00:03:13.800> you'll<00:03:14.640> see

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
behind the solar tower though you'll see

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.550 
behind the solar tower though you'll see
a<00:03:14.910> couple<00:03:15.330> small<00:03:15.360> buildings<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.470> that's

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
a couple small buildings and that's

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.190 
a couple small buildings and that's
where<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.920> US<00:03:17.220> Geological<00:03:17.970> Service<00:03:18.239> has

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
where the US Geological Service has

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.650 
where the US Geological Service has
their<00:03:19.560> earthquake<00:03:19.940> monitoring<00:03:20.940> center<00:03:21.420> for

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
their earthquake monitoring center for

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.449 
their earthquake monitoring center for
the<00:03:22.760> Rio<00:03:23.760> Grande<00:03:24.120> Rift<00:03:24.450> Valley<00:03:24.720> here<00:03:25.470> okay<00:03:26.400> so

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
the Rio Grande Rift Valley here okay so

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.330 
the Rio Grande Rift Valley here okay so
I<00:03:26.640> need<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.690> ask<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.049> question<00:03:28.530> about<00:03:28.650> what

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
I need to ask you a question about what

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.460 
I need to ask you a question about what
we<00:03:29.549> see<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> distance<00:03:30.299> namely<00:03:31.170> these

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
we see in the distance namely these

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.870 
we see in the distance namely these
those<00:03:32.360> what<00:03:33.360> look<00:03:33.570> like<00:03:33.890> observatories<00:03:34.890> they

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
those what look like observatories they

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.380 
those what look like observatories they
are<00:03:36.209> actually<00:03:37.110> part<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.070> project<00:03:38.670> star

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
are actually part of the project star

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.539 
are actually part of the project star
fire<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:41.670> had<00:03:42.269> been<00:03:42.739> continuously<00:03:43.739> going<00:03:44.250> on

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
fire that had been continuously going on

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.880 
fire that had been continuously going on
since<00:03:44.820> they're<00:03:45.030> on<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.690> late<00:03:45.870> 70s<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.709> that

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
since they're on the late 70s is that

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.550 
since they're on the late 70s is that
right<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.880> some<00:03:48.329> kind<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.810> laser

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
right and is that some kind of a laser

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.680 
right and is that some kind of a laser
optics<00:03:50.720> tracking<00:03:52.459> technology<00:03:53.459> do<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.450> think

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
optics tracking technology do you think

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.440 
optics tracking technology do you think
yes<00:03:55.320> that's<00:03:55.650> where<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.100> adaptive<00:03:56.760> optics

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
yes that's where the adaptive optics

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.199 
yes that's where the adaptive optics
actually<00:03:58.049> got<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.410> started<00:03:58.890> right<00:03:59.880> here<00:04:00.150> at

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
actually got it started right here at

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.060 
actually got it started right here at
Kirtland<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.500> they<00:04:02.010> do<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.790> computer<00:04:04.070> analysis

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
Kirtland and they do a computer analysis

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.580 
Kirtland and they do a computer analysis
of<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.540> laser<00:04:06.540> light<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:07.110> they<00:04:07.200> shoot<00:04:07.440> up

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
of the laser light that they shoot up

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.800 
of the laser light that they shoot up
into<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.950> upper<00:04:08.160> atmosphere<00:04:08.690> measured<00:04:09.690> the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
into the upper atmosphere measured the

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.150 
into the upper atmosphere measured the
wind<00:04:09.989> turbulence<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.739> everything<00:04:11.010> and

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
wind turbulence and everything and

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.500 
wind turbulence and everything and
that's<00:04:11.220> how<00:04:11.400> they<00:04:11.610> can<00:04:11.670> correct<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.329> get<00:04:12.480> a

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
that's how they can correct it to get a

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.560 
that's how they can correct it to get a
much<00:04:12.720> sharper<00:04:12.959> image<00:04:13.730> rumor<00:04:14.730> has<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.090> they<00:04:15.420> can

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
much sharper image rumor has it they can

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.599 
much sharper image rumor has it they can
get<00:04:15.690> pictures<00:04:15.930> from<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.440> location<00:04:16.859> here<00:04:17.430> as

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
get pictures from this location here as

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.690 
get pictures from this location here as
good<00:04:18.479> ass<00:04:18.660> if<00:04:19.229> not<00:04:19.560> better<00:04:19.890> than<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.370> Hubble

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
good ass if not better than the Hubble

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.790 
good ass if not better than the Hubble
Space<00:04:20.729> Telescope<00:04:21.049> that's<00:04:22.049> all<00:04:22.410> right<00:04:22.650> no

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
Space Telescope that's all right no

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.480 
Space Telescope that's all right no
that's<00:04:23.039> that's<00:04:23.430> yeah<00:04:24.360> quite<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.720> stretch

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
that's that's yeah quite a stretch

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.790 
that's that's yeah quite a stretch
all<00:04:27.490> right<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.690> have<00:04:29.050> another<00:04:29.350> question

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
all right and I have another question

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.090 
all right and I have another question
about<00:04:29.920> the<00:04:30.130> loveless<00:04:31.740> some<00:04:32.740> kind<00:04:32.920> of<00:04:32.980> a

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
about the loveless some kind of a

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.590 
about the loveless some kind of a
biological<00:04:34.380> experimental<00:04:35.610> facility<00:04:36.610> I<00:04:36.970> it's

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
biological experimental facility I it's

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.230 
biological experimental facility I it's
my<00:04:37.720> understanding<00:04:37.930> yet<00:04:38.710> they<00:04:38.950> were<00:04:39.240> testing

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
my understanding yet they were testing

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.780 
my understanding yet they were testing
what<00:04:40.780> kind<00:04:41.050> of<00:04:41.110> chemicals<00:04:41.650> are<00:04:42.010> susceptible

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
what kind of chemicals are susceptible

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.350 
what kind of chemicals are susceptible
to<00:04:43.150> like<00:04:43.510> animals<00:04:44.140> and<00:04:44.380> so<00:04:44.530> on<00:04:44.820> is<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:46.060> right

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
to like animals and so on is that right

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.570 
to like animals and so on is that right
that's<00:04:46.870> correct<00:04:47.080> that's<00:04:47.770> what<00:04:48.010> I've<00:04:48.160> heard<00:04:48.370> in

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
that's correct that's what I've heard in

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.260 
that's correct that's what I've heard in
the<00:04:48.610> past<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.860> chimpanzees<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.580> guess

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
the past the chimpanzees and I guess

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.640 
the past the chimpanzees and I guess
other<00:04:52.480> animals<00:04:52.960> that<00:04:53.020> they've<00:04:53.230> done<00:04:53.410> some

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
other animals that they've done some

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.180 
other animals that they've done some
testing<00:04:54.070> without<00:04:54.250> they're<00:04:54.730> kind<00:04:55.330> of<00:04:55.390> unknown

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
testing without they're kind of unknown

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.550 
testing without they're kind of unknown
but<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.670> got<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:57.910> stop<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.300> realize<00:04:58.450> oh<00:04:59.110> man

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
but you got to stop and realize oh man

but you got to stop and realize oh man
Lovelace<00:05:00.040> himself<00:05:00.550> was<00:05:00.940> very<00:05:01.570> much<00:05:01.720> into

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
Lovelace himself was very much into

Lovelace himself was very much into
aviation<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.750> respirators<00:05:04.750> he's<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.170> one

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
aviation and respirators he's the one

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.050 
aviation and respirators he's the one
that<00:05:05.350> designed<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:06.160> respirators<00:05:06.730> for<00:05:06.970> the

this<00:05:13.270> area<00:05:13.510> that<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.810> see<00:05:13.960> is<00:05:14.890> where<00:05:15.250> all<00:05:15.400> of

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
this area that you see is where all of

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.400 
this area that you see is where all of
that<00:05:15.730> was<00:05:15.910> actually<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:19.060> lot<00:05:19.720> of<00:05:19.870> science<00:05:20.230> out

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
that was actually a lot of science out

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.710 
that was actually a lot of science out
here<00:05:20.740> a<00:05:21.130> lot<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.730> science<00:05:22.030> with<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.270> Sandia

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
here a lot of science with the Sandia

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.750 
here a lot of science with the Sandia
laboratories<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:24.070> they're<00:05:24.310> still<00:05:24.610> doing

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
laboratories and they're still doing

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.370 
laboratories and they're still doing
more<00:05:25.120> stuff<00:05:25.560> even<00:05:26.560> with<00:05:26.710> Mars

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
more stuff even with Mars

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.560 
more stuff even with Mars
you<00:05:29.380> know<00:05:29.700> object<00:05:30.700> that<00:05:30.790> they<00:05:30.970> sent<00:05:31.270> out<00:05:31.330> there

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
you know object that they sent out there

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.150 
you know object that they sent out there
that<00:05:31.750> bounced<00:05:32.230> in<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.500> balloons<00:05:32.830> and<00:05:33.070> all

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
that bounced in the balloons and all

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.490 
that bounced in the balloons and all
that<00:05:33.340> all<00:05:34.060> that<00:05:34.090> was<00:05:34.420> tested<00:05:34.870> out<00:05:35.020> here<00:05:35.350> in

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
that all that was tested out here in

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.430 
that all that was tested out here in
this<00:05:36.030> you<00:05:37.030> know<00:05:37.290> mountain<00:05:38.290> range<00:05:38.560> here<00:05:39.420> so

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
this you know mountain range here so

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.720 
this you know mountain range here so
fascinating<00:05:41.440> fascinating<00:05:41.680> and<00:05:42.280> you<00:05:42.610> know

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
fascinating fascinating and you know

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.850 
fascinating fascinating and you know
we're<00:05:43.480> now<00:05:43.750> looking<00:05:44.020> at<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.560> actual<00:05:44.980> Manzano

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
we're now looking at the actual Manzano

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.590 
we're now looking at the actual Manzano
mountain<00:05:47.860> or<00:05:48.070> Manzano<00:05:48.640> yield<00:05:49.000> if<00:05:49.270> you<00:05:49.390> will

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
mountain or Manzano yield if you will

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.290 
mountain or Manzano yield if you will
and<00:05:49.900> I<00:05:50.080> it's<00:05:50.260> my<00:05:50.320> understanding<00:05:50.590> that<00:05:51.300> they

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
and I it's my understanding that they

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.810 
and I it's my understanding that they
started<00:05:52.840> construction<00:05:53.080> in<00:05:53.670> 1947<00:05:54.670> and

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
started construction in 1947 and

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.540 
started construction in 1947 and
actually<00:05:55.360> the<00:05:56.290> bottom<00:05:56.500> one-third<00:05:57.250> of<00:05:57.490> that

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
actually the bottom one-third of that

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.290 
actually the bottom one-third of that
Hill<00:05:58.210> is<00:05:58.510> the<00:05:59.290> hollowed-out<00:05:59.740> is<00:06:00.730> that<00:06:01.060> true

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
Hill is the hollowed-out is that true

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.430 
Hill is the hollowed-out is that true
that's<00:06:01.660> correct<00:06:02.020> I<00:06:02.320> see<00:06:02.860> and<00:06:04.200> there's<00:06:05.200> not

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
that's correct I see and there's not

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.920 
that's correct I see and there's not
much<00:06:05.680> in<00:06:05.950> there<00:06:05.980> now<00:06:06.310> it's<00:06:06.610> more<00:06:06.850> storage<00:06:07.510> just

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
much in there now it's more storage just

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.760 
much in there now it's more storage just
junk<00:06:08.380> but<00:06:09.720> from<00:06:10.720> what<00:06:10.900> I've<00:06:11.050> been<00:06:11.200> told<00:06:11.470> but

junk but from what I've been told but

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.350 
junk but from what I've been told but
yeah<00:06:12.190> that<00:06:12.370> whole<00:06:12.550> mountain<00:06:13.020> area<00:06:14.020> there's<00:06:15.360> a

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
yeah that whole mountain area there's a

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.100 
yeah that whole mountain area there's a
hole<00:06:16.900> inside<00:06:17.110> even<00:06:17.770> today<00:06:18.070> you<00:06:18.130> can<00:06:18.640> see<00:06:19.110> some

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
hole inside even today you can see some

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.520 
hole inside even today you can see some
kind<00:06:20.290> of<00:06:20.470> a<00:06:20.850> bunker<00:06:21.850> opening<00:06:22.540> yes<00:06:23.140> at<00:06:23.380> the

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
kind of a bunker opening yes at the

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.070 
kind of a bunker opening yes at the
foothills<00:06:24.010> of<00:06:24.190> that<00:06:24.430> Manzano<00:06:25.270> Hill<00:06:25.810> or

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
foothills of that Manzano Hill or

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.470 
foothills of that Manzano Hill or
actually<00:06:26.800> yeah<00:06:27.130> Manzano<00:06:27.550> mountain<00:06:28.060> actually

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
actually yeah Manzano mountain actually

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.500 
actually yeah Manzano mountain actually
that<00:06:28.770> that<00:06:29.770> Hill<00:06:30.040> is<00:06:30.280> actually<00:06:30.880> the<00:06:31.030> beginning

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
that that Hill is actually the beginning

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.010 
that that Hill is actually the beginning
of<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:31.960> whole<00:06:32.580> Manzano<00:06:33.690> mountain<00:06:34.690> range<00:06:34.930> that

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
of the whole Manzano mountain range that

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.590 
of the whole Manzano mountain range that
starts<00:06:35.590> from<00:06:35.680> over<00:06:35.980> there<00:06:36.220> going<00:06:36.490> south

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
starts from over there going south

towards Los Lunas and Belen area so

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:50.310 
towards Los Lunas and Belen area so
we're<00:06:44.950> really<00:06:45.310> at<00:06:46.120> a<00:06:46.169> very<00:06:48.180> great<00:06:49.180> location<00:06:50.080> to

here<00:07:14.410> is<00:07:15.010> where<00:07:15.340> the<00:07:15.490> base<00:07:15.669> is<00:07:15.880> actually

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
here is where the base is actually

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.140 
here is where the base is actually
located<00:07:16.389> so<00:07:16.990> that's<00:07:17.200> what<00:07:17.380> they<00:07:17.470> have<00:07:17.590> the
