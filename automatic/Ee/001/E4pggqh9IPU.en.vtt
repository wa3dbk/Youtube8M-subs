00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.730
 different painting point we say illusory 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.820
 on how to make a minecraft style tg 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 then this video will upload it while 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.990
 I am on vacation so if you will make some 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.360
 questions and you will see that I do not answer 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.489
 wait a little because precisely 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.090
 holidays I can't answer 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.120
 questions 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.350
 if I don't have wifi anyway 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.910
 ok of advice to make a good rig 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 because I will share this video in two 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.039
 share that part with the rigo rider 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.730
 obviously that of cinema 4d the shopping bag 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.230
 instead at the end and then they don't find 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.260
 in fact I will show you the part 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.870
 photoshop anyway then for really a 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.480
 good rig with beautiful light done well 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.220
 and I advise you to download lightroom from 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.580
 dead car that you can safely 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.950
 download for free from its channel 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.380
 out of six, which is free anyway 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.150
 then I like roller r4r 14 closed 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.450
 dc remo 4 is back in could also 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.119
 in the 15 however r4r 15 are the best 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.880
 r15 but I recommend it 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:32.369
 if you have a 4d r15 cinema version 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.420
 r16 ok those fmr 4.0 not a 14 I don't know 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.229
 what I said there are also o 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.290
 ok anyway that flame 4.0 indeed 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.869
 we will work on our bg 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.350
 then let's go to click on a software 4 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.090
 bike spend we take inspiration yes 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.549
 stop here we find here on crap ai 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.340
 first three dots and let's get selected 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.130
 our skin that points to the skin that 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.719
 we want to put one of those ha now 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.140
 asked with putting the second layer 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.630
 or the flames 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.740
 the hood all this thing therefore 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.150
 be careful 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.520
 yes ok then let's cut if the chef amber 4 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.250
 let's send a little down maybe cut 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.050
 the own the eyebrow and with the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.270
 close the bullet hell we throw the 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.420
 check we study the wink then we go 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.610
 a little more down and we go here on you 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.590
 we want 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.350
 sorry for a moment about layer one 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.860
 episode of the topless that we put the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.510
 check on everyone so I put it 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.660
 above all, even on the legs, I have nothing 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.520
 but I put it for convenience on everyone 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.350
 after which to set one's sights precisely 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.970
 I call myself the flames the quoted leader 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.150
 this thing to fix the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.160
 eyes can simply go here in the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:52.140
 in the balls and tirol and so on 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:54.310
 very very simple for done ok then 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.150
 now the simpler part comes 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.340
 that of the position 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.140
 but sometimes it can be forces as it can 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.160
 be difficult we double click it 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.549
 here on face selector tang 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.140
 ok then we press the point body door 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.170
 of the ring we simply want to 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:19.090
 move maybe we come from the right kick 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.380
 so let's do things then 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.769
 school and for the dg we're going to do 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.260
 now it will be my future bg will be short 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.690
 my new bg I would say to change them 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.299
 put in place here and do something 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.519
 quite decent 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.910
 so ok now so you can also see 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:41.610
 the faces that do while and let us bg 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.610
 weight if something funny ok 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.170
 ok then we pull a little weight name when 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.020
 you lean a little to the back a little 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.260
 said a little thing not a little the c'entrino 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.260
 back come much much prettier 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.300
 so let's do this so let's go down 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.660
 we place the legs even if you don't 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:08.450
 they will see in the ring but I don't want it 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.880
 put a lot to put in place or my god 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.300
 2 cassano that one day in Cuba was 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.380
 disappeared lines ok then we always put 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.830
 four, however, let's look at the e 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.019
 poor 4.0 twiss we go on on the 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.750
 left arm and we put it 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.460
 directly a beautiful sword that me 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.960
 sincerely I would like to put it in diamond 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.910
 but this time because I always have only 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.890
 those in iron because in my opinion it is more 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.810
 nice with the iron to put in the bg 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:38.180
 but we try with which the Indian mountain 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:42.190
 ok maybe we turn the arm over what 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.190
 if we do so 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.940
 you know that with the webcam stop so why 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.490
 I want to try it will be the webcam and or who 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.730
 he asks how you can go enough 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.130
 nice ok after that we have are 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.690
 we finished the door and 4d cinema e 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.870
 It was a pretty quick thing and 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.130
 simply does not have anything that the 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.990
 brings a little faster than 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.990
 photoshop instead will be a tutorial a little 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.700
 more longish however boys now for 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.490
 save our lines we go often 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.610
 the wheel we go to save here is already 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.730
 all selected with the lightroom 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.800
 travel to all the right settings 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.890
 go here go to your walnut 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.130
 leaving you want to irrigate go 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:33.919
 here, however, I went for example 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:39.230
 written position skin we do tutorials 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:41.650
 you say ok me too and we press this here 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.690
 which record the tender to picture of over 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.960
 Perfect will get there if you have not got me 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:51.330
 the stuff in the scheme should be amazed 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.900
 put around 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.180
 five minutes is a 10 5 ways ten 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.860
 maximum minutes however you are done 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.780
 right with the whole world so we can 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.229
 even put in the 20 minutes in each 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.930
 ok case the ring I'm running out of 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.610
 render we will cut cut the 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:14.219
 ports will see you later when in fact 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:16.199
 I'll finish the ring to complete ok guys 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:19.229
 perfect then works like a note 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.699
 you can see I have finished deserving 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.009
 it all took me a lot 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.500
 more than what i expected in 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:31.830
 anyway now we have the 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:36.360
 our paper we are here and do not judge 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.979
 for the background please don't and be in 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.069
 this one I'm going on holiday you'll already have 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.509
 in other words, the audio file 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:45.449
 however now I do when I see the 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:48.000
 render as happened as it comes a lot 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:53.490
 very well therefore that he had a little bit 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.229
 here where all the bg here is here 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.050
 this was precisely the result 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:00.360
 from making that then we're going to do in the 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.889
 next part a strong strike therefore 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.009
 no lives while a thumb up 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:06.599
 history was useful maybe in any case 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:11.029
 will still leave if you want, and 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:11.029
 slaves on all the open channel dances
