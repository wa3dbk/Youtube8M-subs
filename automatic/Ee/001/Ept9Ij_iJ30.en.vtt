00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.810
 I recently had a discussion with one of my best friends he assured me that 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.670
 the actions that he carries out on a daily basis do not have a significant impact on the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.419
 planet 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.709
 finally how many millions of inhabitants there are in the world 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.059
 at present 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.830
 I even implement disagreement with him so I decided to move on from the discussions 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.910
 to the facts the nearest computer arrives and we calculate his footprint 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.859
 ecological 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.909
 and the truth I left surprised 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.579
 but what is the ecological footprint the ecological footprint is a measure that we 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:31.259
 He says 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.440
 how many acres would you taco how many planet would it take to maintain your style 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.089
 of life if all the inhabitants of the planet will act in the same way 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:40.540
 the one that you do it 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.650
 this is based on maybe already thought but 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.880
 we as a civilization only know this planet as a planet 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.080
 habitable 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.150
 now if we divide the surface of the planet that can be harnessed by 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.910
 humans that is a quarter 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.340
 among the total inhabitants of the same 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.480
 only we touch 1 point 7 hectares per inhabitant, that is to say in 1 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.910
 7 hectares points 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.070
 is where all the articles that we use daily are produced 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.400
 and where all the waste we generate is deposited 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.710
 now that you happen to occupy more than this 1 points 7 hectares 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.380
 that we are using the resources of inhabitants from other parts of the planet or 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.380
 that we are using the resources of future generations 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.270
 him but in reality this situation of that moms coaste the 1 points etec 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.310
 pÃ©rez is something very common for example the average of an American are 10 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.200
 hectares the vital ecological average footprint are of 3 points 5 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.230
 hectares and in contrast 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.760
 the average that an inhabitant uses from the Bangladeshi these average sentences 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.550
 hectare 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.550
 Now if you want to calculate what your ecological footprint is, it's very easy to enter 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.410
 to the search engine of your preference write ecological footprint 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.800
 you are going to enter a program where a series of questions are asked and 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.280
 final they will tell you 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.060
 how many hectares are you occupying how many planet are you needed to 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.530
 maintain your lifestyle 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.800
 and remember we only have one planet 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.350
 already he was wanted gasca coeditor of social responsibility in the economist 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.040
 until next time
