and pour it right on to the weeds and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.049 
and pour it right on to the weeds and
it'll<00:00:34.170> kill<00:00:34.380> them<00:00:34.559> instantly<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.969> don't

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
it'll kill them instantly but you don't

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.400 
it'll kill them instantly but you don't
want<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.690> flowerbeds<00:00:37.260> if

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
you've got lots of flowers with it so

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.020 
you've got lots of flowers with it so
you<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.780> actually<00:00:39.989> pull<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.739> weeds<00:00:40.920> up<00:00:41.219> but

you can actually pull the weeds up but
what<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> found<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> wintertime<00:00:43.290> when

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
what I found in the wintertime when

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.950 
what I found in the wintertime when
everything's<00:00:44.309> died<00:00:44.550> back<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.510> put<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
everything's died back I just put a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.319 
everything's died back I just put a
layer<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> compost<00:00:47.010> or<00:00:47.280> potting<00:00:47.309> soil<00:00:48.059> or

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
layer of compost or potting soil or

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.020 
layer of compost or potting soil or
mulch<00:00:48.719> over<00:00:49.160> everything<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.430> flowerbeds

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
mulch over everything on my flowerbeds

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.869 
mulch over everything on my flowerbeds
and<00:00:51.329> everything<00:00:52.260> pretty<00:00:52.469> much<00:00:52.559> dies<00:00:52.949> down<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
and everything pretty much dies down and

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.580 
and everything pretty much dies down and
it's<00:00:54.000> not<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.420> problem<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> would<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.440> if

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it's not the problem that it would be if

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.459 
it's not the problem that it would be if
I<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.890> leave<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.340> go<00:00:56.579> wild<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.930> use<00:00:58.109> corn

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
I just leave it go wild you can use corn

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.069 
I just leave it go wild you can use corn
gluten<00:00:58.680> meal<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.370> well<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.180> will<00:01:00.390> die

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
gluten meal as well and that will die

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.410 
gluten meal as well and that will die
down<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.800> kill<00:01:02.010> all<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> weeds<00:01:02.579> as<00:01:02.820> well<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
down and kill all the weeds as well and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.230 
down and kill all the weeds as well and
another<00:01:04.199> easy<00:01:04.530> trick<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.729> kill<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
another easy trick is to just kill the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.260 
another easy trick is to just kill the
plants<00:01:06.750> manually<00:01:07.650> using<00:01:07.950> bleach<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
plants manually using bleach just a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.539 
plants manually using bleach just a
little<00:01:09.570> drop<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.810> bleach<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.740> water<00:01:11.430> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
little drop of bleach you can water it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.609 
little drop of bleach you can water it
down<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.210> well<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.750> put<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.500> of

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
down as well just put in a little bit of

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.219 
down as well just put in a little bit of
bleach<00:01:13.860> at<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.520> center<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.270> every<00:01:15.570> plant<00:01:15.840> will

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
bleach at the center of every plant will

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.039 
bleach at the center of every plant will
kill<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.680> real<00:01:16.890> well<00:01:17.270> vinegar<00:01:18.270> works<00:01:18.630> really

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
kill it real well vinegar works really

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.190 
kill it real well vinegar works really
well<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.590> also<00:01:20.430> too<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.630> kill<00:01:21.900> most

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
well is also too and it will kill most

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.890 
well is also too and it will kill most
weeds<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.700> only<00:01:23.909> want<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.330> use<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> little

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
weeds but you only want to use a little

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080 
weeds but you only want to use a little
bit<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> base<00:01:25.680> because<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.729> into

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
bit at the base because it can get into

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.210 
bit at the base because it can get into
the<00:01:27.330> waterways<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.680> don't<00:01:28.860> want<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> do

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the waterways and you don't want to do

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.340

that either if you've got weeds in your
lawn<00:01:31.590> don't<00:01:32.549> try<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> kill<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> weeds<00:01:33.950> reseed

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950

reseed<00:01:42.750> heavily<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.520> grow<00:01:44.820> in

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
reseed heavily and then it will grow in

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.960 
reseed heavily and then it will grow in
and<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.869> weeds<00:01:46.259> will<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.530> pushed<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:47.070> because

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and the weeds will be pushed out because

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.160 
and the weeds will be pushed out because
when<00:01:48.149> you're<00:01:48.270> killing<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> weeds<00:01:48.930> are

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
when you're killing the weeds are

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.950 
when you're killing the weeds are
leaving<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> blank<00:01:49.770> spot<00:01:50.189> why<00:01:50.909> not<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.390> recede

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
leaving a blank spot why not just recede

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
leaving a blank spot why not just recede
and<00:01:52.229> then<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.560> way<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.829> will<00:01:52.890> fill<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.340> really

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and then that way it will fill in really

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.789 
and then that way it will fill in really
healthy<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.299> when<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.110> flower<00:01:55.439> beds

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
healthy and when you have flower beds

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.859 
healthy and when you have flower beds
full<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.280> weeds<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.850> either<00:01:57.030> manually<00:01:57.659> pull

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
full of weeds you either manually pull

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.289 
full of weeds you either manually pull
them<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.170> or<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:59.219> put<00:01:59.399> compost<00:01:59.700> on<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
them out or I just put compost on the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.999 
them out or I just put compost on the
areas<00:02:00.689> where<00:02:00.869> they're<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.350> thick<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
areas where they're really thick and

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.850 
areas where they're really thick and
then<00:02:02.610> plant<00:02:03.000> plants<00:02:03.540> over<00:02:03.869> them<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.680> lot<00:02:04.710> of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
then plant plants over them and a lot of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.130 
then plant plants over them and a lot of
times<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.460> by<00:02:05.610> filling<00:02:05.670> your<00:02:06.240> flowerbeds<00:02:06.869> up

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
times just by filling your flowerbeds up

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.809 
times just by filling your flowerbeds up
with<00:02:07.409> beautiful<00:02:07.860> perennials<00:02:08.489> where<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
with beautiful perennials where the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.420 
with beautiful perennials where the
weeds<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.259> dig<00:02:10.500> out<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.950> weeds<00:02:11.129> as

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
weeds are you will dig out the weeds as

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.160 
weeds are you will dig out the weeds as
you<00:02:11.610> plant<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> perennials<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.810> they<00:02:12.959> won't

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
you plant the perennials and they won't

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.400 
you plant the perennials and they won't
be

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
be

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.010 
be
near<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.710> problem<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:14.880> by<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.150> keeping<00:02:15.540> up

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
near the problem so by just keeping up

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.080 
near the problem so by just keeping up
with<00:02:16.410> your<00:02:16.440> weeds<00:02:16.860> here<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.610> there<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
with your weeds here and there and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.330 
with your weeds here and there and
throughout<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> year<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.740> will<00:02:19.890> find<00:02:20.160> they

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
throughout the year you will find they

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.890 
throughout the year you will find they
won't<00:02:20.550> be<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.790> problem<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.540> don't<00:02:21.720> need

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
won't be the problem and you don't need

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.600 
won't be the problem and you don't need
to<00:02:22.110> mess<00:02:22.290> with<00:02:22.470> chemicals<00:02:23.040> because<00:02:23.280> they

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
to mess with chemicals because they

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.490 
to mess with chemicals because they
don't<00:02:23.820> do<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.090> environment<00:02:24.660> any<00:02:24.900> good<00:02:25.260> and

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
don't do the environment any good and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.440 
don't do the environment any good and
most<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> time<00:02:26.460> they<00:02:26.790> don't<00:02:26.970> really<00:02:27.150> solve

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
most of the time they don't really solve

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.050 
most of the time they don't really solve
the<00:02:27.630> problem
