00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:15.860
 jo people what about a video about 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.079
 my training plan 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.320
 because in the last video as I said off 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:23.779
 150 likes I'll put you mine 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.820
 Current training plan before it was 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.869
 Somehow 200 so I know right 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.469
 cool is already a few days ago 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.710
 the last video yes I had a lot around 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.440
 the ears so easy i had a lot 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.030
 I also do not work that way 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.829
 so the kind somehow every day 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.749
 a video from hasselt then stop the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.370
 he simply suffers quality because of me 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:51.409
 could also somehow 100,000 videos 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.850
 about creatine just do it with it everyone 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.809
 day a video of me but have the type 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.309
 I am not 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.530
 that's why it can be that 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.219
 just a two weeks can even 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:08.000
 no video but well now here 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:09.590
 the training plan yes there is the video 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.540
 I 'm relatively short because it gives 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.690
 not so much to say so at the moment 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.400
 I make light of this bros I hold 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.990
 none of these push pull trend me 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.300
 I did not try it that way 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.700
 baptized because I'm just totally crazy 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.420
 So I have to take over in each one 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.580
 workout completely disengage myself and myself 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.290
 really destroy because then I feel 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.090
 thats good for me this is my training goal and 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.460
 I'm just fine that I am 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.200
 every muscle only once a week primary 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.730
 So you can not train now 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.730
 say I train every muscle once 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.770
 the week because, for example, the third training 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.250
 the biceps has also been there with the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.380
 not now primarily so he trained 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.660
 Division at the moment is so monday 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.710
 of course, really big 1 moderate guests 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.250
 So monday breast and belly tuesday 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.250
 legs 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:10.420
 wednesday shoulders and belly thursday 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.800
 poor and thus there somewhere to park the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.530
 wait with purely mostly at the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.890
 poor and Friday is then the move 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.040
 and belly is back on saturday sunday 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.660
 break, and then move I make often 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.090
 still neck so rough now 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.739
 division 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.019
 how it looks now in the workout so 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.640
 I'm really intuitive about that 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.730
 did so a few rules in the example 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.440
 Chester that I always bank with flat 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.090
 or start at an angle and there too 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.209
 the first exercise really hard so 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.860
 usually five times five system that is good 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.590
 I think so well, so I create mine 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.440
 plans to the people who want to have that 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.090
 So it's always a bit of power 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.440
 airy combined with bodybuilding and 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.540
 During the exercises I look that I am there 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.720
 really getting stronger and after that 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.329
 it is then always purely for feeling clear 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.269
 Bank then often comes across bank 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.459
 then still flying and cable to and 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.100
 but I really do feel for the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.049
 I pump then just as I like 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.340
 I've always got points 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.489
 to muscle failure 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.950
 this is not a recommendation now 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.130
 But you guys have so with me 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.670
 I guarantee a maximum appeal 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.290
 and I can say so many too 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.400
 triumph as muscle failure even go 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.290
 not muscle failure but 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.959
 he breaks his head first than she does 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.340
 they really can not think anymore 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.840
 muscle will fail if I really do 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.560
 craft is now when it 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.760
 just does not go up 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.190
 you must of course there will always on 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.079
 you hear yes because I do not know if 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.730
 But she gives training if he does 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.510
 then you are just too exhausted with the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.799
 Time 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.560
 It may be that I just do the 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.159
 week break breaks in very much 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.790
 is intense if you have any 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.930
 training session really like that 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:09.730
 limit is yes thereby I start 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:11.950
 naturally with squats at 5 x 54 x 87 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.739
 x 3 So I just feel 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:19.500
 what on what I hold degrees bock hab 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:21.940
 So it's really always on the limit 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.100
 yes after the squats come then 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.870
 usually other different types 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.430
 from squats so then very close with 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.620
 a stand stood wider 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.699
 squats so at least eight sets 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.580
 Squats because I have none 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.820
 leg press in a fitness room over there 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.930
 so yes so and then then 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.860
 failure steps railway line two 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.970
 The Romanian cross also differs 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.320
 I'm on it 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.330
 there you have to look which one 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.490
 exercises for you are best at 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.490
 the next day i have muscle ache 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.050
 then shoulder on wednesday 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.389
 the next basic exercises though overhead 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.620
 press so I push over the head 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.700
 also mostly with it 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.510
 in 5 months after system then you are 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.450
 lift front lift rear shoulder 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.540
 Just vary I 've been there already 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.100
 My specifications but not always 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.290
 fix so that also changes from week 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.030
 every now and then a bit 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.760
 to bring in something new 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.410
 then thursday in training that is 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.090
 actually really intuitive to do that 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.620
 I like me once I start 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.600
 with dumbbells at once really with 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.139
 Dumbbell once I do very hard 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.780
 biceps then I do antagonist style 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.229
 so always in exchange biceps triceps that 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.300
 is really intuitive friday 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.610
 press of course I start ticking with it 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.110
 sometimes but I also do so 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.700
 I that it may also be that I always 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.380
 making crosses every two weeks 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.820
 because if I'm having a difficult week now 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.260
 then it is often like this 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.110
 that on friday i still have a muscle hangover 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.290
 a leg has that I just no 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.130
 can do cross lifting or not 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.110
 want to do 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.940
 it is also because I just like that 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:08.150
 sack am so it looks then 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.300
 all oars pull things wide la 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:15.110
 pull in the country dumbbells row there 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.900
 I was just like that the whole thing 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.430
 Do not you see it already exists 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.560
 no fixed specifications with me 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.680
 I train for feelings and that 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.169
 works i have to be spa are training 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.120
 I have to have muscle on the day too 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.600
 So the next day came that's the way it is 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.130
 a little muscle is no guarantee now 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.380
 you do not have to have a good training 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.979
 Muscular hangover must have the card of your own 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.979
 hyperacidity of the muscle but me 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.690
 Personally, then I know that that is me 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.880
 a good only good sorger that i have the 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.340
 have met with the muscle 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.680
 aching 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.210
 yes that's my training style 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.289
 there is much to feel you have to 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.880
 really take care or just after 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.669
 feel how are you feeling you are 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.120
 yours is already too much broken 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:10.810
 Training performance down 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:13.479
 yes , that's why it works for me 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.680
 yes as I said the fun is in the fun 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.080
 training is my top priority 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.410
 and so i feel good in the training 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.520
 with this system and yes you can 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.620
 my comments write like you 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.139
 I am training now I am saying now 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.070
 Do not push pull legs is shit or 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:33.280
 just write it in the 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:35.410
 comments that interests me and that 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.120
 was now actually already as 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.710
 next video I do not know when that 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.250
 next video comes no idea of ​​this 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:49.570
 system tutorial video is synonymous 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:50.889
 not yet that makes yes and in this 

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.740
 There is no more sense to say 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:55.780
 I'm a bit sleepy 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.789
 a little update so what the now 

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.740
 next week with me is doing 

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:02.970
 Maybe everything else is coming in 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.990
 next video gives the thumbs up and 

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.479
 then see what the next video 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.479
 modest 

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:09.479
 rank
