00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
come on in the oven you can have like

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.060 
come on in the oven you can have like
two<00:01:46.460> rows<00:01:46.730> think<00:01:47.600> they<00:01:48.290> have<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.470> few<00:01:48.830> different

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
two rows think they have a few different

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.250 
two rows think they have a few different
kinds<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.550> how<00:01:49.940> these<00:01:50.090> permanent<00:01:50.510> stainless

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
kinds so how these permanent stainless

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.320 
kinds so how these permanent stainless
steel<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:52.460> then<00:01:52.580> they<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.000> ones<00:01:53.180> that

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
steel and then they have the ones that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.360 
steel and then they have the ones that
you<00:01:53.420> can<00:01:53.540> put<00:01:53.690> together<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.830> comes<00:01:55.010> apart

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
you can put together so it comes apart

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.670 
you can put together so it comes apart
like<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:55.730> kind<00:01:56.720> of<00:01:56.780> like<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:57.020> old<00:01:57.140> ice<00:01:57.320> cream

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
like this kind of like the old ice cream

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.130 
like this kind of like the old ice cream
yeah<00:01:58.159> ice<00:01:58.340> cube<00:01:58.700> trays<00:01:58.970> from<00:01:59.659> way<00:01:59.870> back<00:02:00.080> when

yeah ice cube trays from way back when

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.450 
yeah ice cube trays from way back when
so<00:02:01.300> this<00:02:02.300> I<00:02:02.600> kind<00:02:03.110> of<00:02:03.170> like<00:02:03.350> these<00:02:03.590> for<00:02:04.370> the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
so this I kind of like these for the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.460 
so this I kind of like these for the
fact<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.600> can<00:02:05.750> just<00:02:05.930> take<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:06.080> apart

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
fact that you can just take it apart

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.879 
fact that you can just take it apart
it's<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:06.979> thin<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:08.030> can<00:02:08.149> put<00:02:08.329> it<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:08.539> your

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:08.889 
it's that thin you can put it in your

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.410 
it's that thin you can put it in your
cutlery<00:02:09.889> area<00:02:10.579> with<00:02:10.819> your<00:02:10.909> knives<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.209> forks

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
cutlery area with your knives and forks

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
cutlery area with your knives and forks
are

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
are

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.540 
are
but<00:02:12.680> once<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:12.890> put<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.130> together<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.520> looks

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
but once you put it together it looks

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.820 
but once you put it together it looks
like<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.930> these<00:02:15.170> are<00:02:15.320> kind<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.530> good<00:02:15.710> if

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
like that so these are kind of good if

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.900 
like that so these are kind of good if
you<00:02:15.920> don't<00:02:16.070> have<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.220> whole<00:02:16.340> lot<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.550> space<00:02:16.760> in

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
you don't have a whole lot of space in

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.310 
you don't have a whole lot of space in
the<00:02:16.970> kitchen<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.330> store<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.930> permanent

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
the kitchen to store the the permanent

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.250 
the kitchen to store the the permanent
ones<00:02:18.830> but<00:02:19.550> once<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.910> have<00:02:20.090> them<00:02:20.300> on<00:02:20.480> your<00:02:20.840> tray

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
ones but once you have them on your tray

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.470 
ones but once you have them on your tray
you<00:02:21.710> can<00:02:21.830> do<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:21.950> lot<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.190> twelve<00:02:22.640> obviously
