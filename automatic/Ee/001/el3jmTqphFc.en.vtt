00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Now our animal is whisperier again 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.779
 use this time is poor by laurent 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.370
 Bad Tatzmannsdorf in Burgenland 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.920
 there is after bieber the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.599
 biggest lipizzaner breeds of austria and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.490
 There is a young boy there 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.930
 stallion he has no relation to humans 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.250
 because he grew up on an alm 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.810
 actually he is under ideal 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.119
 conditions have grown up 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.119
 The seven year old Lipizzaner stallion 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.429
 Siegler like Europe he was allowed to live in an appropriate way 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.510
 in complete freedom with other horses 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.940
 grow up 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.600
 but that was probably his 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.969
 problem 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.989
 nobody knows what's up there on the alm 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.660
 happened to him 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:46.950
 We got him from Poland then many 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.969
 years has built up with people too 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.050
 not that he had to work now 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.969
 our problem i have now from 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.430
 I have been going on for one and a half years 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.170
 what he got in sittard now 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.640
 people even started to let themselves go 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.369
 stop no woman riding on the stallion 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.070
 It has not been possible so far 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.549
 put on the halter that should be today 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.549
 to change 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.880
 always uses what he really only on 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.880
 distance 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.760
 At first laura tries to be alone 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.860
 to contact the stallion 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.479
 The best way is to use the feed 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.360
 ziegler is as bribery as europe 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:45.130
 and that's good for training every time 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.830
 before I give him a feed 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.479
 closed noise also for example 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.720
 is not so good at guessing 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.790
 the snapping surely but so 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.100
 bussi give that the beginning also learns 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.270
 to pay attention to command 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.890
 that you do not follow the horse 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.550
 must change and attention too 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.350
 to get 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.470
 and really this noise is coming 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.560
 After that practice a reward after a short time 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.780
 makes Laura already a break of the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.790
 stallion should have the chance man 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.940
 and of course the food too 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:21.370
 miss 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:25.590
 So the building evacuate the horse also 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.590
 not staring at Earth's floor 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.740
 That's up to you if you like that a lot 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.540
 actively come to us as soon as the distant 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.120
 comes a little bit then they hold the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.270
 Reward already be said out 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.680
 Deeply probably used to escape 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.980
 he has to come now the experience 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.500
 can also come to us as the two 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.080
 to come back with the halter turns 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:56.370
 The Lipizzan stallion, however, again from 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:58.830
 the man from his youth or as 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.720
 foal on the meadow was a trauma 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.340
 I had almost haltered with that 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.410
 sure he's hanging out with the yard 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.080
 remained not out while under 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.090
 panic had hitherto just pulled 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.070
 and then it started happening so it has to be with him 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.920
 It's been a long time since you were here 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.450
 he realizes that he reacts instinctively 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.310
 or really as soon as you try 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.900
 to give in the second gets the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.900
 fear and the second disappears 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.570
 The three of them are afraid again 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.570
 The stallion does not have to leave his 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.780
 pattern constantly turning away 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.630
 come out 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.180
 he could do that best in the riding hall 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.620
 but he has to do that first 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.070
 halter 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.990
 a thing of impossibility therefore calls 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.630
 michaela bienert the nurse of 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.160
 stallions his confidant 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.500
 the hans thoma was really a very 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.930
 strong caregiver with whom everything goes 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.070
 you trust the consumer 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.480
 100% trust and the 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.570
 Poor people are always a bit 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.760
 suspect was the stuthe they are rather 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.890
 Access is to each of the four lights 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.960
 but to make it important for everyone 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.370
 this caregiver has always had this 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.540
 the person is also something with him 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.150
 can work 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.709
 but of course he is in a business 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.400
 Also several people are looking after him 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.840
 To take care of 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.380
 therefore should also learn with others 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.640
 to deal with people in the riding hall 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.519
 the training with ziegler like 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.900
 across Europe he learns that way 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.630
 to turn to man 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.560
 Here he has to deal with Laura 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.060
 Turn and take without knitting 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:43.040
 the stallion makes contact with the animal 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:45.110
 whisperer move on but that 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.210
 not too far away with the edge 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.860
 Energy work with him and it 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.250
 can be a bit uncomfortable for him in the beginning 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.950
 that he is not too far away and there 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.160
 But ziegler like, stay calm 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.229
 lohr a man tries his hand 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.280
 energy of the horse to flow again 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:06.200
 to bring and so dissolve the trauma 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.630
 As a conclusion is in the box that 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.930
 halter dozens of times and again 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.590
 closed it 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.410
 especially at the end car really 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.750
 went through it perfectly and piled up 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:22.120
 down up down up down one says 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.500
 schema where the horse is concerned now 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.169
 because can also learn quickly so that it 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.650
 they are no longer responding 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.930
 of course was there are the approaches 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.870
 the elderly and especially the anita 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.960
 and bring warmth opportunities where 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.620
 he belongs to work has ziegler 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.229
 the europe 1 prefer to be gekrault 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.889
 so hopefully he will soon be the man 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.169
 can trust 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.849
 If you need help from Laurent
