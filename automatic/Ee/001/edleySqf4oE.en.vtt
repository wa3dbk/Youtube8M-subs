00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
card and my personal opinion on this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.810 
card and my personal opinion on this
game<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.460> shoot<00:01:50.700> up

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
game is that it's going to be a shoot up

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.550 
game is that it's going to be a shoot up
because<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.299> how<00:01:51.479> all<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.079> saints<00:01:52.350> games

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
because that's how all the saints games
