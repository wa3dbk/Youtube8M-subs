00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 okay people offtopic topic natali on 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.080
 begin 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.650
 female teacher yes I have a question ne 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.519
 namely the topic of strength training in children 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.500
 and adolescents 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.070
 you would actually have to be an expert 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:24.779
 for his okay wife yes well wait here 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.170
 just say please just so can 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.710
 children and adolescents strength training 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.290
 do weighting and so on 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.280
 I 'm currently doing that too 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.500
 We just have physical education 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.000
 theme of fitness and health and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.700
 Of course we do it with power exercises 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.960
 but clearly we do it for example 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.460
 land with weights on each side 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.260
 are not the mega right now 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.059
 weights I use now but we 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.879
 already have five kilos on each side 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.620
 make default steps yes and yes the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.160
 make bald biceps too 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.140
 they do it all okay but easy 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.719
 thus less weight neck or so 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.410
 dosed I always hit that 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.960
 variations in front of the three have 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.420
 possibilities in terms of weight 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700
 Light weight without weight or one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.530
 a little more difficult men take care of themselves 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.740
 Of course, always the biggest weight and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.540
 want to inform the ladies there and yes 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.520
 the girls are a bit sick 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.530
 but you have to go through it with me 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.740
 but since I am in favor of that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.450
 teenagers this 17 18 with me that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.009
 they naturally get stuck in to the weights 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.740
 that's very clear we have to be sure 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.540
 also a bit better what the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.549
 musculature also just now I see 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.700
 it with my girls in the class the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.100
 are pretty thin but there is nothing 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.860
 there is no power behind it and we are developing 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.659
 just together such a training plan where 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.750
 We run such a course in one 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.619
 certain time and that will be and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.329
 better and better 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.060
 yes, what about the younger ones? 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.000
 under 17 and I say this even quasi Sun 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.009
 in the class levels before that 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.450
 twelve-year-old 13-year-old and so because there 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.700
 It is always so yes from rock 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.619
 growth disorder I personally have yes 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.270
 my opinion that it is nonsense 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.490
 that everybody should train 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.409
 well of course dosed in but you are 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.729
 yes, as a teacher and knows each other with them 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.800
 maybe a little better 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.959
 what is your opinion on that I think 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.400
 even as you do not get it 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.349
 old out of you must stop 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.599
 Teach age-appropriate 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.670
 that does not mean because I'm 13 that 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.830
 I can not handle the weight 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.900
 not if you're in kindergarten 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.670
 got up like doing some exercises for example 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.470
 The wheelbarrow that everyone still knows 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.430
 where one on the other's feet 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.440
 so to speak firmly on the other then 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.989
 it gets cracked on the shoulder and 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.700
 it is also yes that is actually 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.560
 not so good for the shoulder I am 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.360
 rather for that and both now 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.239
 Maybe with the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.980
 kilo or half a kilo and then yes 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.980
 The exercises clean one perfectly 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.549
 itself probably 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.670
 health conscious respectively 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:03:00.060
 better in front of their joints than these 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.060
 wheelbarrow interesting point not 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.959
 for example, in kindergarten 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.310
 make a wheelbarrow 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.680
 I always remember better 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.329
 rows of people are so bent over 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.859
 does not believe in the poor 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.780
 stability had several times the 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.970
 musculature 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.290
 yes I like it when neighbors 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.819
 and so all football club and 13 14 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.950
 and of course already something 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.060
 longer underestimate much earlier 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.230
 Football club constantly injured 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.540
 constant injuries already in the young 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.889
 older 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.359
 the soccer player and then you look 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.709
 but poor of unity at tax times 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.720
 trained with his father and me 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.790
 and you look at the body tension of 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.340
 a 14 year old and is where left 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.480
 not at all comfortable body tension 00 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.650
 so really established force in Bavaria 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.209
 I think that's what I see clearly 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.090
 strength training makes sense in any case 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:58.470
 is just prophylactic and so to speak 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:00.489
 not with body tension first 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.829
 develop body awareness and it 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.989
 starts already at an early stage 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.879
 you should develop it because that 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.760
 yes the base is later for the 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:13.949
 entertainment for all other sports 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.949
 that's why with me we'll be fine 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.170
 okay that was cool then thanks for you 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.240
 I just wanted to go that way again 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.290
 Not at all, because you are very often with 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.390
 children and adolescents together 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.970
 works and if you if you do 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.920
 you see, then maybe come this way 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.630
 so maybe a few now 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.770
 people more security if the boy 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.160
 years already want to train 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.900
 today against the mixed dare you and 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.790
 try to get started easily and you 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.890
 gradually increase and you will 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.260
 realize that you are getting better and better 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.290
 are you need not have fear of 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.560
 weight it comes to you ok ok thanks 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.560
 to you
