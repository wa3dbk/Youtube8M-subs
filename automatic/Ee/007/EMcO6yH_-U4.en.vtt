because it's kind of optimized for

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.440 
because it's kind of optimized for
almost<00:03:22.250> every<00:03:22.849> Android<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:24.500> can<00:03:24.530> play<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.010> on

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
almost every Android you can play it on

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.300 
almost every Android you can play it on
almost<00:03:26.450> every<00:03:26.840> Android<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:29.299> this<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:29.900> a

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
almost every Android and this is a

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
samsung galaxy note so I think you can

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.890 
samsung galaxy note so I think you can
guess<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:37.159> should<00:03:37.489> be<00:03:37.730> nice<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.540> play<00:03:38.689> on

guess that it should be nice to play on

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:49.840 
guess that it should be nice to play on
this<00:03:39.079> big<00:03:39.349> screen

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.220 

yeah<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.740> a<00:03:51.770> little<00:03:52.160> bit<00:03:52.310> quick<00:03:52.790> look<00:03:53.230> on

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
yeah that is a little bit quick look on

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.120 
yeah that is a little bit quick look on
these<00:03:54.560> games<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:58.340> yeah<00:03:58.520> see
