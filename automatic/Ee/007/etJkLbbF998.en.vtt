00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.280 
can see this is one of the team basis
rather<00:00:38.760> massive<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.629> vertically<00:00:40.020> built

although you can only access the lower
floors<00:00:41.940> other<00:00:42.510> two<00:00:42.719> team<00:00:42.960> bases<00:00:43.320> are

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
floors other two team bases are

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.200 
floors other two team bases are
color-coded<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> really<00:00:44.520> give<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:44.940> an<00:00:45.090> ease

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
and they are symmetrical so those are

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
and they are symmetrical so those are
the<00:00:48.690> only<00:00:48.840> symmetrical<00:00:49.440> part<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> map

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
out for that in a little bit it's just

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.030 
out for that in a little bit it's just
amazing<00:01:31.079> that's<00:01:31.470> all<00:01:31.590> I'm<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.860> tell<00:01:32.009> you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
for now anyways as you can see here this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.780 
for now anyways as you can see here this
is<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> separate<00:01:35.100> bases<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.610> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
is one of the separate bases this is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.700 
is one of the separate bases this is
purple<00:01:36.299> area<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.110> these<00:01:37.200> are<00:01:37.290> kind<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
purple area so these are kind of a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.350 
purple area so these are kind of a
neutral<00:01:38.009> basis<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> center<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.180> map

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
neutral basis in the center of the map

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
neutral basis in the center of the map
these<00:01:40.170> are<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> non-symmetrical<00:01:41.159> parts<00:01:41.400> of

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
these are the non-symmetrical parts of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.100 
these are the non-symmetrical parts of
the<00:01:41.579> map<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.780> there's<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the map so as you can see here there's a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
the map so as you can see here there's a
front<00:01:43.530> area<00:01:44.100> where<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> crates

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
front area where you have the crates

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.609 
front area where you have the crates
breaking<00:01:45.180> off<00:01:45.299> lines<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.630> sites<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.500> this

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
breaking off lines of sites and on this

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.289 
breaking off lines of sites and on this
back<00:01:46.799> platform<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.460> purple<00:01:47.759> area<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.180> will

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
back platform of purple area you will

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.670 
back platform of purple area you will
have<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> Banshee<00:01:48.930> spawn<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.350> that's<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.619> of

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
have the Banshee spawn so that's one of

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.710 
have the Banshee spawn so that's one of
the<00:01:49.770> neutral<00:01:50.130> vehicles<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the neutral vehicles and it's going to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.330 
the neutral vehicles and it's going to
be<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.020> very<00:01:52.200> back<00:01:52.439> platform<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.220> can

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
finding a mantis on its platform it's

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.620 
finding a mantis on its platform it's
got<00:02:05.520> some<00:02:05.640> great<00:02:05.790> line<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.090> sight<00:02:06.270> breakers

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
got some great line of sight breakers

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.479 
got some great line of sight breakers
and<00:02:06.810> some<00:02:06.930> good<00:02:07.020> ramp<00:02:07.380> layout<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.310> really

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
and some good ramp layout so it really

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.919 
and some good ramp layout so it really
does<00:02:08.700> give<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> kind<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.239> mixed<00:02:09.569> combat

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
does give you a kind of mixed combat

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.650 
does give you a kind of mixed combat
area<00:02:10.259> when<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.709> there<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:10.979> infantry

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
right at the beginning because they do

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.020 
right at the beginning because they do
give<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.830> slight<00:02:17.100> edge<00:02:17.310> although<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
give you a slight edge although the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.430 
give you a slight edge although the

intense<00:02:19.770> as<00:02:19.950> well<00:02:20.130> including<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.450> chain<00:02:21.780> hog<00:02:21.990> I

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
intense as well including a chain hog I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.890 
intense as well including a chain hog I
believe<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.560> rocket<00:02:23.010> hog<00:02:23.160> any<00:02:23.520> rate<00:02:23.900> perhaps

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
believe a rocket hog any rate perhaps

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.870 
believe a rocket hog any rate perhaps
amongst<00:02:25.440> others<00:02:25.740> but<00:02:25.980> uh<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:26.460> gives

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
amongst others but uh it really gives

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.700
