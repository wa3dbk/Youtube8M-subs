and we explored some avenues to be able
to<00:00:48.840> give<00:00:49.050> him<00:00:49.320> more<00:00:49.980> power<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.600> little<00:00:51.930> more

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
to give him more power and a little more

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.830 
to give him more power and a little more
Rumble<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.739> some<00:00:53.489> better<00:00:53.879> ways<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.210> utilize

Rumble and some better ways to utilize
all<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.440> power<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:56.399> started<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> project<00:00:57.000> by

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
all that power we started the project by

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.900 
all that power we started the project by
taking<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> car<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> our<00:00:58.289> local<00:00:58.469> dyno<00:00:58.770> shop<00:00:59.129> at

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
not a good way to get a tax signal so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.039 
not a good way to get a tax signal so
unfortunately<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.450> didn't<00:01:12.630> gain<00:01:12.720> torque

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
unfortunately we didn't gain torque

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.020 
unfortunately we didn't gain torque
readings<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:13.860> did<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.250> 300<00:01:14.820> horsepower

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

out of the wheel which is actually a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.810 
out of the wheel which is actually a
little<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.860> than<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.100> expected<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.610> start

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
little more than we expected to start

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.630 
little more than we expected to start
with<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.450> make<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.689> car<00:01:18.900> even<00:01:19.049> more<00:01:19.259> fun

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
with to make this car even more fun

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
supercharger headers and a better center

supercharger headers and a better center
force<00:01:22.259> clutch<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.770> because<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> all<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
force clutch in it because of all the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.649 
force clutch in it because of all the
things<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.880> were<00:01:23.970> doing<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.299> car<00:01:24.479> we

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
things we were doing with the car we

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.690 
things we were doing with the car we
thought<00:01:24.689> it'd<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:24.960> best<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.439> kind<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.310> put<00:01:26.670> some

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
thought it'd be best to kind of put some

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.060 
thought it'd be best to kind of put some
things<00:01:27.119> together<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.409> would<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.530> easiest

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
things together when it would be easiest

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.030 
things together when it would be easiest
because<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.610> processes<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.240> other<00:01:30.390> places<00:01:31.040> so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
because of processes in other places so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.980 
because of processes in other places so
we<00:01:32.130> started<00:01:32.490> by<00:01:32.579> pulling<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> intake<00:01:33.299> off<00:01:33.450> now

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
we started by pulling the intake off now

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.380 
we started by pulling the intake off now
this<00:01:34.110> car<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.380> also<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:35.430> much<00:01:35.670> about<00:01:35.939> looking

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
this car is also as much about looking

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.440 
this car is also as much about looking
good<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.470> about<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:38.040> fast<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:39.060> we

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
good as it is about going fast so we

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.690 
good as it is about going fast so we
took<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> opportunity<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:41.130> some<00:01:41.369> detail

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
took the opportunity to do some detail

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.240 
took the opportunity to do some detail
items<00:01:42.060> under<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.360> hood<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.770> main<00:01:43.979> thing

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
items under the hood and the main thing

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
items under the hood and the main thing
is<00:01:44.460> these<00:01:44.729> engines<00:01:45.149> are<00:01:45.240> all<00:01:45.360> aluminum<00:01:45.840> which

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
is these engines are all aluminum which

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.410 
is these engines are all aluminum which
looks<00:01:46.619> great<00:01:46.860> when<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> aluminum<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.610> new<00:01:47.790> but

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
looks great when the aluminum is new but

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.569 
looks great when the aluminum is new but
aluminum<00:01:48.840> tends<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> oxidize<00:01:49.619> pretty<00:01:50.310> quickly

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
aluminum tends to oxidize pretty quickly

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.050 
aluminum tends to oxidize pretty quickly
and<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.479> starts<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.229> grainy

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
and then it starts to get that grainy

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
and then it starts to get that grainy
dingy<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.390> look<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.860> aluminum

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
dingy kind of look so on aluminum

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.999

a little bit of contrast I thought would

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.770 
a little bit of contrast I thought would
be<00:02:38.430> best<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.730> do<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.000> clutch<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.510> time

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
be best to do the clutch this time

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.660 
be best to do the clutch this time
because<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.650> intake<00:02:40.920> manifold<00:02:41.310> wasn't

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
because the intake manifold wasn't

happy we didn't have any problems I

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.920 
happy we didn't have any problems I
noticed<00:05:12.520> first<00:05:12.969> of<00:05:13.150> all<00:05:13.240> that<00:05:13.509> the<00:05:13.629> center

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
noticed first of all that the center

noticed first of all that the center
force<00:05:14.169> clutch<00:05:14.469> the<00:05:14.979> pedal<00:05:15.280> effort<00:05:15.550> is<00:05:15.610> about

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
force clutch the pedal effort is about

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.850 
force clutch the pedal effort is about
the<00:05:15.969> same<00:05:16.210> but<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:16.960> grab<00:05:17.199> point<00:05:17.560> is<00:05:17.680> very

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
the same but the grab point is very

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.010 
the same but the grab point is very
different<00:05:18.279> and<00:05:18.490> it's<00:05:18.969> actually<00:05:19.779> a<00:05:19.810> little

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
different and it's actually a little

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.080 
different and it's actually a little
touching<00:05:20.229> until<00:05:20.650> it's<00:05:20.800> broken<00:05:21.190> in<00:05:21.340> trying<00:05:21.969> not

to get it to chatter the supercharger

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.909 
to get it to chatter the supercharger
was<00:05:25.270> an<00:05:25.389> immediate<00:05:25.810> difference<00:05:26.020> even<00:05:26.439> driving

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
was an immediate difference even driving

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.040 
was an immediate difference even driving
the<00:05:27.009> car<00:05:27.189> gently<00:05:27.699> during<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.240> superchargers

the car gently during the superchargers
break-in<00:05:29.439> period<00:05:29.620> you<00:05:30.009> could<00:05:30.190> tell<00:05:30.370> that

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
break-in period you could tell that

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.309 
break-in period you could tell that
there<00:05:30.699> was<00:05:30.759> a<00:05:31.090> lot<00:05:31.449> more<00:05:31.479> of<00:05:31.750> this<00:05:31.840> car<00:05:32.050> had<00:05:32.229> to

there was a lot more of this car had to

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.320 
there was a lot more of this car had to
give<00:05:32.529> we<00:05:33.039> took<00:05:33.219> it<00:05:33.370> back<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:33.639> the<00:05:33.879> chassis<00:05:34.300> dyno

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
give we took it back to the chassis dyno

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.180 
give we took it back to the chassis dyno
to<00:05:34.719> see<00:05:34.930> what<00:05:35.050> kind<00:05:35.229> of<00:05:35.319> improvement<00:05:35.860> we<00:05:35.949> made

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
to see what kind of improvement we made

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.089 
to see what kind of improvement we made
and<00:05:36.479> we<00:05:37.479> were<00:05:37.719> very<00:05:37.900> pleasantly<00:05:38.560> surprised

or so under Cruz he leaned out a little
bit<00:06:13.659> goes<00:06:13.839> into<00:06:14.020> 13s<00:06:14.650> and<00:06:14.770> you<00:06:14.919> get<00:06:15.849> it<00:06:15.969> into

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
bit goes into 13s and you get it into

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
we noticed in the upper rpm range that

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.900 
we noticed in the upper rpm range that
we<00:06:56.030> had<00:06:56.180> a<00:06:56.210> slight<00:06:56.990> dip<00:06:57.320> in<00:06:57.440> the<00:06:57.560> power<00:06:57.770> so<00:06:58.729> we

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
we had a slight dip in the power so we

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.110 
we had a slight dip in the power so we
went<00:06:59.419> back<00:06:59.509> and<00:06:59.690> reviewed<00:07:00.229> the<00:07:00.259> log<00:07:01.000> but<00:07:02.000> it

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
went back and reviewed the log but it

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.480 
went back and reviewed the log but it
appeared<00:07:02.509> based<00:07:02.840> on<00:07:03.020> rpm<00:07:03.530> and<00:07:03.830> air<00:07:03.979> flow<00:07:04.250> that

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
appeared based on rpm and air flow that

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.659 
appeared based on rpm and air flow that
we<00:07:04.610> probably<00:07:04.850> hit<00:07:05.270> the<00:07:05.479> 7<00:07:05.780> pound<00:07:06.020> boost<00:07:06.320> valve

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669 
we probably hit the 7 pound boost valve

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:08.950 
we probably hit the 7 pound boost valve
so<00:07:07.669> the<00:07:07.789> power<00:07:07.940> dropped<00:07:08.330> off<00:07:08.479> and<00:07:08.750> then<00:07:08.840> it

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
so the power dropped off and then it

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.900 
so the power dropped off and then it
continued<00:07:09.320> to<00:07:09.380> climb<00:07:09.680> after<00:07:10.100> that<00:07:10.250> after

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:10.910 
continued to climb after that after

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.909 
continued to climb after that after
knowing<00:07:11.150> the<00:07:11.210> air<00:07:11.360> fuel<00:07:11.600> curve<00:07:11.900> was<00:07:12.139> safe<00:07:12.740> to

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
knowing the air fuel curve was safe to

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.800 
knowing the air fuel curve was safe to
drive<00:07:13.160> it<00:07:13.370> on<00:07:13.940> the<00:07:14.030> way<00:07:14.120> back<00:07:14.330> from<00:07:14.479> the<00:07:14.630> diner

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
drive it on the way back from the diner

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.540 
drive it on the way back from the diner
