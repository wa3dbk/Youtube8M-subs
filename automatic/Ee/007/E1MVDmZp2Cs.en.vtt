00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
on my 400 x over there i have MX razors

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.980 
on my 400 x over there i have MX razors
that<00:01:20.580> i<00:01:20.610> want<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.970> put<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> rear<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> the
