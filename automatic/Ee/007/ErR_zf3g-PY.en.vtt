00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.800
 enjoy to the fullest 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.380
 but when we think we've found 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:20.340
 to one where is it seems that that topic 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:23.279
 of cinÃ©polis manco or if it is equal mancos 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.610

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.300
 because you are not manic because after 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 you're maimed because you feel like it and not 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.840

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.970

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.410

 they'll get dizzy if the bank stops a 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:10.859
 time because they will not leave you the same 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.470
 and why is Mr. Tormo gets angry 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:20.440
 because those banks do not reduce him 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.440
 fuck 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.750
 two 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.230
 yes 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.509
 with people and no slums they were treated 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.570
 each other as brothers but fraternity 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.799
 and everything was nice and very happy but the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.530
 world 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.530
 3 ruiz 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.060
 but although advocates everywhere 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.430
 with a bit of real water 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.849
 I killed you 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.290
 but the one remembered never because I in my 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.469
 hands 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.829
 so I give a clear example of what 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:41.890
 which is to follow the legacy in money by 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.670
 two but you still know what's going to 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.920
 happen 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.650
 leading a war 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.840
 in your house that managua you are going to 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.610
 get to your mother and your grandmother 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.920
 they were playing word tea 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.739
 vas evans takes a reputed kneecap 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.660
 if they are going to save you understand good sir 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.250
 What do you think about people? 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.620
 who are banking and complain like the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.739
 reported and the rewind and wordpress 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.900
 you are in much greater in myself I have seen 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.489
 in all my life I have worked in a 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.489
 block but without surroundings 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.190
 he has not done anything to me 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.630
 and good and this is the reason why not 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:48.290
 is doing with his latest project the 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.850
 song of and they carry watered water and like 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.800
 you see this song is a song full 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:04:00.410
 of sentimentality that talks about what 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:02.450
 what hurts the most is not right and that's what 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.459
 that more than many of these frames are 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:09.709
 Spaniards what makes me feel even more 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:12.440
 saved and even more the work that leads 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.959
 this guy because a lot of people do not know 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.079
 assess what it costs to make these videos 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.430
 and in these videos they have five minutes and 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.330
 that cost nothing even though in reality 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.190
 They have long behind and knew what 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.780
