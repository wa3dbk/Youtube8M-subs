prominent but otherwise when you look at
the<00:02:01.260> scooter<00:02:01.650> you<00:02:01.830> get<00:02:01.979> hints<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.460> other<00:02:03.030> bikes

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the scooter you get hints of other bikes

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.700 
the scooter you get hints of other bikes
that<00:02:03.420> are<00:02:03.479> already<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:03.990> market<00:02:04.110> scooters

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that are already on the market scooters

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.679 
that are already on the market scooters
like<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.130> maestro<00:02:05.580> perhaps<00:02:06.390> even<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
like the maestro perhaps even the

especially<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.030> weather<00:02:09.149> flank<00:02:09.479> comes<00:02:09.780> up

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
especially the weather flank comes up

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.500 
especially the weather flank comes up
into<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> back<00:02:11.160> but<00:02:11.580> there<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.239> one<00:02:12.360> little

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
into the back but there is one little

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.390 
into the back but there is one little
feature<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.140> might<00:02:13.709> get<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.070> little<00:02:14.220> bit

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
feature that might get a little bit

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.310 
feature that might get a little bit
extra<00:02:14.549> attention<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.750> that's<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.019> fact<00:02:16.230> that

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
extra attention and that's the fact that

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.960 
extra attention and that's the fact that
unlike<00:02:16.830> most<00:02:17.160> scooters<00:02:17.370> where<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.880> to

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
unlike most scooters where you have to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.080 
unlike most scooters where you have to
raise<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.390> seat<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.900> refuel<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.549> is<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
raise the seat to refuel here is a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.620 
raise the seat to refuel here is a
simple<00:02:21.329> little<00:02:22.100> they<00:02:23.100> go<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:24.000> turn<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
simple little they go just a turn of the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.789 
simple little they go just a turn of the
key<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.500> have<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:26.160> fuel<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.470> fuel

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
key and you have the fuel that the fuel

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:29.930 
key and you have the fuel that the fuel
hatch<00:02:28.950> right<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:29.400> at<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.579> back<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:29.850> that's

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
hatch right here at the back so that's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.750 
hatch right here at the back so that's
convenient<00:02:30.450> different<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.370> an<00:02:32.370> interesting

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
convenient different and an interesting

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.039 
convenient different and an interesting
design<00:02:32.880> feature<00:02:33.239> as<00:02:33.480> well<00:02:33.510> if<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.840> want<00:02:33.989> to

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
design feature as well if you want to

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.220 
design feature as well if you want to
call<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.200> that

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
call it that

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.950 
call it that
hmm<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:38.010> different<00:02:38.640> for<00:02:38.970> sure<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.900> I

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
hmm so that is different for sure but I

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.140 
hmm so that is different for sure but I
also<00:02:40.230> liked<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:40.920> unlike<00:02:41.520> most<00:02:41.760> scooters

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
also liked is that unlike most scooters

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.020 
also liked is that unlike most scooters
the<00:02:42.900> jupiter<00:02:43.350> has<00:02:43.590> under<00:02:44.070> seat<00:02:44.310> storage<00:02:44.340> for

the jupiter has under seat storage for

the jupiter has under seat storage for
not<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.420> an<00:02:45.630> open<00:02:45.990> face<00:02:46.200> for<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.830> full<00:02:47.130> helmet

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
not just an open face for a full helmet

not just an open face for a full helmet
to<00:02:47.730> meet<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:49.140> also<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> mobile<00:02:50.190> charger<00:02:50.670> there

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
to meet is also a mobile charger there

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.960 
to meet is also a mobile charger there
the<00:02:52.200> Jupiter<00:02:52.590> also<00:02:52.800> has<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.160> slightly<00:02:53.550> wider

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the Jupiter also has a slightly wider

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.420 
the Jupiter also has a slightly wider
and<00:02:54.300> longer<00:02:54.510> footboard<00:02:55.260> which<00:02:55.800> makes<00:02:56.100> not

and longer footboard which makes not

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
just a most spacious area for the riders

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.860 
just a most spacious area for the riders
legs<00:02:59.130> but<00:02:59.580> also<00:02:59.730> gives<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.120> an<00:03:00.270> Isis<00:03:00.600> stance

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870

overall<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:02.040> all<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.850> seat<00:03:03.060> itself<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.660> also

overall and all the seat itself is also

wider<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.770> little<00:03:05.010> more<00:03:05.130> comfortable

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
wider and a little more comfortable

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.120 
wider and a little more comfortable
given<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:06.720> trying<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.170> go<00:03:07.290> macho<00:03:07.920> I

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
given that it is trying to go macho I

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.580 
given that it is trying to go macho I
would<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:08.820> liked<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.210> bit<00:03:09.600> more<00:03:09.870> ride<00:03:10.230> height

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
would have liked a bit more ride height

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.739 
would have liked a bit more ride height
overall<00:03:11.480> now<00:03:12.480> let's<00:03:13.080> ride

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:18.749 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.209 

the<00:03:19.749> Jupiter<00:03:20.079> is<00:03:20.319> based<00:03:20.829> on<00:03:21.069> the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:21.219 
the Jupiter is based on the

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.489 
the Jupiter is based on the
underpinnings<00:03:21.909> of<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.359> we<00:03:22.569> go<00:03:22.810> now<00:03:23.469> I

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:23.499 
underpinnings of the we go now I

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.289 
underpinnings of the we go now I
remember<00:03:23.620> being<00:03:24.219> very<00:03:24.340> impressed<00:03:25.090> with<00:03:25.269> that

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
remember being very impressed with that

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.899 
remember being very impressed with that
scooter<00:03:25.810> when<00:03:26.049> it<00:03:26.200> first<00:03:26.499> arrived<00:03:26.829> figures<00:03:27.760> a

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
scooter when it first arrived figures a

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.460 
scooter when it first arrived figures a
staggeringly<00:03:28.629> similar

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.210 

ironically<00:03:33.470> enough<00:03:33.590> there's<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.040> certain

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
ironically enough there's a certain

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.970 
ironically enough there's a certain
sense<00:03:34.610> of<00:03:34.819> for<00:03:35.120> ample<00:03:35.569> nests<00:03:35.810> perhaps<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.500> I

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
sense of for ample nests perhaps that I

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.160 
sense of for ample nests perhaps that I
found<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.970> be<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.150> little<00:03:38.330> greater<00:03:38.660> on<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.019> we

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
found to be a little greater on the we

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.199 
found to be a little greater on the we
go<00:03:39.349> that<00:03:39.980> doesn't<00:03:40.430> really<00:03:40.519> come<00:03:40.819> through<00:03:40.849> on

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
go that doesn't really come through on

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.210 
go that doesn't really come through on
this<00:03:41.360> particular<00:03:41.660> product<00:03:42.140> why<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:42.680> say<00:03:42.950> ironic

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
this particular product why I say ironic

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.979 
this particular product why I say ironic
because<00:03:43.790> this<00:03:44.000> one's<00:03:44.239> supposed<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.690> be<00:03:44.810> more

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
because this one's supposed to be more

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.330 
because this one's supposed to be more
butch

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.000 

yes<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.090> wished<00:03:49.360> EVS<00:03:49.810> had<00:03:50.050> not<00:03:50.230> worried<00:03:50.680> that

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
yes I wished EVS had not worried that

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.520 
yes I wished EVS had not worried that
much<00:03:51.280> about<00:03:51.430> mileage<00:03:52.090> unknown<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.780> given<00:03:53.440> the

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
much about mileage unknown and given the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.190 
much about mileage unknown and given the
Jupiter<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.099> extra<00:03:54.550> shot<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.819> far<00:03:55.239> tune<00:03:55.959> the
