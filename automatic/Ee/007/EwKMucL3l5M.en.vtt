00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.859 
the string spread at the bridge which is
two<00:02:05.929> and<00:02:06.079> 1/8<00:02:06.369> now<00:02:07.369> you'll<00:02:07.700> also<00:02:07.969> notice<00:02:08.479> that

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
two and 1/8 now you'll also notice that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.840 
two and 1/8 now you'll also notice that
the<00:02:09.109> body<00:02:09.289> is<00:02:09.649> subtly<00:02:10.340> different

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
the body is subtly different

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.390 
the body is subtly different
it's<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.570> fourteenth<00:02:12.140> fret<00:02:12.350> body<00:02:12.739> neck<00:02:13.070> joint

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
it's a fourteenth fret body neck joint

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.789 
it's a fourteenth fret body neck joint
so<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.390> body<00:02:14.630> appears<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.320> be<00:02:15.440> smaller

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
so the body appears to be smaller

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.300 
so the body appears to be smaller
because<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:18.019> triple<00:02:18.230> of<00:02:18.380> 15<00:02:18.680> SM<00:02:19.100> has

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
because it is the triple of 15 SM has

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.160 
because it is the triple of 15 SM has
that<00:02:19.489> elongated<00:02:20.030> body<00:02:20.329> whereas<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.870> triple

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
that elongated body whereas the triple

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.860 
that elongated body whereas the triple
of<00:02:21.230> 15<00:02:21.590> M<00:02:21.739> has<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.069> shorter<00:02:22.609> more<00:02:22.790> squat<00:02:23.269> kind<00:02:23.810> of

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
of 15 M has a shorter more squat kind of

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.740 
of 15 M has a shorter more squat kind of
classic<00:02:24.350> triple<00:02:24.709> oh<00:02:24.769> look<00:02:25.420> that's<00:02:26.420> what<00:02:26.720> I

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
classic triple oh look that's what I

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.380 
classic triple oh look that's what I
want<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.049> compare<00:02:27.350> today<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:28.670> 12<00:02:28.940> fret<00:02:29.150> body

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
want to compare today the 12 fret body

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.020 
want to compare today the 12 fret body
neck<00:02:29.660> joint<00:02:29.930> versus<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.100> 14th<00:02:31.549> fret<00:02:31.700> body

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
neck joint versus the 14th fret body

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.020 
neck joint versus the 14th fret body
neck<00:02:32.299> joint<00:02:32.569> what<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.590> heard<00:02:34.069> was<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.760> the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
neck joint what I heard was that the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.400 
neck joint what I heard was that the
12th<00:02:35.359> fret<00:02:35.480> has<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> little<00:02:35.959> bit<00:02:36.019> more<00:02:36.079> base

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
12th fret has a little bit more base

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.629 
12th fret has a little bit more base
probably<00:02:36.889> because<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.130> has<00:02:37.250> more<00:02:37.430> surface

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
probably because it has more surface

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.030 
probably because it has more surface
area<00:02:38.000> where<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.840> 14th<00:02:39.260> fret<00:02:39.530> has<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.769> little

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
area where the 14th fret has a little

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.650 
area where the 14th fret has a little
bit<00:02:40.100> more<00:02:40.160> projection<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.389> little<00:02:41.569> bit

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
bit more projection and a little bit

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.330 
bit more projection and a little bit
more<00:02:41.780> mid-range<00:02:41.989> focus<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.010> what<00:02:43.130> we're<00:02:43.250> going

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
more mid-range focus so what we're going

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.860 
more mid-range focus so what we're going
to<00:02:43.400> do<00:02:43.580> we're<00:02:44.060> going<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.239> play<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.510> triple<00:02:44.810> of
