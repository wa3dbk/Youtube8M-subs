Rosario gray from for myself and most

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.730 
Rosario gray from for myself and most
important<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.300> him<00:02:03.450> was<00:02:04.110> great<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.500> robbie

to<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.010> that<00:02:05.250> goal<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.640> i<00:02:05.700> think<00:02:06.000> after<00:02:06.360> he

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
to get that goal but i think after he

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.430 
to get that goal but i think after he
scored<00:02:07.040> he<00:02:08.040> had<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> bunch<00:02:08.460> of<00:02:08.670> chances<00:02:09.510> as<00:02:10.110> well

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
scored he had a bunch of chances as well

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
scored he had a bunch of chances as well
look<00:02:10.619> at<00:02:10.740> his<00:02:11.190> second<00:02:11.610> goal<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> game<00:02:12.030> you

look at his second goal of the game you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.940 
look at his second goal of the game you
know<00:02:12.840> i<00:02:12.870> think<00:02:12.900> even<00:02:13.260> towards<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.710> end<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
know i think even towards the end of the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.890 
know i think even towards the end of the
game<00:02:13.980> when<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.580> are<00:02:14.730> up<00:02:14.880> we're<00:02:15.360> still<00:02:15.630> pressing

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
game when we are up we're still pressing

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.140 
game when we are up we're still pressing
it<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:17.370> know<00:02:17.460> usually<00:02:17.640> we've<00:02:17.880> been<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> team

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
it you know usually we've been a team

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.910 
it you know usually we've been a team
that<00:02:18.510> tends<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.020> kind<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.290> sit<00:02:19.530> back<00:02:19.560> because

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
that tends to kind of sit back because

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.890 
that tends to kind of sit back because
we're<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:20.220> confident<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:20.850> our<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.750> know<00:02:21.780> our

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
know just you know treated it like it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.190 
know just you know treated it like it
was<00:02:52.180> nothing<00:02:52.269> because<00:02:52.750> we<00:02:52.870> knew<00:02:52.989> they<00:02:53.139> were

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
was nothing because we knew they were

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.129 
was nothing because we knew they were
still<00:02:53.439> more<00:02:53.590> business<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.010> come<00:02:54.280> i<00:02:57.989> think<00:02:58.989> it's

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
still more business to come i think it's

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.289 
still more business to come i think it's
just<00:02:59.200> about<00:02:59.469> having<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.980> team<00:03:00.159> focus<00:03:00.700> yeah<00:03:00.909> and

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
just about having a team focus yeah and

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.309 
just about having a team focus yeah and
you<00:03:01.480> could<00:03:01.659> probably<00:03:01.900> argue<00:03:02.109> that<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.680> 2009<00:03:04.319> we

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
you could probably argue that in 2009 we

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.629 
you could probably argue that in 2009 we
tasted<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:05.889> little<00:03:06.010> bit<00:03:06.280> too<00:03:06.519> much<00:03:07.829> success<00:03:08.829> too
