you're going to be doing a lot of

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.360 
you're going to be doing a lot of
mileage<00:00:08.690> than<00:00:09.200> perhaps<00:00:09.469> a<00:00:09.650> diesel<00:00:10.040> is<00:00:10.160> the<00:00:10.250> way

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
mileage than perhaps a diesel is the way

to<00:00:10.430> go<00:00:10.700> you<00:00:11.540> get<00:00:11.690> a<00:00:11.750> great<00:00:12.140> fuel<00:00:12.500> consumption

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
to go you get a great fuel consumption

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
don't do a lot of mileage then you've

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.259 
don't do a lot of mileage then you've
got<00:00:39.859> to<00:00:40.010> wash<00:00:40.129> yourself<00:00:40.519> do<00:00:40.699> you<00:00:40.789> really<00:00:40.820> need

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
got to wash yourself do you really need

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.540 
got to wash yourself do you really need
a<00:00:41.300> diesel<00:00:41.750> first<00:00:42.469> of<00:00:42.649> all<00:00:42.800> it'll<00:00:43.129> cost<00:00:43.370> you

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
a diesel first of all it'll cost you

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.369 
a diesel first of all it'll cost you
maybe<00:00:43.879> eight<00:00:44.239> to<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.539> thousand<00:00:44.960> pound<00:00:45.170> more

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
maybe eight to a thousand pound more

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.220 
maybe eight to a thousand pound more
than<00:00:45.530> a<00:00:45.590> petrol<00:00:46.510> secondly<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:47.539> lot<00:00:47.719> of<00:00:47.899> people

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
than a petrol secondly a lot of people

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.720 
than a petrol secondly a lot of people
put<00:00:48.410> off<00:00:48.589> by<00:00:48.829> them<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.280> fact<00:00:49.489> that<00:00:49.519> they're

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
put off by them the fact that they're

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.200 
put off by them the fact that they're
noisy<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:51.109> dirty<00:00:51.589> get<00:00:52.429> a<00:00:52.460> lot<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.789> smoke<00:00:52.879> out

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
noisy the dirty get a lot of smoke out

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.910 
noisy the dirty get a lot of smoke out
of<00:00:53.390> them<00:00:53.539> etc

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
of them etc

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.510 
of them etc
and<00:00:55.070> that<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:56.000> servicing<00:00:56.770> maybe<00:00:57.770> not<00:00:58.100> not<00:00:58.430> as

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
and that the servicing maybe not not as

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.160 
and that the servicing maybe not not as
many<00:00:58.670> components<00:00:59.120> need<00:00:59.570> replace<00:00:59.899> him<00:01:00.079> when

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
many components need replace him when

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.750 
many components need replace him when
servicing<00:01:00.739> thought<00:01:00.980> they<00:01:01.370> wouldn't<00:01:01.610> need

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
servicing thought they wouldn't need

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.149 
servicing thought they wouldn't need
servicing<00:01:02.300> more<00:01:02.510> on<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.720> regular<00:01:03.110> basis<00:01:03.530> so

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
servicing more on a regular basis so

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.410 
servicing more on a regular basis so
these<00:01:04.309> are<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.610> other<00:01:04.729> things<00:01:04.970> you've<00:01:05.180> got<00:01:05.269> to

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
these are the other things you've got to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.510 
these are the other things you've got to
take<00:01:05.600> into<00:01:05.780> consideration<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:07.190> if<00:01:07.310> that's

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
take into consideration and if that's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.850 
take into consideration and if that's
the<00:01:07.670> case<00:01:07.880> then<00:01:08.210> perhaps<00:01:08.810> perpetual<00:01:09.680> is<00:01:09.740> the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
the case then perhaps perpetual is the

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:23.770 
the case then perhaps perpetual is the
way<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.040> go<00:01:10.310> let's<00:01:10.670> go<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.479> same

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
way to go let's go this is the same

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.930 
way to go let's go this is the same
model<00:01:23.990> as<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.800> cow<00:01:24.950> who<00:01:25.130> just<00:01:25.340> looked<00:01:25.520> up<00:01:25.700> but

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
model as the cow who just looked up but

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.109 
model as the cow who just looked up but
this<00:01:26.060> one's<00:01:26.270> petrol<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:28.520> difference<00:01:28.940> in

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
this one's petrol the difference in

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.540 
this one's petrol the difference in
price<00:01:29.360> between<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:30.050> and<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.680> diesel<00:01:30.920> same

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
price between this and a diesel same

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.609 
price between this and a diesel same
year<00:01:31.789> same<00:01:32.030> model<00:01:32.390> would<00:01:32.630> be<00:01:32.780> about<00:01:32.990> eight<00:01:33.259> to

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
year same model would be about eight to

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.550 
year same model would be about eight to
a<00:01:33.649> thousand<00:01:34.130> pounds<00:01:34.930> secondly<00:01:35.930> they're<00:01:36.259> a<00:01:36.289> lot

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
a thousand pounds secondly they're a lot

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.070 
a thousand pounds secondly they're a lot
quieter<00:01:36.860> lot<00:01:37.759> cleaner<00:01:38.090> better<00:01:38.750> for<00:01:39.020> the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
quieter lot cleaner better for the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.840 
quieter lot cleaner better for the
environment<00:01:41.140> fuel<00:01:42.140> itself<00:01:42.610> unleaded<00:01:43.610> is

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
environment fuel itself unleaded is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.240 
environment fuel itself unleaded is
slightly<00:01:44.270> cheaper<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.869> buy<00:01:45.050> per<00:01:45.530> gallon<00:01:45.950> than

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
slightly cheaper to buy per gallon than

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.510 
slightly cheaper to buy per gallon than
diesel<00:01:47.050> service<00:01:48.050> in<00:01:48.229> requirements<00:01:48.619> every

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
diesel service in requirements every

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.999 
diesel service in requirements every
10,000<00:01:50.210> miles<00:01:50.390> as<00:01:50.570> opposed<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:51.020> 6,000<00:01:51.800> miles

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
10,000 miles as opposed to 6,000 miles

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.150 
10,000 miles as opposed to 6,000 miles
so<00:01:52.869> short<00:01:53.869> journeys<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.530> would<00:01:54.950> probably

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
so short journeys I would probably

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.029 
so short journeys I would probably
consider<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:56.060> petrol<00:01:56.630> because<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.530> benefits

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
consider a petrol because the benefits

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.940 
consider a petrol because the benefits
are<00:01:58.759> not<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:59.119> much<00:01:59.360> difference<00:01:59.840> take<00:02:00.799> you<00:02:00.920> a

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
are not that much difference take you a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.550 
are not that much difference take you a
lot<00:02:01.130> longer<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:02.479> recoup<00:02:02.990> your<00:02:03.049> money<00:02:03.320> back

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
lot longer to recoup your money back

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.219 
lot longer to recoup your money back
buying<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.369> diesel<00:02:04.970> for<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.689> difference<00:02:06.079> in

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
buying a diesel for the difference in

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.560
