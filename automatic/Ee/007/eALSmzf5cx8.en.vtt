00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.850 

so<00:00:00.149> basically<00:00:00.450> what<00:00:00.659> the<00:00:00.719> DC<00:00:01.079> Pro<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.709> that

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
so basically what the DC Pro is is that

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.970 
so basically what the DC Pro is is that
it's<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.389> it's<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.510> lens<00:00:03.689> mount<00:00:03.959> adapter<00:00:04.049> that

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
it's a it's a lens mount adapter that

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.579 
it's a it's a lens mount adapter that
also<00:00:05.339> has<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.609> focal<00:00:06.060> reducer<00:00:06.480> inside<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.080> so

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
also has a focal reducer inside of it so

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.140 
also has a focal reducer inside of it so
what<00:00:07.890> it'll<00:00:08.010> do<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.220> it'll<00:00:08.490> open<00:00:08.730> up<00:00:08.970> your

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
what it'll do is it'll open up your

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.780 
what it'll do is it'll open up your
field<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.450> view<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:10.099> magnification<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.219> 0.7

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
field of view a magnification of 0.7

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.330 
field of view a magnification of 0.7
times<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.389> it'll<00:00:12.990> basically<00:00:13.139> also<00:00:14.099> let<00:00:14.309> in

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
times and it'll basically also let in

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.220 
times and it'll basically also let in
about<00:00:14.670> two-thirds<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> stop<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.660> light<00:00:15.809> on

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
about two-thirds to a stop of light on

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.120 
about two-thirds to a stop of light on
top<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:16.980> into<00:00:17.609> your<00:00:17.760> camera<00:00:18.800> at<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> same

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
top of that into your camera at the same

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429 
top of that into your camera at the same
time<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:20.789> makes<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.090> special<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.750> if<00:00:22.380> you

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
time what makes it special is if you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.150 
time what makes it special is if you
turn<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.760> here<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:25.260> transmitter

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
turn it on this here is a transmitter

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.939 
turn it on this here is a transmitter

your field of view from point seven

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740 
your field of view from point seven
times<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:36.000> basically<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.509> you're<00:01:36.659> on

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
times so basically if you're on

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.499 
times so basically if you're on
something<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.890> micro<00:01:38.460> 4/3<00:01:38.850> sensor<00:01:39.270> that's

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
something like a micro 4/3 sensor that's

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.200 
something like a micro 4/3 sensor that's
like<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> 2.2<00:01:40.380> magnification<00:01:41.220> it'll<00:01:41.850> open<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
like a 2.2 magnification it'll open you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.240 
like a 2.2 magnification it'll open you
up<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> something<00:01:42.630> more<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.140> 1.5<00:01:43.799> which<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
up to something more like a 1.5 which is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.840 
up to something more like a 1.5 which is
closer<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> something<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> crop<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
closer to something like a crop the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.359 
closer to something like a crop the
transmitter<00:01:48.299> itself<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> receiver

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
transmitter itself is or the receiver

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.450
