them is not where the gain to survive

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.170 
them is not where the gain to survive
but<00:03:06.989> how<00:03:07.680> they<00:03:07.889> can<00:03:08.040> stop<00:03:08.279> from<00:03:08.519> being<00:03:08.549> smaller

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
there are five key reasons I've

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.769

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.229 
identified for businesses that remain
smaller<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.950> first<00:03:17.219> is<00:03:17.459> our<00:03:17.700> lack<00:03:17.969> of<00:03:17.999> a

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
smaller the first is our lack of a

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.080 
smaller the first is our lack of a
vision<00:03:18.859> without<00:03:19.859> a<00:03:19.889> vision<00:03:20.189> you<00:03:20.549> can't<00:03:20.819> have
