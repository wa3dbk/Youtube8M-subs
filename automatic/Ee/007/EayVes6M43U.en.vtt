obvious and I used a and old kind of
beat-up<00:01:18.180> ratty<00:01:18.509> brush<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:19.710> get

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
beat-up ratty brush so that I would get

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.100 
beat-up ratty brush so that I would get
a<00:01:19.860> lot<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.130> brush<00:01:20.310> marks<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:21.990> I

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
a lot of brush marks on it and then I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.090 
a lot of brush marks on it and then I
sealed<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.420> with<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> soft<00:01:24.780> gel<00:01:25.100> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
sealed it with the with a soft gel to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.280 
sealed it with the with a soft gel to
make<00:01:26.130> sure<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.030> blazes<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.110> put

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
make sure that the blazes that I put

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.990 
make sure that the blazes that I put
over<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.590> wouldn't<00:01:29.040> soak<00:01:29.189> into<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> paper

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
over that wouldn't soak into the paper

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.960 
over that wouldn't soak into the paper
mache<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.460> started<00:01:32.790> adding

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
mache and then I just started adding

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.440 
mache and then I just started adding
colors<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.590> bit<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.799> gray<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.950> of

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
colors a little bit of gray and a bit of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.700 
colors a little bit of gray and a bit of
I<00:01:42.619> was<00:01:43.619> an<00:01:43.770> orange<00:01:44.189> e<00:01:44.399> color<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> few<00:01:46.320> spots

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
I was an orange e color on a few spots

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.550 
I was an orange e color on a few spots
just<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.220> little<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.810> blue<00:01:48.810> gray<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.350> there

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
just a little bit of blue gray in there

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.300 
just a little bit of blue gray in there
somewhere<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.159> another<00:01:50.600> did<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> eyes

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
somewhere or another did the eyes

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.749 
somewhere or another did the eyes
basically<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:55.399> what<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.579> that

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
basically that's just what was that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.550 
basically that's just what was that
yellow<00:01:57.030> ocher<00:01:58.130> cadmium<00:01:59.130> red<00:01:59.310> light<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.560> raw

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
yellow ocher cadmium red light and raw

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.940 
yellow ocher cadmium red light and raw
umber<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> rusty<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.950> just

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
umber I think it was a rusty in it just

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.899 
umber I think it was a rusty in it just
mixed<00:02:05.189> up<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.399> whole<00:02:05.520> bunch<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.759> different

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
mixed up a whole bunch of different

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.729 
mixed up a whole bunch of different
colors<00:02:06.320> putting<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> layer<00:02:07.680> over<00:02:07.710> layer

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
colors putting on a layer over layer

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.550 
colors putting on a layer over layer
the<00:02:09.039> one<00:02:09.789> thing<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.629> don't<00:02:10.780> like<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.530> how

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
the one thing that I don't like is how

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.679 
the one thing that I don't like is how
shiny<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.549> is<00:02:12.700> now<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.209> doesn't<00:02:13.480> have<00:02:13.569> as

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
shiny it is now it doesn't have as

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:14.640 
shiny it is now it doesn't have as
varnish<00:02:14.049> on<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.260> because<00:02:14.439> it<00:02:14.530> isn't

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
varnish on it because it isn't

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
spray that I've heard about that will

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.569

cut<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.470> shine<00:02:26.769> I<00:02:26.980> don't<00:02:27.159> I<00:02:27.280> don't<00:02:27.340> think

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
cut that shine I don't I don't think

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.569 
cut that shine I don't I don't think
wool<00:02:27.760> should<00:02:28.150> shine<00:02:28.480> what<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.470> much<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.010> even

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
wool should shine what so much and even

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.119 
wool should shine what so much and even
