it's got some nice detail you can see
the<00:01:51.450> nice<00:01:51.630> detail<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> end<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:52.799> there

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
nice detail on the edge there the spring

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.550 
nice detail on the edge there the spring
and<00:02:04.979> you've<00:02:05.700> got<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> nice<00:02:06.210> would<00:02:06.540> look<00:02:06.840> it's

kind<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.829> got<00:02:08.009> some<00:02:08.310> mechanics<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> side

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
kind of got some mechanics on the side

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.150 
kind of got some mechanics on the side
but<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> rest<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.709> made<00:02:11.039> of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
but the rest of it is just like made of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.180 
but the rest of it is just like made of
wood<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.640> then

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
wood and then

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.280 
wood and then
this<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.880> does<00:02:13.150> appear<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.510> be<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.750> real<00:02:14.050> metal

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
this this does appear to be a real metal

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.830 
this this does appear to be a real metal
the<00:02:14.680> young<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.520> end<00:02:15.700> which<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.210> actually<00:02:16.390> cool

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
the young the end which is actually cool

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.050 
the young the end which is actually cool
and<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.440> looks<00:02:17.860> really<00:02:18.010> nice<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.550> can<00:02:18.730> hold<00:02:18.850> it

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
and it looks really nice you can hold it

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.280 
and it looks really nice you can hold it
off<00:02:19.210> rather<00:02:19.420> well<00:02:19.540> even<00:02:19.930> though<00:02:20.020> it's<00:02:20.140> got<00:02:20.260> a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
off rather well even though it's got a

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.840 
off rather well even though it's got a
really<00:02:20.500> big<00:02:20.710> handle<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.760> looks

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
really big handle so that it looks

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.630 
really big handle so that it looks
really<00:02:22.180> cool<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.350> one<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.860> more<00:02:24.160> from<00:02:24.460> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
really cool so this one is more from the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
they're kind of shooting the pod racers

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.430 
they're kind of shooting the pod racers
on<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.420> side<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.110> track<00:02:36.900> he<00:02:37.900> also<00:02:38.050> comes

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
on the side of the track he also comes

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.350 
on the side of the track he also comes
with<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.650> base<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.340> course<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.730> base<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
with a base of course the base is the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.230 
with a base of course the base is the
traditional<00:02:40.990> around<00:02:41.800> from<00:02:42.580> Star<00:02:42.820> Wars<00:02:42.850> as

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
traditional around from Star Wars as

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.240 
traditional around from Star Wars as
well<00:02:43.690> does<00:02:43.870> have<00:02:44.080> like<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.320> little<00:02:44.590> sand<00:02:44.860> piece

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
well does have like a little sand piece

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.550 
well does have like a little sand piece
on<00:02:45.460> top<00:02:45.490> of<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.030> overall<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.720> think<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.080> idea<00:02:47.140> of

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
on top of it overall I think the idea of

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.900 
on top of it overall I think the idea of
it<00:02:47.680> was<00:02:47.830> really<00:02:48.040> cool<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.310> have<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.550> nice<00:02:48.790> little

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
it was really cool to have a nice little

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.820 
it was really cool to have a nice little
sand<00:02:49.240> piece<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.660> just<00:02:50.140> don't<00:02:50.380> think<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.650> it

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
sand piece I just don't think that it

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.520 
sand piece I just don't think that it
was<00:02:50.890> executed<00:02:51.580> oh<00:02:51.850> well<00:02:52.240> I<00:02:52.270> mean<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:53.230> looks

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
was executed oh well I mean it it looks

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.530 
was executed oh well I mean it it looks
a<00:02:53.620> little<00:02:53.740> strange<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.520> can<00:02:54.700> see<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.150> detail

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
a little strange you can see the detail

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.230 
a little strange you can see the detail
of<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.220> sand<00:02:57.220> which<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.550> cool<00:02:57.760> but<00:02:57.910> it's<00:02:58.060> just

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
of the sand which is cool but it's just

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.930 
of the sand which is cool but it's just
it's<00:02:58.480> not<00:02:58.990> all<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.350> way<00:02:59.560> out<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.580> is<00:03:00.730> kind

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
it's not all the way out of it is kind

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.810 
it's not all the way out of it is kind
of<00:03:00.970> sticking<00:03:01.270> up<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:02.040> overall<00:03:03.040> I'm<00:03:03.310> not

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
of sticking up and overall I'm not

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.060 
of sticking up and overall I'm not
impressed<00:03:04.690> with<00:03:04.990> this<00:03:05.110> base<00:03:05.350> too<00:03:05.590> much<00:03:05.800> i

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
impressed with this base too much i

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.920 
impressed with this base too much i
think<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.490> uh<00:03:06.520> just<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.270> normal<00:03:07.510> black<00:03:07.720> base

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
think that uh just the normal black base

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.820 
think that uh just the normal black base
would<00:03:08.110> have<00:03:08.140> been<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.320> little<00:03:08.500> bit<00:03:08.650> better

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
would have been a little bit better

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.620 
would have been a little bit better
because<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.430> bc<00:03:09.880> i<00:03:09.910> don't<00:03:10.270> know<00:03:10.360> it's<00:03:10.510> just

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
because this bc i don't know it's just

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.360
