00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.420
 You have to see how difficult it is to sharpen a 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.500
 knife with a water stone 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.300
 bullshit sharpen a knife with the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.940
 Water stone is the simplest thing 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.059
 that there is no need for a thousand masters 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.150
 universe in quantum physics or nothing alone 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.600
 you need a stone of water a knife 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.140
 of sharpening and 20 minutes you will see what is 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.140
 simple 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.970
 the knife with which my friend brought me 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.829
 if I can with this that you can not 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.910
 you kids with their knives 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.910
 temporary mini key 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.620
 the stone has a mystery is a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.030
 water stone not the one my grandfather had 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.580
 the only difference is that it's so 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.980
 Japanese and has two faces one more face 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.900
 thick to sharpen and a thinner face 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.880
 to polish are marked with a number 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.520
 the lowest number to sharpen and the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.780
 highest number to polish all the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.780
 mystery of the stone of before 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.760
 dip the stone in water and when you leave 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.880
 to take bubbles 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.480
 you take them out and put them on a cloth to 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.480
 that does not move 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.780
 place the knife on the stone three 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.920
 fingers on top of the sheet and you start 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.079
 move the knife from the back 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.729
 taking into account that the whole sheet passes 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.170
 by the stone the inclination of the 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.970
 knife with respect to the stone that is 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.409
 about the little finger 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.179
 polistas are very silly with the subject 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.280
 of the bowing person inclination the 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.250
 knife will sharpen the same as you tilt more 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.610
 or less that yes less inclination more 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.610
 edge 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.080
 and check that it is sharp 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.960
 You put the stone back to the water 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.270
 wash 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.850
 you take them out 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.130
 and the bulls again in the same way 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.840
 until it is completely smooth 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.190
 and eye with the kids knife because 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.190
 now this really cuts 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.549
 ah
