00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.790 

all<00:00:28.880> right<00:00:29.030> this<00:00:29.480> lesson<00:00:29.990> is<00:00:30.140> about<00:00:30.170> the

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
all right this lesson is about the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.290 
all right this lesson is about the
Triads<00:00:31.520> within<00:00:32.510> keys<00:00:33.400> and<00:00:34.400> what<00:00:34.850> we're<00:00:35.000> doing

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
Triads within keys and what we're doing

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.320 
Triads within keys and what we're doing
is<00:00:35.420> we're<00:00:35.630> basing<00:00:36.200> a<00:00:36.710> three<00:00:37.489> note<00:00:37.700> chord<00:00:38.120> off

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
is we're basing a three note chord off

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.020 
is we're basing a three note chord off
each<00:00:38.540> scale<00:00:38.930> degree<00:00:39.400> and<00:00:40.400> that<00:00:40.640> gives<00:00:40.880> us

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
each scale degree and that gives us

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.860 
each scale degree and that gives us
diatonic<00:00:41.840> harmony<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.330> when<00:00:44.330> we<00:00:44.510> learn<00:00:44.720> how

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
diatonic harmony and when we learn how

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.189 
diatonic harmony and when we learn how
to<00:00:44.900> play<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.530> arpeggios<00:00:46.250> of<00:00:46.280> these<00:00:46.670> chords<00:00:47.300> on

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
to play the arpeggios of these chords on

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.540 
to play the arpeggios of these chords on
the<00:00:48.260> guitar<00:00:48.350> it<00:00:48.800> really<00:00:49.100> builds<00:00:49.430> our

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
the guitar it really builds our

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.360 
the guitar it really builds our
technique<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.270> we<00:00:50.330> can<00:00:50.510> use<00:00:50.750> these<00:00:51.050> ideas<00:00:51.379> for

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
technique and we can use these ideas for

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:07.450 
technique and we can use these ideas for
so<00:01:03.430> alright<00:01:04.430> but<00:01:04.670> as<00:01:05.239> we<00:01:05.540> build<00:01:05.869> our<00:01:06.229> our<00:01:06.830> chord

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
so alright but as we build our our chord

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.490 
so alright but as we build our our chord
on<00:01:07.700> each<00:01:07.850> scale<00:01:08.149> degree<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.780> one<00:01:09.020> chord<00:01:09.410> is

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
on each scale degree the one chord is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.130 
on each scale degree the one chord is
going<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.770> be<00:01:09.890> major<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.970> two<00:01:11.210> chord<00:01:11.540> is<00:01:11.750> minor

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
going to be major the two chord is minor

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.030 
going to be major the two chord is minor
3<00:01:13.100> chord<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.580> minor<00:01:14.020> 4<00:01:15.020> chord<00:01:15.440> is<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.710> major

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
3 chord is minor 4 chord is a major

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.740 
3 chord is minor 4 chord is a major
chord<00:01:16.490> five<00:01:17.030> chord<00:01:17.060> major<00:01:17.830> six<00:01:18.830> is<00:01:19.039> minor

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
chord five chord major six is minor

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.170 
chord five chord major six is minor
seven<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:21.080> diminished<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.250> back<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.759> one<00:01:22.970> and

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
seven is diminished and back to one and

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.660 
seven is diminished and back to one and
it<00:01:23.300> starts<00:01:23.420> lumbering<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.190> that<00:01:25.369> is<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
it starts lumbering you so that is the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.710 
it starts lumbering you so that is the
pattern<00:01:25.990> one<00:01:27.009> four<00:01:28.009> five<00:01:28.310> or<00:01:28.670> major<00:01:28.910> two<00:01:29.420> three

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
pattern one four five or major two three

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.260 
pattern one four five or major two three
six<00:01:29.990> or<00:01:30.170> minor<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:31.340> chord<00:01:31.700> built<00:01:31.850> up<00:01:32.090> the

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
six or minor the chord built up the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.410 
six or minor the chord built up the
seventh<00:01:32.810> degree<00:01:32.959> the<00:01:33.950> little<00:01:34.190> triad<00:01:34.520> is

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
seventh degree the little triad is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.580 
seventh degree the little triad is
diminished<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:38.090> anyway<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:39.020> particular

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
diminished so anyway this particular

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.490 
diminished so anyway this particular
lesson<00:01:40.250> we're<00:01:41.179> going<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.509> learn<00:01:41.899> how<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.170> play

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
lesson we're going to learn how to play

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.930 
lesson we're going to learn how to play
just<00:01:42.800> in<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.099> key<00:01:43.310> of<00:01:43.340> G<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:43.819> we're

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
just in the key of G and then we're

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.270 
just in the key of G and then we're
going<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.119> do<00:01:44.690> one<00:01:44.990> exercise<00:01:45.319> in<00:01:45.709> the<00:01:45.770> key<00:01:46.009> of<00:01:46.039> G

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
going to do one exercise in the key of G

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.120 
going to do one exercise in the key of G
and<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:47.149> in<00:01:47.569> the<00:01:47.720> key<00:01:47.869> of<00:01:47.959> C<00:01:48.229> excuse<00:01:48.800> me

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
and this in the key of C excuse me

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.949 
and this in the key of C excuse me
but<00:01:49.580> this<00:01:49.789> we're<00:01:50.090> gonna<00:01:50.179> use<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.630> Caged

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
but this we're gonna use the Caged

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.550 
but this we're gonna use the Caged
system<00:01:51.580> for<00:01:52.580> our<00:01:52.729> study<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:53.539> this<00:01:54.170> first

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
system for our study so this first

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.109 
system for our study so this first
exercise<00:01:54.979> is<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.509> G<00:01:56.750> scale<00:01:57.310> each<00:01:58.310> shape

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
exercise is the G scale each shape

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.740 
exercise is the G scale each shape
now<00:02:00.080> we're<00:02:00.229> gonna<00:02:00.349> play<00:02:00.560> these<00:02:00.830> arpeggios<00:02:01.750> so

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
now we're gonna play these arpeggios so

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.809 
now we're gonna play these arpeggios so
it's<00:02:02.929> kind<00:02:03.410> of<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.619> tongue<00:02:03.920> twister<00:02:04.160> when<00:02:04.670> we

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
it's kind of a tongue twister when we

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.630 
it's kind of a tongue twister when we
play<00:02:05.060> these<00:02:05.410> now<00:02:06.410> since<00:02:06.890> there's<00:02:07.099> a<00:02:07.310> three

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
play these now since there's a three

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.339 
play these now since there's a three
note<00:02:07.849> chord<00:02:08.240> we<00:02:08.420> might<00:02:08.660> as<00:02:08.750> well<00:02:08.869> play<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.200> as<00:02:09.319> a

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
note chord we might as well play it as a

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.550 
note chord we might as well play it as a
triplet<00:02:09.920> as<00:02:10.039> well<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:11.180> in<00:02:11.930> other<00:02:12.050> words<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
triplet as well so in other words the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.820 
triplet as well so in other words the
beat<00:02:12.770> is<00:02:12.890> gonna<00:02:13.069> be<00:02:13.250> one<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.180> two<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.200> one

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
beat is gonna be one and two and one

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.300 
beat is gonna be one and two and one
triplet<00:02:16.790> two<00:02:16.940> triplet<00:02:17.300> three<00:02:18.140> triplet<00:02:18.530> four

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
triplet two triplet three triplet four

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:29.449 
triplet two triplet three triplet four
that's<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.450> rhythm<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.870> it

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:37.440 

one<00:02:30.459> two<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.780> three<00:02:35.130> why<00:02:36.130> I'm<00:02:36.250> saying<00:02:36.450> you

started on this let me show you some
picking<00:02:46.660> suggestions<00:02:47.500> here's<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.370> triplet

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
picking suggestions here's the triplet

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.880 
picking suggestions here's the triplet
exercise<00:02:49.390> with<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.780> Triads<00:02:50.200> with<00:02:50.410> alternate

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
exercise with the Triads with alternate

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:04.140 
exercise with the Triads with alternate
picking

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.720 

now<00:03:05.080> that's<00:03:05.620> all<00:03:05.830> well<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.069> good<00:03:06.250> but<00:03:06.430> it

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
now that's all well and good but it

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.789 
now that's all well and good but it
might<00:03:06.879> not<00:03:06.940> be<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.510> fastest<00:03:08.019> way<00:03:08.260> once<00:03:08.650> you

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
might not be the fastest way once you

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.670 
might not be the fastest way once you
get<00:03:09.010> into<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.930> they<00:03:10.930> might<00:03:11.080> do<00:03:11.290> something<00:03:11.560> like

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680
