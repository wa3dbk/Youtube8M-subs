00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:13.049 

I<00:00:10.320> like<00:00:11.320> knowing<00:00:11.590> how<00:00:11.740> things<00:00:12.070> work<00:00:12.400> knowing

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
I like knowing how things work knowing

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.030 
I like knowing how things work knowing
how<00:00:13.450> things<00:00:13.840> are<00:00:14.050> put<00:00:14.200> together<00:00:14.379> and<00:00:14.770> how<00:00:14.920> they

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
how things are put together and how they

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.940 
how things are put together and how they
integrate<00:00:15.400> and<00:00:15.850> then<00:00:16.059> how<00:00:16.270> they<00:00:16.390> interact<00:00:16.840> a

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.189 

lot<00:00:20.950> of<00:00:21.100> my<00:00:21.340> drive<00:00:21.760> comes<00:00:22.300> from<00:00:22.539> a<00:00:22.689> love<00:00:22.960> of<00:00:23.080> the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
lot of my drive comes from a love of the

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.779 
lot of my drive comes from a love of the
environment<00:00:23.679> and<00:00:23.800> wanting<00:00:23.980> to<00:00:24.010> protect<00:00:24.400> it<00:00:24.580> so

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
environment and wanting to protect it so

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.550 
environment and wanting to protect it so
I<00:00:24.820> think<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.449> best<00:00:25.660> way<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:25.900> do<00:00:26.050> that<00:00:26.170> is<00:00:26.349> to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
I think the best way to do that is to

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.000 
I think the best way to do that is to
start<00:00:26.920> by<00:00:27.099> understanding<00:00:27.279> how<00:00:27.699> it<00:00:27.849> works

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.590 

weakens<00:00:33.010> not<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.430> only<00:00:33.700> place<00:00:33.910> to<00:00:34.300> offer

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
weakens not the only place to offer

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.570 
weakens not the only place to offer
zoology<00:00:35.290> but<00:00:35.440> it's<00:00:35.560> one<00:00:35.680> of<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.920> few<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.400> offer

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
zoology but it's one of the few to offer

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.910 
zoology but it's one of the few to offer
a<00:00:36.760> zoology<00:00:37.330> and<00:00:37.420> animal<00:00:37.690> sciences<00:00:38.140> course<00:00:38.500> it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
a zoology and animal sciences course it

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.740 
a zoology and animal sciences course it
really<00:00:39.129> offers<00:00:39.280> students<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:39.969> capacity<00:00:40.629> to

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
really offers students the capacity to

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.319 
really offers students the capacity to
come<00:00:40.930> in<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:41.260> focus<00:00:41.649> on<00:00:41.950> Australian<00:00:42.850> fauna

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
come in and focus on Australian fauna

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.080 
come in and focus on Australian fauna
and<00:00:43.750> trying<00:00:44.020> to<00:00:44.170> understand<00:00:44.770> how<00:00:45.399> we<00:00:45.460> can<00:00:45.699> view

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
and trying to understand how we can view

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.299 
and trying to understand how we can view
those<00:00:46.390> it's<00:00:46.660> demonstrating<00:00:47.620> how<00:00:47.770> evolution

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
those it's demonstrating how evolution

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.970 
those it's demonstrating how evolution
is<00:00:48.399> impacted<00:00:49.059> an<00:00:49.180> amazing

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.310 

with<00:00:52.280> teaching<00:00:52.760> I<00:00:52.879> love<00:00:53.320> enthusing

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
with teaching I love enthusing

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.380 
with teaching I love enthusing
undergraduate<00:00:55.039> students<00:00:55.460> with<00:00:55.640> knowledge<00:00:56.149> of

undergraduate students with knowledge of
the<00:00:56.449> diversity<00:00:57.170> of<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.440> animals<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:57.980> we<00:00:58.100> see

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
the diversity of the animals that we see

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.950 
the diversity of the animals that we see
around<00:00:58.399> us<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.850> trying<00:00:59.059> to<00:00:59.149> understand<00:00:59.659> why

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
around us and trying to understand why

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.930 
around us and trying to understand why
they<00:01:00.140> behave<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.649> way<00:01:00.769> they<00:01:00.920> do<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.699> on<00:01:01.850> the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
they behave the way they do and on the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.660 
they behave the way they do and on the
research<00:01:02.239> side<00:01:02.629> I<00:01:02.989> work<00:01:03.409> mostly<00:01:03.890> on<00:01:04.070> birds<00:01:04.460> and

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
research side I work mostly on birds and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.160 
research side I work mostly on birds and
I<00:01:04.790> have<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:04.939> range<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.420> different<00:01:05.570> projects

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
I have a range of different projects

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.359 
I have a range of different projects
which<00:01:06.320> look<00:01:06.530> at<00:01:06.649> the<00:01:06.740> physiology<00:01:07.280> and

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
which look at the physiology and

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.490 
which look at the physiology and
behavior<00:01:07.729> of<00:01:07.790> those<00:01:08.030> birds<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.720> I<00:01:08.840> love<00:01:09.110> when

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
behavior of those birds and I love when

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.020 
behavior of those birds and I love when
you<00:01:09.590> get<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.740> new<00:01:09.950> dataset<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.610> you<00:01:10.729> suddenly

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
you get a new dataset and you suddenly

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.730 
you get a new dataset and you suddenly
go<00:01:11.210> hard<00:01:11.450> that's<00:01:11.780> why<00:01:12.049> they<00:01:12.229> do<00:01:12.289> it<00:01:12.380> that<00:01:12.619> way

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
go hard that's why they do it that way

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.910 
go hard that's why they do it that way
isn't<00:01:12.890> that<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:13.369> cool<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:15.320> lecturers<00:01:15.740> here

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
isn't that so cool the lecturers here

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.429 
isn't that so cool the lecturers here
are<00:01:16.189> quite<00:01:16.820> accessible<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.600> lot<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:17.930> them<00:01:18.110> like

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
are quite accessible a lot of them like

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.840 
are quite accessible a lot of them like
to<00:01:18.470> interact<00:01:18.979> with<00:01:19.070> students<00:01:19.460> during<00:01:19.789> the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
to interact with students during the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.510 
to interact with students during the
lectures<00:01:20.210> it<00:01:20.780> helps<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:21.380> absorb<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:22.070> material

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
lectures it helps to absorb the material

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.190 
lectures it helps to absorb the material
more<00:01:22.670> if<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.939> can<00:01:23.090> discuss<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.659> rather<00:01:23.960> than

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
more if you can discuss it rather than

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.529 
more if you can discuss it rather than
just<00:01:24.470> trying<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.100> listen<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.789> it<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.090> memorize

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
just trying to listen to it and memorize

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.919 
just trying to listen to it and memorize
it<00:01:27.310> as<00:01:28.310> part<00:01:28.909> of<00:01:28.940> studies<00:01:29.330> at<00:01:29.450> Deakin<00:01:29.750> they<00:01:29.869> do

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
it as part of studies at Deakin they do

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.050 
it as part of studies at Deakin they do
like<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.860> try<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.490> make<00:01:31.610> industry

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
like you to try and make industry
