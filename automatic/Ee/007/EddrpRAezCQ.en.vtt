00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.339
 hello everyone and everyone welcome to 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.320
 recycling channel 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.720
 I am vicky and today I come to show you how 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.870
 make these little surprises for 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.060
 give family friends or that person 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.010
 special so invite them and if 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.500
 they want to see this video with me what 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.300
 share and subscribe to the channel if you still 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.940
 they have not done it so they do not get lost 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.890
 no recycling video we are going to 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.920
 start to do this recycling 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.219
 very easy today we will need in 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.949
 a pattern of a heart removed in the 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.949
 then we will mark it in the center 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.100
 in our cereal box or 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.769
 cookies and we're going to mark it twice 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.609
 one of the times we will mark the 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.609
 outer heart and inner heart 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.670
 and now we mark the heart again 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.470
 but this time only the part 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.150
 Exterior 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.150
 and now we cut it 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.479
 and once we have trimmed the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.579
 two parts we will decorate it or paint the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.579
 form of what you want to do 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:25.179
 so in this case I'm going to paint it 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:29.310
 of red and I will use tempera of the 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.310
 school from which children can use 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.770
 and before it dries we could 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.770
 put on glitter 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.660
 and once we have covered with the 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.730
 glitter then let it dry here 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.970
 we have the heart that we had painted 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.720
 and we are going to write a message before 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.760
 paste the rest of things for example this 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.620
 this is an example but you can 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.620
 put anything you want 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.409
 and once we have already put the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.660
 message let's put the candy 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.390
 how is this turn 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.580
 we will put the looks in here 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.150
 this way of putting the candy would be 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.760
 like to give candy or to add to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.010
 other gifts in the form of more card or 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.590
 less and now I'm going to stick cellophane 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.330
 covering the sweets in this case 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.510
 I still do not cut it until I'm 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.400
 totally stuck we put the glue and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.570
 we have to put covering it well already 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.040
 that the sweets have to stay 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:43.040
 fresh and now we stick the cellophane 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.040
 over 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.300
 and once we have this we are going to paste 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.350
 over the heart that we had put 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.450
 purpurin 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.069
 as before we put enough 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.780
 glue 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.859
 now I'm using cold silicone 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.139
 you can use any 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.799
 glue even white glue too 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.799
 it would serve us 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.370
 ok now we put them 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.200
 and we press 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.320
 and let's be 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.290
 let's decorate it and I'll do it with 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.840
 White glue 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.430
 and in this case it would be very useful if the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.409
 boat that has white tail has the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.430
 very thin dealer to write 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.299
 words 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.299
 so 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.450
 ah 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.480
 and in what we have put here we are going to 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.690
 put glitter to put the glitter 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.810
 I'm going to use a good sheet so that 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.460
 collect all the glitter that I dropped 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.490
 then I'm slowly putting on 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.870
 the glue that I put and once like that 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.610
 let's move a little so that it 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.790
 distribute well 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.220
 and we remove the excess and we will stay 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.450
 in this way we are going to let this 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.010
 dry well to continue working 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.880
 once it is dried you can already 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.639
 manipulate let's turn it around because 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:38.380
 that has to be left out 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:40.810
 and in the center we will add sweet funds 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.640
 and whatever we say in the previous and 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.010
 now let's put glue on the 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.860
 edge well now we paste the paper 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:53.970
 cellophane and now we just paste the 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.970
 another heart so glue and paste 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.279
 here you can take advantage to put the 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.110
 sweet that you like that person 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:02.360
 special 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.970
 well we also let it dry and then 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.790
 we will trim the excess well and this is 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.070
 the result of our recycling today 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.140
 what do you think they are very details 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.140
 pretty nice and especially 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.300
 easy and quick to do so 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.280
