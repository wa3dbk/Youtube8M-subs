00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
to do before I had this you could do it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.870 
to do before I had this you could do it
with<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> hand<00:01:07.320> mixer<00:01:07.470> whatever<00:01:08.220> works<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
with a hand mixer whatever works for you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
with a hand mixer whatever works for you
I'm<00:01:09.570> gonna<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> quarter<00:01:10.409> teaspoon<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:11.010> salt

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
I'm gonna do a quarter teaspoon of salt

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.280 
I'm gonna do a quarter teaspoon of salt
and<00:01:11.580> don't<00:01:11.820> eliminate<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.479> salts<00:01:12.900> thinking

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and don't eliminate the salts thinking

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.929 
and don't eliminate the salts thinking
all<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.710> probably<00:01:14.100> doesn't<00:01:14.400> really<00:01:14.490> need<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
all it probably doesn't really need that

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.510 
all it probably doesn't really need that
because<00:01:15.540> salt<00:01:16.350> actually<00:01:16.590> will<00:01:16.979> bring<00:01:17.310> out

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
because salt actually will bring out

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.460 
because salt actually will bring out
some<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.090> flavors<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.720> things<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.290> it's

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
some of the flavors and things so it's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.020 
some of the flavors and things so it's
only<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> quarter<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> teaspoon<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.880> whole

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
into you know two or three chunks it

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.969 
into you know two or three chunks it

the<00:02:02.520> mixer<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.969> mix<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.210> especially<00:02:03.540> if<00:02:03.869> you're

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the mixer to mix up especially if you're

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.180 
the mixer to mix up especially if you're
doing<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.259> by<00:02:04.439> hand<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.829> would<00:02:04.950> bring

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
doing this by hand I would bring

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.090 
doing this by hand I would bring
into<00:02:05.490> chunks<00:02:06.750> or<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.320> you're<00:02:07.530> doing<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.950> with

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
into chunks or if you're doing that with

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.980 
into chunks or if you're doing that with
a<00:02:08.160> hand<00:02:08.340> mixer<00:02:08.400> you<00:02:08.700> know<00:02:08.820> it's<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.630> easier

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
a hand mixer you know it's just easier

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.300 
a hand mixer you know it's just easier
no<00:02:10.380> matter<00:02:10.619> how<00:02:10.830> you're<00:02:11.040> doing<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:16.310> let

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
no matter how you're doing it and let

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.960 
no matter how you're doing it and let
that<00:02:17.460> start<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.850> come<00:02:17.880> together

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.400 

one<00:02:24.970> thing<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.360> notice<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.900> always<00:02:26.080> want

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
one thing to notice that you always want

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.020 
one thing to notice that you always want
to<00:02:26.500> start<00:02:26.710> your<00:02:26.890> mixer<00:02:27.340> if<00:02:27.490> you're<00:02:27.640> using<00:02:27.820> a

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
to start your mixer if you're using a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.000 
to start your mixer if you're using a
hand<00:02:28.210> mixer<00:02:28.270> or<00:02:28.660> one<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.930> these<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.350> lower

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
hand mixer or one of these on a lower

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.260 
hand mixer or one of these on a lower
level<00:02:30.130> otherwise<00:02:30.760> you're<00:02:30.940> going<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.120> get<00:02:31.210> a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
level otherwise you're going to get a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.020 
level otherwise you're going to get a
big<00:02:31.480> poof<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:32.140> flour<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:33.160> whatnot<00:02:33.820> in

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
big poof of flour and and whatnot in

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.530 
big poof of flour and and whatnot in
your<00:02:34.150> face

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
your face

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.630 
your face
so<00:02:34.870> start<00:02:35.260> low<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.740> then<00:02:35.860> work<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.370> up<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.610> a

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
so start low and then work it up to a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.820 
so start low and then work it up to a
higher<00:02:36.880> speed

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.840 

okay<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.860> think<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.130> really<00:02:44.370> important<00:02:44.820> to

able to fit 15 on a tree only because

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.740 
able to fit 15 on a tree only because
these<00:05:50.040> don't<00:05:50.310> spread<00:05:50.880> out<00:05:51.030> or<00:05:51.180> anything<00:05:51.540> very

always you know 10 to 12 minutes but it

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.120 
always you know 10 to 12 minutes but it

to<00:06:11.460> go<00:06:11.550> less<00:06:11.760> time<00:06:12.000> so<00:06:12.210> I<00:06:12.240> always<00:06:12.570> start<00:06:12.840> at<00:06:13.139> 9

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
to go less time so I always start at 9

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.870 
to go less time so I always start at 9
minutes<00:06:13.680> and<00:06:13.889> then<00:06:14.040> I<00:06:14.130> work<00:06:14.310> my<00:06:14.490> way<00:06:14.520> up<00:06:14.669> from

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.450 
otherwise I'll try to touch them too
soon<00:06:45.210> but<00:06:45.810> you<00:06:45.990> definitely<00:06:46.289> want<00:06:46.800> to<00:06:46.950> do<00:06:47.190> this

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
soon but you definitely want to do this

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.190 
soon but you definitely want to do this
step<00:06:47.729> and<00:06:48.030> as<00:06:48.120> you<00:06:48.270> can<00:06:48.419> see<00:06:48.600> I'm<00:06:48.720> rolling<00:06:49.080> them

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
step and as you can see I'm rolling them

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.080 
step and as you can see I'm rolling them
in<00:06:49.320> powdered<00:06:49.650> sugar<00:06:49.680> you<00:06:50.190> want<00:06:50.639> to<00:06:50.789> do<00:06:50.910> that

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
in powdered sugar you want to do that

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.210 
in powdered sugar you want to do that
before<00:06:51.240> they<00:06:51.539> cool<00:06:51.750> if<00:06:52.080> you<00:06:52.560> don't<00:06:52.770> if<00:06:53.100> you

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
before they cool if you don't if you

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.590 
before they cool if you don't if you
wait<00:06:53.370> too<00:06:53.610> long<00:06:53.639> then<00:06:54.150> the<00:06:54.180> powdered<00:06:54.570> sugar

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
wait too long then the powdered sugar

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.570 
wait too long then the powdered sugar
won't<00:06:54.990> stick<00:06:55.380> so<00:06:56.130> you<00:06:56.220> want<00:06:56.400> to<00:06:56.460> make<00:06:56.550> sure
