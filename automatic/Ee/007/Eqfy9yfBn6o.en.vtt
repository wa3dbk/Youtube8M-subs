 Welcome to Tutopolis TV. 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.230
 Today I'll show you how to easily change the back cover on a LG G2, but 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.929
 before we start, I urge you to follow this tutorial to the end, 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:18.000
 because in the end important information is waiting for you, so follow me into the workshop and off you go. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 So let's start. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.500
 First, we turn off the LG G2. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.231
 So now we pick up a flat plastic tool and go between backcover and 

00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:43.610
 Medium frame and try around it to solve all the clips. 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.039
 You should take your time and just do not use force as it will take a little longer 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.039
 could last for the first time. 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.180
 Here I have the original sound again, so you do not get a shock, 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:01:07.600
 when you open this for the first time, because it sounds a bit brutal. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:27.020
 Now just put the new back cover on it again, press down until all the clips snap into place 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.360
 and the back cover fits completely. 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:38.280
 So that's it. 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.990
 Now you can look forward to a new backcover. 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.230
 So people I hope I could help you. 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.640
