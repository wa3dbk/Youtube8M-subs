00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 the staff here is Sergio Franc at the top 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:13.080
 a goal 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:15.059
 96 ta is 1.6 thp engine with a beak 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.650
 Just okay gun I'm going to give a big 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.680
 Tip for you that have a car 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 similar is the one with an injector nozzle 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.650
 only ok there is a bomb inside the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.250
 tank is that it generates gallon for 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.890
 minute , and that it is the entrance 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.920
 Fuel is as seen here at 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.469
 tpi passes by here by the beak here looks 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.360
 for an editor who goes through this 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.050
 restriction valve and returns to the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.079
 OK 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.170
 You can understand everything fine, but you have a 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.180
 big mechanical problem there is the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.860
 car owner thinks this is a 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:00.649
 carburetor is not the temperature sensor 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.649
 of the air and has several sensors 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.500
 idle sensor has position sensor 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.780
 Butterfly is not so karachi alone that has a 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.620
 screw that it can work what 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.250
 happens 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.410
 it regulates the pressure that this car 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.560
 if you specifically work with a bar 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.070
 a pair of pressure only if okay then 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.170
 You do not have a handset that proposes that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.350
 emits a pressure bar do not touch here 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:35.590
 because it happens is to fuck the messi for 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.690
 the kitchen then restricted the return of 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.750
 increasing the pressure on the 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.750
 system is damaging the pump 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.960
 damaged the pump that we already 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.990
 replaced it would be the one here that 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.750
 inside of the compartment here of the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.009
 buoy album of the attack a new bomb already 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.350
 was then placed only 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.799
 recapitulating that this looks like a 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.840
 developer but is not this is a td one 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.910
 nozzle only this injector nozzle is 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.760
 very very difficult, this is already good 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.420
 people in not messing with that kitchen for 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.400
 no way 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.530
 Now, what's the procedure? 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.870
 ride this darn here in the tank 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.269
 and we'll have to do it later 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.840
 was a device here to be able to 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:32.079
 pressure correctly so there is no 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.329
 damage to the new pump which is a tip that 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:38.350
 I left it to someone who has a 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:41.650
 1.0 1611's with a nozzle only to that 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.140
 model left 94 95 96 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.410
 these cars came out with a 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.410
 OK
