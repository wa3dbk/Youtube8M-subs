yeah so Center
so<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:02.750> basically<00:02:03.750> has<00:02:03.930> got<00:02:04.260> a<00:02:04.970> quad<00:02:05.970> core

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
so this basically has got a quad core

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.170 
so this basically has got a quad core
Pentium<00:02:06.930> quad<00:02:07.140> core<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.040> three<00:02:08.400> five-30

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
Pentium quad core and three five-30

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.800 
Pentium quad core and three five-30
series<00:02:09.600> processor<00:02:10.170> at<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> 2gb<00:02:11.250> RAM<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.060> comes

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
series processor at the 2gb RAM so comes

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.490 
series processor at the 2gb RAM so comes
with<00:02:12.900> 8.1<00:02:13.830> Windows<00:02:14.160> 8.1<00:02:14.480> 64-bit<00:02:15.500> operating

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
with 8.1 Windows 8.1 64-bit operating

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.100 
with 8.1 Windows 8.1 64-bit operating
system<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:20.310> upgradeable<00:02:20.940> up<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.180> 8gb<00:02:21.360> but

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
system and is upgradeable up to 8gb but

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.710 
system and is upgradeable up to 8gb but
one<00:02:22.560> thing<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.220> will<00:02:23.490> have<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.970> understand<00:02:24.480> is

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
one thing you will have to understand is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.880 
one thing you will have to understand is
the<00:02:25.730> motherboard<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.360> motherboard<00:02:28.050> inside

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
the motherboard the motherboard inside

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.710 
the motherboard the motherboard inside
is<00:02:29.070> totally<00:02:29.550> different<00:02:29.880> from<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.540> have

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
is totally different from what you have

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.090 
is totally different from what you have
in<00:02:30.900> other<00:02:31.050> laptops<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.930> here<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.230> RAM<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.740> some

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
in other laptops so here the RAM is some

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.580 
in other laptops so here the RAM is some
more<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.490> an<00:02:35.610> affixed<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.590> motherboard

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
more like an affixed to the motherboard

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.160 
more like an affixed to the motherboard
so<00:02:37.920> you'll<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.490> take<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.840> service

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
so you'll have to take it to the service

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.070 
so you'll have to take it to the service
center<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.490> tried<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:42.390> upgrade<00:02:42.540> around

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
center and I tried to upgrade around

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.200 
center and I tried to upgrade around
