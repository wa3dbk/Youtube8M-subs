Wii and I've also played that one after
playing<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:20.509> ds1<00:00:21.200> I<00:00:21.700> can<00:00:22.700> easily<00:00:23.029> say<00:00:23.390> that

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
playing the ds1 I can easily say that

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.100 
playing the ds1 I can easily say that
the<00:00:23.960> DS<00:00:24.140> version<00:00:24.289> is<00:00:25.450> so<00:00:26.450> much<00:00:26.660> better<00:00:26.869> than

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
the DS version is so much better than

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.460 
the DS version is so much better than
the<00:00:27.320> Nintendo<00:00:27.920> Wii<00:00:27.949> one<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:29.539> Nintendo<00:00:30.439> Wii

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
the Nintendo Wii one the Nintendo Wii

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.000 
the Nintendo Wii one the Nintendo Wii
one<00:00:30.830> is<00:00:31.009> just<00:00:31.220> really<00:00:31.429> awkward<00:00:31.460> to<00:00:31.910> play<00:00:32.119> it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
one is just really awkward to play it

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.920 
one is just really awkward to play it
like<00:00:34.010> when<00:00:34.220> you<00:00:34.250> have<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.610> do<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.940> trampoline

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
like when you have to do the trampoline

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.390 
like when you have to do the trampoline
one<00:00:36.110> with<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.589> Weaver<00:00:36.860> mote<00:00:37.070> you<00:00:37.220> have<00:00:37.309> to

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
one with the Weaver mote you have to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.060 
one with the Weaver mote you have to
twist<00:00:37.670> your<00:00:37.790> hand<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:38.559> push<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:39.710> buttons<00:00:39.980> it

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
twist your hand and push the buttons it

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.009 
twist your hand and push the buttons it
just<00:00:40.280> feels<00:00:40.460> really<00:00:40.640> weird<00:00:40.879> doing<00:00:41.150> that<00:00:41.449> but

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
just feels really weird doing that but

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.779 
just feels really weird doing that but
on<00:00:42.140> this<00:00:42.260> version<00:00:42.769> you<00:00:43.040> just<00:00:43.250> draw<00:00:43.460> all<00:00:43.519> the

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
on this version you just draw all the

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:45.940 
on this version you just draw all the
shapes<00:00:44.059> on<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.450> touchscreen<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.260> then

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
shapes on the touchscreen and then

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.520 
shapes on the touchscreen and then
whatever<00:00:46.250> character<00:00:46.989> you're<00:00:47.989> playing<00:00:48.200> with

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
whatever character you're playing with

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.560 
whatever character you're playing with
will<00:00:48.860> contort<00:00:49.370> their<00:00:49.550> body<00:00:49.730> flipped<00:00:50.149> twist

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
will contort their body flipped twist

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.700 
will contort their body flipped twist
and<00:00:51.430> do<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:52.579> trampoline<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:53.710> gymnastic

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
and do the trampoline and the gymnastic

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.729 
and do the trampoline and the gymnastic
moves<00:00:55.570> there's<00:00:56.570> some<00:00:56.780> games<00:00:56.989> on<00:00:57.199> here<00:00:57.559> that

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
moves there's some games on here that

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.790 
moves there's some games on here that
are<00:00:57.859> a<00:00:57.890> whole<00:00:58.039> lot<00:00:58.100> better<00:00:58.219> than<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.699> others

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
are a whole lot better than the others

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.349 
are a whole lot better than the others
unlike<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.920> swimming<00:01:01.280> one<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:01.820> one<00:01:02.030> really

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
unlike the swimming one that one really

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.970 
unlike the swimming one that one really
isn't<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.809> great<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.469> problem<00:01:03.769> with<00:01:03.949> that

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
isn't that great and a problem with that

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.150 
isn't that great and a problem with that
is<00:01:04.990> when<00:01:05.990> you're<00:01:06.110> playing<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.649> swimming<00:01:06.979> one

touchscreen and draw a figure eight and
the<00:01:15.890> faster<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.460> do<00:01:16.610> that<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:17.299> faster<00:01:17.689> your

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
the faster you do that the faster your

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.240 
the faster you do that the faster your
character<00:01:18.200> moves<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:18.710> when<00:01:18.830> you're<00:01:18.950> moving

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250

borned relatively quickly because

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.550 
borned relatively quickly because
they're<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:27.520> simple<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.000> straightforward

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
they're so simple and straightforward

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.690 
they're so simple and straightforward
there's<00:02:29.560> really<00:02:29.650> no<00:02:29.890> skill<00:02:30.220> involved<00:02:30.250> you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
there's really no skill involved you

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.070 
there's really no skill involved you
just<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:31.060> exactly<00:02:31.180> what<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.750> says<00:02:31.900> on<00:02:32.050> the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
just do exactly what it says on the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.580 
just do exactly what it says on the
screen<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.420> again<00:02:34.960> this<00:02:35.110> isn't<00:02:35.290> something

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
screen and again this isn't something

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.720 
screen and again this isn't something
that<00:02:35.740> you're<00:02:35.920> going<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.100> want<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.280> pick<00:02:36.430> up<00:02:36.550> and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
that you're going to want to pick up and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.070 
that you're going to want to pick up and
do<00:02:36.820> daily<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.300> once<00:02:37.480> you've<00:02:37.630> beat<00:02:37.810> everything

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
do daily so once you've beat everything

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.560 
do daily so once you've beat everything
a<00:02:38.440> few<00:02:39.100> times<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.670> gets<00:02:39.790> really<00:02:40.000> boring<00:02:40.270> and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
a few times it gets really boring and

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.600 
a few times it gets really boring and
repetitive<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.680> even<00:02:41.890> though<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.100> game<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.460> a

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
repetitive so even though this game is a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.550 
repetitive so even though this game is a
lot<00:02:42.640> better<00:02:42.970> than<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.510> Nintendo<00:02:44.020> Wii<00:02:44.050> version

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
lot better than the Nintendo Wii version

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.470 
lot better than the Nintendo Wii version
it's<00:02:45.550> not<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:45.790> saying<00:02:46.120> much<00:02:46.180> because

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
it's not really saying much because

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.010 
it's not really saying much because
they're<00:02:46.989> both<00:02:47.170> kind<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.910> boring<00:02:48.910> after<00:02:49.900> you've

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
they're both kind of boring after you've

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.440 
they're both kind of boring after you've
played<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.350> for<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.530> few<00:02:50.680> hours<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:52.090> if<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.330> do

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
played it for a few hours so if you do

played it for a few hours so if you do
