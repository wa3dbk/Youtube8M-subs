00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.730 

I<00:00:13.940> believe<00:00:14.600> that<00:00:14.720> success<00:00:14.930> that<00:00:15.410> looks<00:00:15.620> like

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
I believe that success that looks like

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.500 
I believe that success that looks like
Cessna

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
yep so this is a this is a live runway

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.010 
yep so this is a this is a live runway
so<00:00:27.850> I<00:00:27.880> have<00:00:28.060> them<00:00:28.180> kind<00:00:28.360> of<00:00:28.510> shouting<00:00:28.930> because

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
so I have them kind of shouting because

so I have them kind of shouting because
there's<00:00:29.290> a<00:00:29.350> lot<00:00:29.590> of<00:00:29.770> engine<00:00:30.160> noises

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
engages it there's a belt on here goes

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.680 
engages it there's a belt on here goes
from<00:00:47.580> the<00:00:48.559> drive<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.610> motor<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
from the drive on the motor because the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.520 
from the drive on the motor because the
belt<00:00:51.900> non<00:00:52.829> -<00:00:53.040> here

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.620 

so<00:00:58.160> that's<00:00:58.310> fun<00:00:58.580> when<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.600> go<00:00:59.750> up<00:00:59.930> oh<00:01:00.230> this<00:01:01.220> is

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
so that's fun when you go up oh this is

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.840 
so that's fun when you go up oh this is
the<00:01:02.630> private<00:01:02.900> thunder<00:01:03.710> if<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:04.250> saw<00:01:04.430> my<00:01:04.610> video

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
the private thunder if you saw my video

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.090 
the private thunder if you saw my video
a<00:01:04.910> while<00:01:05.030> back<00:01:05.089> with<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.890> privately<00:01:06.890> owned

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
a while back with the privately owned

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.630 
a while back with the privately owned
Thunderbolt<00:01:07.820> 1003<00:01:08.450> B<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:09.050> is<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.380> this<00:01:09.620> is<00:01:10.520> the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
Thunderbolt 1003 B this is a this is the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.690 
Thunderbolt 1003 B this is a this is the
same<00:01:10.850> one<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:12.430> now<00:01:13.430> you're<00:01:13.550> rotating

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
same one and now you're rotating

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.940 
same one and now you're rotating
mechanism<00:01:14.119> this<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.110> how<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.260> set<00:01:15.560> up<00:01:15.800> just

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
mechanism this is how you set up just

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.250 
mechanism this is how you set up just
which<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.580> goes<00:01:17.030> back<00:01:17.060> into<00:01:17.660> some<00:01:17.869> series

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
which is it goes back into some series

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.890 
which is it goes back into some series
of<00:01:18.410> switches<00:01:18.970> you<00:01:19.970> always<00:01:20.240> just<00:01:20.450> manually

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
of switches you always just manually

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.100 
of switches you always just manually
operating<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.670> that's<00:01:23.510> how<00:01:23.630> we<00:01:23.780> are

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
operating it so that's how we are

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.090 
operating it so that's how we are
running<00:01:24.710> it<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:26.110> got<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.140> lot<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.320> paint<00:01:27.650> chipping

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
running it I got a lot of paint chipping

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.550 
running it I got a lot of paint chipping
solenoids<00:01:29.050> everything<00:01:30.050> is<00:01:30.140> in<00:01:30.229> great

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
solenoids everything is in great

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.940 
solenoids everything is in great
condition<00:01:30.590> besides<00:01:31.520> cosmetic

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:45.280 

what<00:01:37.610> else<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:38.620> got<00:01:39.620> a<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:42.910> power<00:01:43.910> panel<00:01:44.660> and<00:01:45.200> it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
what else I got a the power panel and it

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.560 
what else I got a the power panel and it
just<00:01:45.500> goes<00:01:45.680> over<00:01:45.860> into<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.370> generator<00:01:47.150> that<00:01:47.420> is

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
just goes over into a generator that is

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.410 
just goes over into a generator that is
right<00:01:47.900> there<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:51.229> series<00:01:51.470> of<00:01:51.620> switches

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
right there so this series of switches

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.510 
right there so this series of switches
that's<00:01:53.420> how<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.660> works<00:01:53.930> I'll<00:01:54.140> try<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.619> try<00:01:55.160> and

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
that's how it works I'll try to try and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.969 
that's how it works I'll try to try and
get<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.729> video<00:01:56.060> of<00:01:56.300> it<00:01:56.479> running<00:01:56.780> but<00:01:57.740> she

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
get a video of it running but she

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.950 
get a video of it running but she

just<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.299> I<00:03:04.329> guess<00:03:04.750> that's<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.049> for<00:03:05.109> now<00:03:05.260> stay

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
just so I guess that's it for now stay

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.949 
just so I guess that's it for now stay
tuned<00:03:05.859> for<00:03:06.099> another<00:03:06.159> video<00:03:06.579> if<00:03:07.239> I<00:03:07.390> do<00:03:07.450> get<00:03:07.719> that

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
tuned for another video if I do get that

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.610 
tuned for another video if I do get that
one<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.379> if<00:03:08.650> now<00:03:08.859> I<00:03:09.159> will<00:03:09.489> make<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:10.950> video<00:03:11.950> of

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
one and if now I will make a video of

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.490 
one and if now I will make a video of
what<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.739> why<00:03:14.980> won't<00:03:15.489> make<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.730> video<00:03:16.060> of

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
what is why won't make a video of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.890 
what is why won't make a video of
probably<00:03:17.500> my<00:03:17.650> Thunderbolt<00:03:18.450> do<00:03:19.450> something<00:03:19.810> of

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
probably my Thunderbolt do something of

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.260 
probably my Thunderbolt do something of
that<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.939> that's<00:03:21.939> this<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.079> for<00:03:23.230> now
