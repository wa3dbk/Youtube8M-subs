Vester<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.840> wherever<00:03:37.470> there<00:03:37.680> LLC<00:03:38.220> was<00:03:38.430> at<00:03:38.610> the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
Vester and wherever there LLC was at the

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.920 
Vester and wherever there LLC was at the
time<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.770> in<00:03:40.770> me<00:03:41.180> so<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.420> really<00:03:42.660> that

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
time and in me so it's really that

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.580 
time and in me so it's really that
simple

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
simple

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.000 
simple
but<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:43.980> only<00:03:44.160> thing<00:03:44.340> about<00:03:44.520> that<00:03:45.710> that<00:03:46.710> buyer

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
but the only thing about that that buyer

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.910 
but the only thing about that that buyer
now<00:03:47.340> becomes<00:03:47.790> his<00:03:48.000> buyer<00:03:48.240> because<00:03:48.990> that's

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
now becomes his buyer because that's

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.520 
now becomes his buyer because that's
what<00:03:50.130> he<00:03:50.250> does<00:03:50.460> also<00:03:50.790> as<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.150> wholesaler<00:03:51.720> so

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
what he does also as a wholesaler so

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.870 
what he does also as a wholesaler so
