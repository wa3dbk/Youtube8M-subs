00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.840
 hello in this tutorial let's learn 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.420
 how to touch up a photo from start to finish 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.490
 first of all we will start as usual 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.959
 removing the defects the possible 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.260
 defects to the skin the granites and that 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.260
 kind of things 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.800
 on this occasion it does not have many flaws 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.869
 so with removes this this little 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.869
 spot here ready 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.680
 next the next thing we're going to 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.739
 to do is smoothing skin that is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.090
 Leave your skin soft without any wrinkles 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.090
 without any kind of stain 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.370
 this type of skin retouching with 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.500
 photoshop would be much better but 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.750
 It is also much slower and is one of 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.670
 the advantages of lightroom than when 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.930
 you have a lot of photos ago 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.930
 everything is much faster 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.770
 you have to look a bit at all the skin 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.770
 once finished 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.610
 re touch parameters 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.020
 coming down from the clarity and care that is not 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.240
 you notice the edges and also have 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.960
 careful not to look too 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.960
 retouched 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.650
 the insulator allows to test d'alema to give 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.650
 less and in this way you see the result 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.390
 another advantage with respect to photoshop 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.050
 that maybe it allows you but of a 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.050
 slower way 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.000
 next we are going to outline well the 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.000
 eyebrows 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.119
 have not finished what we do is 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.649
 Give the shadows to be more 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.649
 dark and highlight more 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.190
 as you can see the result it shows 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.140
 a much prettier eyebrow 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.210
 Now let's continue reviewing the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.210
 eye makeup 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.230
 so that it is more defined and darker 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.879
 you have to wait a lot while more 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.459
 slowly do it better you will have the 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.719
 final result but I pass it fast 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.719
 so that the video does not become eternal 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.160
 it darkens a little 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.470
 but there is no need to lower the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.900
 exposure because if you do not notice the cut 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.830
 of the brush from where you have found the 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.830
 brush and where not 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.020
 I'm more interested to lower the shade 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.940
 the parts that were already dark before with 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.480
 the makeup of the model are still made 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.480
 darker 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.180
 and more than lowering the exposure itself that 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.180
 I put everything dark 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.800
 now let's move on to the retouch of eyes 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.730
 first of all we are going to bleach 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.920
 We do not wait for selecting that area 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.720
 we remove the saturation and we put it 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.720
 the clearest shadows 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.559
 and there is a whiter white 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.559
 which highlights the eyes much more 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.990
 now the iris area 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.460
 Well first let's go through the 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.699
 tabs 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.800
 we are going to mark very carefully if 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.130
 it is possible even one to one of the 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.130
 tabs 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.580
 once marked 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.140
 what we do is give clarity to 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.460
 that are more defined and that is how 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.460
 can count the tabs 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.160
 and darken the 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.500
 now we are going to give way to the retouching of 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.849
 iris what we do with a brush 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.929
 soft 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.929
 we are giving him 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.389
 as if it were an additional reflection of 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.940
 this way there will be a lot more eyes 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.660
 bright and a lot more look 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.660
 penetrating 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.330
 We are trying to see what we like 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.330
 more results with the bars 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.360
 we are perfecting the 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.470
 details another part that I jumped on 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.500
 the video because if it would not be too much 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:27.479
 Long is retouching the sheet 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.479
 take to chicago I do not know what that is called 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.180
 and that what has been to give shine to 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.350
 the areas of brightness and give it more 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.540
 darkness to the area of ​​more darkness 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.940
 right now what I'm doing 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.620
 giving clarity to the eyes so that it 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.160
 see much clearer eyes and more 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.160
 focused 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.340
 the hair is given a smoothing 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.640
 also and good and now and simply 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:56.520
 retouched all the parameters of the photo 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:07:00.680
 to improve the global as much as possible 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.680
 without any layer or brush 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.110
 I personally like that the 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.820
 Shadows are darker and whites 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.950
 they are pretty white so there are 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.490
 there is a photo with enough force 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.490
 contrast 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.830
 and that's what I'm doing 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.400
 now in the curve everything would happen to us 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:21.400
 darken the blacks 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.880
 and I give it 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.360
 with the focus mask that I will do to 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.360
 continuation 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.250
 with the focus mask I'll put in 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.140
 crisp clear areas the mask the 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.790
 I put 90 percent more so that 

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.170
 blurred areas or areas that I do not 

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.900
 interests that are sharp as 

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.640
 example the skin does not focus but that 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.960
 I want to focus are the 

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.030
 areas that are already focused that 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.390
 Focus even more so that you see a 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:04.000
 sharpest picture 

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.010
 Well I hope you liked to continue 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.460
