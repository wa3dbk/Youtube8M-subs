00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 the damn nerds need to be 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.400
 informed by that now Maxilian him 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.490
 they bring all the news from the world of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.040
 technology and videogames 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 damn news a critic that usually 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.850
 receive the creators of casual games 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.310
 is that they do not care much about making copies 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.750
 downloaded from better games that's why it's 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.910
 that the world of technology does not 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.890
 He forgave the candy craft company and 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.260
 wanted to register the words as a brand 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.520
 candy and saga for whom nobody else 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.490
 can use but the thing did not end there 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.140
 the king lowers his head the other day 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.910
 he commented that the company king 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.190
 responsible among other games of the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.380
 popular candy crack saga walks in 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.390
 problems at the end of December skin 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.850
 he tried to register the words candy and 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.950
 saga as brands so that no other 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.780
 can use them this generated a 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.250
 pretty negative reaction on the part of 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.080
 the developer community of 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.629
 fichines and among dissident voices 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.210
 there was the marc porter that had 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.570
 created a game called is camper golf and 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.089
 who accused the guy of stealing it 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.740
 shamelessly and baptize it pack avoid and 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.600
 He denied that he was doing anything wrong 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.580
 but good it took the game off what 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.649
 caused even more murmurs among the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.899
 press as much as riccardo zacconi 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.060
 director of the company had to write 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.560
 an open letter in which he lamented 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.930
 for what had happened with the game 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.700
 apologizing for having copied it and 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.040
 assuring that Kim is not a company that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.050
 I copy games something half weird coming from 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.600
 a company that exclusively sells 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.030
 clones of games like bublÃ© pool and 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.460
 for him it's more the same candy crack is 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.709
 a copy to some extent of the classic 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.940
 visible this story has not yet 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.550

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.860
 even stranger than the previous one

 her name is the mind technologies a 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.250
 company that develops intelligence 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.130
 artificial for robots using a 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.170
 automatic learning mix and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.810
 green sticks on the sweet table remained 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.970

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.310
