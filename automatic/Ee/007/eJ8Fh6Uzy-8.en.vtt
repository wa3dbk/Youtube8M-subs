 what's up parents and i have you for a long time 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.170
 not seen so I'm a little bit too 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.730
 I also already have a cold 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.869
 yes how are you all with 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.869
 I'm fine 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.570
 and I'm just going to slip the reason 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.619
 wommack tell a while and i am 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.539
 been 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.550
 comes mainly the school I think I have 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.680
 also if something tells and follow video 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.280
 but I have a very busy group with 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.020
 school 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.750
 I 'm at the film and video school and me 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.490
 had to make a film that is finished by the way 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.050
 but you might let him hear 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.880
 more about 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.050
 not really related to this gaming 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.780
 youtube channel should you be interested 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.670
 are x french is I found 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.350
 then you should mark it as him 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.120
 then it can show the film late 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.060
 nos so I have been very busy with 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.330
 school I have spent a little too much time 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:03.980
 in youtube and not enough time 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.469
 put into trying to pass into you 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.390
 of my school year but is happy 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.880
 everything around when it's good I'm over 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.429
 to the third year of the mine 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.890
 educations 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:19.030
 I have a little time for myself again 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.030
 I am now in a three-cent shop 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.960
 I am really selling it so it is a score 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.229
 3 does not really go out on it for a moment 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.909
 game 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.810
 I actually wanted a lot 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:35.270
 tell you I want I can 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.979
 to fly over 100 this is flat then 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.069
 receive 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.829
 strange how we're just going to run 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.380
 so yes there are many things that i like 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.460
 actually want to tell and what am I going 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.549
 to do 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.689
 if is the i can stream live on the 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.729
 so youtube channel so like fuckin ice 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.049
 first we stream live via twitch that is 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.340
 alfred but of course don't get it 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.020
 all subscribers land to see me 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.020
 live and then they must also subscribe 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.869
 are on my twitch account and yes that is 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.490
 maybe a little tricky some people 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.810
 to keep it all up to date 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.830
 so if I can stream a live it can go on 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.170
 youtube I wanted women and sensors 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.940
 and that kind of chill so keep it one 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.430
 I know a little bit for the rest 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.710
 not when I have new videos again 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.330
 or that I can put that on a constant 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.190
 flow basis I'm going next week 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.840
 namely also to Spain and then I come 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.190
 no spain though on the following idea 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.230
 make videos but I don't 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.660
 Forward I do for my other 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.130
 youtube channel and also my blog 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.540
 there may be 4 know it is right too 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.290
 so you probably know new 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.080
 it doesn't 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.090
 it this stalk events and one mini name 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.340
 well you can actually me 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.130
 stumps through that blocks I go there quite 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.110
 set up many things in daily 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.340
 make life do videos from it 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.210
 daily life 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.080
 I have some new video equipment 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.910
 bought making everything a lot better and 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.070
 professional befalls 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.540
 And that's why I'm going to make movies 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.870
 when again we have nothing to do with it 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.360
 games that require five things around the wheel 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.610
 yes i just really like that too 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.010
 I also do film and video 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.690
 school and therefore I am trained to 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.730
 thing to do in real life and techniques 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.450
 I can all apply to those who learn there 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.560
 I can play my videos on this channel 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.880
 of course here too 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.530
 and then I do that in the machine 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.680
 one so maybe i can do the sketches that 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.450
 I then get on with it minecraft 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.739
 that is of course also possible but me 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.690
 know i just like to be in it 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.040
 really make some movies 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.790
 instead of always getting a room 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.360
 put a very cool car and for one 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.209
 camera webcams talk how that looked 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.920
 nice out but of course I just go 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.860
 continue on this youtube channel 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.470
 so did not write it i am only going one 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.840
 add the second channel and stick 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.420
 since about we think the tofu channel 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.060
 did you actually it was that easy 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.150
 I once had small extra space and vince 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.530
 channel and xxsmall spacer has been replaced 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.590
 by on 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.350
 so my gaming channel and find channel is 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.820
 replaced by stick finds all my channel 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.860
 The reason we go to new channel or them 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.810
 created has to do with a 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.650
 network partnerships and all that 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.239
 stuff 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.710
 my channel is the we network 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.730
 registered so yes I say so 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.280
 and video ad 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.580
 and they get a part of it in terms of 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.500
 money and that is very handy 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.050
 well not to live on or something like that 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.310
 very handy to occasionally what 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.290
 maybe buy some new equipment 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.760
 or they man as if often viewed 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.000
 is becoming 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.350
 I had my old channel is there eh 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.330
 so that I almost all loose network 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.400
 angeles and I wasn't quite there 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.110
 satisfied with that so you can't either 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.090
 just gone so problem so I had to 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.850
 create a new channel and thus 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.300
 I immediately added another block 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.220
 www.sdock.nl 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.220
 just check it out i'm actually coming 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.990
 I usually think bullshit movies on you 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.030
 not really bullshit but not 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.460
 have felt whole educational things or so 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.230
 I made a movie in yesterday together 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.270
 with my friends about a tip for if 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.500
 you are bored during the summer holidays 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.500
 do a water fight 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.570
 went to town together and then we 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.600
 bought some things for water fights 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.630
 and then filmed everything in my 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.040
 garden and that video is online 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.750
 so you just have to take a look at the 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.850

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.000
