00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
if you don't have one you can do this

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.000 
if you don't have one you can do this
step<00:02:11.980> by<00:02:12.250> hand<00:02:12.610> if<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.780> decide<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.290> go<00:02:14.740> this

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
step by hand if you decide to go this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.670 
step by hand if you decide to go this
route<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.610> would<00:02:16.360> make<00:02:16.600> sense<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.290> do<00:02:17.470> the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
route it would make sense to do the
