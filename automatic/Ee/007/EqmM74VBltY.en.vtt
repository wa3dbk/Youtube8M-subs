yes<00:00:21.500> I<00:00:21.710> know<00:00:21.880> I'm<00:00:22.880> actually<00:00:23.030> using<00:00:23.330> my<00:00:23.600> brain

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
yes I know I'm actually using my brain

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.630 
yes I know I'm actually using my brain
that<00:00:24.920> doesn't<00:00:25.220> happen<00:00:25.310> very<00:00:25.460> often

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
that doesn't happen very often

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.960 
that doesn't happen very often
then<00:00:28.269> ate<00:00:28.449> my<00:00:28.480> idea<00:00:29.050> is<00:00:29.230> this<00:00:29.439> okay<00:00:30.099> you<00:00:30.849> know

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
then ate my idea is this okay you know

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.770 
then ate my idea is this okay you know
the<00:00:31.090> way<00:00:31.180> pedestrians<00:00:32.079> just<00:00:32.470> walk<00:00:33.370> around<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
the way pedestrians just walk around and

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.619 
the way pedestrians just walk around and
they<00:00:34.960> cross<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.440> road<00:00:35.620> and<00:00:35.890> things<00:00:36.070> like<00:00:36.220> that

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
they cross the road and things like that

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.510 
they cross the road and things like that
well<00:00:37.629> I've<00:00:38.170> come<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:38.890> conclusion<00:00:38.920> that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
well I've come to the conclusion that

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.049 
well I've come to the conclusion that
really<00:00:40.360> that<00:00:40.750> is<00:00:40.899> just<00:00:41.199> unacceptable<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.879> way

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
really that is just unacceptable the way

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.860 
really that is just unacceptable the way
a<00:00:43.390> current<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.199> system<00:00:44.589> works<00:00:44.860> okay<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:46.150> system

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
a current a system works okay the system

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.560 
a current a system works okay the system
of<00:00:47.019> for<00:00:47.199> pedestrians<00:00:47.739> is<00:00:48.040> just<00:00:48.370> wrong<00:00:48.579> stay

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
of for pedestrians is just wrong stay

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.780 
of for pedestrians is just wrong stay

and<00:02:54.050> then<00:02:54.530> if<00:02:54.950> once<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.310> pass<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:55.810> you've

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
and then if once you pass that you've

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.290 
and then if once you pass that you've
then<00:02:56.959> got<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.230> go<00:02:57.349> do<00:02:57.500> your<00:02:57.620> module<00:02:57.950> 2<00:02:58.180> which<00:02:59.180> is

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
then got to go do your module 2 which is

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.690 
then got to go do your module 2 which is
the<00:02:59.420> road<00:02:59.569> test<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.160> mostly<00:03:01.430> watching

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
the road test so it mostly watching

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.309 
the road test so it mostly watching
probably<00:03:02.360> bike<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.720> seal<00:03:02.900> know<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.170> already

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
probably bike the seal know that already

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.290 
probably bike the seal know that already
but<00:03:03.590> for<00:03:03.769> those<00:03:03.860> who<00:03:03.920> are<00:03:04.160> bikers<00:03:04.400> there<00:03:05.209> you

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
but for those who are bikers there you

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.059 
but for those who are bikers there you
go<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:05.989> it's<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.140> pretty<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.470> pain<00:03:06.709> in<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.920> ass

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
go so it's a pretty of a pain in the ass

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.009 
go so it's a pretty of a pain in the ass
to<00:03:07.099> be<00:03:07.370> honest<00:03:08.860> but<00:03:09.860> pedestrians<00:03:10.540> okay<00:03:11.540> they

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
to be honest but pedestrians okay they

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.370 
to be honest but pedestrians okay they
don't<00:03:12.290> need<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.500> take<00:03:12.620> any<00:03:12.769> test<00:03:13.160> at<00:03:13.370> all<00:03:13.580> I

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
don't need to take any test at all I

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:24.039 
don't need to take any test at all I
think<00:03:15.380> that's<00:03:15.530> really<00:03:15.650> unfair<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.510> my

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
think that's really unfair so my

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.839 
think that's really unfair so my
proposal<00:03:24.200> is<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:25.060> all<00:03:26.060> pedestrians<00:03:27.610> have<00:03:28.610> to

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
proposal is this all pedestrians have to

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.180 
proposal is this all pedestrians have to
have<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.209> same<00:03:29.420> sort<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.840> testing<00:03:30.349> as<00:03:30.530> bikes

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
have the same sort of testing as bikes

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.390 
have the same sort of testing as bikes
do<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:33.140> wall<00:03:33.290> pedestrians<00:03:33.890> have<00:03:33.980> got<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.250> go

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
do the wall pedestrians have got to go

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.640 
do the wall pedestrians have got to go
for<00:03:34.670> compulsory<00:03:35.269> pedestrian<00:03:35.930> testing<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:36.560> the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
for compulsory pedestrian testing so the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.979 
for compulsory pedestrian testing so the
cpt<00:03:37.480> okay<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.519> that's<00:03:40.940> not<00:03:41.269> valid<00:03:41.660> once

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
cpt okay that is that's not valid once

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.009 
cpt okay that is that's not valid once
they<00:03:42.140> do<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.319> they<00:03:43.130> can<00:03:43.310> be<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.489> pedestrian<00:03:44.120> as

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
they do that they can be a pedestrian as

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.009 
they do that they can be a pedestrian as
long<00:03:45.790> as<00:03:46.790> they<00:03:46.940> walk<00:03:47.120> around<00:03:47.480> with<00:03:47.750> an<00:03:47.840> elf

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
long as they walk around with an elf

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.539 
long as they walk around with an elf
late<00:03:48.519> on<00:03:49.519> their<00:03:49.819> back<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.299> front<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:52.250> they

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
late on their back and front and they

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.240 
late on their back and front and they
could<00:03:52.700> do<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:52.940> for<00:03:53.000> two<00:03:53.299> years<00:03:54.010> by<00:03:55.010> which

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
could do that for two years by which

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.780 
could do that for two years by which
point<00:03:55.989> when<00:03:56.989> it<00:03:57.079> comes<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.440> two<00:03:57.620> years<00:03:57.920> if<00:03:58.489> they

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
point when it comes to two years if they

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.180 
point when it comes to two years if they
haven't<00:03:59.000> done<00:03:59.870> their<00:04:00.079> full<00:04:00.290> pedestrian<00:04:00.889> test

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
haven't done their full pedestrian test

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.819 
haven't done their full pedestrian test
I<00:04:01.549> have<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.299> go<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.600> repeat<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.170> compulsory

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
I have to go and repeat the compulsory

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.970 
I have to go and repeat the compulsory
pedestrian<00:04:04.430> training<00:04:04.819> again<00:04:05.889> and<00:04:06.889> I<00:04:06.950> think

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
pedestrian training again and I think

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.160 
pedestrian training again and I think
that's<00:04:07.370> fair<00:04:07.639> I<00:04:07.970> think<00:04:08.660> that's<00:04:08.810> very<00:04:08.900> very

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
that's fair I think that's very very

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.700 
that's fair I think that's very very
fair

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:22.560 

Oh<00:04:12.810> dick<00:04:15.090> Frank<00:04:19.050> so<00:04:20.490> module<00:04:21.490> one<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:22.270> being<00:04:22.480> a

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
Oh dick Frank so module one the being a

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.270 
Oh dick Frank so module one the being a
pedestrian<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:25.270> maneuvers<00:04:26.010> first<00:04:27.010> of<00:04:27.160> all

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
pedestrian the maneuvers first of all

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.760 
pedestrian the maneuvers first of all
you<00:04:27.550> have<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.360> ensure<00:04:28.720> that<00:04:29.190> one<00:04:30.190> bag

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
you have to ensure that one bag

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.650 
you have to ensure that one bag
it's<00:04:32.340> put<00:04:32.639> in<00:04:33.389> front<00:04:33.629> of<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.960> other<00:04:33.990> leg<00:04:35.660> this

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
it's put in front of the other leg this

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.140 
it's put in front of the other leg this
maneuver<00:04:37.139> is<00:04:37.289> called<00:04:37.560> walking<00:04:37.949> I<00:04:40.940> don't<00:04:41.940> even

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
maneuver is called walking I don't even

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.480 
maneuver is called walking I don't even
think<00:04:42.330> about<00:04:42.479> it<00:04:42.770> so<00:04:43.770> what<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.009> pedestrian

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
think about it so what the pedestrian

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.719 
think about it so what the pedestrian
must<00:04:44.669> do<00:04:44.849> is<00:04:45.479> be<00:04:45.750> able<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:46.020> walk<00:04:46.340> slow<00:04:47.340> speed

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
must do is be able to walk slow speed

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.460 
must do is be able to walk slow speed
and<00:04:48.360> then<00:04:48.539> be<00:04:48.690> able<00:04:48.780> to<00:04:48.930> come<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.259> stop

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
and then be able to come to a stop

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.800 
and then be able to come to a stop
within<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.500> predefined<00:04:54.050> set<00:04:55.050> of<00:04:55.080> two<00:04:55.379> cones<00:04:56.810> the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
within a predefined set of two cones the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.029 
within a predefined set of two cones the
next<00:04:58.080> blue<00:04:58.259> of<00:04:58.319> the<00:04:58.379> pedestrian<00:04:58.860> could<00:04:58.949> do

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
next blue of the pedestrian could do

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.379 
next blue of the pedestrian could do
alone<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.550> won't<00:04:59.759> go<00:04:59.879> into<00:04:59.909> all<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.300> details

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
alone I won't go into all the details

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.080 
alone I won't go into all the details
because<00:05:01.229> it's<00:05:02.009> a<00:05:02.099> work<00:05:02.280> in<00:05:02.310> progress<00:05:02.639> but

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
because it's a work in progress but

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.089 
because it's a work in progress but
basically<00:05:03.569> the<00:05:03.900> pedestrian<00:05:04.380> has<00:05:04.740> got<00:05:04.949> to<00:05:05.069> be

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
basically the pedestrian has got to be

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.240 
basically the pedestrian has got to be
able<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.639> walk<00:05:06.360> in<00:05:06.539> a<00:05:06.630> circle<00:05:06.840> but<00:05:07.740> su<00:05:07.860> has<00:05:08.009> got

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
able to walk in a circle but su has got

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.520 
able to walk in a circle but su has got
to<00:05:08.400> start<00:05:08.669> walking<00:05:08.880> stop<00:05:09.659> walking<00:05:09.840> pedestrian

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
to start walking stop walking pedestrian

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.950 
to start walking stop walking pedestrian
must<00:05:11.099> always<00:05:11.310> observe<00:05:11.880> what<00:05:12.419> is<00:05:12.539> going<00:05:12.810> on
