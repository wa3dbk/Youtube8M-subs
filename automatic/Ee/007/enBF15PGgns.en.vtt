00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.589
 today we prepare falafel that you know 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.960
 no more chickpea balls 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.809
 franzoni that hot country calls in 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.839
 egypt then to move maghreb everything 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.270
 Middle East to arrive even for 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.310
 we need this and chickpeas 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.080
 parsley of red onions of the hague 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 if you want olive oil for 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.310
 subsequently fry meatballs on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.230
 coriander powder cumin a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.240
 little bit of baking powder and in the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.309
 rocket warrior as the first step 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:40.739
 we press the two red onions the wounds 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:42.450
 I love very finely just outlined 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.309
 onions here if you don't want to cry like 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.180
 they are doing right now while 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.280
 irritated respected on the mouth ok 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.780
 having said this once the onions are created 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.699
 we must use garlic in this 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 case the falafels that I will do 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.300
 I will avoid putting garlic because for me 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.390
 they are a little bit lighter 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.760
 no longer the tastiest so let's proceed 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.470
 will be and let's try the parsley 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.470
 just as finely as the onion 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.820
 does not cease that to blend helping us with a 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.409
 chickpea dipping trainer and after that 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.979
 we will assemble all the other ingredients 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.979
 agree 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.649
 we got this compound here 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.979
 very generous very dense a lot 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:43.719
 compact and we play the onion e 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:43.719
 deserved parsley 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.500
 let's take the coriander cumin e 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.500
 let's put a teaspoon each 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.290
 then half a teaspoon of yeast in 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.290
 powder 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:13.459
 let 's start with net and salt once that 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.319
 we have combined all the ingredients 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.090
 we amalgamate with a put in wood in 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.989
 this case very gently 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.950
 remembered that he put the yeast in it 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.950
 so he covered it like that 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.299
 let's leave a medium to rise 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.500
 after which we will make the meatballs 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:43.610
 then about half an hour later 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.700
 resume our dough is a 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.250
 a little bit avoided as you see and in 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.380
 meanwhile that each end to prepare 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.380
 meatballs let's put the oil on the fire 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.000
 then with the dough for the falafel 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.189
 we make some taps I realized 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.170
 which kneads a little wet must 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.610
 this depends on the quality of chickpeas here 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.760
 but I got a little bit in 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.260
 flour to thicken the whole 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.650
 amount of flour clearly goes to 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.790
 eye and goes to what the dough is yes 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.599
 compact then try slowly 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.599
 spoon after spoon 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:51.200
 if the end is ready to eat well 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.200
 warm easy in which click
