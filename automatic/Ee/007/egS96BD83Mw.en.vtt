00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.819
 hi to all guys and welcome back 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.339
 finally in this new video in which 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:31.460
 I propose the review of the brand new 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.380
 universal doc lightning distributed by 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.270
 Apple has also been around for a few months now 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.030
 we will make a small comparison with his 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.580
 predecessor the iPhone 5 dock 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.200
 two different philosophies because something is 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.480
 changed between these two docs 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.950
 let's go straight to analyzing and seeing them 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.450
 if the game is worth the candle 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.670
 well when I used to say two philosophies 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.829
 I really meant different in truth 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.630
 sense of the word because in comparison yes 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.790
 can immediately understand that before 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.100
 publish this new dock that has a 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.980
 little twisted apple all the usual 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.680
 release a dock for each device 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.079
 so there was the doc made especially for the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.759
 size of the iphone 5 c doc done 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.679
 affixed for the size of the iPhone 5 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.200
 s that 's what you see in this case 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.609
 on the right the document made for the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.579
 even the size of the iPhone 5 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.380
 then each doc for each device on 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.840
 which obviously brought an expense 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.520
 decidedly wider while this 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.859
 new dock that what you see on the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.539
 left has no boundaries of the 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.689
 barriers simply has the door 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.889
 lightning and that's it so it's a dock 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.719
 universal that works with all 

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.639
 iphone models of course with the 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.920
 door lightning with all models of 

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:39.139
 ipod touch with all ipad models 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.539
 mini even if it is not specified but there is 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:44.539
 I say I am perfectly compatible and in 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.659
 some cases even with some model of 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.999
 normal ipad but I'm a bit in the 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.189
 doubts compared with the old docs 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.889
 as you can see it is identical to simply 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.929
 3.5mm headphone jack input 

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:59.299
 to which you can connect either 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.819
 headphone is the speaker then 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.359
 obviously attacking the iPhone at the base 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.009
 at the dock 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.289
 if we were to reproduce one 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.270
 song will be transmitted via the 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.880
 headphones or through the case anyway 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.780
 you connected us and obviously the door 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.980
 lightning 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.230
 attach the cable for charging 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.160
 so nothing changed compared to 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.290
 previous model 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.780
 what has changed is above all 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.970
 the size because the new dock is 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.640
 slightly thinner and from a shape 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.530
 more flat than the old one below 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.569
 to the lightning door which serves as a 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.220
 hold the device before there was 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.020
 just an excavation now that instead 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.660
 dimensions must be universal and 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.870
 standard there is a small piece of rubber 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.790
 durable that serves to allow the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.340
 device to stand raised compared 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.110
 to the plastic of the dock in such a way that 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.430
 maybe when we play 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.500
 a song that is played for 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.510
 middle of the device's speakers 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.000
 the crates do not crash into the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.890
 hard and the audio could ruin a 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.200
 little this is basically the 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.819
 role of the small plastic pad 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.780
 which was not the case with i 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.700
 previous doc 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.319
 I repeat the thing I like best about 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.300
 this doc that is practically compatible 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.069
 with everyone in the devices because the 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.840
 most apple devices that 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.610
 I have at home and lightning and I must say that 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.720
 they all adapt very well to the 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.640
 dimensions of this doc 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.660
 I did the test with my phone 6 col 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.630
 my iphone 5 with my ipod touch 5 e 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.400
 all are really stable in all and 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.380
 four directions so don't dance 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.299
 neither left nor right what 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.280
 instead I was expecting it since there is not 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.350
 more are the side barriers but a 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.060
 apparently the lightning outlet is just that 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.370
 obviously not even dancing forward or 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.370
 before he had mentioned that it was 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.650
 semi compatible with ipad and I say seeds 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.120
 compatible because the first days like 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.100
 see it held it perfectly ipad 2 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.850
 in this case he was on that one 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.130
 wonder 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.440
 after a while it has not been 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.880
 on my idea it was that continuing to 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.989
 put the ipad on 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.120
 at some point he ended up 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.130
 incline slightly too much la 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.959
 lightning socket and then now on for the 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.120
 center of gravity and no longer able to maintain 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.040
 on an ipad anyway up to the ipad mini 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.780
 compatibility is guaranteed 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.420
 another point in favor of this doc is 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.549
 which is compatible with the covers what 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.160
 the old docs didn't have any covers 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.410
 type cover spes cover wallet 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.120
 really any kind of cover e 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.489
 this is something I appreciate because the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.660
 my iphone 6 currently has a cover 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.610
 so first he will not have 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.560
 could absolutely mount it on a dock 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.150
 in practical use maybe for those 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.500
 must do tutorials or for those who must 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.090
 use on the desk 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.520
 I must say that it is comfortable as I have already said 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.370
 first it is stable and also when the user 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.710
 goes to press with the finger on the screen 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.240
 the iphone does not move practically by one 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.670
 mm here maybe with the devices 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.680
 larger like iphone 6 fonsai plus 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.460
 if we really go to shake a 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.450
 left and right could do some 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.280
 inclination but this is normal too 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.080
 because these docs are not meant for 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.360
 do the rocking are meant for a 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.680
 touch forward or backward not a 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.050
 left or right 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.380
 I repeat potentially can be 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.170
 also compatible with normal ipads but 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.880
 don't do it because you could be impoverished 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.860
 in the same problem that I had 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.720
 as you see surprisingly when 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.550
 it worked well it also worked if that 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.620
 the user wrote or otherwise gave a 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.630
 tap on the obvious screen not too much 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.310
 we must not make the goiters as strong 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.470
 I did it in this case but anyway 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.780
 with a normal rin touch that worked 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.240
 it worked well and held it without it 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.210
 problems a hypothesis is that maybe indeed 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.190
 definitely gluing it to the table and there 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.930
 also reads a normal and non ipad 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.940
 should have problems because the glue 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.160
 compensates for the strength more than from the iPad 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.470
 here's obviously if you put an ipad in it 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.780
 her2 left to right will move that 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.790
 it's a pleasure it's normal because this doc 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.830
 in theory it is meant only for the 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.720
 iphone wouldn't even be thought of for 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.669
 the ipad even if the ipad mini is 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.830
 perfectly compatible therefore boys 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.780
 in this video I simply gave you 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.970
 a quick demonstration of what it is 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.350
 one month of use of this doc 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.630
 I wish you were seeing a shot of 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.490
 profile the iphone is obviously not required 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.470
 perfectly straight but that's right 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.419
 an apple choice always makes after a 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.450
 a little more inclined thing than anyway 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:08.000
 I like the design and the pluses are eye-catching 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.919
 there are many of this doc and last 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.910
 the price this touches is available 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:16.640
 at the store for a price of 45 euros 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.440
 I know it's a lot but I can guarantee you that 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.630
 once you bought it you won't have it 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.280
 problems and miss us later 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.930
 all that costs said that 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.020
 guys I hope this review 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.520
 of the universal doc lightning there is 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.919
 liked it if so let me know 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.350
 leaving a nice thumb up that helps 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.300
 the dog 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.370
