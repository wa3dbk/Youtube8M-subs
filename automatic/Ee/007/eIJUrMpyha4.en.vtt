when<00:00:02.129> you<00:00:02.250> have<00:00:02.399> repeated<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.000> steps<00:00:03.300> up<00:00:03.570> to

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
when you have repeated the steps up to

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.070 
when you have repeated the steps up to
the<00:00:03.870> length<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.440> necklace<00:00:05.600> take<00:00:06.600> one<00:00:06.810> seed

also take a crimp bead and put it again
on<00:00:16.619> each<00:00:16.800> end<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.130> your<00:00:17.279> wires<00:00:20.359> this<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.510> not

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
on each end of your wires this is not

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.950 
on each end of your wires this is not
necessary<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:22.619> what<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.960> take

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
necessary but what I like to do is take

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.380 
necessary but what I like to do is take
one<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.500> these<00:00:25.680> little<00:00:25.980> loops<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:27.060> could<00:00:27.240> buy

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
one of these little loops you could buy

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.030 
one of these little loops you could buy
how<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.289> bead<00:00:28.529> store<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.990> answer<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.650> on

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
how to bead store and you answer it on

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.280 
how to bead store and you answer it on
your<00:00:32.309> wire<00:00:32.520> I'm<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:33.989> just

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
your wire I'm just going to do is just

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.630 
your wire I'm just going to do is just
going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.559> protect<00:00:34.920> your<00:00:35.070> wire<00:00:35.250> from<00:00:35.550> breaking

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
going to protect your wire from breaking

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.580 
going to protect your wire from breaking
but<00:00:38.809> it's<00:00:39.809> not<00:00:39.960> necessary<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.290> do

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
but it's not necessary so if you do do

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.709 
but it's not necessary so if you do do
that<00:00:45.260> put<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:46.440> again<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.950> each<00:00:47.360> side<00:00:49.789> and<00:00:50.789> make

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
that put one again on each side and make

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.349 
that put one again on each side and make
sure<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.260> beads<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.829> go<00:00:53.129> through<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:59.359> go

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
sure the beads don't go through it go

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:11.060 
sure the beads don't go through it go
down<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:03.769> pull<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> wire<00:01:05.129> now<00:01:10.070> I'm

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
down like this and pull the wire now I'm

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.450 
down like this and pull the wire now I'm
gonna<00:01:11.250> put<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> other<00:01:12.180> side

take your toggle clasp put it in the end
of<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.080> wire<00:01:52.960> like<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:57.610> this<00:01:58.610> part<00:01:59.050> on<00:02:00.050> the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
of the wire like this this part on the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:13.150 
of the wire like this this part on the
other<00:02:00.350> side<00:02:10.239> like<00:02:11.239> this<00:02:11.920> when<00:02:12.920> you're<00:02:13.040> done

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
other side like this when you're done

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.699 
other side like this when you're done
with<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:14.020> this<00:02:15.020> is<00:02:15.200> when<00:02:15.350> you're<00:02:15.500> going<00:02:15.650> to

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
with that this is when you're going to

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.320 
with that this is when you're going to
start<00:02:15.920> using<00:02:16.130> your<00:02:16.550> tool<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.860> take<00:02:19.100> your<00:02:20.060> crimp

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
start using your tool so take your crimp

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.920 
start using your tool so take your crimp
ring<00:02:20.420> plier<00:02:23.440> put<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.500> right<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:25.600> then<00:02:26.600> what

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
ring plier put it right here then what

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.240 
ring plier put it right here then what
you're<00:02:27.049> going<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.260> do<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.500> you're<00:02:27.620> going<00:02:28.190> to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.990 
you're going to do is you're going to
take<00:02:28.310> your<00:02:28.489> wire<00:02:30.549> and<00:02:31.549> you're<00:02:31.730> going<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.910> go

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
take your wire and you're going to go

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.740 
take your wire and you're going to go
pass<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.480> through<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.920> crimp<00:02:34.250> bead<00:02:35.110> and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
pass it through the crimp bead and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.250 
pass it through the crimp bead and
through<00:02:39.370> seed<00:02:40.370> bead<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.790> previously<00:02:41.180> put<00:02:42.049> on

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
through seed bead you previously put on

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.550 
through seed bead you previously put on
the<00:02:42.500> end<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.709> your<00:02:42.769> wire<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.019> gives<00:02:45.380> it

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
the end of your wire like that gives it

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.020 
the end of your wire like that gives it
double<00:02:45.920> protection<00:02:50.920> like<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.850> then

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
double protection like this and then

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.500 
double protection like this and then
just<00:02:53.750> pull<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.380> out<00:02:56.709> like<00:02:57.709> this<00:02:58.180> they<00:02:59.180> want<00:02:59.450> to

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
just pull it out like this they want to

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.300 
just pull it out like this they want to
leave<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> little<00:02:59.870> bit<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.049> space<00:03:00.410> because<00:03:01.130> you

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
leave a little bit of space because you

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.699 
leave a little bit of space because you
don't<00:03:01.489> want<00:03:01.549> your<00:03:01.760> wire<00:03:01.940> be<00:03:02.180> too<00:03:02.329> tense<00:03:03.730> then

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
don't want your wire be too tense then

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:20.790 
don't want your wire be too tense then
you're<00:03:06.709> gonna<00:03:06.860> take<00:03:09.310> your<00:03:10.310> crimping<00:03:10.730> flyer<00:03:14.530> be

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.710 

make<00:03:21.800> sure<00:03:21.830> it's<00:03:22.220> tight<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.420> don't<00:03:23.570> want

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
make sure it's tight so you don't want

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.120 
make sure it's tight so you don't want
it<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.930> let<00:03:24.110> go<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.470> break<00:03:26.560> do<00:03:27.560> same<00:03:27.830> on<00:03:28.010> the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
it to let go and break do same on the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
it to let go and break do same on the
other<00:03:28.160> side<00:03:29.860> take<00:03:30.860> your<00:03:30.980> wire<00:03:34.870> put<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:35.990> through

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
other side take your wire put it through

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.040 
other side take your wire put it through
the<00:03:38.150> crimp<00:03:38.420> bead<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:40.030> CBD<00:03:41.030> previously<00:03:41.720> put<00:03:41.900> on

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
the crimp bead and CBD previously put on

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.430 
the crimp bead and CBD previously put on
there<00:03:42.400> again<00:03:43.400> just<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:43.760> sure<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.960> has<00:03:45.110> double

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
there again just so sure it has double

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:54.820 
there again just so sure it has double
protection<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:51.170> is<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.410> tricky<00:03:51.710> part<00:03:53.830> right

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
protection this is the tricky part right

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.090 
protection this is the tricky part right
here<00:03:56.830> then<00:03:57.830> pull<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.220> out<00:03:59.890> make<00:04:00.890> sure<00:04:00.920> it's

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
here then pull it out make sure it's

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.740 
here then pull it out make sure it's
