confidence that they showed against
Chesterfield<00:00:31.099> was<00:00:31.430> just<00:00:31.759> on<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.059> back<00:00:32.210> foot

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
Chesterfield was just on the back foot

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.299 
Chesterfield was just on the back foot
today<00:00:32.720> and<00:00:33.410> that's<00:00:33.530> maybe<00:00:33.800> because<00:00:34.280> of

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
today and that's maybe because of

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.580 
today and that's maybe because of
respect<00:00:34.850> for<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.660> opposition<00:00:35.690> I<00:00:36.230> don't<00:00:36.440> know

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
respect for the opposition I don't know

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.250 
respect for the opposition I don't know
maybe<00:00:36.860> it's<00:00:37.160> it's<00:00:37.580> a<00:00:37.700> fear<00:00:37.940> factor<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.600> just

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
maybe it's it's a fear factor I just

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.200 
maybe it's it's a fear factor I just
thought<00:00:39.440> we<00:00:39.650> we<00:00:40.370> could<00:00:40.580> have<00:00:40.730> given<00:00:40.850> a<00:00:41.030> better

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
thought we we could have given a better

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.500 
thought we we could have given a better
countless<00:00:41.600> of<00:00:41.870> ourselves<00:00:42.410> but<00:00:42.920> in<00:00:43.040> terms<00:00:43.250> of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
countless of ourselves but in terms of

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.870 
countless of ourselves but in terms of
the<00:00:44.510> desire<00:00:45.290> that<00:00:45.590> drive<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.070> determination

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
the desire that drive the determination

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.090 
the desire that drive the determination
the<00:00:47.120> work<00:00:47.300> ethic<00:00:47.600> all<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.620> them<00:00:48.710> things<00:00:48.980> were

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
beaten by by premier league side hull

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.460 
beaten by by premier league side hull
today<00:01:25.909> but<00:01:26.180> we<00:01:26.479> gave<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.750> really<00:01:27.110> good<00:01:27.229> account

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
today but we gave a really good account

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.399 
today but we gave a really good account
of<00:01:27.560> ourselves<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.040> we're<00:01:28.190> unlucky<00:01:28.610> not<00:01:29.240> to

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
of ourselves and we're unlucky not to

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.039 
of ourselves and we're unlucky not to
possibly<00:01:30.409> get<00:01:30.620> something<00:01:31.040> up<00:01:31.159> again<00:01:32.020> yeah<00:01:33.020> I

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
possibly get something up again yeah I

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.230 
possibly get something up again yeah I
think<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:34.520> know<00:01:34.640> there's<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.909> lot<00:01:34.940> of<00:01:35.090> hype

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
think so you know there's a lot of hype

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.899 
think so you know there's a lot of hype
going<00:01:35.510> into<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.840> game<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.890> lot<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.580> confidence

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
going into the game a lot of confidence

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.140 
going into the game a lot of confidence
as<00:01:38.180> well<00:01:38.360> within<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.500> team<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.000> hold<00:01:41.000> squat

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
as well within the team and hold squat

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.200 
as well within the team and hold squat
and<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:41.720> think<00:01:41.900> we're<00:01:42.049> looking<00:01:42.200> for<00:01:42.500> soup<00:01:42.680> again

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
and I think we're looking for soup again

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.370 
and I think we're looking for soup again
so<00:01:44.210> you're<00:01:44.390> out<00:01:44.570> a<00:01:44.600> little<00:01:44.750> bit<00:01:44.869> this<00:01:45.020> point<00:01:45.290> I

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
so you're out a little bit this point I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.830 
so you're out a little bit this point I
think<00:01:45.409> we<00:01:45.619> put<00:01:45.799> good<00:01:45.830> show<00:01:46.820> on<00:01:46.970> for<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.600> fans

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
think we put good show on for the fans

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.149 
think we put good show on for the fans
give<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.140> good<00:01:48.290> account<00:01:48.560> of<00:01:48.619> ourselves<00:01:48.740> and

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
give a good account of ourselves and

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.830 
give a good account of ourselves and
like<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.400> say<00:01:49.520> think<00:01:50.270> we're<00:01:50.390> unlucky<00:01:50.600> not<00:01:50.780> to

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
like to say think we're unlucky not to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.109 
like to say think we're unlucky not to
get<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.080> goal<00:01:51.260> you<00:01:51.710> know<00:01:51.830> maybe<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:52.640> know

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
get a goal you know maybe you know

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:53.830 
get a goal you know maybe you know
something<00:01:53.330> from<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.630> game

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
something from the game

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.959 
something from the game
because<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.950> game<00:01:55.100> started<00:01:55.520> brother<00:01:55.759> from

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
because the game started brother from

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.999 
because the game started brother from
the<00:01:56.030> first<00:01:56.329> half<00:01:56.570> in<00:01:56.750> fact<00:01:56.960> was<00:01:57.380> very<00:01:57.560> even<00:01:57.950> and

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
the first half in fact was very even and

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.279 
the first half in fact was very even and
we're<00:01:58.189> probably<00:01:58.520> had<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.149> closest<00:01:59.899> gentlemen

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
we're probably had the closest gentlemen

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.510 
we're probably had the closest gentlemen
they<00:02:00.380> had<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.560> good<00:02:00.770> chance<00:02:00.979> with<00:02:01.159> Danny<00:02:01.310> Graham

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
they had a good chance with Danny Graham

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.740 
they had a good chance with Danny Graham
possibly<00:02:01.939> should<00:02:02.090> have<00:02:02.179> scored<00:02:02.359> but<00:02:02.479> very

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
possibly should have scored but very

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.929 
possibly should have scored but very
cool<00:02:03.020> when<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:03.740> extremely<00:02:04.069> close<00:02:04.310> close<00:02:04.819> to

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
cool when the extremely close close to

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.450 
cool when the extremely close close to
give<00:02:05.060> us<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.329> late<00:02:05.479> yeah<00:02:05.899> first<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:06.920> think<00:02:06.979> you

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
give us the late yeah first I think you

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.369 
give us the late yeah first I think you
know<00:02:07.579> I<00:02:07.609> was<00:02:07.789> a<00:02:07.819> quite<00:02:08.539> an<00:02:08.629> even<00:02:08.869> even<00:02:09.229> game

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
know I was a quite an even even game

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.199 
know I was a quite an even even game
ladies<00:02:09.560> say<00:02:09.800> there<00:02:10.459> wasn't<00:02:10.580> too<00:02:10.759> many<00:02:10.819> chances

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
ladies say there wasn't too many chances

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.949 
ladies say there wasn't too many chances
as<00:02:11.599> such<00:02:12.049> and<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:13.430> think<00:02:14.120> we<00:02:14.180> had<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.810> know

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
as such and I think we had the you know

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.680 
as such and I think we had the you know
who<00:02:15.799> share<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.190> play<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.360> think<00:02:17.569> it's

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
who share of the play and I think it's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.780 
who share of the play and I think it's
fairly<00:02:17.870> even<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.349> I<00:02:18.410> think<00:02:18.620> second<00:02:18.950> half<00:02:19.099> you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
fairly even and I think second half you

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.860 
fairly even and I think second half you
know<00:02:19.879> I<00:02:19.910> think<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.209> first<00:02:20.390> goal<00:02:20.629> was<00:02:20.720> always

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
know I think the first goal was always

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.539 
know I think the first goal was always
gonna<00:02:21.049> be<00:02:21.140> important<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.620> think<00:02:21.680> if<00:02:22.129> they<00:02:22.340> got

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
gonna be important I think if they got

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.850 
gonna be important I think if they got
it<00:02:22.670> we'd<00:02:23.060> have<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.239> go<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.860> that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
it we'd have to go for it and that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.130 
it we'd have to go for it and that
leaves<00:02:25.129> open<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.580> little<00:02:25.730> bit<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.019> first

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
leaves open a little bit so the first

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.020 
leaves open a little bit so the first
goal<00:02:27.380> was<00:02:27.470> important<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.130> amongst<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:28.910> get

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
goal was important and amongst you get

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.660 
goal was important and amongst you get
that<00:02:29.180> how<00:02:29.720> close<00:02:29.989> did<00:02:30.170> we<00:02:30.829> went<00:02:31.040> even<00:02:31.250> close<00:02:31.430> up

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
that how close did we went even close up

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.430 
that how close did we went even close up
three<00:02:31.819> michael<00:02:32.150> 10<00:02:32.360> minutes<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:33.110> one<00:02:33.319> of

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
three michael 10 minutes it's one of

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.050 
three michael 10 minutes it's one of
them<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.829> goes<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.190> it's<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.430> wonder<00:02:34.730> goal<00:02:34.760> to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
them if it goes in it's a wonder goal to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.449 
them if it goes in it's a wonder goal to
put<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.450> lead<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.900> side<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.170> heli<00:02:36.410> ahead<00:02:37.130> against

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
put a lead to side a heli ahead against

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.130 
put a lead to side a heli ahead against
a<00:02:37.519> premier<00:02:37.790> league<00:02:37.910> team<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.390> confidence

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
a premier league team the confidence

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.199 
a premier league team the confidence
would<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.440> step<00:02:39.590> through<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.980> siding<00:02:40.370> yeah

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
would you step through the siding yeah

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.580 
would you step through the siding yeah
definitely<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.870> mean<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.049> was<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.200> great<00:02:42.349> strike

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
definitely I mean it was a great strike

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.160 
definitely I mean it was a great strike
from<00:02:42.739> tims<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.220> know<00:02:43.599> on<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.810> side<00:02:44.959> of<00:02:44.989> the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
from tims you know on the side of the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.050 
from tims you know on the side of the
bar<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.860> say<00:02:46.069> that<00:02:46.310> goes<00:02:46.489> in<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.819> gives

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
bar and like say that goes in it gives

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.640 
bar and like say that goes in it gives
everyone<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.450> boost<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.870> was<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.049> fans<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.440> boost

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
everyone a boost it was the fans a boost

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.830 
everyone a boost it was the fans a boost
them<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.129> it<00:02:49.579> probably<00:02:49.730> gives<00:02:49.940> whole<00:02:50.510> city<00:02:50.780> a

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
them and it probably gives whole city a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.449 
them and it probably gives whole city a
kick<00:02:51.410> in<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.560> teeth<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.220> know<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.370> think

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
kick in the teeth and you know I think

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.830 
kick in the teeth and you know I think
we'd<00:02:52.730> probably<00:02:52.910> favorites<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.510> go<00:02:53.629> on<00:02:53.720> from

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
we'd probably favorites to go on from

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.050 
we'd probably favorites to go on from
there<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.200> ask<00:02:55.099> the<00:02:55.250> margins<00:02:55.610> in<00:02:55.730> football

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
there but ask the margins in football

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:06.220 
there but ask the margins in football
again<00:02:56.299> going<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.739> we<00:02:57.799> ended<00:02:57.980> up<00:02:58.069> losing<00:02:58.310> again

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.290 

you
