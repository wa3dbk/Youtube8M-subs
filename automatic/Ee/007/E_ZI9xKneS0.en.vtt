00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.559
 be less than youtube friend m 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.000
 referent in fact told another video 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.240
 Well, I bring you a new clip 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.279
 gentlemen clicks to double in the had 24 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.800
 well lords of a new glitch for 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.090
 duplicate any block even if the time 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.610
 I do not like to say what I like most 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.829
 say blocks that break down since 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.230
 they are not all are basically these the 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.360
 block of gold the iron of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.149
 emerald diamond lapis lazuli redstone 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 hay and bale of hay bale of hay 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.050
 are the ones that can be doubled 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.420
 the wood and sandstone and quartz I'm not 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.710
 very sure they can be applied but I 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.060
 I 'm going to the insurance if you want to try 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.950
 with others you can do for your 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.590
 window and well what is it that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.290
 we need first the 11 blocks of 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.690
 material that you want to duplicate second you go 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.970
 to fill your inventory of any 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.739
 Eye material can not or does not have to 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.750
 be wheat seeds you're going to fill it with 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.820
 any material and you're going to leave a 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.680
 space next to the block you want 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.659
 duplicate in this case because I left it 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.880
 the for the 11 blocks and the third 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.890
 you need a kraft table or so 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.049
 Gentlemen eye you need this table 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.270
 because if it does not, the cliché is the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.230
 three things you need is not so much the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.360
 science 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.490
 let's make this cliché is very 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.200
 complicated you're going to have your 11 blocks in 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.970
 the hand or good not necessarily the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.770
 hand once you are in this inventory 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.990
 ok or you already have your space and all that and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.270
 your crafter table you are going to put on your 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.230
 crafter table you go to the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.170
 decorations are going to happen 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.470
 the blocks to the diamonds from the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.020
 blocks to the item and elite to the block as well 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.150
 very fast times as fast as 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.950
 You can though, if it does not come out, you 'll have 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.540
 to take a break and we're going to 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.430
 do again and again and again 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.550
 until it is doubled once a 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.140
 block so good I'll try look 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.000
 I'll keep a tight right now in 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.220
 this moment to apply it from block to 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.530
 diamond and then quickly I'm going to 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.690
 apply diamond to block to duplicate 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.700
 to convert I'm sorry and so the times 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.620
 that can the times that leave if you do not 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.810
 They look , I already have, they would not have 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.820
 12 so how do you realize I have 12 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.340
 blocks no longer 11 and they are totally over 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.650
 two can break us because craft is 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.000
 whatever the point is that if it works 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.580
 it does not have to be anything other than what 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.020
 I did right now if it does not work for you 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.640
 what you will have to do is make a slight 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.500
 pause 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.420
 and when you're converting make a 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.760
 slight pause and then start converting 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.860
 do not do it so fast because not to 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.450
 Sometimes this cliché does not work, I take it 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.819
 a lot because of experience since 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.770
 it's something that you agree with the most 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.840
 duplicating you're learning how to how 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.510
 do it at what time etc. and so on 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.950
 If you look, I already have 13 so I already have 13 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.520
 diamond blocks totally those 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.800
 books I can put back but not 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.870
 and in fact it tastes better if it's in the world 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.700
 of a friend because of the connection 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.920
 that one has it that one has fast the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.810
 connection as the xbox responds fast 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.880
 from things not so well I think that 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.610
 I'm going to make them reach 14 and then I'll 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.290
 cut because when you get to 20 it goes to 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.360
 have a pretty important fact that 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.460
 you will have to take into account so this 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.340
 I will get to 14 to see if it comes out not 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.210
 wait let's see here wait for a 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.010
 moment and I did not leave this fact is 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.680
 question of practice as I had said 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.600
 it's pure practice and look I already have 14 already 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.180
 I have 14 blocks and now what I would do is 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.710
 cut until I'm 20 because I'm going to 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.920
 say an important fact now so 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.590
 I'm going to cut and I look at them right now and then 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.050
 well what happens now when I'm 20 now 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.970
 that you already have 20 what you're going to do is 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.490
 basically the same thing but before 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.370
 start duplicating just go to your 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.110
 inventory and you're going to free up another space 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.780
 now you have now two spaces 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.970
 empty then you're going to do exactly the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.190
 same glitch the blocks the hand over 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.380
 of the kraft table or decorations you go 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.550
 to convert from block to diamond and from 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.320
 diamond i speak 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.910
 That's right gentlemen and we are going to do this 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.490
 same look I have 21 came out to me 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.190
 first and you're going to do this when 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.480
 you already have 40 then when you already have 60 and 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.800
 then you will have to start from scratch 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.900
 not because you'll already have a stack 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.490
 basically and you're going to do exactly what 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.680
 same look, you are all the same 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.180
 basically the only thing that you have to 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.830
 take into account is that you have to 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.920
 make amends 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.780
 is that the more blocks you have the more 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.730
 fast you will have to do that is something 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.070
 what do you have to take finds out 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.080
 in which the fewer blocks you have 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.090
 fact it is necessary to make one as a type 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.920
 pause you do not realize when you arrived 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.560
 is doubling your truth and well 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.060
 Gentlemen, basically, this is right now 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.720
 I'm waiting for them to come out 22 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.030
 little blocks but I do not get to see here 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.770
 no good I do not know why it does not come out but 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.290
 well now this last one is last 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.510
 has to leave does not have to follow and 22 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.670
 that and then that's what you have to 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.830
 do look I already have 22 blocks of 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.870
 totally solid diamonds and then it is 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.730
 that's basically the trick so good 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.530
 I hope you liked it and you know how to give it 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.240
 exite served comment have any questions 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.949
 for coming thing 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.080
 for more videos like this and if you have not 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:03.750
 done so good gentlemen i am bnf
