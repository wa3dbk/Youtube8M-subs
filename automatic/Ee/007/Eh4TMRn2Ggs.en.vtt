00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 moin moin mine the mark of and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.670
 Welcome back to unity and video 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.960
 on my channel my name is children 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.000
 power and today I have for you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.429
 tips and tricks video and it works 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.710
 Today I have the game mode bedburg 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.900
 you my best tips I know 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.970
 picked out and you are in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.020
 Have fun with this video 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.020
 and see you soon 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.320
 so the first tip is 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.940
 already at the beginning in a round and 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.550
 Although it is about you on the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.470
 must consider beginning some things you 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.880
 you have to think about what you are 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.770
 because now should do and I can 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.660
 just give you the recommendation 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.850
 the beginning of a game is easy 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.770
 the hottest is when you slip directly 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.270
 you can have quite a few teams 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.190
 or quite a few beds 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.080
 simply by destroying the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.940
 opponent surprised or very 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.489
 fast easy in the opponent's base 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.470
 stands in the middle of you builds them 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.570
 maybe your house tricks too 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.580
 Runs past them and directly the bed 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.130
 destroyed they are the most 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.080
 overwhelmed very surprised count 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.720
 not with it and you have a team directly 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.970
 build up or a bed destroyed what you 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.680
 you have a certain advantage 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.299
 but take care that the others 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.549
 people not directly in your base 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.080
 can clean or that your bed 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.270
 somehow a bit too 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.580
 or your team is completely waiting and the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.619
 people kill if they want to come to the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.920
 next tip is something very simple though 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.049
 also something very important and 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.000
 take care that you always somehow 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.490
 a pickaxe it does not matter 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.259
 which material is a pickaxe 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.380
 just damn much faster around 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.780
 stones or sens than with the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.520
 hand and no matter which one it is even 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.560
 if it's just the hay pickpick she is 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.479
 is just faster and it provides 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.219
 you more time because sometimes there are the 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.929
 situation there one thinks before now 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.999
 I do not have anything anyway I'm leaving now 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.259
 a little young fashion and quickly 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.850
 I do not want to go in that way 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.920
 lose and then you suddenly get up 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.359
 before the situation where you realize damn 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.249
 I just had the opposing team 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.320
 tricked could build that better 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:08.479
 but you are not enough because you are not 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.310
 It has sometimes succeeded in picking it up 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.990
 one that you still just in the shop 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.670
 the opponent's base can buy 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.380
 but that's still something 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.900
 so be careful, so be careful 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.550
 but always every situation 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.650
 somewhere a pickaxe here you have 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.530
 believe me the bronze or 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.569
 silver is not wasted like that 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.520
 the third tip is a bit simpler 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.350
 but also very very important tip and 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.880
 Please pay attention or you have to 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.520
 Just make sure that you always 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.319
 always enough gold I know that sounds 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.860
 very very simple but you have to do it that way 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.120
 There are many games in the bars 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.070
 Just play on them 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.840
 even with their silver and their own 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.280
 bronze and not big towards the gold 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.350
 build or 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.540
 not big to the middle goldsource 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.340
 think wise, yes I have 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.810
 anyway enough but that my dear 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.280
 friends is just completely 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.100
 wrong because I can tell you that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.750
 Gold is most important in all 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.860
 conscious because many think so too 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.720
 just yes 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.520
 so you can buy bows but 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.470
 Be aware that you still have it 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.140
 How much more can you buy? 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.050
 example of drinks better swords 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.209
 ender beads grenades and so on 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.860
 In any case , if people believe me 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.890
 mastered goldstone dominated so 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.600
 pretty much the game is the fourth tip 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.209
 a damn important tip and that 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.270
 you have to think clearly what 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.590
 wanted to apply for a tactic because that 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.880
 is not simply one better 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.380
 folded as the one or the other 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.020
 thinks but also with one 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.570
 fighting certain tactics and indeed it works 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.340
 therefore, for example, whether we are at the beginning 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.959
 jump right into the middle and in the process 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.550
 Take the risk of that 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.350
 maybe someone directly our pace 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.790
 we do not want to destroy it and we do not want that 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.500
 take the risk of buying that 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.940
 opponents then maybe like and have 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.430
 We do not and keep us at a distance 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.230
 can and if so far though 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.269
 you with people you know together in the 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.459
 ts since you talk a little bit off 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.989
 We want to apply what race tactics and 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.000
 otherwise perhaps via the chat 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.920
 Talk to your team a bit and 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.080
 considering doing exactly what now 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.850
 maybe best and how it works 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.620
 said who controls the goldstone 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.570
 dominates almost the whole game and how 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.190
 of course that's what you do 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.140
 tactics differently maybe knew about 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.940
 beginning at the beginning and keeping the and 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.670
 tried to hold your position there 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.400
 or you just go with armor later 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.780
 and swear and try in you 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.340
 forcibly or whatever 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.500
 always in any case you think about one 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.850
 tactics and does not just play on me 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.620
 Run in now and die 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.419
 so people we are already at 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.550
 fifth and therefore last tip 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.040
 arrived and this tip my friends 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.440
 is a very very very important one 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.320
 or very simple trick and 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.780
 although you have to become aware of one thing 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.180
 in battles and that the floors mostly 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.620
 even more important than swords it 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.330
 There are many people who like to try 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.250
 Just say that a bit 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.630
 keep traveling and then always go 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.240
 swear on it but I can you 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.069
 say that if you 're in bow h 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.410
 Can you make the game much better 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.569
 control as with a sword because 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.280
 Both are well known 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.660
 that you have to build yourself the way 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.710
 and most of the time you need it 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.169
 a blog a big way over to the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.849
 other sports and goldstone and such 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.620
 continue and you just have to 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.840
 Note that one with a bow 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.639
 the most extreme advantage one can do is people 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.130
 either gentleman subject that much 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.750
 you want to have better equipment 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.550
 Sometimes there are situations where you 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.169
 Even only in bow has no armor 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.270
 the other with full armor around it 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.190
 Run once a fall hits and the type 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.169
 is still going to take as a matter of course 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.000
 do not forget the bow is damned 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.409
 again important in this game you 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.090
 can the opponents nicely on distance 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.610
 hold and partly you can with it 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.520
 also destroy biting and of course 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.319
 save your pace so that was it now 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.909
 already back from this I video 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.130
 Hope you have the tips and a little bit 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.750
 have helped further if this is so 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.180
 then leave us a positive rating 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.770
 I would be very happy in any case 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.020
 and I would say we are in 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.250
 if one of my next videos again 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.349
 you liked it as said 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.539
