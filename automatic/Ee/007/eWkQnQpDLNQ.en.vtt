00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
I connected with some of the Yard House

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.750 
I connected with some of the Yard House
founders<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.260> they<00:02:40.710> liked<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.550> was<00:02:41.640> doing

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
founders and they liked what I was doing

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.570 
founders and they liked what I was doing
and<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:43.380> know<00:02:43.500> did<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.800> first<00:02:44.010> restaurant

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
and you know did the first restaurant

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.790 
and you know did the first restaurant
and<00:02:45.000> at<00:02:45.180> first<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.660> was<00:02:45.780> pretty<00:02:45.960> edgy<00:02:46.530> for<00:02:46.770> a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
and at first it was pretty edgy for a

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.560 
and at first it was pretty edgy for a
restaurant<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:47.550> then<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.820> kind<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.180> people

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
restaurant but then it kind of people

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.340 
restaurant but then it kind of people
seemed<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.110> it

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
seemed to like it

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.200 
seemed to like it
I<00:02:49.470> guess<00:02:49.680> they<00:02:49.980> connected<00:02:50.730> with<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.060> and

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
I guess they connected with it and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.210 
I guess they connected with it and
that's<00:02:51.360> how<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.720> happened<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.440> I've<00:02:53.010> been

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.470 
that's how it happened and I've been
doing<00:02:53.340> all<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.640> them<00:02:53.880> ever<00:02:54.000> since

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
doing all of them ever since

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.350 
doing all of them ever since

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
I really like this see I don't

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.950 
I really like this see I don't
particularly<00:03:00.870> like<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.530> area<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.600> love<00:03:03.600> this

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
particularly like this area I love this

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.790 
particularly like this area I love this
and<00:03:04.380> sometimes<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.920> like<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.460> this<00:03:06.560> all<00:03:07.560> in

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
and sometimes I like that this all in

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.080 
and sometimes I like that this all in
here<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:10.260> can't<00:03:10.530> do<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:10.950> if<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.250> tried<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.670> you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
here you can't do it if you tried it you

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.690 
here you can't do it if you tried it you
know<00:03:12.239> could<00:03:12.840> never<00:03:13.050> do<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:16.310> see<00:03:17.310> when<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.550> do

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
know could never do it see when you do

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.620 
know could never do it see when you do
abstract<00:03:18.180> work<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:19.560> can't<00:03:19.800> copy<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:21.510> would

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
abstract work you can't copy it it would

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.570 
abstract work you can't copy it it would
be<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:21.959> taking<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.500> bunch<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.130> sand<00:03:23.370> and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
be like taking a bunch of sand and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.920 
be like taking a bunch of sand and
throwing<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> ground<00:03:24.209> with<00:03:24.570> paint<00:03:24.840> on

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
throwing it on the ground with paint on

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.390 
throwing it on the ground with paint on
it<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.560> could<00:03:25.709> never<00:03:25.860> throw<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.310> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
it you could never throw it on the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.250 
it you could never throw it on the
ground<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.760> same<00:03:26.940> way<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.540> just<00:03:27.570> can't<00:03:27.900> do<00:03:28.080> it

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
ground the same way you just can't do it

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.050 
ground the same way you just can't do it
doesn't<00:03:28.680> work<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:29.100> way<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:29.820> the

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
doesn't work that way so it's the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.510 
doesn't work that way so it's the
spontaneity<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.320> surprise<00:03:31.830> that<00:03:32.250> just

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
spontaneity and the surprise that just

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.770 
spontaneity and the surprise that just
it's<00:03:33.170> fantastic

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.340 

and<00:03:39.760> sometimes<00:03:40.760> some<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.780> most

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
and sometimes some of the most

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.910 
and sometimes some of the most
spontaneous<00:03:42.760> pieces<00:03:43.760> are<00:03:43.910> just<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.840> best<00:03:45.020> and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
spontaneous pieces are just the best and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.520 
spontaneous pieces are just the best and
I'm<00:03:46.100> sure<00:03:46.460> musicians<00:03:47.210> sometimes<00:03:47.840> they<00:03:47.960> write

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
I'm sure musicians sometimes they write

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.350 
I'm sure musicians sometimes they write
something<00:03:49.010> is<00:03:49.100> just<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:49.490> unbelievably

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
something is just so unbelievably

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.020 
something is just so unbelievably
powerful<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:51.110> you<00:03:51.200> can<00:03:51.380> try<00:03:52.280> for<00:03:52.340> 20<00:03:52.790> years

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
powerful and you can try for 20 years

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.700 
powerful and you can try for 20 years
and<00:03:53.270> there's<00:03:53.660> one<00:03:53.930> song<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.560> they've
