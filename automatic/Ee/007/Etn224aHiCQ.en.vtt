here<00:00:31.789> guys<00:00:32.059> I<00:00:32.360> don't<00:00:33.079> think<00:00:33.199> Atlantis<00:00:34.070> is

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
here guys I don't think Atlantis is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.189 
here guys I don't think Atlantis is
going<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.430> be<00:00:34.550> from<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:34.760> pack<00:00:35.180> 2<00:00:35.480> in<00:00:35.719> fact<00:00:36.019> I

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
going to be from that pack 2 in fact I

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.259 
going to be from that pack 2 in fact I
highly<00:00:36.589> doubt<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:36.980> do<00:00:37.819> I<00:00:37.850> think<00:00:37.940> eventually

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
highly doubt it do I think eventually

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.849 
highly doubt it do I think eventually
they'll<00:00:38.839> come<00:00:39.019> out<00:00:39.140> with<00:00:39.260> it<00:00:39.409> may<00:00:39.620> be<00:00:39.679> from

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
they'll come out with it may be from

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.290 
they'll come out with it may be from
that<00:00:39.920> pad<00:00:40.309> 3<00:00:40.609> or<00:00:41.059> map<00:00:41.899> pack<00:00:42.199> for<00:00:42.679> yes<00:00:43.609> all<00:00:43.940> right

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
that pad 3 or map pack for yes all right

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.149 
that pad 3 or map pack for yes all right
I<00:00:44.329> think<00:00:44.510> matpat<00:00:45.079> for<00:00:45.499> would<00:00:45.679> be<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:45.920> best

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
I think matpat for would be the best

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.819 
I think matpat for would be the best
time<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:47.300> release<00:00:47.600> Atlantis<00:00:48.289> because<00:00:48.620> it's

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
time to release Atlantis because it's

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.759 
time to release Atlantis because it's
such<00:00:49.159> a<00:00:49.190> drastic<00:00:49.609> change<00:00:49.909> in<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.569> environment

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
such a drastic change in the environment

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.099 
such a drastic change in the environment
just<00:00:51.769> like<00:00:51.889> noon<00:00:52.249> was<00:00:52.579> right<00:00:52.940> I<00:00:53.179> mean<00:00:53.960> they

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
just like noon was right I mean they

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:55.360 
just like noon was right I mean they
wanted<00:00:54.289> to<00:00:54.499> really<00:00:54.649> go<00:00:54.859> out<00:00:54.979> with<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.159> big<00:00:55.309> bang

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
wanted to really go out with a big bang

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.840 
wanted to really go out with a big bang
right<00:00:55.999> and<00:00:56.409> they<00:00:57.409> really<00:00:57.889> pulled<00:00:58.159> it<00:00:58.309> off<00:00:58.489> for

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
right and they really pulled it off for

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.449 
right and they really pulled it off for
black<00:00:59.059> ops<00:00:59.299> 1<00:00:59.510> you<00:01:00.350> know<00:01:00.469> for<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.710> last<00:01:00.889> zombie

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:01.459 
black ops 1 you know for the last zombie

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:03.729 
black ops 1 you know for the last zombie
map<00:01:01.789> I<00:01:02.030> think<00:01:02.569> they<00:01:02.659> if<00:01:02.959> they<00:01:03.289> do<00:01:03.350> have<00:01:03.649> an

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
map I think they if they do have an

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.860 
map I think they if they do have an
Atlantis<00:01:04.190> map<00:01:04.400> saved<00:01:04.940> right<00:01:05.120> now<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.600> if<00:01:05.750> it's

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
Atlantis map saved right now and if it's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.279 
Atlantis map saved right now and if it's
already<00:01:06.200> made<00:01:06.700> please<00:01:07.700> save<00:01:08.689> it<00:01:08.840> for<00:01:09.049> last

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
already made please save it for last

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.249 
already made please save it for last
because<00:01:09.770> this<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.729> best<00:01:11.000> one<00:01:11.659> of<00:01:11.719> the<00:01:11.990> best

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
because this is the best one of the best

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.330 
because this is the best one of the best
things<00:01:12.380> that<00:01:12.619> you<00:01:12.710> guys<00:01:12.950> could<00:01:13.159> probably

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
things that you guys could probably

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.600 
things that you guys could probably
introduced<00:01:13.939> at<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.990> very<00:01:15.320> very<00:01:15.439> end<00:01:16.009> I<00:01:16.340> think

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
introduced at the very very end I think

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.959 
introduced at the very very end I think
it<00:01:16.700> would<00:01:16.789> be<00:01:16.850> an<00:01:16.939> awesome<00:01:17.270> idea<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.899> do<00:01:18.020> that

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
it would be an awesome idea to do that

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.440 
it would be an awesome idea to do that
now<00:01:19.969> from<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:20.659> pack<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:22.070> what<00:01:23.000> I'm<00:01:23.210> really

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.770 
now from that pack to what I'm really
interested<00:01:23.570> in<00:01:24.140> alright<00:01:25.009> is<00:01:25.189> maybe<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.329> map

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
interested in alright is maybe a map

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.289 
interested in alright is maybe a map
that<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:27.560> featured<00:01:28.430> in<00:01:28.609> a<00:01:28.789> totally<00:01:29.270> different

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
environment that doesn't necessarily

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.899 
environment that doesn't necessarily
have<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.520> be<00:01:31.579> underwater<00:01:32.200> but<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.469> whole

you'll see like the probably the n64
game<00:02:27.660> pop-up<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:29.070> zombie<00:02:29.520> content<00:02:30.090> I

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.050 
believe this is something really really
cool<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.250> mean<00:02:32.970> like<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.470> base<00:02:34.850> leveraged<00:02:35.850> up

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
cool I mean like a base leveraged up

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.570 
cool I mean like a base leveraged up
into<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.630> sky<00:02:36.960> all<00:02:37.410> right<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.800> couple<00:02:37.980> hundred

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
into the sky all right a couple hundred

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.820 
into the sky all right a couple hundred
feet<00:02:38.760> maybe<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.180> thousand<00:02:39.630> feet<00:02:39.780> up<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.410> think

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
feet maybe a thousand feet up I think

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.590 
feet maybe a thousand feet up I think
that's<00:02:40.980> awesome<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.610> mean<00:02:42.090> imagine<00:02:42.300> like

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
right the whole environment it's just a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.810 
right the whole environment it's just a
torn<00:03:04.560> down<00:03:04.800> building<00:03:05.100> there's<00:03:05.490> nothing
