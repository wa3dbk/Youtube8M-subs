00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
the fractals you'll get it at the end of

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.670 
the fractals you'll get it at the end of
certain<00:00:20.970> fractal<00:00:21.449> levels<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.230> first<00:00:22.470> one

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
certain fractal levels the first one

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.950 
certain fractal levels the first one
you'll<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.189> at<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> end<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.730> level<00:00:23.910> 2<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.600> 4

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
you'll get is at the end of level 2 so 4

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.630 
you'll get is at the end of level 2 so 4
level<00:00:25.199> 2<00:00:25.350> you'll<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.710> your<00:00:25.830> three<00:00:26.099> fractals

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
level 2 you'll do your three fractals

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.790 
level 2 you'll do your three fractals
and<00:00:26.760> then<00:00:27.330> you'll<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.990> oceanic<00:00:28.410> fractal

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
and then you'll get the oceanic fractal

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.580 
and then you'll get the oceanic fractal
as<00:00:28.949> sort<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.490> bonus<00:00:29.849> stage<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.320> can<00:00:31.439> see

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
as sort of a bonus stage so you can see

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
as sort of a bonus stage so you can see
in<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.800> first<00:00:32.040> part<00:00:32.340> there<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:32.579> mobs<00:00:32.969> called

in this first part there are mobs called

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.889 
in this first part there are mobs called
Jade<00:00:34.020> shards<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.329> Irukandji<00:00:36.329> which<00:00:36.660> are

Jade shards and Irukandji which are

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.930 
Jade shards and Irukandji which are
quite<00:00:37.200> similar<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> reef<00:00:38.070> stalkers<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.579> such

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
quite similar to reef stalkers and such

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.180 
quite similar to reef stalkers and such
you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.079> either<00:00:40.200> stop<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> kill<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:40.980> they

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you can either stop and kill this they

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.000 
you can either stop and kill this they
have<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:42.020> variety<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> confusion<00:00:43.620> abilities

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
have a variety of confusion abilities

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.860 
have a variety of confusion abilities
quite<00:00:44.399> frustrating<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.300> honest<00:00:45.570> or<00:00:45.719> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
quite frustrating to be honest or you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.660 
quite frustrating to be honest or you
can<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:46.500> I've<00:00:46.710> done<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.129> run<00:00:47.370> straight

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
can do what I've done and run straight

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.850 
can do what I've done and run straight
through<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.450> first<00:00:48.719> part<00:00:48.899> involves<00:00:49.350> quite<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
through the first part involves quite a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.790 
through the first part involves quite a
bit<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.129> jumping<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.879> prepared<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
bit of jumping so be prepared for that

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.260 
bit of jumping so be prepared for that
you<00:00:52.800> can't<00:00:53.039> stop<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> kill<00:00:53.730> them<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> go

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you can't stop and kill them as you go

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.029 
you can't stop and kill them as you go
obviously<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:55.320> loot<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.649> way<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
obviously you get more loot that way and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.950 
obviously you get more loot that way and
it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.280> safer<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> no<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.420> will<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.719> left

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it is safer in that no one will get left

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.529 
it is safer in that no one will get left
behind<00:00:58.550> it<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.789> depends<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.359> want

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
behind it just depends on what you want

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:14.120 
behind it just depends on what you want
on<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> group<00:01:01.020> wants<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> main<00:01:13.860> part

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
on what the group wants so the main part

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679 
on what the group wants so the main part
this<00:01:14.220> fractal<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:14.939> with<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> Jade<00:01:15.360> more

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
this fractal is to do with the Jade more

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.899 
this fractal is to do with the Jade more
and<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.040> only<00:01:17.250> boss<00:01:17.640> in

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and this is the one and only boss in

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.880 
and this is the one and only boss in
this<00:01:18.150> fractal<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.259> first<00:01:19.470> thing<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.710> need<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
this fractal the first thing you need to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.590 
this fractal the first thing you need to
do<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.310> clear<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> area<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.240> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> take

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
do is clear the area you want to take

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.240 
do is clear the area you want to take
out<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> Irukandji<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:22.920> tentacles

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
out the Irukandji and the two tentacles

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.249 
out the Irukandji and the two tentacles
there<00:01:23.580> note<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> Irukandji<00:01:25.049> will

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
there note that the Irukandji will

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.320 
there note that the Irukandji will
continue<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> spawn<00:01:26.040> until<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> two

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
continue to spawn until the two

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780 
continue to spawn until the two
tentacles<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.990> down<00:01:28.380> you'll<00:01:29.250> need<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> range

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
tentacles are down you'll need to range

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
tentacles are down you'll need to range
down<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> tentacles<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> huge

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
down the tentacles as they have a huge

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.179 
down the tentacles as they have a huge
AoE<00:01:32.130> knock<00:01:32.490> back<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.240> huge<00:01:33.270> damage<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> real

AoE knock back and a huge damage so real

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.130 
AoE knock back and a huge damage so real
pain<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> deal<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:35.790> sometimes<00:01:36.090> when<00:01:37.049> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
pain to deal with sometimes when you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.749 
pain to deal with sometimes when you
have<00:01:37.170> new<00:01:37.500> tentacle<00:01:37.890> spawn<00:01:38.159> you'll<00:01:38.400> also<00:01:38.520> need

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
have new tentacle spawn you'll also need

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.789 
have new tentacle spawn you'll also need
to<00:01:38.820> nuke<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:39.720> two<00:01:39.869> down<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.320> fast<00:01:40.619> as

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
to nuke one or two down as fast as

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.440 
to nuke one or two down as fast as
possible<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.610> enough<00:01:41.820> room<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.329> move

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
get nuked by the Jade more what you want

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.350 
get nuked by the Jade more what you want
to<00:02:14.980> happen<00:02:15.130> is<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:15.640> target<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.090> pick<00:02:16.120> up

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
to happen is for this target to pick up

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.180 
to happen is for this target to pick up
a<00:02:16.510> reflecting<00:02:16.990> crystal<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.620> crystal<00:02:17.650> then

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
a reflecting crystal the crystal then

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.860 
a reflecting crystal the crystal then
gets<00:02:18.370> charged<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.270> throw<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.660> back

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
gets charged and then you throw it back

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.380 
gets charged and then you throw it back
at<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.350> Jade<00:02:20.560> more<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.000> only<00:02:22.030> way<00:02:22.330> to

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
at the Jade more this is the only way to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.120 
at the Jade more this is the only way to
damage<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> Jade<00:02:23.050> more<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:23.980> how

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
damage the Jade more so this is how

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.580 
damage the Jade more so this is how
you're<00:02:24.310> going<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.640> complete<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.150> event<00:02:25.590> if

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
you're going to complete the event if

you're going to complete the event if
you<00:02:26.740> can't<00:02:26.950> get<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.430> reflecting<00:02:27.880> crystal<00:02:28.239> or

you can't get to a reflecting crystal or

there simply aren't any close enough you

it for this fractal you'll have to visit
this<00:03:35.099> a<00:03:35.159> few<00:03:35.430> times<00:03:35.489> while<00:03:36.000> leveling<00:03:36.269> through

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
this a few times while leveling through

the<00:03:36.840> fractals<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.440> mist<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.400> not<00:03:38.940> too

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
the fractals the mist but it's not too
