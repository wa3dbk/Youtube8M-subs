I was right this is going to work in a
very<00:00:56.940> similar<00:00:57.239> way<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.989> Nvidia<00:00:58.410> shield

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699

now<00:02:07.299> this<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:07.990> potentially<00:02:08.500> where<00:02:09.250> PC<00:02:10.119> gaming

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
now this is potentially where PC gaming

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.480 
now this is potentially where PC gaming
is<00:02:10.780> going<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.319> take<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.680> massive<00:02:11.980> massive

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
uplift if you think the oculus rift

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.760 
uplift if you think the oculus rift

this<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.190> very<00:02:30.400> very<00:02:30.760> similar<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.540> Google's

it's not quite like that what this

essentially laser etched onto it in real
time<00:04:12.790> and<00:04:13.299> that's<00:04:13.480> what<00:04:13.600> gives<00:04:13.750> us<00:04:13.930> this<00:04:14.019> kind

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
time and that's what gives us this kind

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
front of us now there does seem to be

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.930 
front of us now there does seem to be
another<00:04:18.010> set<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.400> glass<00:04:18.579> there<00:04:18.609> which<00:04:18.850> I

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
another set of glass there which I

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.229 
another set of glass there which I
believe<00:04:19.150> may<00:04:19.329> be<00:04:19.389> some<00:04:19.630> kind<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:19.870> faux

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239

believe may be some kind of faux
called<00:04:20.389> peace<00:04:20.569> essentially<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:21.560> you<00:04:21.650> can

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
called peace essentially so you can

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.080 
called peace essentially so you can

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
always make sure the depth perception is

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.540 
always make sure the depth perception is
correct<00:04:23.710> but<00:04:24.710> it's<00:04:24.860> very<00:04:24.949> interesting

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
correct but it's very interesting

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.249 
correct but it's very interesting

10 include well basically rethinking
what<00:04:35.030> windows<00:04:35.569> 8<00:04:35.750> was<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.440> what<00:04:36.680> windows

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
what windows 8 was and what windows

those two elements together and it

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.240 
those two elements together and it
certainly<00:04:42.289> looks<00:04:42.680> like<00:04:42.889> they've<00:04:43.039> done<00:04:43.220> a

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
certainly looks like they've done a

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.610 
certainly looks like they've done a
pretty<00:04:43.520> good<00:04:43.669> job<00:04:43.880> so<00:04:44.120> far<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.870> lot<00:04:45.440> of<00:04:45.470> the

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
pretty good job so far a lot of the

the technical preview I've actually been

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.499 
the technical preview I've actually been
fixed<00:04:48.860> this<00:04:48.979> time<00:04:49.220> including<00:04:49.940> new<00:04:50.090> features
