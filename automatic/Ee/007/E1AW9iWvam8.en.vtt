what are some things to think about when
you're<00:00:56.640> making<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.180> decision<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.289> yourself

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
first of all personally I don't think

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
first of all personally I don't think
there's<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:06.119> much<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> difference

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
there's that much of a difference

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.469 
there's that much of a difference
between<00:01:07.679> the<00:01:07.890> alto<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:08.490> tenor<00:01:08.759> playing

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
wise they both play quite easier quite

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.880 
wise they both play quite easier quite
easily<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.850> equally<00:01:15.659> are<00:01:15.960> equally<00:01:16.350> hard<00:01:16.649> or

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
easily and equally are equally hard or

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.910

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
equally easy to master just you know you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.499 
equally easy to master just you know you
make<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.190> choice<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> put<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.179> the<00:01:21.299> time

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
make a choice and you put in the time

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.320 
make a choice and you put in the time
and<00:01:21.539> it's<00:01:21.899> it's<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.830> quite<00:01:23.100> equal<00:01:23.549> that

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and it's it's really quite equal that

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.719 
and it's it's really quite equal that
way<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:25.170> having<00:01:25.440> said<00:01:25.649> that<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:25.950> tone<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.580> of

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
way now having said that the tone is of

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.620 
way now having said that the tone is of
course<00:01:27.319> different<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.340> register<00:01:30.149> of<00:01:30.330> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
course different the register of the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.240 
course different the register of the
alto<00:01:30.929> saxophone<00:01:31.319> the<00:01:31.649> smaller<00:01:32.539> version<00:01:33.539> is<00:01:34.250> as

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
alto saxophone the smaller version is as

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.100 
alto saxophone the smaller version is as
I<00:01:35.369> understand<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.209> this<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.720> also<00:01:36.959> quite

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
I understand it and this is also quite

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.869 
I understand it and this is also quite
apparent<00:01:37.350> when<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.619> listen<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.069> it<00:01:38.190> is<00:01:38.340> very

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:38.879 
apparent when you listen to it is very

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:42.770 
apparent when you listen to it is very
close<00:01:39.179> to<00:01:39.239> the<00:01:40.050> female<00:01:40.560> human<00:01:41.280> voice<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.599> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
close to the female human voice so the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.669 
close to the female human voice so the
way<00:01:42.959> it<00:01:43.140> sounds<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.739> tamra<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.879> it<00:01:45.349> the<00:01:46.349> range

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
way it sounds the tamra of it the range

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.779 
way it sounds the tamra of it the range
of<00:01:47.160> it<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:48.090> notes<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.629> very<00:01:48.840> close<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.789> what

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
of it in notes is very close to what

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.089 
of it in notes is very close to what
most<00:01:51.090> human<00:01:51.720> females<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.649> few

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:53.099 
most human females you know a few

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:54.430 
most human females you know a few
exceptions<00:01:53.580> here<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.879> there<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.090> course

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
exceptions here and there of course

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.300 
exceptions here and there of course
about<00:01:55.440> what<00:01:55.709> most<00:01:56.250> human<00:01:56.640> females<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.450> sing

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
about what most human females can sing

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.960 
about what most human females can sing
and<00:01:59.310> the<00:02:00.000> tenor<00:02:00.269> is<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> bit<00:02:02.340> larger

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
and the tenor is you know a bit larger

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.589 
and the tenor is you know a bit larger
and<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.629> it's<00:02:04.440> really<00:02:05.190> closer<00:02:05.519> to<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.300> males

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
and so it's really closer to the males

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.889 
and so it's really closer to the males
with<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.140> sort<00:02:07.410> of<00:02:07.440> a<00:02:07.530> typical<00:02:08.239> human<00:02:09.239> male

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
with the sort of a typical human male

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.410 
with the sort of a typical human male
voice<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.649> think<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.310> really<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
voice and I think that is really the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.160 
voice and I think that is really the
main<00:02:12.920> difference<00:02:14.450> funny<00:02:15.450> enough<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.959> see

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
main difference funny enough you see

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.369 
main difference funny enough you see
that<00:02:16.349> most<00:02:16.670> female<00:02:17.670> players<00:02:18.120> also<00:02:18.390> gravitate

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
that most female players also gravitate

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.220 
that most female players also gravitate
towards<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.250> alto<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.120> many<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
towards the alto and that many of the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.170 
towards the alto and that many of the
well<00:02:22.590> most<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.370> male<00:02:23.580> players<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.060> I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
well most of the male players that I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.600 
well most of the male players that I
know<00:02:24.239> all<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.620> know<00:02:25.709> even<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.099> they<00:02:26.220> start<00:02:26.430> on

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
know all you know even if they start on

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.570 
know all you know even if they start on
Altos<00:02:26.970> slowly<00:02:27.300> gravitate<00:02:28.250> towards<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> tenor

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
Altos slowly gravitate towards the tenor

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.339 
Altos slowly gravitate towards the tenor
saxophone<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.569> happened<00:02:30.900> for<00:02:31.050> me<00:02:31.170> also

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
saxophone this this happened for me also

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.190 
saxophone this this happened for me also
I<00:02:31.530> started<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:32.190> alto<00:02:32.580> but<00:02:33.209> slowly<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.750> found

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
I started on alto but slowly on I found

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.680 
I started on alto but slowly on I found
then<00:02:35.129> I<00:02:35.190> play<00:02:35.430> more<00:02:35.700> comfortably<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.629> I

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
then I play more comfortably and that I

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.170 
then I play more comfortably and that I
just<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:38.250> sound<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.970> tenor

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
just like the sound of the tenor

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.869 
just like the sound of the tenor
saxophone<00:02:39.500> more<00:02:40.500> because<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.040> bit<00:02:41.400> deeper

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
saxophone more because it's a bit deeper

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.910 
saxophone more because it's a bit deeper
it's<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.299> bit<00:02:42.859> lower<00:02:43.859> it's<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.639> bit<00:02:44.849> more

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
it's a bit lower it's a bit more

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.500 
it's a bit lower it's a bit more
you<00:02:46.250> know<00:02:46.900> lusher<00:02:47.900> more<00:02:48.200> more<00:02:48.530> thicker<00:02:48.830> sound

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
you know lusher more more thicker sound

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.420 
you know lusher more more thicker sound
why<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.870> alto<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:51.940> sharper<00:02:52.940> brighter<00:02:54.430> you

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
why the alto is sharper brighter you

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.910 
why the alto is sharper brighter you
know<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.550> little<00:02:55.880> higher<00:02:56.390> damn<00:02:57.200> bro<00:02:57.380> wise<00:02:57.590> and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
know a little higher damn bro wise and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.580 
know a little higher damn bro wise and
it's<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.280> more<00:02:58.690> yeah<00:02:59.690> more<00:02:59.990> more<00:03:00.020> edgier

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
it's just a more yeah more more edgier

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.050 
it's just a more yeah more more edgier
more<00:03:00.860> more<00:03:01.280> female<00:03:02.260> sound<00:03:03.640> that's<00:03:04.640> really<00:03:04.940> the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
more more female sound that's really the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.300 
more more female sound that's really the
main<00:03:05.270> difference<00:03:06.050> now<00:03:06.800> of<00:03:06.890> course<00:03:07.070> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
main difference now of course the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.340 
main difference now of course the
mechanics<00:03:07.820> are<00:03:08.000> pretty<00:03:08.030> much<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.720> same<00:03:08.750> the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
mechanics are pretty much the same the

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.580 
mechanics are pretty much the same the
spacing<00:03:10.100> of<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.430> notes<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.180> know<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.840> the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
spacing of the notes so you know the the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.050 
spacing of the notes so you know the the
location<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.310> your<00:03:13.340> keys<00:03:14.020> on<00:03:15.020> an<00:03:15.320> alto<00:03:15.740> is

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
location of your keys on an alto is

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.240 
location of your keys on an alto is
slightly<00:03:17.060> different<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.900> would<00:03:18.470> say<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.830> of

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
slightly different I would say that of

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.770 
slightly different I would say that of
course<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.730> key<00:03:20.060> pads<00:03:20.330> are<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.540> little<00:03:20.630> bit

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
course the key pads are a little bit

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.870 
course the key pads are a little bit
closer<00:03:21.080> together<00:03:21.470> because<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.220> saxophone<00:03:22.730> is

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
closer together because the saxophone is

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.780 
closer together because the saxophone is
smaller<00:03:23.240> so<00:03:23.930> my<00:03:24.620> personal<00:03:24.950> experience<00:03:25.670> from

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
smaller so my personal experience from

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.940 
smaller so my personal experience from
playing<00:03:26.090> out<00:03:26.330> there<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.470> elta<00:03:27.800> is<00:03:27.920> a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
playing out there is that the elta is a

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.510 
playing out there is that the elta is a
bit<00:03:28.400> easier<00:03:29.240> to<00:03:29.870> play<00:03:30.380> fingering<00:03:31.280> wise

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
bit easier to play fingering wise

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.460 
bit easier to play fingering wise
because<00:03:32.420> everything<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:32.990> just<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.170> little<00:03:33.380> bit

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
because everything is just a little bit

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.620 
because everything is just a little bit
more<00:03:33.680> closer<00:03:34.010> together<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:35.180> just<00:03:35.390> makes

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
more closer together so that just makes

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.990 
more closer together so that just makes
it<00:03:35.840> easier<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.290> grab<00:03:36.590> easier<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.160> hold<00:03:37.280> playing

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
it easier to grab easier to hold playing

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.920 
it easier to grab easier to hold playing
up<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:38.780> down<00:03:39.010> faster<00:03:40.300> might<00:03:41.300> be<00:03:41.540> just<00:03:41.840> a

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
up and down faster might be just a

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.370 
up and down faster might be just a
twelfth<00:03:42.890> easier<00:03:43.340> on<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:44.060> alto<00:03:44.480> but<00:03:45.110> having

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
twelfth easier on the alto but having

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.170 
twelfth easier on the alto but having
said<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:46.340> know<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.490> anything<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.030> can

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
said that you know you anything you can

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.680 
said that you know you anything you can
do<00:03:47.330> on<00:03:47.360> alto<00:03:47.990> you<00:03:48.140> can<00:03:48.380> do<00:03:48.970> on<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.150> tenor<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.510> I

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
do on alto you can do on the tenor and I

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.390 
do on alto you can do on the tenor and I
find<00:03:51.110> that<00:03:51.230> actually<00:03:51.410> we<00:03:51.680> have<00:03:51.709> rather<00:03:52.130> big

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
find that actually we have rather big

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.580 
find that actually we have rather big
hands<00:03:52.820> that<00:03:53.000> for<00:03:53.510> me<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.720> alto<00:03:54.019> feels<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.440> bit

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
hands that for me the alto feels a bit

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.759 
hands that for me the alto feels a bit
like<00:03:54.800> I'm<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.790> know<00:03:55.910> really<00:03:56.720> pushing<00:03:57.200> my

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
like I'm you know really pushing my

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.910 
like I'm you know really pushing my
hands<00:03:58.100> together<00:03:58.430> well<00:03:58.970> well<00:03:59.330> as<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.600> tenor

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
hands together well well as the tenor

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.130 
hands together well well as the tenor
also<00:04:00.920> gives<00:04:01.220> my<00:04:01.400> hands<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:01.910> bit<00:04:02.060> more<00:04:02.330> space<00:04:02.900> so

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
also gives my hands a bit more space so

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.250 
also gives my hands a bit more space so
I<00:04:03.170> find<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.800> more<00:04:04.010> more<00:04:04.610> pleasurable<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:06.080> play

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
I find it more more pleasurable to play

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.449 
I find it more more pleasurable to play
the<00:04:06.440> tenor<00:04:06.709> also<00:04:07.640> for<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.350> reason<00:04:09.350> those<00:04:10.250> are

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
the tenor also for that reason those are

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.460 
the tenor also for that reason those are
really<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.730> two<00:04:10.910> main<00:04:11.180> differences<00:04:11.450> now<00:04:12.200> you

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
really the two main differences now you

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.650 
really the two main differences now you
know<00:04:12.560> any<00:04:12.769> song<00:04:13.070> you<00:04:13.250> can<00:04:13.400> play<00:04:13.430> on<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.330> alto

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
know any song you can play on the alto

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.080 
know any song you can play on the alto
you<00:04:14.930> can<00:04:15.110> play<00:04:15.290> on<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.590> tenor<00:04:15.830> of<00:04:16.700> course<00:04:16.970> a

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
you can play on the tenor of course a

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.630 
you can play on the tenor of course a
voicing<00:04:17.480> is<00:04:17.570> different<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.320> alto<00:04:18.650> is<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:19.459> an

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
voicing is different the alto is is an

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.460 
voicing is different the alto is is an
e-flat<00:04:20.000> instrument<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.019> tenor<00:04:21.260> is<00:04:21.440> a

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
e-flat instrument and the tenor is a

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.530 
e-flat instrument and the tenor is a
b-flat<00:04:21.980> instrument<00:04:22.640> so<00:04:23.120> as<00:04:23.270> far<00:04:23.480> as

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
b-flat instrument so as far as

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.990 
b-flat instrument so as far as
transposing<00:04:24.230> goes<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:25.580> know<00:04:25.669> they're

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
transposing goes you know they're

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.719 
transposing goes you know they're
they're<00:04:26.330> very<00:04:26.570> different<00:04:27.610> instruments<00:04:28.610> of

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
they're very different instruments of

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.700 
they're very different instruments of
course<00:04:28.970> it's<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.510> different<00:04:29.960> tonality<00:04:30.440> that

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
course it's a different tonality that

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.940 
course it's a different tonality that
are<00:04:31.070> tuned<00:04:31.370> in<00:04:31.580> but<00:04:32.450> other<00:04:32.660> than<00:04:32.840> that<00:04:32.950> you

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
are tuned in but other than that you

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.950 
are tuned in but other than that you
know<00:04:33.979> all<00:04:34.280> all<00:04:34.729> repertoire<00:04:35.450> is<00:04:35.690> really

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
know all all repertoire is really

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.080 
know all all repertoire is really
available<00:04:36.200> for<00:04:36.710> both<00:04:36.950> of<00:04:37.250> these<00:04:37.400> saxophones

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
available for both of these saxophones

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.820 
available for both of these saxophones
many<00:04:38.330> people<00:04:38.660> play<00:04:39.500> both<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:39.890> them<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:41.870> that's

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
many people play both of them so that's

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.340 
many people play both of them so that's
really<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.130> main<00:04:43.400> difference<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:44.350> also

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
really the main difference and also

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.560 
really the main difference and also
someone<00:04:45.979> mentioned<00:04:46.430> that<00:04:46.580> you<00:04:46.940> know<00:04:46.970> which<00:04:47.360> is

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
someone mentioned that you know which is

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.020 
someone mentioned that you know which is
a<00:04:47.600> more<00:04:47.900> authentic<00:04:48.290> you<00:04:48.830> know<00:04:49.160> American<00:04:49.760> jazz
