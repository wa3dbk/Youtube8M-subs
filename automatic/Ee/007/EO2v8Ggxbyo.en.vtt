00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
some of the more CNC based

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.039 
some of the more CNC based
computer-based<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:04.030> companies<00:01:04.689> you<00:01:04.900> know

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
computer-based are companies you know

computer-based are companies you know
that<00:01:05.320> I<00:01:05.500> think<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.799> product<00:01:06.009> gets<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.490> little

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that I think the product gets a little

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.260 
that I think the product gets a little
sterile<00:01:08.680> weak<00:01:08.979> and<00:01:09.159> you<00:01:09.400> can<00:01:09.520> sort<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:09.970> tell

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
sterile weak and you can sort of tell

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.840 
sterile weak and you can sort of tell
but<00:01:10.689> you<00:01:10.900> know<00:01:11.259> just<00:01:11.799> wasn't<00:01:12.280> this<00:01:12.490> didn't

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
but you know just wasn't this didn't

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.940 
but you know just wasn't this didn't
have<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.060> real<00:01:13.360> person<00:01:13.930> like<00:01:13.960> running<00:01:14.799> their
