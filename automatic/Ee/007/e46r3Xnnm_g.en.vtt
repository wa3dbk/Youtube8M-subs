herself<00:01:08.369> right<00:01:08.580> now<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.760> mean<00:01:09.650> she's<00:01:10.650> been<00:01:11.010> like

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
herself right now I mean she's been like

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.100 
herself right now I mean she's been like
at<00:01:11.970> first<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.299> had<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.450> little<00:01:12.630> scared<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
at first I had a little scared that I

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
at first I had a little scared that I
thought<00:01:13.320> she<00:01:13.439> might<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.619> had<00:01:13.770> impaction<00:01:14.460> but

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
thought she might have had impaction but

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.100 
thought she might have had impaction but
I<00:01:14.850> think<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.630> taking<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> little

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
I think it was just as taking a little

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.570 
I think it was just as taking a little
while<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> digest<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> food<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.189> was<00:01:17.310> giving
