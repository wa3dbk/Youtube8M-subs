00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.230
 today a favorite toy of children is the video game 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.100
 This was certainly the request of thousands of them to Santa, but the 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.100
 fascination with electronic games is not only 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.609
 many adults demonstrated a mentality and passion 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.900
 does not need to be cured has assembled a mini-game of video games in piracicaba 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.120
 the technology coordinator we have a new generation of game consoles 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.989
 he other action envisaged 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.519
 I prefer to play the old games aÃ§u also exposed all my players 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.580
 telma santos next to remember a bit of history 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.920
 I can already see that they ask for an investigation that someone says 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.999
 and find out all about the releases I have a forecast 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.110
 it is his escape that is a resolution that exists today in the market 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.020
 I turned to the production of wine is what they do than that of man 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.070
 no one new then entered a little time also the question of a year more or 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.730
 any less 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.670
 already the fable throws nothing away 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.930
 have fun with what you have at home 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.270
 the video games in this room are already out of line 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.450
 all still work the searched on the internet all 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.700
 some old ones that productive can not have as children 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.469
 hence my space commented but how to join new and old 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.590
 - an environment 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.710
 was what made the owner of this store in piracicaba on the internet and found 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.250
 some fictitious 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.550
 along with the gadgets you already had that made an exhibition 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.230
 This is the first video game video game Tired 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.840
 in the early 70's it contains only three games in memory 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.670
 I will give here also the laptops and the bigger ones 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.689
 in this case the control is almost the size of the apparatus the lifestyle that 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.130
 was made with 90 power 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.689
 with the intention of you have to get an idea one dead and head for 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.279
 example they did 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:13.379
 therefore support the demand is much greater than the Cubans is three times more 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.089
 his memory so great that he can judge it 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:21.409
 and think that today to completely different controls it worked 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.429
 the game every moment that you do with the outline 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:30.789
 you realize that all of relevant percent young people will have to start 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:33.119
 playing real tennis 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:37.499
 It's really cool this phase is what makes you fear that it takes way to get each 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:38.849
 closer 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.059
 since that time we showed in the game of tennis 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:47.339
 let's compare the pictures of the current with the other video games 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:51.159
 how much difference the shortcut popularized 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.070
 the videogame 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.049
 was the first to have games in cartridges 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.319
 we invite a child with the novelties for the challenge to 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.709
 play 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.810
 there he is in front of one of the most famous games of the 80's 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.939
 what did you think 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.609
 very different 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.180
 but if you have to choose between the ps you want to be hi there on the balcony 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.259
 Actually, what's this? 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.709
 the boy's aunt said 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.019
 always played video games and do not forget the afternoon I think I'd stay with both 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.590
 because that she remembers the childhood the mark is praxe before 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.699
 many options 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:37.620
 what is the best 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.289
 It is to everyone's liking. 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:43.949
 but whatever the name of someone miss will always have audience for him we will 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.769
 entertains with them in 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.969
 who wants to register the password 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:51.309
 this house has to show why it's ballad in the state 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:54.309
 is coming 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.349
 that toy museum and in this storefront of a branch store 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.570
 the address is rua boa morte in the center of piracicaba
