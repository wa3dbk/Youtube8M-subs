went to the triceps extensions using

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.210 
went to the triceps extensions using
cables<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:42.810> what<00:04:42.990> we<00:04:43.080> did<00:04:43.229> is<00:04:43.290> we<00:04:43.440> started<00:04:44.040> off

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
cables so what we did is we started off

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.430 
cables so what we did is we started off
with<00:04:44.790> lightweight<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.600> we<00:04:45.870> brought<00:04:46.110> it<00:04:46.290> up

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
with lightweight and we brought it up

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.680 
with lightweight and we brought it up
each<00:04:46.740> set<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.430> you<00:04:48.120> know<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.330> second<00:04:48.660> he

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
each set and you know the second he

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.320 
each set and you know the second he
finishes<00:04:49.200> I<00:04:49.350> would<00:04:49.650> jump<00:04:49.860> on<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:51.000> know<00:04:51.120> we

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
finishes I would jump on and you know we

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.690 
finishes I would jump on and you know we
would<00:04:51.510> increase<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.410> weight<00:04:52.740> until<00:04:53.040> you<00:04:53.370> know
