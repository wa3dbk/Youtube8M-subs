00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.180 
but I wish I could say some bad things
about<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.560> scare<00:01:49.830> off<00:01:49.920> some<00:01:50.069> of<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
about it scare off some of the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.320 
about it scare off some of the
opposition<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:50.789> it's<00:01:50.940> actually<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.209> really

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
opposition but it's actually a really

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.570 
opposition but it's actually a really
good<00:01:51.509> surface<00:01:51.920> we<00:01:52.920> try<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.220> not<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.459> other

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
good surface we try and not the other

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.340 
good surface we try and not the other
day<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:53.970> quite<00:01:54.209> soft<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:54.869> spongy<00:01:55.020> under

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
day it was quite soft and spongy under

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.690 
day it was quite soft and spongy under
the<00:01:55.410> foot<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:55.709> I<00:01:55.770> reckon<00:01:56.039> after<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.399> settles

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the foot but I reckon after it settles

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850 
the foot but I reckon after it settles
off<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.030> couple<00:01:57.179> of<00:01:57.330> weeks<00:01:57.509> would<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.860> nice

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
off a couple of weeks would be nice

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.800 
off a couple of weeks would be nice
underfoot<00:01:59.429> and<00:01:59.550> and<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.149> good<00:02:00.420> footwork

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
underfoot and and you get good footwork

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.120 
underfoot and and you get good footwork
under<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.289> that<00:02:01.319> you<00:02:01.500> don't<00:02:01.679> seem<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> be

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
under it that you don't seem to be

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.070 
under it that you don't seem to be
sliding<00:02:02.580> or<00:02:02.670> anything<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.240> unlike

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
sliding or anything like that so unlike

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.350 
sliding or anything like that so unlike
some<00:02:04.319> of<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.470> turf<00:02:04.920> fields<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> wet<00:02:05.940> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
some of the turf fields with a wet and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.940 
some of the turf fields with a wet and
muddy<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.929> think<00:02:07.140> your<00:02:07.229> boots<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.649> stuck

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
muddy so I think your boots get stuck

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.230 
muddy so I think your boots get stuck
and<00:02:08.130> slip<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.520> slide<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:08.729> over<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> place

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
and slip and slide all over the place

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.699 
and slip and slide all over the place
and<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.869> don't<00:02:09.990> really<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.590> these

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
and you don't really get that on these

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.080 
and you don't really get that on these
pitches

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090
