00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.319
 let's prepare fake chips 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.660
 the ingredients that we need are a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.809
 potato per person of monalisa type or 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.960
 Special for frying salt water and oil 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.909
 better if we have it without spray 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.239
 we started first of all it's going to be 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:24.569
 Preheat the oven to 250 degrees above 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:27.390
 and below or if we have a 220 fan 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:30.839
 up and down and we have our potato 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.350
 already peeled which we are going to cut in 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:37.199
 regular sticks the size of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.450
 the normal chips we're going to 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:44.910
 put in a saucepan 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.910
 and we will cover them with cold water 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.160
 the potatoes I remember you always 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.170
 they have to start cooking from 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.660
 cold water so they cook equally 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.379
 we do not have to pour too much water 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.350
 with covering them will be enough we throw a 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.239
 little salt and then it will not be 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.700
 need to add more once 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.890
 finished and we're going to count five 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.710
 cooking minutes once it starts to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.600
 always boil over medium heat so 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.720
 the potatoes are not crushed during the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.570
 cooking, we drain them very carefully 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.909
 and we spread them on a baking tray 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.920
 non-stick or on a tray with a 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.710
 little bit of tissue paper or paper 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.759
 we place them a little with care 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.429
 not to burn well separated and with a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.140
 spray oil we give them a spray if 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.300
 we do not have this kind of oil always 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.970
 we can paint them with a skewer and a 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.210
 little bit of oil and we put them in the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.090
 I remember you at 220 degrees above and 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.090
 down with fan or 250 up and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.710
 down without fan and we count 10 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.840
 exact minutes 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.270
 once the time has passed as you can see 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.850
 we have our chips that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.190
 they remain with a crunchy texture but 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.350
 very juicy inside the salt and the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.960
 carry and you do not need to add the and 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.810
 as they carry very little oil they are very 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.940
 light to mario loves them and they 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.550
 we prepare almost every night to 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.400
 dine because they are so quick to make 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.350
 so healthy and he eats them too and like 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.300
 to deny him the whim almost 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.000
 we are left wanting to eat 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.700
 because he never leaves any and it's not 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.700
 to miss is that they are delicious
