saying earlier this is the practice
image<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:36.069> how<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:37.330> said<00:02:37.930> students<00:02:38.380> get<00:02:38.650> to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
image this is how I said students get to

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.550 
image this is how I said students get to
learn<00:02:38.950> how<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.250> use<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.090> tools<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.750> we're

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
learn how to use the tools that we're

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.680 
learn how to use the tools that we're
just<00:02:41.680> putting<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:42.130> our<00:02:42.280> hands<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.030> how<00:02:43.630> to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
just putting in our hands and how to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.949 
just putting in our hands and how to
work<00:02:43.990> with<00:02:44.020> wood<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:46.120> that's<00:02:46.390> what<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:46.720> one

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
work with wood and that's what this one

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.760 
work with wood and that's what this one
is<00:02:46.990> so<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:48.040> hopefully<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:49.840> our<00:02:49.990> next<00:02:50.290> project

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
is so that hopefully in our next project

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.980 
is so that hopefully in our next project
we<00:02:50.920> can<00:02:51.100> go<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.550> one<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.090> then<00:02:52.690> again

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
we can go to this one and then again

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.900 
we can go to this one and then again
pick<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.770> techniques<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.580> learn<00:02:54.880> from

pick the techniques that you learn from

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.780 
pick the techniques that you learn from
this<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.750> apply<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.860> more<00:02:57.190> finished

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
this and apply to a more finished

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.479 
this and apply to a more finished
