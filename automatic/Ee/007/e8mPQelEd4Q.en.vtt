 of all our actions 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.549
 movements that makes retained 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.219
 it is important to highlight 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.060
 cancer is not only of great importance in the world's economy 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.059
 but also the health of consumers 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.149
 now they have been found 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:54.959
 n 2 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.919
 to the meeting 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.509
 have children 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:00.819
 beneficial 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.849
 for the chains 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.849
 there are organisms that did not tolerate 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.079
 but not because it is widespread 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.310
 and that does not tolerate caffeine and organism 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.369
 that can take six seven eight seats 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.779
 the Europeans are taking steps then 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.779
 when we have other health problems 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.689
 then we associate that you should not drink coffee 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.739
 In addition to these benefits it has been proven that what needs to be done will help 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.819
 have more attention and memory 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.220

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.479
 this sickness 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.009
 today 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.009
 if we find in the drugs 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.209
 medicines for both children and adults 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.479
 containing santa fe 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.849
 so I think 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.259
 in which we take 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:06.669
 efe 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.589
 really in order 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:09.789

 even for more grass diets like on brown skin not 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:20.219
 people who have been incarcerated for addictions 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.029
 read a drug that contains chlorogenic acids that has no escape 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:26.779
 and they give them 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:28.169
 a lot of efe 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.180
 and they are always drinking coffee 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.560
 It is important to let people know one day that coffee is not just casey 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.220
 that it contains other substances such as chlorogenic acids salts salts 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.100
