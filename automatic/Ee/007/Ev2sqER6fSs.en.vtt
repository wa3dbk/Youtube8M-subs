00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
crazy drivers on my camera I'm sort of

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.290 
crazy drivers on my camera I'm sort of
thinking<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.010> maybe<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.699> do<00:00:17.880> lots<00:00:18.150> of

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
thinking that maybe if you do lots of

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.599 
thinking that maybe if you do lots of
driving<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.350> potential<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.189> capture

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
driving the potential for you to capture

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.179 
driving the potential for you to capture
all<00:00:20.760> sorts<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.240> craziness<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.990> very<00:00:22.680> very<00:00:22.920> high

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
all sorts of craziness is very very high

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.000 
all sorts of craziness is very very high
so<00:00:23.490> my<00:00:24.210> advice<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:25.050> go<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.710> put<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:25.980> of

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
so my advice is to go and put one of

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.439 
so my advice is to go and put one of
these<00:00:26.160> little<00:00:26.340> dash<00:00:26.519> cam<00:00:26.760> cameras<00:00:27.150> into<00:00:27.330> your
