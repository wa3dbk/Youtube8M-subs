doing the chords the way I do that

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.590 
doing the chords the way I do that
doesn't<00:00:51.249> matter<00:00:51.370> so<00:00:51.609> much<00:00:51.639> but<00:00:52.329> if<00:00:52.449> you're

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
doesn't matter so much but if you're

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.450 
doesn't matter so much but if you're
doing<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.079> guitar<00:00:53.229> you'll<00:00:54.100> want<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.309> know
