00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.129
 I can not remember if daniel arrived. 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.770
 to loose what does not strike 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.750

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.789

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.109

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.790
 arriving there with g20 with denis as 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.530
 z like bruno so it's being pretty cool 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.420
 even we even played the game 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.729
 to infect from yesterday 6 was very cool 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.890
 much of the time even for 20 med and so 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.990
 need to have fun playing the corridors 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 because lately so stressful is 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.710
 Dude, if you ever stop to think, it's all 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.180
 history and all it has behind 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.220
 holster for who is already a little more 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.110
 old is very annoying but at last 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.570
 On that from there I'm turning the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.240
 score 12 take the last lot to sin 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.950
 very much the same or even group genic goals 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.140
 one of the best weapons there is but the best 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.180
 game rage assault I'm 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.700
 using it with a fee but the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.189
 rehearsers and max in my opinion is 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.899
 best combination for this weapon and I 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.670
 I can say now proudly said 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.380
 It happened with pride to you that I 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.450
 without finally playing dow face 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.399
 able to play and regain my goals 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.200
 I learned how to play the game and it's 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.540
 basically one more son, not infinity 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.520
 ward is how you know, dont face the games 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.829
 of child AIDS have always been 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.689
 in chicken and so have never been games 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.060
 so you need to have a lot of skill 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.979
 to play then you will see in that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.140
 match that focused too much on that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.750
 sport and that in this building at last 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.340
 In this diner senac because that's me. 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.470
 I stayed in this area in this area 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.450
 pick up several that I used on match 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.370
 The crowd was giving Spanish and in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.850
 my front is on two main stages 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.170
 in this place here in this flags and 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.000
 which in my opinion the best of 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.400
 best stages surprised the guys is 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.960
 What is this dick there? 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.870
 gasoline that the people ended up 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.340
 front and back even flags and then 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.350
 If I'm not mistaken, there was a guy who ended up 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.000
 and he was trying to get the flag 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.040
 when a friend was there and captured 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.660
 so he kept going and trying to get 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.940
 flags and I got more or less 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.920
 three or four times and then it was dude 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.709

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.570

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.590

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.250
