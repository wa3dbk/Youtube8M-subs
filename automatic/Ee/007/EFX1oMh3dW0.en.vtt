00:00:02.014 --> 00:00:04.014
The Corriente province 

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:08.277
treasures one of the most privileged regions for the development of ecotourism: 

00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:10.305
The Iberá Nature Reserve.

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:17.305
Each day Iberá opens its doors to visitors from around the world, 

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:23.335
direct witnesses of the most bountiful scenario of the Argentinean biodiversity. 

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:39.335
The reserve 

00:00:39.703 --> 00:00:43.703
is the result of a recovered, abundant and tamed fauna 

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.335
with well- preserved natural landscapes

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:51.335
and the willingness of the Corrientes people to maintain a land

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.880
 like no other in the country

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:58.335
that brings together the landscape, nature and culture. 

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:03.917
Through new portals that allow access to the Iberá 

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:10.335
from four directions, the reserve is ready to fulfil the varied interests of its visitors, 

00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:15.335
always in the context of a preserved and wild landscape.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.050
The navigation in lagoons and streams

00:01:27.398 --> 00:01:32.358
brings us closer to
surprisingly tamed species 

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:33.952
already extinct in other regions.

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:37.052
The marsh deer grazing on the shores,

00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:42.064
alligators basking in the morning,

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.909
the otters catching fish,

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.909
groups of capybaras moving between water and land,

00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:53.264
plus 100 species of birds which, to the delight of bird-watchers,

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:59.072
provide a natural attraction hard to find in other destinations.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:03.439
Forests may reveal other important wildlife,

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:09.019
like the carayá monkeys searching for food in treetops

00:02:09.522 --> 00:02:16.402
while dozens of birds and mammals carry on their struggle for survival in this ecosystem,

00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:19.422
barely touched by human hands.

00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:29.322
Fishing and returning dorados,

00:02:29.347 --> 00:02:33.187
snorkle diving along the submerged prairies,

00:02:33.347 --> 00:02:35.267
kayaking through natural surroundings

00:02:35.347 --> 00:02:40.267
is all possible in the transparent waters of the Corrientes river,

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:42.647
in the gentle streams of the western sector of the reserve

00:02:42.757 --> 00:02:48.677
and also in the pristine lagoons of the southern Iberá.

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:53.295
Iberá is one of the few places that can be traversed on horseback

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:55.015
through the immensity of its rugged terrain, 

00:02:55.035 --> 00:03:00.795
crossing deep streams alongside animals and even a canoe.

00:03:04.524 --> 00:03:08.044
Sometimes this activity takes place side by side

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:14.584
with Corrientes cattle herders leading cattle from one estancia to another.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.599
The variety of available hotels

00:03:33.653 --> 00:03:39.413
offer a wide opportunity to visitors with different purchasing power

00:03:39.493 --> 00:03:42.413
but always looking for local values

00:03:42.553 --> 00:03:48.713
​in terms of architecture, cuisine and customs of Corrientes.

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:55.753
The reintroduction of species like the anteater,

00:03:55.873 --> 00:03:56.713
the deer of the pampas, 

00:03:56.808 --> 00:03:59.008
the pecaríes, 

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:02.508
and the return of large carnivores such as the puma and the jaguar,

00:04:02.548 --> 00:04:08.948
attract a new public thirsty for close encounters with large mammals.

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:16.333
Iberá is on the way to become the park inhabited by the big five in América:

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.200
the jaguar,

00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:19.091
tapir,

00:04:19.137 --> 00:04:20.857
the maned wolf,

00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:22.664
 anteater

00:04:22.824 --> 00:04:24.664
 and marsh deer.

00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:31.211
The marshlands of Iberá

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:36.211
are one of the best preserved natural sanctuaries throughout Latin América.

00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:39.251
And with a handful of parks and reserves,

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:44.589
it integrates a small list of privileged eco-tourist destinations around the world.

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.229
The reserve has an area of ​one million three hundred thousand hectares

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:53.829
and consists of 10 municipalities.

00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:57.854
Iberá is in the midst of the three international tourist corridors

00:04:58.218 --> 00:05:01.978
linking Buenos Aires to Iguazú, San Pablo, and Salta.

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:02.939
In this context, 

00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:05.118
Iberá is distinguished as the only destination

00:05:05.198 --> 00:05:09.198
that offers an abundant wildlife accessible throughout the year.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.529
Through five stories, 

00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:22.224
we can connect with Iberá and the numerous alternatives offered to meet the most varied demands of travellers.

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:25.099
From a distinguished family tourism,

00:05:25.135 --> 00:05:27.975
to an adventurous water horseriding,

00:05:28.013 --> 00:05:33.533
passing through a thematic tour for bird watchers and photographers

00:05:33.754 --> 00:05:38.754
and a journey by kayaking through the unexplored streams.
