 he he decided strong 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.880
 the first step is to find out 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.880
 one should bear the cost 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.670
 the clue 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.300
 after the 2-0 defeat at the Alligator Arena in seven

 I did not think I was in Brasilia. 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.670
 in Europe 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.670
 throughout my career, just as it was 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.070
 the doubts in choosing we will start to eliminate

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 not married 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.970
 after I became interested in this 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.590
 back in the day we believed 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.080
 I will make 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.080

 I hope this works out. 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.009
 what we have 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:45.279
 same 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.629

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.469
 but let's try until the next step 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:09.889
 which is practically null 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.369
