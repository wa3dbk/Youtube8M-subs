00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:31.810 

I<00:00:30.040> think<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:31.130> thing<00:00:31.310> that<00:00:31.340> stood<00:00:31.670> out<00:00:31.730> the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
I think the thing that stood out the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.090 
I think the thing that stood out the
most<00:00:32.000> about<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.510> Polaris<00:00:32.960> was<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.800> fact<00:00:33.980> that

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
most about the Polaris was the fact that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.410 
most about the Polaris was the fact that
I<00:00:34.160> could<00:00:34.280> turn<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.520> sled<00:00:34.700> over<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.210> first

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
I could turn the sled over the first

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.460 
I could turn the sled over the first
time<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:35.630> tried<00:00:35.840> to<00:00:35.870> turn<00:00:36.050> it<00:00:36.200> over

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
time I tried to turn it over

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.460 
time I tried to turn it over
I<00:00:37.180> pretty<00:00:38.180> much<00:00:38.270> overcompensate<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:39.200> didn't<00:00:39.379> I

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
I pretty much overcompensate it didn't I

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.140 
I pretty much overcompensate it didn't I
really<00:00:40.070> didn't<00:00:40.340> have<00:00:40.400> to<00:00:40.520> work<00:00:40.640> as<00:00:40.790> hard<00:00:40.820> as<00:00:41.030> I

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
really didn't have to work as hard as I

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.790 
really didn't have to work as hard as I
normally<00:00:41.210> do<00:00:43.960> once<00:00:44.960> you<00:00:45.050> got<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.290> basics<00:00:45.710> of

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
normally do once you got the basics of

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.229 
normally do once you got the basics of
what<00:00:45.950> you<00:00:46.040> were<00:00:46.129> trying<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.430> do<00:00:46.610> counter<00:00:47.030> steer

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
what you were trying to do counter steer

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
and wrong foot for that sort of thing

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.350 
and wrong foot for that sort of thing
you<00:00:49.280> could<00:00:49.400> really<00:00:49.460> look<00:00:49.790> where<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:50.059> want<00:00:50.270> it

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
to go and just sort of point it and it

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.250 
to go and just sort of point it and it
was<00:00:52.100> really<00:00:52.790> easy<00:00:52.970> it<00:00:53.180> was<00:00:53.270> mellow<00:00:53.510> it<00:00:53.930> didn't
