00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
basically how to reduce lag so what you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.139 
basically how to reduce lag so what you
want<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:31.189> is<00:00:32.189> go<00:00:32.399> into<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.700> multiplayer

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
it's going to take a while to load sauce

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.990 
it's going to take a while to load sauce
and<00:00:37.290> speak<00:00:37.739> about<00:00:37.829> how<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.309> works<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.700> stuff

and speak about how it works and stuff

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.420 
and speak about how it works and stuff
when<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.300> loads<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.170> basically<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.160> what

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
when it loads so basically what and what

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.590 
when it loads so basically what and what
it<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.920> you<00:00:43.920> go<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> options<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> install

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
it is is you go to options and install

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630 
it is is you go to options and install
and<00:00:45.840> installs<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.530> onto<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> hard<00:00:47.100> drive<00:00:47.370> disk

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and installs it onto the hard drive disk

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.479 
and installs it onto the hard drive disk
and<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.629> hard<00:00:48.840> drive<00:00:49.050> disk<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and the hard drive disk is like the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.479 
and the hard drive disk is like the
memory<00:00:50.820> inside<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> ps3<00:00:52.020> or<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> xbox<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> i

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
memory inside the ps3 or the xbox and i

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.189 
memory inside the ps3 or the xbox and i
know<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.730> works<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.090> xbox<00:00:54.510> as<00:00:54.690> well<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.079> think

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
know this works in xbox as well I think

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.680 
know this works in xbox as well I think
it's<00:00:55.500> optional<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.160> xbox<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.760> ps3<00:00:57.120> usually

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
it's optional on xbox and ps3 usually

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.510 
it's optional on xbox and ps3 usually
downloads<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> game<00:00:58.350> automatically<00:00:58.949> but

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
downloads the game automatically but

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.740 
downloads the game automatically but
with<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.760> game<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> doesn't<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.570> some

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
with this game it doesn't for some

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.450 
with this game it doesn't for some
reason<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> option<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.190> allows

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
reason so this is the option that allows

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.350 
reason so this is the option that allows
it<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.339> once<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.580> install<00:01:06.000> onto

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
it to do it and once you install onto

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.359 
it to do it and once you install onto
the<00:01:06.570> hard<00:01:06.750> drive<00:01:06.960> disk<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.409> reads<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.920> from<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the hard drive disk it reads it from the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.539 
the hard drive disk it reads it from the
disk<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.930> hard<00:01:09.930> drive<00:01:10.200> disk<00:01:10.470> instead<00:01:11.310> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
disk in the hard drive disk instead of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.480 
disk in the hard drive disk instead of
the<00:01:11.729> insert<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> disc<00:01:13.110> itself<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.860> I'll<00:01:14.310> just

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the insert the disc itself and I'll just

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.980 
the insert the disc itself and I'll just
call<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> HDD<00:01:15.210> that's<00:01:15.570> what<00:01:15.750> hard<00:01:15.930> drive

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
call it a HDD that's what hard drive

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.460 
call it a HDD that's what hard drive
disk<00:01:16.320> sounds<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.830> because<00:01:17.390> it's<00:01:18.390> quicker<00:01:18.600> so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
disk sounds for because it's quicker so

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.100 
disk sounds for because it's quicker so
once<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.130> download<00:01:20.610> onto<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> HDD<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.869> runs

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
once you download onto the HDD it runs

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
once you download onto the HDD it runs
off<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.799> said<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.850> lot<00:01:24.060> faster

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
off that as I said and it's a lot faster

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
off that as I said and it's a lot faster
for<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.470> run<00:01:25.650> from<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.250> HDD<00:01:27.229> for<00:01:28.310> compared

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
for it to run from the HDD for compared

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.010 
for it to run from the HDD for compared
to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> disc<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.240> run<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.509> from<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> disc

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
to the disc if you run it from the disc

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.980 
to the disc if you run it from the disc
it's<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.409> lot<00:01:31.560> slower<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.329> textures

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it's a lot slower and the textures

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.050 
it's a lot slower and the textures
they'd<00:01:34.500> load<00:01:34.890> slower<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.880> might

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
they'd load slower and you might

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.609 
they'd load slower and you might
actually<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.780> as<00:01:36.960> well<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
actually get like as well so this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.920 
actually get like as well so this
reduces<00:01:38.159> lag<00:01:38.400> by<00:01:39.030> quite<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> bit<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.780> well

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
reduces lag by quite a bit as well

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.620 
reduces lag by quite a bit as well
another<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:41.189> fun<00:01:41.520> facts<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.420> guys

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
another really fun facts for you guys

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.960 
another really fun facts for you guys
it's<00:01:42.869> not<00:01:42.990> fun<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.490> fact<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
it's not fun it's just it's a fact that

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.880 
it's not fun it's just it's a fact that
might<00:01:45.149> help<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:46.680> ps3

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
might help you if you have your ps3

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.590 
might help you if you have your ps3
around<00:01:47.460> twenty<00:01:47.700> percent<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> total

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
around twenty percent of the total

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.920 
around twenty percent of the total
memory<00:01:49.560> free<00:01:50.189> then<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.970> actually<00:01:51.119> runs<00:01:51.509> faster

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
memory free then it actually runs faster
