and<00:00:09.440> having<00:00:10.440> done<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.740> bit<00:00:11.040> more<00:00:11.190> further

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
and having done it a bit more further

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.970 
and having done it a bit more further
analysis<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.509> image<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.440> see

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
analysis on this image I can see

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.340 
analysis on this image I can see
actually<00:00:14.519> what<00:00:14.700> they've<00:00:14.880> done<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:16.080> that's<00:00:16.199> why

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
actually what they've done so that's why

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.630 
actually what they've done so that's why
I<00:00:16.379> wanted<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.650> make<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.980> follow<00:00:17.310> up<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
I wanted to make this follow up the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.929 
I wanted to make this follow up the
video<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.320> Apollo<00:00:19.529> 16<00:00:19.939> Earth

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
video so this is the Apollo 16 Earth

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.019 
video so this is the Apollo 16 Earth
image<00:00:21.359> again<00:00:21.949> so<00:00:22.949> I'll<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> second<00:00:23.850> bit

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
image again so I'll do the second bit

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.009 
image again so I'll do the second bit
contrasting<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.260> where<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.810> turn<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
contrasting in where I turn up the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.820 
contrasting in where I turn up the
collar<00:00:28.170> brightness<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.960> turn<00:00:31.529> down<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
collar brightness and turn down the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.970 
collar brightness and turn down the
contrast<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.500> basically<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.730> they've<00:00:39.210> done

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
contrast so basically what they've done

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.459 
contrast so basically what they've done
well<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> looks<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.370> me<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.610> they've<00:00:41.879> done<00:00:42.120> is

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
well it looks to me like they've done is

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
well it looks to me like they've done is
they've<00:00:43.469> taken<00:00:43.710> an<00:00:43.950> image<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> earth<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
they've taken an image of the earth a

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.790 
they've taken an image of the earth a
painting<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:47.640> whatever<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:49.590> they've

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
painting or whatever it is and they've

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.610 
painting or whatever it is and they've
done<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.219> cropping<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:51.270> I've<00:00:51.960> cropped<00:00:52.320> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
done this cropping here I've cropped it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.150 
done this cropping here I've cropped it
to<00:00:52.770> look<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.360> this<00:00:54.360> part<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.110> shadow<00:00:56.780> okay

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
to look like this part is in shadow okay

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.740 
to look like this part is in shadow okay
but<00:00:59.160> clearly<00:00:59.520> when<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.030> cropped<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> was

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
but clearly when they cropped it it was

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.070 
but clearly when they cropped it it was
much<00:01:00.930> too<00:01:01.710> hard<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.219> an<00:01:02.309> edge<00:01:02.750> you<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:03.899> this

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
much too hard of an edge you see this

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.719 
much too hard of an edge you see this
you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.710> where<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:04.920> they've<00:01:05.430> cropped

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you can see where they they've cropped

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.670 
you can see where they they've cropped
this<00:01:06.030> original<00:01:06.479> image<00:01:06.570> or<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:07.140> cut<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.500> round

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
this original image or they cut it round

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440 
this original image or they cut it round
here<00:01:07.860> they've<00:01:08.040> got<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.280> round<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> then

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
here they've got it round here and then

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.440 
here they've got it round here and then
they've<00:01:09.630> continued<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.650> cut<00:01:11.869> like<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:15.770> and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
they've continued this cut like this and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.060 
they've continued this cut like this and
you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> continuation<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
you can see the continuation of the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.929 
you can see the continuation of the
black<00:01:20.280> line<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:21.659> how<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.990> crops<00:01:22.350> this

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
black line and that's how it crops this

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.929 
black line and that's how it crops this
original<00:01:23.990> image<00:01:25.070> I've<00:01:26.070> no<00:01:26.369> idea<00:01:26.400> why<00:01:26.790> they

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
original image I've no idea why they

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
original image I've no idea why they
made<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:27.900> clearly<00:01:28.259> what

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
made it like this but as clearly what

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.130 
made it like this but as clearly what
they've<00:01:28.619> done<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.299> fuzzy<00:01:30.840> part

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
they've done and then this fuzzy part

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.300 
they've done and then this fuzzy part
extends<00:01:31.920> beyond<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.850> crop<00:01:33.119> line<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:34.310> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
extends beyond the crop line is the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.340 
extends beyond the crop line is the
shadow<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:36.329> they've<00:01:36.509> obviously<00:01:36.689> added

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
shadow that they've obviously added

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.350 
shadow that they've obviously added
afterwards<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.100> make<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.430> look<00:01:38.610> softer<00:01:41.360> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
afterwards to make it look softer you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.080 
afterwards to make it look softer you
see<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.530> still<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.100> shadows<00:01:44.549> appearing

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
see that still that shadows appearing

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.010 
see that still that shadows appearing
there<00:01:45.270> mm-hmm<00:01:46.820> well<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.420> shadow<00:01:48.689> they

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
there mm-hmm well that's the shadow they

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.749 
there mm-hmm well that's the shadow they
added<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.409> cover<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.070> hard<00:01:50.369> edge<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.729> see

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
added to cover up that hard edge you see

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.060 
added to cover up that hard edge you see
the<00:01:51.030> hard<00:01:51.270> edge<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:52.350> disappears<00:01:52.890> into

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the hard edge there just disappears into

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.899 
the hard edge there just disappears into
this<00:01:53.280> shadow<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.500> shadow<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.759> you

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
this shadow and that shadow is what you

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.690 
this shadow and that shadow is what you
can<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.899> green<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.770> appearing<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.430> green

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
can see in green is appearing in green

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:12.960 
can see in green is appearing in green
there<00:02:01.759> it's<00:02:02.759> been<00:02:02.969> overlaid

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.360 

for<00:02:13.970> some<00:02:14.120> reason<00:02:14.650> they've<00:02:15.650> actually<00:02:15.890> over

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
for some reason they've actually over

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.030 
for some reason they've actually over
lates<00:02:16.660> more<00:02:17.660> clouds<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.500> don't<00:02:18.650> know<00:02:18.740> why<00:02:18.890> they

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
lates more clouds I don't know why they

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.360 
lates more clouds I don't know why they
did<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.450> anyway<00:02:20.450> they've<00:02:21.350> kind<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.980> don't

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
did that anyway they've kind of I don't

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.200 
did that anyway they've kind of I don't
know<00:02:22.430> they've<00:02:22.520> probably<00:02:22.700> done<00:02:22.850> a<00:02:22.940> couple<00:02:23.090> of

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
know they've probably done a couple of

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.430 
know they've probably done a couple of
things<00:02:23.270> there<00:02:23.600> they<00:02:23.750> probably<00:02:23.930> overlaid<00:02:24.410> a

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
things there they probably overlaid a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.160 
things there they probably overlaid a
few<00:02:24.860> clouds<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.670> try<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:25.970> hide<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.330> line<00:02:26.810> and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
few clouds to try and hide that line and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.500 
few clouds to try and hide that line and
then<00:02:27.290> they<00:02:27.410> overlaid<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.860> saw<00:02:28.100> shadow<00:02:31.300> but<00:02:32.300> I

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
then they overlaid a saw shadow but I

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
like what you think they copped out at a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.190 
like what you think they copped out at a
real<00:02:43.430> photo<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.090> earth<00:02:44.240> you<00:02:44.510> think<00:02:44.690> you

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
real photo of the earth you think you

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.080 
real photo of the earth you think you
think<00:02:45.230> when<00:02:45.590> they<00:02:45.740> cropped<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.340> they<00:02:46.820> just

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
think when they cropped it they just

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.010 
think when they cropped it they just
happened<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.960> crop<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:49.270> exactly<00:02:50.270> across<00:02:50.600> where

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
happened to crop it exactly across where

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.480 
happened to crop it exactly across where
the<00:02:51.050> shadow<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.770> meant<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.100> be<00:02:52.250> earth<00:02:52.340> the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
the shadow is meant to be earth the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.800 
the shadow is meant to be earth the
earth<00:02:52.660> why<00:02:53.660> would<00:02:53.840> they<00:02:53.960> do<00:02:54.080> that<00:02:55.540> why<00:02:56.540> would

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
earth why would they do that why would

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.930 
earth why would they do that why would
they<00:02:56.930> do<00:02:57.080> that<00:02:57.110> if<00:02:57.950> you're<00:02:58.130> gonna<00:02:58.250> cop<00:02:58.610> out<00:02:58.820> an

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
they do that if you're gonna cop out an

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.310 
they do that if you're gonna cop out an
image<00:02:59.060> of<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.360> earth<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.660> would<00:02:59.720> just<00:02:59.990> crop

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
image of the earth you would just crop

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.230 
image of the earth you would just crop
it<00:03:00.350> well<00:03:00.680> first<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:01.040> all<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:01.250> probably<00:03:01.400> cop<00:03:02.060> it

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
it well first of all you probably cop it

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.960 
it well first of all you probably cop it
as<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.750> square<00:03:03.230> but<00:03:04.070> if<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.340> were<00:03:04.550> for<00:03:04.850> some

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
as a square but if you were for some

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.640 
as a square but if you were for some
weird<00:03:05.210> reason<00:03:05.330> gonna<00:03:05.780> crop<00:03:05.960> it<00:03:06.110> as<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.230> circle

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
weird reason gonna crop it as a circle

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.650 
weird reason gonna crop it as a circle
you'd<00:03:06.800> at<00:03:06.890> least<00:03:06.970> he's<00:03:07.970> at<00:03:08.090> least<00:03:08.210> crop<00:03:08.510> it

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
you'd at least he's at least crop it

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.479 
you'd at least he's at least crop it
around<00:03:08.900> here<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.530> would<00:03:09.740> still<00:03:10.010> see<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
around here so you would still see the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.810 
around here so you would still see the
shadowy<00:03:10.880> bit<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.360> image

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
shadowy bit in image

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.970 
shadowy bit in image
why<00:03:13.820> have<00:03:14.000> they<00:03:14.150> cropped<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.810> exactly<00:03:15.590> where

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
why have they cropped it exactly where

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.140 
why have they cropped it exactly where
the<00:03:16.310> shadow<00:03:16.580> line<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:18.459> mean<00:03:19.459> it's

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
the shadow line is is I mean it's

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.810 
the shadow line is is I mean it's
obvious<00:03:20.600> right<00:03:20.770> because<00:03:21.770> that's<00:03:22.459> how<00:03:22.640> they

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
obvious right because that's how they

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.610 
obvious right because that's how they
made<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.570> shadow<00:03:23.810> was<00:03:24.739> by<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.190> cropping

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
made the shadow was by this cropping

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.430 
made the shadow was by this cropping
okay<00:03:27.620> that's<00:03:28.130> it
