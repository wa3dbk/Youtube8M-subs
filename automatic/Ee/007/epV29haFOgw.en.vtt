00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.200 
for it well first of all fnatic edition
means<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:36.469> endorsed<00:00:37.469> by<00:00:37.620> fnatic<00:00:38.070> so

means it's endorsed by fnatic so

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.630 
means it's endorsed by fnatic so
fnatic<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.260> professional<00:00:41.190> gaming<00:00:41.489> group

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
fnatic is a professional gaming group

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.200 
fnatic is a professional gaming group
and<00:00:43.010> this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.190> their<00:00:44.370> headset<00:00:44.730> or<00:00:44.910> at<00:00:45.030> least

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and this is their headset or at least

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.150 
and this is their headset or at least
this<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.719> guess<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> their<00:00:46.289> colors<00:00:46.680> their<00:00:46.920> team

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
this I guess is their colors their team

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.630 
this I guess is their colors their team
colors<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.850> something<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.899> so

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
colors or something like that so

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
colors or something like that so
otherwise<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.090> basically<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.289> same<00:00:52.469> thing

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
otherwise it's basically the same thing

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
otherwise it's basically the same thing
as<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.489> regular<00:00:54.289> 7h<00:00:55.289> except<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.430> got<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.789> unique

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
as a regular 7h except it's got a unique

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.619 
as a regular 7h except it's got a unique
color<00:00:57.780> design<00:00:58.460> maybe<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.730> your<00:01:00.180> pets<00:01:00.420> might

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
color design maybe that your pets might

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.939 
color design maybe that your pets might
be<00:01:00.750> different<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.170> don't<00:01:01.350> know

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
be different I don't know

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.219 
be different I don't know
you<00:01:02.430> know<00:01:02.520> I've<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:03.570> looks<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.110> is

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you know I've it looks like it is

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.570 
you know I've it looks like it is
different<00:01:04.559> from<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> website<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.430> I've

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
different from the website but I've

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.969 
different from the website but I've
never<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:06.060> used<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> regular<00:01:06.810> 7h<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
never actually used the regular 7h so I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.390 
never actually used the regular 7h so I
can't<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.729> tell<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.930> otherwise<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
can't really tell you but otherwise the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.570 
can't really tell you but otherwise the
the<00:01:12.060> headsets<00:01:12.750> frequency<00:01:13.530> response<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.070> ten

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the headsets frequency response is ten

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.210 
the headsets frequency response is ten
to<00:01:14.760> twenty<00:01:15.030> eight<00:01:15.119> thousand<00:01:15.479> Hertz<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.220> it's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
to twenty eight thousand Hertz and it's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.530 
to twenty eight thousand Hertz and it's
got<00:01:17.430> 32<00:01:18.240> ohms<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.689> impedance<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:20.310> there<00:01:21.210> right

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
got 32 ohms of impedance so there right

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.469 
got 32 ohms of impedance so there right
there<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.710> well<00:01:23.549> some<00:01:23.850> instruction

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
there is the well some instruction

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.660 
there is the well some instruction
manual<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.350> don't<00:01:26.189> think<00:01:26.310> you'll<00:01:26.490> really

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
manual but I don't think you'll really

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.600 
manual but I don't think you'll really
need<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:28.080> also<00:01:28.200> got<00:01:28.470> these<00:01:28.619> replacement

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
need one you also got these replacement

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.890 
need one you also got these replacement
ear<00:01:30.090> pads<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.619> feels<00:01:31.829> kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.430> like

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
ear pads so this feels kind of like

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.120 
ear pads so this feels kind of like
squishy<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:35.360> very<00:01:36.360> soft<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:37.530> PA's<00:01:37.799> looks

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
squishy and very soft your PA's looks

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.300 
squishy and very soft your PA's looks
like<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.610> felt<00:01:38.939> or<00:01:39.119> something<00:01:40.280> but<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
like it's like felt or something but I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.010 
like it's like felt or something but I
don't<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.670> well<00:01:41.970> we'll<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.360> into<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.689> in

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
don't know well we'll get into that in

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
don't know well we'll get into that in
the<00:01:43.140> full<00:01:43.350> review<00:01:43.700> whenever<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.880> around<00:01:45.210> to

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
look at the backlighting on both of

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.870 
look at the backlighting on both of
these<00:05:42.540> keyboards<00:05:43.170> and<00:05:43.320> one<00:05:44.070> of<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:44.340> functions

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
these keyboards and one of the functions

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.730 
these keyboards and one of the functions
that<00:05:45.000> I<00:05:45.150> found<00:05:45.510> really<00:05:45.810> cool<00:05:45.960> with<00:05:46.590> the

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
that I found really cool with the

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.280 
that I found really cool with the
backlighting<00:05:47.220> is<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.850> fact<00:05:48.120> that<00:05:48.270> you<00:05:49.110> can

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
backlighting is the fact that you can

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.310 
backlighting is the fact that you can
set<00:05:49.530> it<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:49.680> a<00:05:49.860> mode<00:05:50.520> called<00:05:50.910> a<00:05:51.420> pulsing<00:05:52.080> mode

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
set it to a mode called a pulsing mode

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.960 
set it to a mode called a pulsing mode
and<00:05:52.910> that<00:05:53.910> would<00:05:54.120> be<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.480> the<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.830> top<00:05:56.430> you

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
and that would be the the the top you

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.690 
and that would be the the the top you
know<00:05:57.090> mode<00:05:57.840> on<00:05:58.230> this<00:05:58.530> keyboard<00:05:58.860> and<00:05:59.310> when<00:05:59.580> you

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
know mode on this keyboard and when you

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.400

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
set it to this mode the keyboard

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.870 
set it to this mode the keyboard
