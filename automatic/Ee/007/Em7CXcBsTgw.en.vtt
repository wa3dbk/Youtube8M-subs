00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.710 
ordered an extra small the material is
different<00:01:53.490> than<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.700> tank<00:01:53.970> top<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.479> ordered

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
different than a tank top that I ordered

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.280 
different than a tank top that I ordered
last<00:01:54.990> time<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> was<00:01:57.270> expecting<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.079> fit

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
last time so I was expecting it to fit

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.080 
last time so I was expecting it to fit
like<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> tank<00:01:58.950> top<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
like the tank top that I have in the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.270 
like the tank top that I have in the
same<00:02:00.329> print<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.899> style<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.130> is

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
same print and style but this one is

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.810 
same print and style but this one is
just<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.549> little<00:02:02.729> more<00:02:02.939> restrictive<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.820> for

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
just a little more restrictive and for

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.510 
just a little more restrictive and for
me<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.119> kind<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.390> borderline<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
me it's kind of borderline like it can

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.450 
me it's kind of borderline like it can
get<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.970> kind<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.270> tight<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.110> should

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
get to be kind of tight and I should

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.460 
get to be kind of tight and I should
probably<00:02:11.120> sent<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.450> back<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:11.810> exchanged<00:02:12.320> it

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
probably sent it back and exchanged it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.740 
probably sent it back and exchanged it
but<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.650> didn't<00:02:13.010> really<00:02:13.040> feel<00:02:13.340> like<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.330> if

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750

as<00:02:24.940> far<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.870> tank<00:02:27.620> top<00:02:27.860> goes<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.960> was<00:02:29.960> really

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
as far as the tank top goes I was really

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.460 
as far as the tank top goes I was really
surprised<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:31.100> tank<00:02:31.400> top<00:02:31.640> was<00:02:32.470> this

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
surprised that this tank top was this

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.080 
surprised that this tank top was this
material<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.340> thought<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:34.640> was<00:02:34.730> going<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:34.940> be

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
material I thought it was going to be

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.180 
material I thought it was going to be
like<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.480> jersey<00:02:35.900> material<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:37.010> thought

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
like the jersey material and I thought

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.520 
like the jersey material and I thought
it<00:02:37.340> was<00:02:37.430> going<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.610> be<00:02:37.760> bad<00:02:38.000> year<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:38.990> because

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
it was going to be bad year so because

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.400 
it was going to be bad year so because
this<00:02:39.770> tank<00:02:40.340> top<00:02:40.610> is<00:02:40.850> form-fitting<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.870> tends

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
this tank top is form-fitting it tends

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.030 
this tank top is form-fitting it tends
to trap<00:02:42.860> in<00:02:43.070> heat<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.900> um<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:45.380> lot<00:02:45.710> of<00:02:45.860> times

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
to trap in heat and um a lot of times

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.860 
to trap in heat and um a lot of times
and<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.310> was<00:02:46.430> wearing<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:47.000> wanted<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.480> patent

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
and I was wearing it I wanted a patent

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.710 
and I was wearing it I wanted a patent
to<00:02:47.990> like<00:02:48.140> flip<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.740> up<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.130> like<00:02:49.910> get<00:02:50.270> some<00:02:50.510> air

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
to like flip it up and like get some air

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.470 
to like flip it up and like get some air
just<00:02:51.080> like<00:02:51.200> go<00:02:51.770> like<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.000> get<00:02:53.180> air

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
just like go like that just to get air

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480 
just like go like that just to get air
because<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.050> was<00:02:54.140> just<00:02:54.290> trapping<00:02:54.740> in<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.310> much

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
because it was just trapping in so much

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.170 
because it was just trapping in so much
heat<00:02:55.870> um<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.830> cutout<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.400> back<00:02:58.490> is<00:02:58.850> cute

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
heat um the cutout in the back is cute

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.960 
heat um the cutout in the back is cute
