but<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.939> don't<00:01:27.170> buy<00:01:28.170> honey<00:01:28.740> typically<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.820> use

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.910 

agave<00:01:33.840> nectar<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.720> aged<00:01:37.049> ok

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920

substitute to switch out with honey

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.580 
substitute to switch out with honey
because<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:41.040> guy<00:01:41.549> vain<00:01:41.790> nectar<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.420> also<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
because a guy vain nectar is also a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.030 
because a guy vain nectar is also a
humectant<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.880> honey<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
humectant just like honey is so it's a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.420 
humectant just like honey is so it's a
good<00:01:47.250> alternative<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.890> use<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> gobby

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
you can kind of see how liquidy it is so

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.720 
you can kind of see how liquidy it is so
does<00:03:33.850> pretty<00:03:34.120> much<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.570> consistency<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.350> it

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
does pretty much the consistency of it

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.940 
does pretty much the consistency of it
okay<00:03:36.730> so<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.570> is<00:03:37.780> what<00:03:37.930> this<00:03:38.410> side<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.830> my

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
okay so this is what this side of my

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.699 
okay so this is what this side of my
hair<00:03:39.190> looks<00:03:39.519> like<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.480> basically<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.530> this<00:03:41.650> is

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
hair looks like so basically and this is

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.890 
hair looks like so basically and this is
something<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.519> might<00:03:43.180> be<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.390> little<00:03:43.630> bit

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
something that might be a little bit

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.229 
something that might be a little bit
easier<00:03:44.640> should<00:03:45.640> do<00:03:45.910> then<00:03:46.300> um<00:03:47.850> trying<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.940> pour

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
easier should do then um trying to pour

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.360 
easier should do then um trying to pour
it<00:03:49.480> if<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:49.989> have<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.200> large<00:03:50.560> bowl<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.250> your

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
it if you have a large bowl and your

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.460 
it if you have a large bowl and your
hair<00:03:51.580> is<00:03:51.730> long<00:03:51.970> enough<00:03:52.330> what<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.019> pretty<00:03:53.380> much

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
hair is long enough what I pretty much

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.860 
hair is long enough what I pretty much
just<00:03:53.620> did<00:03:54.160> with<00:03:54.370> our<00:03:54.400> let's<00:03:54.790> pull<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.330> bowl<00:03:55.540> up

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
just did with our let's pull the bowl up

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.280 
just did with our let's pull the bowl up
and<00:03:56.230> just<00:03:56.410> kind<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.830> dunk<00:03:57.640> my<00:03:58.000> hair<00:03:58.330> inside<00:03:59.080> of

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
and just kind of dunk my hair inside of

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.130 
and just kind of dunk my hair inside of
the<00:03:59.380> bowl<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.980> um<00:04:00.910> that's<00:04:01.540> how<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:01.720> was<00:04:01.810> able<00:04:01.989> to

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
the bowl and um that's how I was able to

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.890 
the bowl and um that's how I was able to
get<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.190> on<00:04:03.700> my<00:04:03.760> hair<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.209> little<00:04:04.360> bit<00:04:04.570> easier

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
get it on my hair a little bit easier

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.539 
get it on my hair a little bit easier
than<00:04:05.110> trying<00:04:05.320> to<00:04:05.500> pour<00:04:05.799> it<00:04:05.980> because<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.280> can<00:04:06.430> be

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
than trying to pour it because it can be

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.300 
than trying to pour it because it can be
kind<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.850> awkward<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.870> that's<00:04:08.080> what<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.350> did<00:04:08.590> and

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
kind of awkward so that's what I did and

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.170 
kind of awkward so that's what I did and
just<00:04:10.920> saturated<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.220> then<00:04:12.370> just<00:04:12.640> moved<00:04:12.910> it

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
just saturated it and then just moved it

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.349 
just saturated it and then just moved it
to<00:04:13.750> make<00:04:14.080> sure<00:04:14.319> you<00:04:14.590> know<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:14.770> got<00:04:15.069> all<00:04:15.400> on<00:04:16.239> the

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
to make sure you know I got all on the

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.750 
to make sure you know I got all on the
inside<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.350> so<00:04:17.410> I'm<00:04:18.010> going<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.280> do<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.549> same

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
inside and so I'm going to do the same

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.430 
inside and so I'm going to do the same
thing<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.209> other<00:04:19.239> side<00:04:19.480> of<00:04:19.660> my<00:04:19.870> head<00:04:19.900> and

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
thing to the other side of my head and

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.990 
thing to the other side of my head and
then<00:04:21.160> I'll<00:04:22.290> kind<00:04:23.290> of<00:04:23.470> roll<00:04:23.710> it<00:04:23.740> just<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.760> make

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
then I'll kind of roll it just to make

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.170 
then I'll kind of roll it just to make
the<00:04:25.750> hair<00:04:25.990> easier<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:27.100> fit<00:04:27.400> inside<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:27.910> the

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
the hair easier to fit inside of the

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.650 
the hair easier to fit inside of the
plastic<00:04:28.419> cap<00:04:29.020> cuz<00:04:29.800> when<00:04:30.460> my<00:04:31.150> hair<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:31.630> long

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
plastic cap cuz when my hair is so long

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.810 
plastic cap cuz when my hair is so long
now<00:04:32.110> that's<00:04:32.800> probably<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.340> biggest<00:04:33.610> problem

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
now that's probably the biggest problem

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.750 
now that's probably the biggest problem
that<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.300> have<00:04:34.540> is<00:04:34.930> on<00:04:35.110> getting<00:04:36.040> all<00:04:36.340> my<00:04:36.490> hair
