00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
but I put my intake on a long time back

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.120 
but I put my intake on a long time back
and<00:00:16.730> I<00:00:17.000> just<00:00:17.840> never<00:00:17.960> got<00:00:18.080> around<00:00:18.230> to<00:00:18.619> making<00:00:18.920> a

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
and I just never got around to making a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.390 
and I just never got around to making a
video<00:00:19.570> showing<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:20.690> intake<00:00:21.160> because<00:00:22.160> I'm

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
video showing the intake because I'm

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.269 
video showing the intake because I'm
sure<00:00:22.580> a<00:00:22.609> lot<00:00:22.789> of<00:00:22.820> people<00:00:23.090> are<00:00:23.180> interested<00:00:24.279> so

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
sure a lot of people are interested so

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.470 
sure a lot of people are interested so
far<00:00:25.490> I<00:00:25.520> haven't<00:00:25.670> really<00:00:25.880> done<00:00:26.000> much<00:00:26.060> to<00:00:26.390> the

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
far I haven't really done much to the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.329 
car Eibach proline Springs all the way
around<00:00:31.179> painted<00:00:32.179> the<00:00:32.239> calipers<00:00:32.749> and<00:00:33.190> then<00:00:34.190> the

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:34.339 
around painted the calipers and then the

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:38.139 
around painted the calipers and then the
APR<00:00:34.760> intake<00:00:35.359> so<00:00:36.639> I'll<00:00:37.639> show<00:00:37.879> you<00:00:37.969> what<00:00:38.120> that

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
APR intake so I'll show you what that

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:46.209 
APR intake so I'll show you what that
looks<00:00:38.479> like<00:00:38.539> I<00:00:43.780> really<00:00:44.780> like<00:00:44.989> it<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:45.260> mean<00:00:45.469> it

looks awesome and pretty soon I'm going

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.899 
looks awesome and pretty soon I'm going
to<00:00:47.690> get<00:00:47.839> carbon<00:00:48.799> fiber<00:00:49.129> covers<00:00:49.549> for<00:00:49.729> the<00:00:49.789> whole

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
to get carbon fiber covers for the whole

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.840 
to get carbon fiber covers for the whole
engine<00:00:50.299> but<00:00:51.069> there<00:00:52.069> it<00:00:52.219> is<00:00:54.549> you<00:00:55.549> pretty<00:00:55.760> much

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
engine but there it is you pretty much

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.750 
engine but there it is you pretty much
just<00:00:56.049> disconnect<00:00:57.049> this<00:00:57.260> box<00:00:57.589> right<00:00:57.799> here<00:00:57.859> with

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
just disconnect this box right here with

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.359 
just disconnect this box right here with
the<00:00:58.999> MAF<00:00:59.329> sensor<00:00:59.359> there<00:00:59.869> and<00:01:00.289> get<00:01:01.100> rid<00:01:01.219> of<00:01:01.249> that

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
the MAF sensor there and get rid of that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.749 
the MAF sensor there and get rid of that
whole<00:01:01.549> tube<00:01:01.819> and<00:01:03.399> instead<00:01:04.399> of<00:01:04.519> connecting

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
whole tube and instead of connecting

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.679 
whole tube and instead of connecting
from<00:01:05.119> there<00:01:05.329> to<00:01:06.140> here<00:01:07.180> which<00:01:08.180> then<00:01:08.479> goes<00:01:08.659> to

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
from there to here which then goes to

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.529 
from there to here which then goes to
this<00:01:08.899> box<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:09.820> goes<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.939> your<00:01:11.030> intake<00:01:11.359> here

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
this box and goes to your intake here

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.569 
this box and goes to your intake here
the<00:01:11.689> stock<00:01:11.899> intake<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:13.130> just<00:01:13.310> go<00:01:13.399> straight

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
the stock intake you just go straight

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:14.770 
the stock intake you just go straight
from<00:01:13.789> the<00:01:13.880> throttle<00:01:14.090> body<00:01:14.270> which<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:14.689> the

from the throttle body which is the
silver<00:01:15.140> thing<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:17.810> run<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.020> intake<00:01:18.439> down

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
silver thing and you run the intake down

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
k's i mean its carbon fiber you can't

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.919 
k's i mean its carbon fiber you can't
beat<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.600> look<00:01:30.350> sweet

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
pretty soon i'm gonna get a carbon fiber

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.459 
pretty soon i'm gonna get a carbon fiber
cover<00:01:34.429> there<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:35.600> little<00:01:36.020> carbon<00:01:36.289> fiber

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469

full front GLI GTI honeycomb conversion
from<00:01:45.770> ECS<00:01:46.460> tuning<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.539> all<00:01:47.719> that<00:01:47.869> chrome<00:01:48.079> I

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
from ECS tuning so all that chrome I

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.950 
from ECS tuning so all that chrome I
don't<00:01:48.770> know<00:01:48.829> just<00:01:48.979> looks<00:01:49.130> tacky<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.549> me
