hi<00:00:04.870> guys<00:00:05.020> and<00:00:05.050> welcome<00:00:05.319> to<00:00:05.440> a<00:00:05.560> really<00:00:05.830> quick

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:05.950 
hi guys and welcome to a really quick

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.910 
hi guys and welcome to a really quick
unboxing<00:00:06.160> of<00:00:06.640> the<00:00:06.850> NVIDIA<00:00:07.450> GeForce<00:00:07.689> GTX<00:00:08.349> 680

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
unboxing of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.740 
unboxing of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680
this<00:00:09.309> is<00:00:09.430> the<00:00:09.550> pallet<00:00:09.940> version<00:00:10.360> but<00:00:10.540> it's<00:00:10.660> a

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
this is the pallet version but it's a

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.959 
this is the pallet version but it's a
reference<00:00:11.260> one<00:00:11.470> so<00:00:11.799> pretty<00:00:12.490> much<00:00:12.669> all<00:00:12.879> the

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
reference one so pretty much all the

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.699 
reference one so pretty much all the
different<00:00:13.299> makes<00:00:13.480> are<00:00:13.660> the<00:00:13.690> same<00:00:14.049> apart<00:00:14.500> from

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
different makes are the same apart from

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.710 
different makes are the same apart from
maybe<00:00:15.280> a<00:00:15.400> slightly<00:00:15.669> different<00:00:15.849> warranty<00:00:16.480> from

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
maybe a slightly different warranty from

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.750 
maybe a slightly different warranty from
the<00:00:16.780> manufacturer<00:00:17.500> and<00:00:17.530> maybe<00:00:18.039> some<00:00:18.250> bundled

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
the manufacturer and maybe some bundled

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.880 
the manufacturer and maybe some bundled
games<00:00:19.030> but<00:00:19.360> apart<00:00:19.960> from<00:00:20.050> that<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.320> card<00:00:20.619> looks

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
games but apart from that the card looks

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.310 
games but apart from that the card looks
and<00:00:21.250> it<00:00:21.670> works<00:00:21.910> exactly<00:00:22.240> the<00:00:22.570> same<00:00:22.900> as<00:00:23.140> then

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
and it works exactly the same as then

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.339 
and it works exactly the same as then
the<00:00:23.349> other<00:00:23.650> nvidia<00:00:24.580> geforce<00:00:24.820> gtx<00:00:25.449> 680<00:00:25.929> 2

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.210 
and pcie 3.0 which is a brand new
version<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.820> on<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.390> back<00:00:43.630> there<00:00:44.020> is<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.650> wealth

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
version so on the back there is a wealth

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.070 
version so on the back there is a wealth
of<00:00:45.370> information<00:00:45.520> but<00:00:46.270> it's<00:00:46.540> pretty<00:00:46.780> nicely

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
of information but it's pretty nicely

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.020 
of information but it's pretty nicely
designed<00:00:47.500> box<00:00:47.830> and<00:00:48.100> like<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.280> lot<00:00:48.490> of<00:00:48.610> computer

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
designed box and like a lot of computer

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.990 
designed box and like a lot of computer
hardware<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:51.160> a<00:00:51.190> quick<00:00:51.520> thing<00:00:51.700> to<00:00:51.820> mention

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
hardware so a quick thing to mention

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.120 
hardware so a quick thing to mention
while<00:00:52.330> ii<00:00:52.360> unbox<00:00:52.840> this<00:00:53.170> is<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.740> fact<00:00:53.980> that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
while ii unbox this is the fact that

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.010 
while ii unbox this is the fact that
this<00:00:54.370> works<00:00:54.670> on<00:00:54.940> like<00:00:55.150> quite<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.450> lot<00:00:55.690> of<00:00:55.810> other

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
this works on like quite a lot of other

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.680 
this works on like quite a lot of other
video<00:00:56.320> cards<00:00:56.740> or<00:00:56.920> in<00:00:57.190> fact<00:00:57.700> every<00:00:58.120> other<00:00:58.300> video

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
video cards or in fact every other video

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.300 
video cards or in fact every other video
card<00:00:58.990> out<00:00:59.140> there<00:00:59.170> at<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.500> moment<00:00:59.530> it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
card out there at the moment it

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.720 
card out there at the moment it
overclocked<00:01:00.820> itself<00:01:01.240> a<00:01:01.360> bit<00:01:01.540> like<00:01:02.340> CPU<00:01:03.340> boost

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
overclocked itself a bit like CPU boost

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.179 
overclocked itself a bit like CPU boost
from<00:01:03.910> Nvidia<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.869> then<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.320> different<00:01:05.950> speed

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
from Nvidia and then the different speed

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.969 
from Nvidia and then the different speed
core<00:01:06.490> or<00:01:06.760> whatever<00:01:07.000> it's<00:01:07.150> called<00:01:07.210> on<00:01:07.570> AMD<00:01:08.409> and

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
core or whatever it's called on AMD and

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.800 
core or whatever it's called on AMD and
so<00:01:09.520> it's<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.700> graphics<00:01:10.060> card<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.299> overclocks

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
so it's a graphics card that overclocks

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.080 
so it's a graphics card that overclocks
itself<00:01:11.289> according<00:01:11.829> to<00:01:11.979> how<00:01:12.280> much<00:01:12.460> power<00:01:12.789> it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
itself according to how much power it

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.669 
itself according to how much power it
can<00:01:13.270> use<00:01:13.539> and<00:01:13.810> how<00:01:13.990> hot<00:01:14.289> it<00:01:14.469> is

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
can use and how hot it is

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.399 
can use and how hot it is
it's<00:01:15.189> decock<00:01:15.789> sit<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.270> overclocked<00:01:17.020> itself

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
it's decock sit it overclocked itself

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.910 
it's decock sit it overclocked itself
until<00:01:17.619> it<00:01:17.679> gets<00:01:17.890> too<00:01:18.039> hot<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.579> will<00:01:18.840> then

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
until it gets too hot and it will then

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.450 
until it gets too hot and it will then
tune<00:01:20.920> down<00:01:21.249> again<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:22.060> cool<00:01:22.600> down<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:23.109> off<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
tune down again to cool down and off so

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.459 
tune down again to cool down and off so
it's<00:01:25.179> gonna<00:01:25.299> be<00:01:25.450> pretty<00:01:25.780> difficult<00:01:26.109> to

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
it's gonna be pretty difficult to

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.349 
it's gonna be pretty difficult to
benchmark<00:01:26.829> these<00:01:27.219> against<00:01:27.670> each<00:01:27.789> other<00:01:28.030> but

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
benchmark these against each other but

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.929 
benchmark these against each other but
it<00:01:29.229> should<00:01:29.439> be<00:01:29.649> an<00:01:29.890> amazing<00:01:30.159> graphics<00:01:30.729> card

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
it should be an amazing graphics card

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.029 
it should be an amazing graphics card
all<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.119> same<00:01:32.789> so<00:01:33.789> inside<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.479> box<00:01:34.859> we<00:01:35.859> have

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
all the same so inside the box we have

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.480 
all the same so inside the box we have
the<00:01:36.219> card<00:01:36.490> itself<00:01:36.909> which<00:01:37.359> is<00:01:37.719> a<00:01:38.490> large

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
the card itself which is a large

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.410 
the card itself which is a large
graphics<00:01:39.909> card<00:01:40.119> I'll<00:01:40.270> tell<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.509> about

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
graphics card I'll tell you about

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:52.859 
graphics card I'll tell you about
anyways<00:01:43.420> it's<00:01:43.689> on

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.359 

okay<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:55.869> on<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.080> top<00:01:57.320> we<00:01:57.560> have<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.830> same<00:01:58.040> cool

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
okay so on the top we have the same cool

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.570 
okay so on the top we have the same cool
the<00:01:58.490> design<00:01:58.820> as<00:01:59.030> all<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.360> other<00:01:59.510> ones<00:02:00.369> this<00:02:01.369> is

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
the design as all the other ones this is

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.030 
the design as all the other ones this is
the<00:02:01.700> palette<00:02:02.030> version<00:02:02.390> of<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.600> set<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.110> there

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
the palette version of the set and there

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.810 
the palette version of the set and there
is<00:02:04.250> exactly<00:02:04.940> two<00:02:05.090> slots<00:02:05.479> high<00:02:05.720> no<00:02:06.080> higher<00:02:06.350> and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
is exactly two slots high no higher and

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.910 
is exactly two slots high no higher and
there's<00:02:07.820> no<00:02:08.060> Ridge<00:02:09.020> down<00:02:09.289> here<00:02:09.590> for<00:02:09.800> when

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
there's no Ridge down here for when

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.550 
there's no Ridge down here for when
you've<00:02:10.069> got<00:02:10.220> them<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.459> SLI<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.239> maybe<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.110> little

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
you've got them in SLI so maybe a little

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.290 
you've got them in SLI so maybe a little
less<00:02:12.800> cooling<00:02:13.130> available<00:02:13.850> than<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.090> outer

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
less cooling available than this outer

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.150

plastic as I hope you can see there and
on<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.400> back<00:02:28.580> it's<00:02:28.880> just<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.180> normal<00:02:29.510> regular

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
on the back it's just a normal regular

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.680 
on the back it's just a normal regular
PCB<00:02:30.500> uncovered<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.209> doesn't<00:02:32.420> look<00:02:32.570> exactly

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
PCB uncovered so it doesn't look exactly

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.390 
PCB uncovered so it doesn't look exactly
great<00:02:33.400> except<00:02:34.400> we<00:02:34.519> have<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:36.190> really<00:02:37.190> nice

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
great except we have a really nice

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
GeForce GTX logo on the side right there

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.740 
GeForce GTX logo on the side right there
we<00:02:40.430> should<00:02:40.640> look<00:02:40.760> pretty<00:02:40.820> good<00:02:41.209> if<00:02:41.300> you<00:02:41.330> have<00:02:41.720> a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
we should look pretty good if you have a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.440 
we should look pretty good if you have a
window<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.260> your<00:02:42.380> case<00:02:42.910> yeah<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:43.940> don't<00:02:44.150> think

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
window in your case yeah I don't think

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.870 
window in your case yeah I don't think
that's<00:02:44.600> gonna<00:02:44.720> light<00:02:44.989> up<00:02:45.019> like<00:02:45.470> some<00:02:45.880> Nvidia

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
that's gonna light up like some Nvidia

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.640 
that's gonna light up like some Nvidia
cards<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:47.870> got<00:02:48.019> two<00:02:48.400> 6-pin<00:02:49.400> power<00:02:49.700> a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650

quick<00:03:39.049> installation<00:03:39.500> guide<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:41.239> as<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:41.900> said

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
quick installation guide so as I said

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.810 
quick installation guide so as I said
this<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.410> exactly<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.890> same<00:03:43.100> as<00:03:43.340> pretty<00:03:43.609> much

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
this is exactly the same as pretty much

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.160 
this is exactly the same as pretty much
all<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.150> other<00:03:44.180> six<00:03:44.540> eight<00:03:44.720> years<00:03:44.900> out<00:03:44.989> at<00:03:45.109> the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
all the other six eight years out at the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.229 
all the other six eight years out at the
moment<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:46.280> is<00:03:46.400> probably<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.760> cheapest<00:03:47.060> one

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
moment this is probably the cheapest one

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.800 
moment this is probably the cheapest one
around<00:03:47.510> this<00:03:47.840> one<00:03:48.079> runs<00:03:48.440> about<00:03:49.239> 410<00:03:50.239> pounds<00:03:50.540> at

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
around this one runs about 410 pounds at

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.150 
around this one runs about 410 pounds at
the<00:03:50.900> moment<00:03:51.230> it's<00:03:51.410> going<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.650> be<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:51.950> lot

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
the moment it's going to be a lot

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.259 
the moment it's going to be a lot
different<00:03:52.190> probably<00:03:52.850> when<00:03:53.030> you're<00:03:53.150> watching

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269
