Take an old headboard.

00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:31.302
Paint it white
Replace the spindles with something cooler.

See these panels on the headboard.

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:33.302
This panel needs to be upholstered.

00:00:33.302 --> 00:00:34.302
Cut a thin board the same size as a panel.

00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:35.302
Cover the top with a layer of batting.

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:36.302
Then cover with material and staple to the
back.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.302
It should look like this.

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:38.302
You remember this panel?

00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:39.302

You remember this cushion?

00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:41.302

Take a washer and a bolt.

00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:43.302
And poke it through the cushion.

00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:44.302

00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:45.302

00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:46.302
Cut some rounds from your material.

00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:47.302

00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:48.302
