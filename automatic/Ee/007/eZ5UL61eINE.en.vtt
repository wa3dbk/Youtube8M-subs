00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Sustain 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Normally the sound stops by releasing a key. With the sustain function, it is possible to continue to play a note even after releasing it 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Load the jazzlead preset. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Check that sustain is enabled in the menu. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 While pressing a note, slide up on the touch panel. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Note that the screen indicating that the second string (A) is maintained. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 You can change the held note by pressing other notes on the string. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 (re-slide upwards to stop the function) 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 You can also maintain the chord sound ... 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 ... and re-attack the individual notes of the chords. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 You can also change the held notes without touching the screen, to get a smooth transition of notes. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Here is another example using the crazyb preset. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 This preset assigns the TOUCH_X / Y control of the filter frequency cut-off and the resonance of each voice. This means that by tapping different parts of the screen, the sound will be different.
