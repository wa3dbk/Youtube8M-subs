00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.750
 canned food is here everywhere 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.200
 lounging everywhere is barbed wire 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.140
 not prepared and further on the road 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:50.660
 there is already a zombie apocalypse here and a zombie 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:55.370
 attacking people here can be seen as a dude with 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.510
 pot torments this and zombies arm 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.379
 got my arm and took it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.739
 but then the police are lying around dead 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.549
 already that person takes 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.950
 weapons throw also zombies there too 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.140
 man can zoom here a little garden and in 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.100
 bushes something there lying around thymine 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.820
 the remains of a moped policeman here 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.680
 fight back from the zombies well, and now continue 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:29.729
 we will move on to the second group and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.390
 So here we see that Suvorov firing 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.759
 on zombies 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.990
 through the glass of Kalash that's such an ordinary 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.509
 the cop means and go to the building 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.640
 here is his general 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.979
 it crumbled the machine completely 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.790
 crushed because don't build a building 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.630
 from glass 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.210
 build it all strong concrete for example 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.640
 right here zombies are so ordinary ex 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.600
 the fireman wallows there all kinds of chairs 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.530
 tables 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.390
 outlet and here is the courtyard between 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.090
 by the way between these two buildings we 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.489
 see the sheriff who is moving over 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.740
 the barricade further we have a workshop of the city 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.340
 about this is the main workshop 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.140
 she and very poorly here we have wood 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.290
 which closes the door from 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.090
 detractors 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:30.420
 inside we have a dude who survived some not 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.420
 the sheriff couldn't get over the ladder 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:39.430
 scary means a mountain of car tools 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.380
 some boxes are very important in general 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.630
 survival supplies didn't you want there 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.150
 lies zombies do 2 st he is resting 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.080
 wanted he ready to attack go over 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.290
 patio 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.070
 in the courtyard we have two doors here 1 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.850
 broken out 1 normally even open two 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.060
 bandyugana 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:03.090
 not rob all innocent citizens here at 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.600
 we used to have a small fortification 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.920
 most likely a police post a cashier 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.840
 lying around ammo and a wheel from some 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.430
 tells or 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.710
 lawn mowers here we sit 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:23.700
 very scared and as you can see by 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:26.920
 face peasant with padawan body armor were walking 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.190
 military probably means right here 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.500
 here we have a very tough incident but 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:38.430
 man looks at helicopter crash this 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.770
 helicopter drop or 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.330
 if copter boxes mean we have here 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.500
 here here 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:51.370
 dropped a helicopter here inside junk 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.480
 everyone is crushed in front of the blade somehow 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.850
 so incomprehensible lie and this is the car 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.110
 This car brought a small 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.480
 helicopter for demonstration shows he, too 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.850
 a little wrecked because he was being carried 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.459
 at the service here is a man swatch and this is 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.150
 bulletproof vest very afraid that you him 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.150
 will come 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:23.920
 no luck zombies are so stupid with 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.230
 a revolver and here's another zombie this 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.610
 quite difficult situation as for building 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.530
 but because the zombie apocalypse 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.170
 real zombies will remind you pretty much 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.410

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.700

 here the computer that probably burned 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.500

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.930
 Well everything is destroyed everything is everywhere 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.560

 following the stairs is the supplies 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:04.980
 the boxes are not a big pipe of some sort 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:08.800
 radio helicopter antennas naturally 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:12.610

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.669
 some kind of shelf down below this whole 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.510
 we have a mini garage 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:25.870
 or shelters 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:29.350

 asking some survivor for 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.570
 place in camp fights very much 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.840
 so this little man shot down 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.540
 today came to run for a seat 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.860

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.380
 here are concrete barricades 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.470
 which they miss or should not 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:11.340
 skip cars can be seen as 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.920
 the taxi ran into some kind of incomprehensible 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:17.110
 lawn mower but the car is very small 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.120
