00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
attempt at ripening green tomatoes we

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.270 
attempt at ripening green tomatoes we
had<00:00:06.060> had<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> couple<00:00:06.540> small<00:00:07.410> frost<00:00:07.770> I'd<00:00:08.040> cover

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
had had a couple small frost I'd cover

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.770 
had had a couple small frost I'd cover
the<00:00:08.460> tomatoes<00:00:08.820> up<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:11.269> every<00:00:12.269> time<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.570> frost

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
the tomatoes up and every time the frost

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.020 
the tomatoes up and every time the frost
came<00:00:13.019> then<00:00:13.230> uncover<00:00:13.590> them<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.920> next<00:00:14.070> day<00:00:14.370> we

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
came then uncover them the next day we

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.150 
came then uncover them the next day we
had<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> major<00:00:15.450> frost<00:00:15.870> coming<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.619> then<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
had a major frost coming and then the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.410 
had a major frost coming and then the
temperatures<00:00:17.550> were<00:00:17.730> supposed<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.090> stay<00:00:18.359> as

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
temperatures were supposed to stay as

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.880 
temperatures were supposed to stay as
low<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.080> knew<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> production<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
low so I knew the production of the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.099 
low so I knew the production of the
tomatoes<00:00:20.310> were<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:21.029> almost<00:00:21.930> at<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
tomatoes were going to be almost at a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.170 
tomatoes were going to be almost at a
standstill<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.130> made<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> decision<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.000> go

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
standstill so I made a decision to go

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.109 
standstill so I made a decision to go
ahead<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.510> pull<00:00:25.410> these<00:00:25.590> Tomatoes<00:00:26.550> there's<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119

tomato would just be wrapping in a loose
envelope<00:00:52.770> open<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> top<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.850> newspaper

around 50 to 60 degree mark

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
around 50 to 60 degree mark
if<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.440> want<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.649> let<00:01:01.739> them<00:01:01.859> ripen

if you just want to let them ripen
slowly<00:01:03.260> these<00:01:04.260> were<00:01:04.589> anywhere<00:01:05.460> between<00:01:05.640> 60

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
slowly these were anywhere between 60

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.399 
slowly these were anywhere between 60
and<00:01:06.299> 65<00:01:06.720> degrees

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and 65 degrees

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
and 65 degrees
I<00:01:07.680> left<00:01:08.369> them<00:01:08.549> open<00:01:08.729> supposedly<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.659> can

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
I left them open supposedly you can

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.539 
I left them open supposedly you can
close<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.290> box<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.860> concentrate<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
close the box to concentrate the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.730 
close the box to concentrate the
ethylene<00:01:11.850> gas<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.570> put<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> piece<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.080> Apple<00:01:13.530> in

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
ethylene gas to put a piece of Apple in

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310 
ethylene gas to put a piece of Apple in
with<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.420> ripening<00:01:15.420> banana<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.110> that's

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
with them ripening banana and that's

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.990 
with them ripening banana and that's
supposed<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.590> speed<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> process<00:01:17.759> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
supposed to speed up the process I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
supposed to speed up the process I
wasn't<00:01:18.780> interested<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.259> speeding<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
wasn't interested in speeding up the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.840 
wasn't interested in speeding up the
process<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.909> let<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.659> was

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
process so I just let it go as it was

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.690 
process so I just let it go as it was
this<00:01:23.850> final<00:01:24.600> set<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:26.040> Tummie<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
Tomatoes

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.039 
Tomatoes
and<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:28.820> didn't<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.060> wrap<00:01:30.210> each<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.840> in

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and I didn't want to wrap each one in

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.679 
and I didn't want to wrap each one in
newspaper<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.340> looked<00:01:32.970> around<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.479> had

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
newspaper so I looked around and I had

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.469 
newspaper so I looked around and I had
some<00:01:33.960> egg<00:01:34.290> cartons<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.549> placed<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.150> an<00:01:36.360> egg

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
some egg cartons and I placed one an egg

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.899 
some egg cartons and I placed one an egg
carton<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.900> seemed<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> great<00:01:37.619> fit<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.850> I

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
carton it seemed like a great fit so I

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.280 
carton it seemed like a great fit so I
went<00:01:39.090> ahead<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.420> put<00:01:39.600> them<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.170> egg

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
went ahead and put them in the egg

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.670 
went ahead and put them in the egg
cartons<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.759> did<00:01:42.240> closed<00:01:42.570> these<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.530> they

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
cartons I did closed these up so they

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.080 
cartons I did closed these up so they
did<00:01:43.860> ripen<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.490> faster<00:01:44.820> than<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.970> other

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
did ripen a little faster than the other

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.080 
did ripen a little faster than the other
