it's<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> pretty<00:00:41.790> impressive<00:00:42.149> feature<00:00:42.629> list

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
it's a pretty impressive feature list

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.200 
it's a pretty impressive feature list
for<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.140> device<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.739> small<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.000> good

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
for a device this small but is it good

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.209 
for a device this small but is it good
enough<00:00:45.239> at<00:00:45.690> each<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.230> those<00:00:46.350> things<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.129> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
enough at each of those things is it a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.889 
enough at each of those things is it a
jack-of-all-trades<00:00:47.700> or<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> master<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> none

that's<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:49.770> we're<00:00:49.890> gonna<00:00:49.980> find<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.370> kids

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that's what we're gonna find out kids

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.580 
that's what we're gonna find out kids
let's<00:00:51.270> take<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> look<00:00:51.690> at<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> device<00:00:52.199> itself

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
let's take a look at the device itself

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.770 
let's take a look at the device itself
it's<00:00:52.829> got<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> minimal<00:00:53.550> no-nonsense<00:00:54.090> design

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it's got a minimal no-nonsense design

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.600 
it's got a minimal no-nonsense design
which<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.379> appreciate<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
which I can appreciate I don't like a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.580 
which I can appreciate I don't like a
lot<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.910> flashy<00:00:57.210> quirks<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.870> tech<00:00:58.140> stuff<00:00:58.410> on

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
lot of flashy quirks on tech stuff on

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.920 
lot of flashy quirks on tech stuff on
the<00:00:58.920> front<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> hub<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> Wi-Fi<00:01:00.449> LED

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the front of the hub we have a Wi-Fi LED

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.020 
the front of the hub we have a Wi-Fi LED
battery<00:01:01.199> indicator<00:01:01.800> LED<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.670> power<00:01:02.910> button

battery indicator LED and a power button

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.729 
battery indicator LED and a power button
on<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.629> right<00:01:03.870> side<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.379> micro<00:01:04.710> USB

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
on the right side we have a micro USB

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.530 
on the right side we have a micro USB
port<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.460> charging<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.880> device<00:01:06.030> using<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
port for charging the device using the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.390 
port for charging the device using the
supplied<00:01:06.960> cable<00:01:07.380> although<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> unit<00:01:08.250> does

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
supplied cable although the unit does

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.490 
supplied cable although the unit does
not<00:01:08.430> come<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> power<00:01:09.360> adapter<00:01:09.479> wall<00:01:10.140> plug

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
not come with a power adapter wall plug

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.810 
not come with a power adapter wall plug
so<00:01:10.680> you'll<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> either<00:01:11.189> use<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.700> that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
so you'll have to either use one that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.310 
so you'll have to either use one that
you<00:01:11.880> already<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.479> plug<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.080> into<00:01:13.200> your

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
you already have or plug it into your

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.440 
you already have or plug it into your
computer<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> top<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.610> rj45

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
computer on the top we have a rj45

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.969 
computer on the top we have a rj45
Ethernet<00:01:15.930> port<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.320> at<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> bottom<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:16.950> have

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
Ethernet port and at the bottom we have

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.910 
Ethernet port and at the bottom we have
a<00:01:17.130> USB<00:01:17.490> 2.0<00:01:18.240> port<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.689> well<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.320> reset<00:01:19.890> button

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
a USB 2.0 port as well as a reset button

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
a USB 2.0 port as well as a reset button
so<00:01:20.520> how<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.790> use<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.240> thing<00:01:21.450> well<00:01:21.659> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so how do you use the thing well it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.450 
so how do you use the thing well it
works<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.140> pretty<00:01:22.259> much<00:01:22.439> anything<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.220> can

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
works with pretty much anything you can

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.120 
works with pretty much anything you can
think<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.850> Windows<00:01:24.270> Linux<00:01:24.570> OS<00:01:25.049> 10<00:01:25.350> iOS<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
think of Windows Linux OS 10 iOS and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
think of Windows Linux OS 10 iOS and
Android<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.729> phones<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.509> simple<00:01:27.869> download

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
Android on phones it's simple download

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.230 
Android on phones it's simple download
the<00:01:28.409> next<00:01:28.770> two<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:28.920> Wi-Fi<00:01:29.340> Drive<00:01:29.640> app<00:01:29.850> turn

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the next two have Wi-Fi Drive app turn

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.940 
the next two have Wi-Fi Drive app turn

the results depend on the router as well

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
smooth sailing from there so the hotspot
