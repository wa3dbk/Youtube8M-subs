00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.699
 Welcome to the golf club good 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.030
 Share today the cool golf 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:45.070
 aligned and masters 2014 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.070
 connection, there is still the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.280
 what are the thin trends 2014 for you? 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.990
 in any case, pastel and sooner 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.250
 classic I really think of it 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.250
 time is becoming classic 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.320
 prefers too long then the middle 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.540
 or the miniskirt 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.580
 So I find such a medium-long 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.320
 third always very cool so very short and 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.920
 super mini is just not 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.920
 traditionally 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.190
 this year very strong you dare 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.360
 tomorrow in the hair or not yes I have 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.700
 especially used to it 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.390
 maritime man has in no time 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.200
 a super floral signature native 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.200
 constantly cover 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.600
 I can imagine that the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.250
 femininity is back in the foreground 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.500
 So I do the diapers that yes 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.210
 anyway sexy and so beautiful out of love 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.560
 women want that too, but that will 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.450
 still underlined by pastel 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.920
 Also sound through the style in you now 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.760
 So you have flower in the hair and me 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.760
 I am really happy about it 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.770
 what do you say blouse and the boggy yes 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.959
 or no for the vast majority this 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.120
 year because it's just way too much for us 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.069
 shows there are a few things you 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.130
 are that it is okay 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.430
 but I prefer safe 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.430
 page 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.590
 For what occasion would you give yourself one 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.060
 kindle one now I have one 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.010
 borrowed that was ever the perfect 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.300
 different with you just when you're at 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.310
 Watching TV is really nice 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.630
 always something new to have on 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.110

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.650
 more often knock on you know that from 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.750
 me 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.090
 I feel my dalliance yes in the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.590
 cupboard according to the wise but who not 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.450
 should have much space but rather 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.860
 borrowing because you want to resort 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.090
 indeed actually every year again so 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.090

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.739

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.079

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.519
