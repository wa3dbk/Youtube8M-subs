00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.060
 attention deficit disorder with 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.700
 hyperactivity or tdh as it is known 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.370
 commonly affects about 1 in each 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.860
 20 young people around the world can have 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.360
 a great impact on everyday life in 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.360
 the school and with friends 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.800
 the symptoms of neglect and 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.260
 impulsivity and hyperactivity can 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.330
 reduce a person's ability to 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.180
 control your actions and concentrate 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.580
 without being distracted 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.590
 some people have expressed their 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.200
 skepticism regarding the disorder 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.050
 but the brain images have 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.270
 shown that the symptoms of tdh are 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.310
 associated with a series of anomalies in 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.650
 the development and operation of 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.320
 some areas of the brain let's see first 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.140
 the cerebral cortex the superficial layer 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.899
 of the brain 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.940
 during normal development the bark 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.320
 which plays a key role in memory 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.869
 attention thinking and language increases 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.240
 gradually in thickness before reaching 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.670
 a maximum during adolescence the 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.490
 scanners show that in children with tdh 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.280
 the bark develops in general more 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.759
 slowly especially in the regions 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.400
 of the frontal and temporal lobes 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.430
 which are important for memory and 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.590
 to control the behavior generally 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.229
 the frontal cortex along with other 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.930
 fundamental parts of the brain are more 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.509
 small in children with tdh that in 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.130
 children who do not suffer from these parts of the 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.100
 brain do not work in isolation 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.590
 but they interact widely to 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.440
 create networks that control functions like 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.440
 the language the attention and the movement 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.990
 the activity of the different networks 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.880
 increases and decreases allowing 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.189
 the different functions take place 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.049
 for example while you're watching this 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.090
 video activity on networks 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.310
 involved in the processing of the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.560
 information usually has now 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.830
 increased while the activity in 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.500
 the networks involved in distraction 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.230
 will have decreased in a person with greg 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.170
 h the activity of these networks is 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.019
 altered and the connections within 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.849
 networks are interrupted and when 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.769
 we look more closely at communication 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.330
 between these networks there is also a 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.790
 upset in the release of 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.310
 dopamine chemicals and 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.769
 noradrenaline who are responsible 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.950
 of transmitting messages between cells 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.530
 brain in general terms when 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.230
 children with tdh carry out tasks 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.360
 specific some networks are not 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.340
 lit enough while 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.829
 others remain lit too 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.840
 time investigations throughout the 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.910
 world have shown differences in the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.370
 development and operation of 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.650
 brain of children with td h 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.959
 although we still can not use techniques 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.060
 of brain imaging to diagnose 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.090
 this disorder the more we learn 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.920
 about tdh in the brain better we can 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.250
 understand the symptoms that children with 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.989
 tdh experience in everyday life and 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.989
 more we can do to support them
