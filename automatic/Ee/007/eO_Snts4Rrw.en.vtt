00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
racing game that we've created so far

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.270 
racing game that we've created so far
mostly<00:00:13.790> create<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.940> greatest<00:00:16.190> create<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
mostly create and greatest create a

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.310 
mostly create and greatest create a
greatest<00:00:17.670> i've<00:00:18.180> already<00:00:18.420> created<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.140> blue

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
greatest i've already created a blue

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.010 
greatest i've already created a blue
latex<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.040> named<00:00:20.940> it<00:00:21.120> a<00:00:21.180> slab<00:00:21.450> checkpoint

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
latex and named it a slab checkpoint

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.370 
latex and named it a slab checkpoint
I've<00:00:22.710> initialize<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.610> way<00:00:24.000> texture<00:00:24.360> to<00:00:24.510> this

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I've initialize the way texture to this

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.360 
I've initialize the way texture to this
string<00:00:26.370> and<00:00:27.030> that<00:00:27.180> position<00:00:27.810> there<00:00:28.020> this<00:00:28.920> we

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
string and that position there this we

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.730 
string and that position there this we
take<00:00:29.610> so<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.000> way<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.990> will<00:00:31.200> be<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
take so that way it will be in the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.709 
take so that way it will be in the
bottom<00:00:32.129> right<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.600> screen<00:00:35.000> yeah<00:00:36.000> i've

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.970 
franchise yeah next week we need
checkpoints<00:00:49.429> checkpoints<00:00:50.429> can<00:00:50.609> be<00:00:50.789> created

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
checkpoints checkpoints can be created

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.979 
checkpoints checkpoints can be created
at<00:00:52.980> different<00:00:53.339> positions<00:00:53.519> within<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.629> racing

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
at different positions within the racing

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.160 
at different positions within the racing
track<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:56.449> I've<00:00:57.449> created<00:00:57.749> four

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
track right I've created four

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.049 
track right I've created four
checkpoints<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.829> different<00:00:59.309> positions<00:00:59.489> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
checkpoints at different positions and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.220 
checkpoints at different positions and
the<00:01:00.569> racing<00:01:00.899> track<00:01:02.210> force<00:01:03.210> what<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.510> your<00:01:03.719> yeah

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
the racing track force what if your yeah

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.830 
the racing track force what if your yeah
i<00:01:04.470> did<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.640> checkpoint<00:01:05.910> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.450> create<00:01:06.690> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
i did this checkpoint you can create a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.170 
i did this checkpoint you can create a
checkpoint<00:01:07.260> by<00:01:07.860> simply<00:01:08.250> creating<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.850> cube

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
checkpoint by simply creating the cube

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.010 
checkpoint by simply creating the cube
go<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> game<00:01:10.530> object<00:01:10.890> creator<00:01:11.660> create<00:01:12.660> a<00:01:12.690> queue

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
go to game object creator create a queue

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.270 
go to game object creator create a queue
yeah<00:01:14.150> after<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.110> or<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
yeah after that you get this or get the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
yeah after that you get this or get the
box<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.700> either<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.330> mesh<00:01:18.480> render<00:01:18.780> when

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
box but either and the mesh render when

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.280 
box but either and the mesh render when
you<00:01:19.440> create<00:01:19.800> a<00:01:19.830> cute<00:01:20.130> Willa<00:01:21.120> you<00:01:21.690> have<00:01:22.140> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you create a cute Willa you have to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.950 
you create a cute Willa you have to
create<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.980> script<00:01:23.820> name<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.270> checkpoint<00:01:24.510> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
create a script name this checkpoint and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.050 
create a script name this checkpoint and
add<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.980> script<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:27.120> this<00:01:27.860> what<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.130> say

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
add the script to this what you can say

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.630 
add the script to this what you can say
the<00:01:31.180> bottom<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.689> key<00:01:31.930> word<00:01:32.140> yeah<00:01:32.649> and<00:01:32.829> I

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
the bottom of the key word yeah and I

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.300 
the bottom of the key word yeah and I
will<00:01:33.820> ask<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.390> add<00:01:34.600> this<00:01:34.840> lab<00:01:35.740> check<00:01:36.040> point

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
will ask you to add this lab check point

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.050 
will ask you to add this lab check point
we<00:01:36.490> text<00:01:36.790> just<00:01:37.479> try<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:39.340> good<00:01:39.700> days<00:01:39.880> and

transparent image having a low this this
is<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.950> transparent<00:01:51.700> image<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.750> I've

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
is the transparent image that I've

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:01.819 
is the transparent image that I've
created<00:01:53.140> for<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.850> checkpoints<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.009> is

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
created for the checkpoints what it is

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.930 
created for the checkpoints what it is
yeah

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
yeah

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.870 
yeah
this<00:02:04.510> is<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.750> checkpoint<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.370> Finnish

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
this is a checkpoint this is a Finnish

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.770 
this is a checkpoint this is a Finnish
actually

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.500 

this<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.800> checkpoint<00:02:13.310> 1<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:14.270> is<00:02:14.480> a

this is a checkpoint 1 and this is a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.590 
this is a checkpoint 1 and this is a
finish<00:02:14.959> I<00:02:15.340> just<00:02:16.340> check<00:02:16.550> point<00:02:16.790> five<00:02:16.880> named<00:02:17.360> s

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600

checkpoint for here this is a finish
these<00:02:20.180> two<00:02:20.390> are<00:02:20.420> placed<00:02:20.930> some<00:02:21.590> other<00:02:21.770> some<00:02:22.370> of

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
these two are placed some other some of

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.680 
these two are placed some other some of
the<00:02:22.720> positions<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.260> track<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:26.090> follow

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
the positions on the track it you follow

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.960 
the positions on the track it you follow
the<00:02:26.870> same<00:02:27.080> procedure<00:02:27.530> for<00:02:27.830> all<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.790> four

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
the same procedure for all the four

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.510 
the same procedure for all the four
checkpoints<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:30.770> should<00:02:30.950> add<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.280> same

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
checkpoints you should add the same

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.100 
checkpoints you should add the same
script<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:33.530> can<00:02:33.770> add<00:02:34.130> different<00:02:35.110> images

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
script and you can add different images

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.430 
script and you can add different images
like<00:02:36.470> I've<00:02:37.370> added<00:02:37.610> here<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.660> can<00:02:38.840> create<00:02:39.110> you

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
like I've added here you can create you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.699 
like I've added here you can create you
or<00:02:39.800> perhaps<00:02:40.670> if<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.300> want<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.440> same

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
or perhaps if you want this the same

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.220 
or perhaps if you want this the same
images<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.400> I've<00:02:43.520> graded<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:44.570> can<00:02:44.780> ask<00:02:44.959> for

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
images that I've graded you can ask for

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.250 
images that I've graded you can ask for
it<00:02:45.500> or<00:02:46.400> I'll<00:02:46.550> be<00:02:46.820> putting<00:02:47.030> in<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.390> blog<00:02:47.630> then

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
it or I'll be putting in the blog then

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.530 
it or I'll be putting in the blog then
yeah<00:02:49.269> let's<00:02:50.769> go<00:02:51.769> before<00:02:52.070> that<00:02:52.280> will<00:02:53.000> create<00:02:53.360> a

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
yeah let's go before that will create a

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.380 
yeah let's go before that will create a
box<00:02:53.840> Collider<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.310> car<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.820> might<00:02:55.970> create<00:02:56.360> a

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
box Collider to the car I might create a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.120 
box Collider to the car I might create a
new<00:02:56.860> coat<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:57.910> confident<00:02:59.080> physics<00:03:00.130> box

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
new coat of confident physics box

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.610 
new coat of confident physics box
Collider<00:03:02.440> set<00:03:03.440> this<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.860> 10<00:03:04.660> 10<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:06.260> center

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
Collider set this to 10 10 the center

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.050 
Collider set this to 10 10 the center
and

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
and

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.690 
and
make<00:03:08.989> this<00:03:09.140> size<00:03:09.380> as<00:03:09.620> your<00:03:09.890> as<00:03:10.040> usual<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
make this size as your as usual the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.250 
make this size as your as usual the
reason<00:03:14.060> why<00:03:14.209> make<00:03:14.810> them<00:03:15.020> meet<00:03:15.230> si<00:03:15.560> 000<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:16.610> that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
reason why make them meet si 000 is that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.680 
reason why make them meet si 000 is that
if<00:03:18.260> this<00:03:18.590> box<00:03:18.860> below<00:03:19.160> there<00:03:20.000> are<00:03:20.180> chances<00:03:20.480> that

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
if this box below there are chances that

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.320 
if this box below there are chances that
a<00:03:21.190> car<00:03:22.190> may<00:03:23.230> behave<00:03:24.230> in<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.340> manner<00:03:25.489> which<00:03:25.790> we<00:03:26.180> do

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
a car may behave in a manner which we do

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.800 
a car may behave in a manner which we do
not<00:03:26.360> write<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.200> behave<00:03:27.560> right<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:29.209> can<00:03:29.450> check

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
not write to behave right you can check

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.800 
not write to behave right you can check
it<00:03:29.989> out<00:03:30.110> if<00:03:31.099> by<00:03:32.030> keeping<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.540> size<00:03:32.890> 100<00:03:33.890> or

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
it out if by keeping the size 100 or

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.520 
it out if by keeping the size 100 or
greater<00:03:35.810> than<00:03:36.050> that<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.440> prefer<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.630> 000<00:03:38.630> and

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
greater than that I prefer it 000 and

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.840 
greater than that I prefer it 000 and
what<00:03:39.680> we'll<00:03:39.890> do<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.720> we'll<00:03:42.459> check<00:03:43.459> out<00:03:43.640> this

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
what we'll do is we'll check out this

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.809 
what we'll do is we'll check out this
checkpoint<00:03:44.750> script<00:03:47.650> three<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:49.220> can<00:03:49.430> create<00:03:49.670> a

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
checkpoint script three you can create a

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.620 
checkpoint script three you can create a
checkpoint<00:03:50.239> script

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.440 

you<00:03:54.620> can<00:03:54.770> create<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.130> checkpoint<00:03:55.490> script<00:03:55.850> by

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
you can create a checkpoint script by

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.250 
you can create a checkpoint script by
creating<00:03:57.050> creating<00:03:58.210> JavaScript<00:03:59.210> right<00:03:59.420> this

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
creating creating JavaScript right this

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.070 
creating creating JavaScript right this
is<00:04:00.380> a<00:04:00.440> JavaScript<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:03.470> is<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.770> question<00:04:05.080> yeah

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
is a JavaScript this is a question yeah

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.540 
is a JavaScript this is a question yeah
what<00:04:07.070> this<00:04:07.550> does<00:04:08.090> is<00:04:08.380> firstly<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.650> will<00:04:09.830> find

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
what this does is firstly it will find

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.540 
what this does is firstly it will find

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
and I should also tag it with player try

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:10.270 
this carpet layer I've already tied it
you<00:05:04.670> can<00:05:04.880> tag<00:05:05.330> it<00:05:05.510> here<00:05:05.720> here<00:05:07.930> yeah

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
you can tag it here here yeah

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.060 
you can tag it here here yeah
if<00:05:10.630> this<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.810> well-documented<00:05:12.410> script

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
if this is a well-documented script

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.500 
if this is a well-documented script
actually<00:05:13.250> all<00:05:14.180> right<00:05:15.190> it's<00:05:16.190> actually<00:05:16.340> I<00:05:16.820> don't

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
actually all right it's actually I don't

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.379 
actually all right it's actually I don't
think<00:05:17.780> I<00:05:18.020> need<00:05:18.230> to<00:05:18.260> explain<00:05:18.830> this<00:05:19.790> since<00:05:20.150> it<00:05:20.270> as

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
think I need to explain this since it as

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.790 
think I need to explain this since it as
well<00:05:20.570> document<00:05:21.400> but<00:05:22.400> yeah<00:05:22.580> send<00:05:23.240> stuff<00:05:23.800> I've

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
well document but yeah send stuff I've

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.310 
well document but yeah send stuff I've
named<00:05:25.190> it<00:05:25.220> as<00:05:25.520> a<00:05:25.550> literally<00:05:26.330> targum<00:05:26.750> tutorial

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
named it as a literally targum tutorial

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.390 
named it as a literally targum tutorial
I<00:05:27.560> guess<00:05:28.400> it's<00:05:28.610> my<00:05:28.820> job<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:30.050> explain<00:05:30.650> a<00:05:30.919> bit

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
I guess it's my job to explain a bit

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.870 
I guess it's my job to explain a bit
about<00:05:31.460> this<00:05:34.990> if<00:05:35.990> if<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.650> competitor<00:05:37.310> is<00:05:37.580> clear

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
about this if if the competitor is clear

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.170 
about this if if the competitor is clear
if<00:05:38.470> it<00:05:39.470> is<00:05:39.560> not<00:05:39.740> if<00:05:40.130> it's<00:05:40.370> not<00:05:40.520> diet<00:05:40.940> player

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
if it is not if it's not diet player

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.659 
if it is not if it's not diet player
then<00:05:41.690> return<00:05:42.100> don't<00:05:43.100> increment<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:45.400> lap<00:05:46.400> or

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
then return don't increment the lap or

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.430 
then return don't increment the lap or
anything<00:05:47.240> away<00:05:47.540> need<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:47.840> functions<00:05:48.260> return

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
anything away need the functions return

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.890 
anything away need the functions return
you<00:05:48.650> just<00:05:48.680> returned<00:05:49.280> from<00:05:49.310> this<00:05:49.610> function<00:05:50.060> if

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
you just returned from this function if

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.130 
you just returned from this function if
if<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.440> transform<00:05:52.070> is<00:05:52.690> tagged<00:05:53.690> with<00:05:53.720> clear

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
if the transform is tagged with clear

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.020 
if the transform is tagged with clear
what<00:05:54.710> we<00:05:54.890> do<00:05:55.040> is<00:05:56.740> we<00:05:57.740> we<00:05:58.580> have<00:05:58.730> created

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
what we do is we we have created

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.090 
what we do is we we have created
together<00:06:01.270> right<00:06:02.270> why<00:06:03.140> should<00:06:03.350> I<00:06:03.440> should<00:06:03.800> open

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
together right why should I should open

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.100 
together right why should I should open
this<00:06:04.280> first<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:05.270> be<00:06:05.419> honest<00:06:06.340> car<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.640> point

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
this first to be honest car to the point

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.830 
this first to be honest car to the point
CH<00:06:10.150> open<00:06:11.150> this<00:06:11.300> since<00:06:11.600> I've<00:06:11.780> used<00:06:12.250> these<00:06:13.250> TCO

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
CH open this since I've used these TCO

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.719 
CH open this since I've used these TCO
this<00:06:14.840> is<00:06:15.020> a<00:06:15.050> car<00:06:15.380> checkpoint<00:06:15.830> that<00:06:16.430> we'll<00:06:16.700> be

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
this is a car checkpoint that we'll be

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:22.390 
this is a car checkpoint that we'll be
adding<00:06:17.500> first<00:06:18.500> a<00:06:18.650> lattice<00:06:19.100> to<00:06:19.340> this<00:06:20.270> car<00:06:21.400> and

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
adding first a lattice to this car and

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.850 
adding first a lattice to this car and
this<00:06:23.180> here

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
this here

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.260 
this here
I<00:06:24.919> said<00:06:25.759> did<00:06:25.990> take<00:06:26.990> point<00:06:27.469> sighs<00:06:27.919> right<00:06:28.460> since

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
I said did take point sighs right since

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.080 
I said did take point sighs right since
I've<00:06:29.449> created<00:06:29.840> four<00:06:30.199> checkpoints<00:06:30.879> I've<00:06:31.879> set

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
I've created four checkpoints I've set

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.899 
I've created four checkpoints I've set
it<00:06:32.120> to<00:06:32.240> four<00:06:32.689> and<00:06:33.310> drag<00:06:34.310> these<00:06:34.580> checkpoints

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
it to four and drag these checkpoints

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:37.389 
it to four and drag these checkpoints
