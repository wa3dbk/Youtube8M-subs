00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.410 
it's very very easy to do and I will
give<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> quick<00:01:26.430> demo<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.820> how<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
give a quick demo on how you do that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.539 
give a quick demo on how you do that
because<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.780> very<00:01:28.049> very<00:01:28.170> easy<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.310> box

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
because it is very very easy in the box

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.130 
because it is very very easy in the box
you<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.180> remote<00:01:30.420> control<00:01:30.840> which<00:01:31.020> I've

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
you get your remote control which I've

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.539 
you get your remote control which I've
got<00:01:31.290> my<00:01:31.439> own<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
got my own one here so you do get the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.700 
got my own one here so you do get the
box<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.210> then<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.659> also<00:01:33.840> get<00:01:34.200> your<00:01:34.350> power

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
box and then you also get your power

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
box and then you also get your power
supply<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.310> well<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.610> course<00:01:35.640> which<00:01:36.210> comes<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
supply as well of course which comes in

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.190 
supply as well of course which comes in
the<00:01:36.750> box<00:01:36.960> okay<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.579> also<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:39.329> if

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the box okay and then you also get if

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.530 
the box okay and then you also get if
you<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.560> your<00:01:41.100> cable<00:01:41.610> yeah<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:41.970> was<00:01:42.270> gonna<00:01:42.390> ask

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
you get your cable yeah I was gonna ask

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.819 
you get your cable yeah I was gonna ask
about<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.899> cable<00:01:43.170> because<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.619> quite<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
about the cable because if it's quite a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.069 
about the cable because if it's quite a
new<00:01:44.100> TV<00:01:44.340> presumably<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.450> attach<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
new TV presumably we can attach with the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.139 
new TV presumably we can attach with the
HDMI<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.939> slightly<00:01:48.149> older<00:01:48.659> team

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
HDMI but if it's a slightly older team

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.880 
HDMI but if it's a slightly older team
that's<00:01:51.149> such<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> good<00:01:51.689> point<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.710> you've

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
that's such a good point so if you've

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.819 
that's such a good point so if you've
got<00:01:53.100> one<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.310> these<00:01:53.460> massive<00:01:54.299> CRT<00:01:55.229> television

goodness<00:02:18.280> our<00:02:18.430> program<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.270> Vsauce<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.050> all

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
goodness our program is a Vsauce and all

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.540 
goodness our program is a Vsauce and all
that<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:20.350> straightforward<00:02:20.890> thing<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.340> it's

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
that so straightforward thing is it's

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.860 
that so straightforward thing is it's
very<00:02:21.610> straightforward<00:02:21.970> let<00:02:22.450> me<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> quick

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
very straightforward let me do a quick

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.600 
very straightforward let me do a quick
demo<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.170> how<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.440> would<00:02:23.770> set<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:23.950> up<00:02:24.160> first<00:02:24.430> of

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
demo on how you would set it up first of

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.090 
demo on how you would set it up first of
all<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.360> we<00:02:25.540> need<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.990> connect<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.860> Wi-Fi

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
all so we need to connect to the Wi-Fi

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.030 
all so we need to connect to the Wi-Fi
first<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.730> all<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.120> I'll<00:02:28.750> emulate<00:02:29.470> how<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.860> how

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
first of all and I'll emulate how it how

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.680 
first of all and I'll emulate how it how
it<00:02:30.160> works<00:02:30.430> because<00:02:30.670> I've<00:02:30.940> already<00:02:31.240> set<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.450> up

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
it works because I've already set it up

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.320 
it works because I've already set it up
occurs<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.680> when<00:02:32.950> your<00:02:33.100> very<00:02:33.430> first<00:02:33.670> home<00:02:33.940> Roco

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
occurs so when your very first home Roco

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.570 
occurs so when your very first home Roco
on<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:35.110> will<00:02:35.260> ask<00:02:35.440> for<00:02:35.770> your<00:02:35.950> network<00:02:36.160> your

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
on it will ask for your network your

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.550 
on it will ask for your network your
your<00:02:36.850> intimates<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.570> then<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.230> would<00:02:38.380> put

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
your intimates and then you would put

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.950 
your intimates and then you would put
your<00:02:38.710> Wi-Fi<00:02:39.100> in<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.610> this<00:02:40.420> was<00:02:40.600> how<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.810> would

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
your Wi-Fi in so this was how it would

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.170 
your Wi-Fi in so this was how it would
look<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.890> would<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.550> know<00:02:42.670> search<00:02:42.910> for<00:02:43.090> all

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
look it would you know search for all

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.250 
look it would you know search for all
the<00:02:43.240> Wi-Fi<00:02:43.360> than<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.750> area<00:02:45.390> network<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:47.050> we're

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
the Wi-Fi than the area network so we're

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.140 
the Wi-Fi than the area network so we're
in<00:02:47.410> Studio<00:02:47.709> B<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.700> would<00:02:48.820> select<00:02:48.940> your

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
in Studio B and you would select your

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.210 
in Studio B and you would select your
home<00:02:49.330> network<00:02:49.510> not<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.170> neighbors<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:51.010> for

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
home network not the neighbors just for

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.190 
home network not the neighbors just for
one<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:51.880> we'd<00:02:52.030> select<00:02:52.270> that<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.959> input

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
one so we'd select that one you input

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.390 
one so we'd select that one you input
your<00:02:53.410> password<00:02:53.709> I've<00:02:54.490> already<00:02:54.820> pre<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.840> know

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
your password I've already pre you know

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.280 
your password I've already pre you know
it's<00:02:57.400> already<00:02:57.640> done<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:58.390> hit<00:02:58.570> connect<00:02:58.959> and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
it's already done and we hit connect and
