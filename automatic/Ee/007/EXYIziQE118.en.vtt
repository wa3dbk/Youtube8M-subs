00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
how you I'm not sure if that cord is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.590 
how you I'm not sure if that cord is
actually<00:01:02.190> right<00:01:02.370> by<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:02.699> there<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.300> some

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
actually right by know there is some

actually right by know there is some
kind<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.840> change<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.769> um<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.460> thought

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
kind of change there so um I thought

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.109 
kind of change there so um I thought
how's<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> thing<00:01:06.450> fit<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.560> most<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.159> so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
how's the thing fit the most and so

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.700 
how's the thing fit the most and so
after<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.390> say<00:01:09.600> stop<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.670> he<00:01:11.670> goes<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:13.560> this

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
after I say stop and he goes to this

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.030 
after I say stop and he goes to this
court<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.210> that's<00:01:15.330> yi<00:01:15.659> b<00:01:16.619> &amp;<00:01:16.860> E<00:01:17.369> flat

face nothing's changed no one can take
your<00:01:47.200> place<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.850> gets<00:01:49.180> harder<00:01:50.080> every<00:01:51.040> day<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
your place it gets harder every day and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.800 
your place it gets harder every day and
then<00:01:53.500> goes<00:01:53.650> back<00:01:53.860> down<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.540> what<00:01:55.540> happens

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
then goes back down and what happens

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.900 
then goes back down and what happens
here<00:01:56.050> is<00:01:56.290> it's<00:01:56.830> basically<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.280> same<00:01:57.369> chords

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
here is it's basically the same chords

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.440 
here is it's basically the same chords
but<00:01:58.540> again<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.229> without<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.680> third<00:01:59.920> or<00:02:00.880> just

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
but again and without the third or just

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.290 
but again and without the third or just
inverted<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.460> it's<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.600> minor<00:02:04.810> since<00:02:05.110> me<00:02:06.300> you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
inverted so it's a minor since me you

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.820 
inverted so it's a minor since me you
pay<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.479> twice<00:02:08.790> then<00:02:09.790> you<00:02:09.880> pay<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.209> D<00:02:10.830> so

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
pay that twice then you pay the D so

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.620 
pay that twice then you pay the D so
it's<00:02:12.010> almost<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.459> these<00:02:13.120> two<00:02:13.330> notes<00:02:13.480> are

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
it's almost like these two notes are

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.860 
it's almost like these two notes are
connected<00:02:14.020> sirs<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:16.650> then<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:19.950> f30<00:02:20.950> Weiss

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
connected sirs and then to the f30 Weiss

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.790 
connected sirs and then to the f30 Weiss
this<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.320> see<00:02:23.620> boats<00:02:24.010> o<00:02:24.400> ye<00:02:24.790> add<00:02:25.090> g<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.200> come

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
this is a see boats o ye add g and come

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.610 
this is a see boats o ye add g and come
here<00:02:27.630> but<00:02:28.630> once<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:30.010> they<00:02:30.489> go<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.670> UM<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:32.380> gene

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
here but once and they go to UM the gene

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.360 
here but once and they go to UM the gene
up<00:02:32.860> here<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.730> as<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.470> g.f<00:02:35.470> e<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:37.470> then<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.920> g

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
up here so as a g.f e and then to the g

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.320 
up here so as a g.f e and then to the g
chord<00:02:39.610> down<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.600> that's<00:02:40.930> Judy<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:43.060> pay<00:02:43.209> out

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
chord down is that's Judy you pay out

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:55.320 
chord down is that's Judy you pay out
twice<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:53.080> then<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:54.010> goes<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:55.030> that's<00:02:55.209> just

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
twice and then it goes so that's just

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.030 
twice and then it goes so that's just
the<00:02:55.510> right<00:02:55.630> hands<00:02:56.049> there's<00:02:56.440> no<00:02:56.590> left<00:02:56.830> half<00:02:57.010> of

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
the right hands there's no left half of

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.210 
the right hands there's no left half of
