chicken breast with roasted turkey I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.660 
chicken breast with roasted turkey I
mean<00:01:10.740> basically<00:01:10.890> may<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> whole

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
mean basically may have like the whole

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.740 
mean basically may have like the whole
left<00:01:11.820> side<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> menu<00:01:12.210> maybe<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.630> might

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
left side of the menu maybe that might

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
left side of the menu maybe that might
help<00:01:12.930> relieve<00:01:13.200> them<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:13.979> actually<00:01:14.189> have

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
help relieve them so they actually have

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.130 
help relieve them so they actually have

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
done Studies on my brain like three

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.570 
done Studies on my brain like three
hours<00:01:16.170> studies<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.770> EEG<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.490> they

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
hours studies in the EEG and when they

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.090 
hours studies in the EEG and when they
found<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.110> broker<00:01:19.530> section<00:01:20.009> of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
found out is that the broker section of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.160 
found out is that the broker section of
my<00:01:20.189> brain<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.670> controls<00:01:20.700> speech<00:01:21.330> won't<00:01:22.049> do

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
my brain which controls speech won't do

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.330 
my brain which controls speech won't do
different<00:01:22.500> than<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> lot<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.830> other<00:01:22.979> people's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
