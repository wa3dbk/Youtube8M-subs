been invented by the great Brendon power
for<00:00:09.120> new<00:00:09.210> tuning<00:00:10.040> configuration<00:00:11.040> I've<00:00:11.550> had

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
for new tuning configuration I've had

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.430 
for new tuning configuration I've had
one<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:11.969> these<00:00:12.120> harps<00:00:12.389> for<00:00:12.690> about<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> month<00:00:13.139> now

and have been mucking around with it and
I'm<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.480> having<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.870> lot<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.049> fun<00:00:16.320> trying<00:00:16.560> to

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
learn how to use it so I just wanted to

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.250 
learn how to use it so I just wanted to
say<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> few<00:00:19.560> words<00:00:19.830> about<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.490> Brendon<00:00:20.880> has

invented which i think is you know
absolutely<00:00:23.779> fantastic<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.140> these<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.439> my<00:00:25.560> my

own opinions I'm independent I'm doing

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.349 
own opinions I'm independent I'm doing
this<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.160> because<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.519> want<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.970> because<00:00:30.269> I

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
this just because I want to because I

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.030 
this just because I want to because I
think<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:31.349> Brendan's<00:00:31.740> done<00:00:31.920> is

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
think this is what Brendan's done is

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.930 
think this is what Brendan's done is
really<00:00:32.340> significant<00:00:33.170> I<00:00:34.370> uploaded<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.550> tune<00:00:35.790> by

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
really significant I uploaded a tune by

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.549 
really significant I uploaded a tune by
the<00:00:36.000> way<00:00:36.210> dedicated<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> Brendan<00:00:37.290> called

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the way dedicated to Brendan called

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.220 
the way dedicated to Brendan called
Brendan<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.340> few<00:00:38.850> days<00:00:39.000> ago<00:00:39.180> using<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.840> this

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
Brendan a few days ago using this this

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.000 
Brendan a few days ago using this this
tuning<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.040> definitely<00:00:41.670> worth<00:00:41.820> checking<00:00:42.090> out

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
tuning so definitely worth checking out

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.459 
tuning so definitely worth checking out
I<00:00:44.010> think<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.940> these<00:00:45.170> these<00:00:46.170> harps

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I think you can get these these harps

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.959 
I think you can get these these harps
from<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> different<00:00:47.579> manufacturers

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
from all the different manufacturers

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.729 
from all the different manufacturers
Brendan<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:48.629> either<00:00:48.750> make<00:00:48.960> them<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.559> you

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
Brendan will either make them up for you

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.240 
Brendan will either make them up for you
in<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.969> Suzuki<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.129> get

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
in a Suzuki as I have here you can get

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
in a Suzuki as I have here you can get
him<00:00:53.370> direct<00:00:53.670> from<00:00:53.879> zidle<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.510> think<00:00:54.690> Brendan

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
him direct from zidle I think Brendan

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.020 
him direct from zidle I think Brendan
will<00:00:55.110> make<00:00:55.289> homeowners<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.489> new<00:00:56.670> tuning

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
will make homeowners in this new tuning

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.340 
will make homeowners in this new tuning
as<00:00:57.120> well<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:57.870> doesn't<00:00:58.109> matter<00:00:58.170> if

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
as well so it really doesn't matter if

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.049 
as well so it really doesn't matter if
you<00:00:58.469> prefer<00:00:58.800> one<00:00:59.070> manufacturer<00:00:59.730> or<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> other

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
you prefer one manufacturer or the other

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.250 
you prefer one manufacturer or the other
you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.379> main<00:01:01.680> ones<00:01:02.120> um

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
you can get this in all the main ones um

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
you can get this in all the main ones um
so<00:01:04.260> what<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.799> say<00:01:04.979> about<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.180> first

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so what to say about it so the first

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.020 
so what to say about it so the first
thing<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.290> way<00:01:07.470> my<00:01:07.500> mind<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.340> really

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
thing is in a way my mind is not really

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.170 
thing is in a way my mind is not really
a<00:01:09.240> new<00:01:10.020> tuning<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.280> more<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.909> with

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
a new tuning it's it's more to do with

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.230 
a new tuning it's it's more to do with
taking<00:01:12.869> familiar<00:01:13.830> notes<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.090> you'll

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
taking familiar notes that what you'll

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.480 
taking familiar notes that what you'll
be<00:01:15.420> used<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.990> play<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.530> standard<00:01:17.250> tune

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
be used to if you play a standard tune

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.340 
be used to if you play a standard tune
harmonica<00:01:18.210> especially<00:01:18.659> as<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> Blues<00:01:19.049> player

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
harmonica especially as a Blues player

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.380 
harmonica especially as a Blues player
or<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> roots<00:01:19.710> player<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.310> laying<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.180> in

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
or a roots player and laying them out in

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.880 
or a roots player and laying them out in
a<00:01:21.450> different<00:01:21.600> way<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.020> there's<00:01:22.439> no<00:01:22.530> kind<00:01:22.799> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
a different way so there's no kind of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.499 
a different way so there's no kind of
out<00:01:23.130> notes<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.670> unusual<00:01:24.180> notes<00:01:26.060> with<00:01:27.060> without

out notes or unusual notes with without

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.870 
out notes or unusual notes with without
bending<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.380> it'll<00:01:28.979> instantly<00:01:29.490> sound

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
bending so it'll instantly sound

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.620 
bending so it'll instantly sound
familiar<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.610> bottom<00:01:33.030> part<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
familiar to you the bottom part of the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.080 
familiar to you the bottom part of the
harmonica<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.979> say<00:01:35.009> blow<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.939> two

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
harmonica that is to say blow one to two

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.940 
harmonica that is to say blow one to two
or<00:01:36.180> four<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.659> exactly<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.470> same<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
or four is exactly the same as a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.460 
or four is exactly the same as a
standard<00:01:38.640> tuned<00:01:39.329> harmonica<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.259> means

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
standard tuned harmonica so that means

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
standard tuned harmonica so that means
all<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> cross<00:01:41.130> positions<00:01:41.670> staff<00:01:42.000> all<00:01:42.210> the

all the cross positions staff all the

all the cross positions staff all the
straight<00:01:42.810> position<00:01:42.960> third<00:01:43.439> position<00:01:43.470> stuff

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
straight position third position stuff

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.840 
straight position third position stuff
you're<00:01:44.189> used<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.460> playing

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.480 

it's<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.410> as<00:01:52.410> it<00:01:52.650> was<00:01:52.770> he'll<00:01:52.980> be<00:01:53.070> instantly

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it's all as as it was he'll be instantly

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.400 
it's all as as it was he'll be instantly
familiar<00:01:59.330> so<00:02:00.330> all<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.750> stuff<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.170> right

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
familiar so all that stuff is right

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.000 
familiar so all that stuff is right
there<00:02:01.620> it's<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:02.130> above<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.150> from<00:02:03.390> 12<00:02:03.570> 5

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
there it's really above so from 12 5

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.100 
there it's really above so from 12 5
upwards<00:02:05.010> where<00:02:05.220> things<00:02:05.520> start<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.940> change<00:02:06.110> um

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
upwards where things start to change um

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.499 
upwards where things start to change um
so<00:02:08.009> all<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.310> anchoring<00:02:08.880> stuff<00:02:09.179> you're<00:02:09.330> used

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
so all the anchoring stuff you're used

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.880 
so all the anchoring stuff you're used
to<00:02:09.630> doing<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.700> available<00:02:11.700> straightaway

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
to doing will be available straightaway

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.620 
to doing will be available straightaway
now<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.950> main<00:02:14.220> things<00:02:14.670> about<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.120> harp<00:02:15.390> as<00:02:15.600> I

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
now the main things about this harp as I

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.720 
now the main things about this harp as I
said<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.380> all<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.100> notes<00:02:17.280> will<00:02:17.580> be

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
said is that all the notes will be

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.580 
said is that all the notes will be
familiar<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.900> easy<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.230> get<00:02:19.440> up

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
familiar to you so it's easy to get up

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.890 
familiar to you so it's easy to get up
and<00:02:19.770> running<00:02:20.100> but<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.970> main<00:02:21.209> difference<00:02:21.690> is

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
and running but the main difference is

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.750 
and running but the main difference is
that<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.740> notes<00:02:22.980> which<00:02:23.190> are<00:02:23.340> familiar<00:02:23.459> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
that the the notes which are familiar to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.220 
that the the notes which are familiar to
you<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.120> laid<00:02:24.300> out<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> different<00:02:25.050> way<00:02:25.200> so

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
you and laid out in a different way so

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.820 
you and laid out in a different way so
for<00:02:25.890> instance<00:02:26.280> below<00:02:27.180> 6<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.750> below<00:02:27.900> 5<00:02:28.320> on<00:02:28.770> a

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
for instance below 6 and below 5 on a

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.520 
for instance below 6 and below 5 on a
standard<00:02:29.580> chin<00:02:29.820> harmonica<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.630> now<00:02:31.050> draw

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
standard chin harmonica and now draw

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.949 
standard chin harmonica and now draw
notes<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.820> that's<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.209> one<00:02:33.360> example<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.900> how

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
notes and that's just one example of how

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.470 
notes and that's just one example of how
Brendan's<00:02:34.890> laid<00:02:35.160> out<00:02:35.370> some<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.790> these<00:02:35.910> these

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
Brendan's laid out some of these these

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.850 
Brendan's laid out some of these these
notes<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.900> don't<00:02:37.050> all<00:02:37.140> sort<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.380> go<00:02:37.530> through<00:02:37.709> and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
notes I don't all sort of go through and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.140 
notes I don't all sort of go through and
break<00:02:38.010> everything<00:02:38.340> down<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:38.820> want<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
break everything down I just want to

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.440 
break everything down I just want to
give<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> an<00:02:39.690> overview<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:41.000> crucial<00:02:42.000> notes<00:02:42.239> in

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
give a an overview but crucial notes in

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.000 
give a an overview but crucial notes in
our<00:02:42.540> draw<00:02:42.840> notes<00:02:43.110> which<00:02:43.290> means<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.800> give

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
our draw notes which means you can give

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.920 
our draw notes which means you can give
that<00:02:44.220> draw<00:02:44.610> no<00:02:44.850> attack<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.780> get

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
that draw no attack and you can get

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.380 
that draw no attack and you can get
vibrato<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.830> bend<00:02:47.430> them<00:02:47.760> which<00:02:47.970> gives<00:02:48.150> lots

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
vibrato and bend them which gives lots

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.850 
vibrato and bend them which gives lots
of<00:02:48.510> other<00:02:48.690> different<00:02:49.080> possibilities<00:02:49.650> I'll

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
of other different possibilities I'll

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.630 
of other different possibilities I'll
come<00:02:50.070> on<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> minute<00:02:50.519> so<00:02:51.300> for<00:02:51.540> example<00:02:52.110> in

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
come on to in a minute so for example in

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.300 
come on to in a minute so for example in
cross<00:02:53.640> position<00:02:54.120> draw<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.900> an<00:02:55.500> octave<00:02:56.190> above

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
cross position draw to an octave above

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.460 
cross position draw to an octave above
is<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.760> blow<00:02:56.970> 6<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.810> standard<00:02:58.290> sheet

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
is to blow 6 on a standard sheet

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.930 
is to blow 6 on a standard sheet
harmonica<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.100> isn't<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.489> draw<00:02:59.880> 6<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
harmonica that isn't in a draw 6 and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.170 
harmonica that isn't in a draw 6 and
that<00:03:06.810> note<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.290> also<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:07.769> bendable<00:03:08.549> now

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
that note is also now bendable now

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.949 
that note is also now bendable now
because<00:03:09.570> these<00:03:10.230> these<00:03:10.680> notes<00:03:10.950> have<00:03:11.130> bendable

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
because these these notes have bendable

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.870 
because these these notes have bendable
from<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.530> middle<00:03:14.070> part<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.760> whole

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
from the middle part of the whole

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.610 
from the middle part of the whole
moniker<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.330> upper<00:03:15.630> register<00:03:15.810> normally

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
moniker in the upper register normally

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.560 
moniker in the upper register normally
to<00:03:16.739> get<00:03:16.890> certain<00:03:17.250> flat<00:03:17.580> notes<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.299> minor

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
to get certain flat notes like the minor

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.680 
to get certain flat notes like the minor
third<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.530> flat<00:03:19.799> 5<00:03:20.100> you'd<00:03:20.700> have<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.030> use<00:03:21.299> over

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
third the flat 5 you'd have to use over

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.780 
third the flat 5 you'd have to use over
blows<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.590> now<00:03:22.799> they're<00:03:23.070> just<00:03:23.280> standard

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
blows but now they're just standard

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.750 
blows but now they're just standard
bends<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.630> for<00:03:24.870> example<00:03:25.350> in<00:03:25.680> cross<00:03:26.280> position

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
bends so for example in cross position

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.300 
bends so for example in cross position
again<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.600> minor<00:03:27.870> third<00:03:28.320> which<00:03:28.769> is<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.070> draw

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
again the minor third which is the draw

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.030 
again the minor third which is the draw
three<00:03:29.610> half<00:03:29.820> step<00:03:30.150> Bend

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:43.360 

now<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.099> can<00:03:34.370> do<00:03:34.459> that<00:03:34.610> under<00:03:34.760> all<00:03:35.000> seven<00:03:42.370> no

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
now you can do that under all seven no

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.610 
now you can do that under all seven no
over<00:03:43.640> but<00:03:43.819> it's<00:03:43.969> really<00:03:44.180> really<00:03:44.840> really<00:03:45.349> great

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
over but it's really really really great

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.399 
over but it's really really really great
and<00:03:47.890> because<00:03:48.890> certain<00:03:49.819> notes<00:03:50.090> are<00:03:50.420> now<00:03:50.659> next

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
and because certain notes are now next

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.319 
and because certain notes are now next
to<00:03:51.620> each<00:03:51.739> other<00:03:51.920> whereas<00:03:52.730> on<00:03:52.879> the<00:03:52.939> standard

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
to each other whereas on the standard

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.199 
to each other whereas on the standard
harmonica<00:03:53.780> they're<00:03:53.930> not<00:03:54.230> next<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.680> each<00:03:54.709> other

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
harmonica they're not next to each other

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.289 
harmonica they're not next to each other
um<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.629> have<00:03:56.780> new<00:03:56.989> chordal<00:03:57.560> possibilities<00:03:58.310> so

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
um you have new chordal possibilities so

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.990 
um you have new chordal possibilities so
for<00:03:59.569> instance<00:03:59.930> blow<00:04:00.349> five<00:04:00.739> is<00:04:01.129> now<00:04:01.250> draw<00:04:01.670> five

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
for instance blow five is now draw five

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.449 
for instance blow five is now draw five
which<00:04:02.299> means<00:04:02.540> it's<00:04:02.689> next<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.139> draw<00:04:03.379> four<00:04:03.769> and

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
which means it's next to draw four and

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.309 
which means it's next to draw four and
that<00:04:04.639> gives<00:04:04.909> you<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.120> new<00:04:05.420> kind<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.840> chord<00:04:06.109> and

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
that gives you a new kind of chord and

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.190 
that gives you a new kind of chord and
you<00:04:06.439> sound<00:04:06.829> and<00:04:07.189> you'd<00:04:07.670> head<00:04:08.000> roll<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.510> new<00:04:08.900> kind

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
you sound and you'd head roll a new kind

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.899 
you sound and you'd head roll a new kind
of<00:04:09.319> trill<00:04:09.709> which<00:04:10.250> you<00:04:10.370> can't<00:04:10.639> do<00:04:10.879> because

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
of trill which you can't do because

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.640 
of trill which you can't do because
those<00:04:11.389> notes<00:04:11.689> are<00:04:11.870> not<00:04:11.989> normally<00:04:12.319> next<00:04:12.560> to

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
those notes are not normally next to

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.960 
those notes are not normally next to
each<00:04:12.769> other<00:04:12.889> you<00:04:13.099> have<00:04:13.129> to<00:04:13.250> go<00:04:13.459> from<00:04:13.700> a<00:04:13.730> blow<00:04:13.939> to

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
each other you have to go from a blow to

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.390 
each other you have to go from a blow to
a<00:04:14.150> draw<00:04:14.419> but<00:04:14.659> now<00:04:14.750> it's<00:04:14.900> just<00:04:15.139> a<00:04:15.200> draw<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:16.190> for

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
a draw but now it's just a draw so for

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.819 
a draw but now it's just a draw so for
instance<00:04:16.759> going<00:04:17.599> to<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.930> four<00:04:18.229> chord<00:04:18.590> in

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
instance going to the four chord in

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.560 
instance going to the four chord in
cross<00:04:19.340> position<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:19.880> can<00:04:20.000> get<00:04:20.120> this<00:04:20.209> really

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
cross position you can get this really

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:31.360 
cross position you can get this really
nice<00:04:20.720> chordal<00:04:21.680> effect<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.740> lots<00:04:31.190> of

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
nice chordal effect so lots of

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.670 
nice chordal effect so lots of
interesting<00:04:32.060> chord<00:04:32.389> impossibilities<00:04:32.870> all

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
interesting chord impossibilities all

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.480 
interesting chord impossibilities all
the<00:04:34.220> main<00:04:34.639> octaves<00:04:35.150> are<00:04:35.330> still<00:04:35.599> there<00:04:35.840> um<00:04:36.800> for

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
the main octaves are still there um for

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.010 
the main octaves are still there um for
that<00:04:37.610> sort<00:04:37.820> of<00:04:37.849> big<00:04:38.060> William<00:04:38.330> Clark<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.780> kind

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
that sort of big William Clark you kind

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:46.409 
that sort of big William Clark you kind
of<00:04:39.080> sound<00:04:39.260> that<00:04:42.729> all<00:04:43.729> that<00:04:43.940> still<00:04:44.330> there<00:04:45.190> and

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
of sound that all that still there and

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.300 
of sound that all that still there and
also<00:04:47.419> because<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.470> notes<00:04:48.740> are<00:04:48.949> laid<00:04:49.099> out

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
also because the notes are laid out

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.610 
also because the notes are laid out
differently<00:04:49.490> you're<00:04:50.449> forced<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.080> play<00:04:51.349> in<00:04:51.530> a

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
differently you're forced to play in a

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.010 
differently you're forced to play in a
different<00:04:52.039> way<00:04:52.250> which<00:04:52.970> means<00:04:53.240> you<00:04:53.510> sort<00:04:53.990> of

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
different way which means you sort of

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.740 
different way which means you sort of
avoid<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:54.530> lot<00:04:54.919> of<00:04:54.949> the<00:04:55.130> cliches<00:04:55.699> and<00:04:56.000> traps

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
avoid a lot of the cliches and traps

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.040 
avoid a lot of the cliches and traps
that<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.080> fall<00:04:57.289> into<00:04:57.320> with<00:04:57.889> a<00:04:58.099> standard<00:04:58.729> tune

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
that you fall into with a standard tune

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.850 
that you fall into with a standard tune
harmonica<00:05:00.050> forces<00:05:00.590> you<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.740> think

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
harmonica forces you to think

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.890 
harmonica forces you to think
differently<00:05:01.250> but<00:05:02.090> because<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.479> notes<00:05:02.720> are

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
differently but because the notes are

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.899 
differently but because the notes are
familiar<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:03.289> you<00:05:03.530> it'll<00:05:04.010> still<00:05:04.400> kind<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:04.760> make

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
familiar to you it'll still kind of make

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.879 
familiar to you it'll still kind of make
sense<00:05:05.240> in<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.539> upshot<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:05.960> you'll<00:05:06.169> make<00:05:06.530> new

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
sense in the upshot is you'll make new

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.129 
sense in the upshot is you'll make new
licks<00:05:07.220> I<00:05:07.520> think<00:05:07.849> this<00:05:07.940> is<00:05:08.060> partly<00:05:08.360> why<00:05:08.539> Brenden

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
licks I think this is partly why Brenden

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.260 
licks I think this is partly why Brenden
sounds<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:09.620> unique<00:05:10.039> is<00:05:10.280> because<00:05:10.610> he<00:05:11.120> doesn't

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
sounds so unique is because he doesn't

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.659 
sounds so unique is because he doesn't
play<00:05:11.570> what<00:05:11.810> anyone<00:05:12.080> else<00:05:12.110> plays<00:05:12.530> because<00:05:12.889> the

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
play what anyone else plays because the

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.050 
play what anyone else plays because the
way<00:05:13.820> these<00:05:14.060> these<00:05:14.720> notes<00:05:14.990> are<00:05:15.199> laid<00:05:15.349> out<00:05:16.060> the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
way these these notes are laid out the

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.170 
way these these notes are laid out the
next<00:05:17.300> thing<00:05:17.539> to<00:05:17.690> say<00:05:17.870> is<00:05:18.380> that<00:05:19.159> certain<00:05:19.729> parts

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
next thing to say is that certain parts

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.629 
next thing to say is that certain parts
of<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.389> harmonica<00:05:20.990> are<00:05:21.199> kind<00:05:21.500> of<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.889> lift<00:05:22.430> and

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
of the harmonica are kind of a lift and

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.060 
of the harmonica are kind of a lift and
shift<00:05:22.940> for<00:05:23.659> what<00:05:23.840> you're<00:05:24.050> so<00:05:24.620> if<00:05:24.740> used<00:05:24.949> to

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
shift for what you're so if used to

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.180 
shift for what you're so if used to
playing<00:05:25.310> so<00:05:25.639> for<00:05:25.820> instance<00:05:26.180> draw<00:05:26.990> two<00:05:27.530> two<00:05:28.039> two

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
playing so for instance draw two two two

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.659 
playing so for instance draw two two two
or<00:05:28.220> four<00:05:28.669> is<00:05:29.000> exactly<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.930> same<00:05:30.199> as<00:05:30.470> draw<00:05:31.220> six

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
or four is exactly the same as draw six

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.410 
or four is exactly the same as draw six
to<00:05:31.849> draw<00:05:32.090> eight<00:05:32.300> so

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.790 

and<00:05:38.420> normal<00:05:38.720> you<00:05:38.810> have<00:05:38.840> that<00:05:39.080> over<00:05:39.260> bloats<00:05:39.560> get

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
and normal you have that over bloats get

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.830 
and normal you have that over bloats get
that<00:05:39.920> kind<00:05:40.160> of<00:05:40.250> flat<00:05:40.520> five<00:05:40.820> sound<00:05:41.180> so<00:05:41.720> the

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
that kind of flat five sound so the

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.490 
that kind of flat five sound so the
upshot<00:05:42.170> is<00:05:42.350> this<00:05:42.590> harmonica<00:05:43.220> this<00:05:43.460> tuning<00:05:44.150> um

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
upshot is this harmonica this tuning um

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.800 
upshot is this harmonica this tuning um
lets<00:05:45.500> you<00:05:45.770> play<00:05:46.550> things<00:05:47.120> which<00:05:47.330> were<00:05:47.450> normally

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
lets you play things which were normally

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.260 
lets you play things which were normally
quiet<00:05:48.020> over<00:05:48.380> blows<00:05:48.590> and<00:05:48.770> over<00:05:48.950> draws<00:05:49.190> the<00:05:50.000> fact

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
quiet over blows and over draws the fact

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.300 
quiet over blows and over draws the fact
that<00:05:50.420> um<00:05:50.780> all<00:05:51.260> the<00:05:51.530> notes<00:05:51.740> will<00:05:51.920> be<00:05:51.950> familiar

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
that um all the notes will be familiar

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.700 
that um all the notes will be familiar
