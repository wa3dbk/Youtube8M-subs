00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.459 
turns freely I now understand why the
instructions<00:03:12.680> said<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:12.980> tap<00:03:13.969> drill<00:03:14.719> a<00:03:14.750> tap<00:03:15.079> one

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.469 
instructions said to tap drill a tap one

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:20.159 
instructions said to tap drill a tap one
hole<00:03:15.739> at<00:03:15.919> a<00:03:15.949> time<00:03:17.169> these<00:03:18.169> holes<00:03:18.530> back<00:03:19.430> here

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
hole at a time these holes back here

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.530 
hole at a time these holes back here
well<00:03:21.169> you<00:03:21.379> can't<00:03:21.620> really<00:03:21.709> see<00:03:22.069> them<00:03:22.159> very<00:03:22.310> well

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
well you can't really see them very well

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.759 
well you can't really see them very well
but<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.870> tap<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.919> drill<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:26.780> about<00:03:26.810> half<00:03:27.500> way

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
but the tap the drill is about half way

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.099 
but the tap the drill is about half way
into<00:03:28.099> this<00:03:28.370> wall<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:30.699> even<00:03:31.699> using<00:03:32.150> my<00:03:32.480> drill

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
into this wall so even using my drill

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.629 
into this wall so even using my drill
press<00:03:34.750> which<00:03:35.750> was<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.930> pain<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.560> get<00:03:37.069> it<00:03:37.250> lined

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
press which was a pain to get it lined

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:44.189 
press which was a pain to get it lined
up<00:03:37.879> also<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:41.239> drill<00:03:41.540> wanted<00:03:42.169> to<00:03:42.319> curve<00:03:42.620> off

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
up also the drill wanted to curve off

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.009 
up also the drill wanted to curve off
the<00:03:45.199> drill<00:03:45.439> bit<00:03:45.680> wanted<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.220> curve<00:03:46.430> off<00:03:47.019> into

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
the drill bit wanted to curve off into

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.909 
the drill bit wanted to curve off into
the<00:03:48.169> open<00:03:48.859> area<00:03:49.040> instead<00:03:49.609> of<00:03:50.620> cutting<00:03:51.620> through

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
the open area instead of cutting through

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:59.759 
the open area instead of cutting through
here<00:03:54.370> but<00:03:55.449> it's<00:03:56.449> there<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:58.239> it<00:03:59.239> turns

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
here but it's there and it turns

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:13.569 
here but it's there and it turns
smoothly<00:04:01.479> at<00:04:02.479> both<00:04:02.840> ends<00:04:11.919> well<00:04:12.919> you<00:04:13.099> can't<00:04:13.340> see

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
smoothly at both ends well you can't see

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.310 
smoothly at both ends well you can't see
it<00:04:13.689> see<00:04:14.689> the<00:04:14.840> handle<00:04:15.199> moving<00:04:15.439> but<00:04:17.079> let<00:04:18.079> me<00:04:18.139> get

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
it see the handle moving but let me get

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:57.510 
it see the handle moving but let me get
it<00:04:18.409> back<00:04:18.530> down<00:04:18.799> on<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:19.250> rack<00:04:21.759> there<00:04:22.759> we<00:04:22.880> go

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.800 

well<00:04:58.520> I'm<00:04:59.210> almost<00:04:59.480> there<00:04:59.780> I<00:04:59.840> still<00:05:00.350> good<00:05:00.620> I

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
well I'm almost there I still good I

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.270 
well I'm almost there I still good I
found<00:05:02.810> out<00:05:02.990> that<00:05:03.170> I<00:05:03.320> do<00:05:03.380> have<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:03.800> drill<00:05:04.010> in<00:05:04.130> tap

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
found out that I do have to drill in tap

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.230 
found out that I do have to drill in tap
a<00:05:04.310> hole<00:05:04.550> for<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:04.940> change<00:05:05.480> screw<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:10.030> did<00:05:11.030> go

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
a hole for the change screw I did go

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.580 
a hole for the change screw I did go
ahead<00:05:12.490> whoops<00:05:13.490> don't<00:05:14.000> want<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.300> lose<00:05:14.450> that<00:05:14.480> I

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.290 

did<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.950> don't<00:05:19.250> know<00:05:19.430> if<00:05:19.550> you<00:05:19.670> can<00:05:19.850> see<00:05:20.150> it

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
did I don't know if you can see it

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:28.260 
did I don't know if you can see it
clearly<00:05:20.810> but<00:05:22.030> describe<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:24.110> arc<00:05:25.450> in<00:05:26.450> position

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
clearly but describe the arc in position

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.250 
clearly but describe the arc in position
based<00:05:29.270> on<00:05:29.480> my<00:05:30.200> old<00:05:30.320> lathe<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:32.750> according<00:05:33.230> to

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
based on my old lathe is according to

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.510 
based on my old lathe is according to
the<00:05:33.530> destructions<00:05:34.330> but<00:05:36.100> one<00:05:37.100> step<00:05:37.340> closer

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
the destructions but one step closer

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:49.000 
the destructions but one step closer
well<00:05:40.520> I<00:05:41.740> can't<00:05:42.740> put<00:05:42.950> my<00:05:45.820> lathe<00:05:46.820> up<00:05:47.090> in<00:05:47.240> a<00:05:48.010> drill

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
well I can't put my lathe up in a drill

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.600 
well I can't put my lathe up in a drill
press<00:05:49.040> this<00:05:49.610> time<00:05:50.710> my<00:05:51.710> drill<00:05:51.980> press<00:05:52.220> is<00:05:52.250> too

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
press this time my drill press is too

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:02.100 
press this time my drill press is too
small<00:05:53.800> so<00:05:54.800> I<00:05:54.830> made<00:05:55.820> me<00:05:56.090> a<00:05:56.120> little<00:05:57.100> drill<00:05:58.100> guide

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.150 

hope<00:06:03.110> it<00:06:03.320> keeps<00:06:03.500> it<00:06:03.740> straight<00:06:05.890> got<00:06:06.890> a<00:06:06.920> nice

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
hope it keeps it straight got a nice

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.250 
hope it keeps it straight got a nice
little<00:06:07.400> mountain<00:06:07.850> of<00:06:08.090> cast<00:06:08.750> iron<00:06:08.930> shavings

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
little mountain of cast iron shavings

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.780 
little mountain of cast iron shavings
and<00:06:12.260> it<00:06:12.650> looks<00:06:13.610> pretty<00:06:13.910> straight<00:06:15.100> so<00:06:16.100> now<00:06:16.760> I

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
and it looks pretty straight so now I

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.570 
and it looks pretty straight so now I
get<00:06:17.090> to<00:06:17.120> tap<00:06:17.450> it<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:18.970> see<00:06:19.970> how<00:06:20.180> it<00:06:20.330> turns<00:06:20.540> out

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
get to tap it and see how it turns out

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.980 
get to tap it and see how it turns out
so<00:06:22.580> I<00:06:23.320> tap<00:06:24.320> the<00:06:24.530> hole<00:06:24.740> using<00:06:25.730> a<00:06:26.030> tapping<00:06:26.810> guide

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
so I tap the hole using a tapping guide

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.700 
so I tap the hole using a tapping guide
to<00:06:27.140> keep<00:06:27.290> it<00:06:27.470> square<00:06:28.810> then<00:06:30.550> installed<00:06:31.550> the

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
to keep it square then installed the

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.760 
to keep it square then installed the
changed<00:06:33.710> gear<00:06:34.210> mounting<00:06:35.210> nut<00:06:36.220> check<00:06:37.220> the

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:40.719 
travel

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:45.329
