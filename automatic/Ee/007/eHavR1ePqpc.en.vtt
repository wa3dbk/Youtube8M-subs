00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
this is actually I was expecting this

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.380 
this is actually I was expecting this
not<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:51.890> dial<00:02:52.160> because<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.880> number<00:02:53.150> here<00:02:53.300> is

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
not to dial because the number here is

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.550 
not to dial because the number here is
not<00:02:53.420> nine<00:02:53.750> once<00:02:54.110> one<00:02:54.320> on<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:56.350> better<00:02:57.350> did

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
not nine once one on to better did

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.780 
not nine once one on to better did
actually<00:02:57.739> dial<00:02:59.590> it<00:03:00.590> translated<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.610> was<00:03:01.760> not

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
actually dial it translated it I was not

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.180 
actually dial it translated it I was not
expecting<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:02.750> yeah<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.500> can

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
expecting that but yeah so I can

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.110 
expecting that but yeah so I can
actually<00:03:04.370> go<00:03:04.700> like<00:03:04.910> lines<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:06.760> didn't<00:03:07.760> put<00:03:08.030> it

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
actually go like lines I didn't put it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.670 
actually go like lines I didn't put it
correctly<00:03:08.510> because<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:08.959> not<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.410> tips

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
correctly because it's not on the tips

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.100 
correctly because it's not on the tips
only<00:03:10.010> on<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.280> sides<00:03:10.520> so<00:03:11.510> I'm<00:03:11.750> decided

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
only on the sides so I'm decided

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.680 
only on the sides so I'm decided
something<00:03:12.260> on<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.160> have<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.670> type<00:03:14.540> it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
something on this so I have to type it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.570 
something on this so I have to type it
like<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:14.959> just<00:03:15.020> but<00:03:15.440> all<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.739> have<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.190> reapply

like this just but all I have to reapply

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.060 
like this just but all I have to reapply
it<00:03:16.700> correctly<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:17.989> sort<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.410> like<00:03:18.680> nine

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.130 

this<00:03:59.200> is<00:03:59.380> asking<00:03:59.770> a<00:03:59.860> bit<00:04:00.010> too<00:04:00.190> much<00:04:01.140> because

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
this is asking a bit too much because

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.010 
this is asking a bit too much because
this<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.560> hard<00:04:02.740> to<00:04:02.890> use<00:04:03.070> even<00:04:03.280> with<00:04:03.490> hands<00:04:04.020> I'm

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
this is hard to use even with hands I'm

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.450 
this is hard to use even with hands I'm
not<00:04:05.230> doing<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:06.000> even<00:04:07.000> remotely<00:04:07.180> right<00:04:08.400> but<00:04:09.400> I

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
not doing this even remotely right but I

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.180 
not doing this even remotely right but I
did<00:04:09.940> see<00:04:10.120> some<00:04:10.300> movement<00:04:10.630> there<00:04:10.690> but<00:04:11.410> yeah<00:04:11.620> at

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
did see some movement there but yeah at

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.410 
did see some movement there but yeah at
least<00:04:12.430> this<00:04:12.700> way<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:13.000> does<00:04:13.180> work<00:04:15.000> this<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.150> very

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
least this way it does work this is very

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.310 
least this way it does work this is very
dirty<00:04:17.820> no<00:04:18.820> no<00:04:19.090> let's<00:04:19.299> let<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.750> proper<00:04:20.049> way

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
dirty no no let's let the proper way

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.030 
dirty no no let's let the proper way
like<00:04:21.310> so<00:04:21.340> let's<00:04:21.970> close<00:04:23.790> okay<00:04:25.170> now<00:04:26.170> I<00:04:26.530> want<00:04:26.890> to

unlock<00:04:27.490> my<00:04:27.730> cellphone<00:04:31.410> please<00:04:32.410> what<00:04:35.070> wait<00:04:36.070> if

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
unlock my cellphone please what wait if

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.640 
unlock my cellphone please what wait if
it<00:04:36.669> moved<00:04:38.070> so<00:04:39.070> yeah<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.310> guess<00:04:39.880> it<00:04:40.030> works<00:04:40.650> behind

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
it moved so yeah I guess it works behind

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.880 
it moved so yeah I guess it works behind
one<00:04:41.980> of<00:04:42.070> these<00:04:42.280> things<00:04:42.580> barely<00:04:43.740> which<00:04:44.740> is

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
one of these things barely which is

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.280 
one of these things barely which is
pretty<00:04:45.220> impressive<00:04:45.520> though<00:04:48.990> then<00:04:49.990> I<00:04:50.020> think

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
pretty impressive though then I think

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.830 
pretty impressive though then I think
I'm<00:04:50.410> just<00:04:50.620> scraping<00:04:51.040> this<00:04:51.280> thing<00:04:51.490> off<00:04:51.840> we're

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
I'm just scraping this thing off we're

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.100 
I'm just scraping this thing off we're
here<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:54.130> hang<00:04:54.370> these<00:04:54.550> plastic<00:04:55.000> things<00:04:55.110> look

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
here and hang these plastic things look

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.670 
here and hang these plastic things look
look<00:04:56.470> even<00:04:56.710> with<00:04:56.830> my<00:04:57.040> hand<00:04:57.310> it's<00:04:57.520> hard<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.820> do

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.270 

see<00:05:02.680> took<00:05:03.070> two<00:05:03.250> tries<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:05.320> this<00:05:05.530> does<00:05:05.950> work

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
see took two tries so this does work

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.120 
see took two tries so this does work
even<00:05:06.520> though<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:06.910> does<00:05:07.800> lower<00:05:08.800> the

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
even though it does lower the

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.880 
even though it does lower the
sensitivity<00:05:09.370> a<00:05:09.910> bit<00:05:10.090> but<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:10.870> is<00:05:10.990> precise<00:05:11.380> it

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
sensitivity a bit but it is precise it

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.640 
sensitivity a bit but it is precise it
is<00:05:12.419> very<00:05:13.419> precise<00:05:13.720> I<00:05:13.900> haven't<00:05:14.140> placed<00:05:14.500> it

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
is very precise I haven't placed it

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.830 
is very precise I haven't placed it
correctly<00:05:15.130> how<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.370> should<00:05:15.610> have<00:05:15.729> put<00:05:16.240> more<00:05:16.570> on

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
correctly how it should have put more on

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.980 
correctly how it should have put more on
the<00:05:17.740> inside<00:05:18.010> here<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.640> here<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:19.510> on<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:19.780> tip

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
the inside here and here and on the tip

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.990 
the inside here and here and on the tip
and<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.260> didn't<00:05:20.590> same<00:05:21.340> thing<00:05:21.520> with<00:05:21.669> this<00:05:21.820> this

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
and I didn't same thing with this this

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.969 
and I didn't same thing with this this
has<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.330> go<00:05:22.450> back<00:05:22.630> to<00:05:22.810> here<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.200> here<00:05:23.770> but<00:05:23.890> it

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
has to go back to here and here but it

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:24.719 
has to go back to here and here but it
works<00:05:24.220> really<00:05:24.430> well

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729
