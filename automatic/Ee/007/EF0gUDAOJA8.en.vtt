00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.090
 very good day my dear and dear 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.120
 friends today we are going to make you a 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.630
 different version of piña colada a pineapple 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.509
 wash flavored as strawberry because 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.270
 I know that my clients to my 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.910
 followers my followers love the 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.649
 strawberry then let's combine something 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.140
 It is very well known here in Ecuador as it is 

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:30.290
 the piña colada with that gustito that 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.770
 have for the strawberry we're going to that for 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.510
 start we have this long glass 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.910
 but we're not going to do like the one in 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.030
 previous video where we made a pineapple 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.790
 wash with a more artisanal process more 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.390
 natural more wax not on this occasion anymore 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.970
 we have pineapple juice 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.510
 we have strawberry juice tie and with my 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.020
 words 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.350
 I say juice I'm not saying soda no 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.100
 I'm saying water from making juices is 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.760
 a concentrated juice that leaves fruit that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.370
 it stops to strawberry that stops to pineapple 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.120
 we will also use in this case 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.950
 like this one and strain the rum 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.659
 let's proceed 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.659
 one and a half ounces of red 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.610
 i 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.510
 we see the pineapple juice 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.510
 2 bags 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.970
 the same with strawberry juice if you 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.150
 the consistency of its truth lies 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:44.540
 211 dry strawberries and can not miss 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.750
 our beloved coconut cream I remember 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.120
 it's not I'm using condensed milk 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.670
 condensed milk has a tendency to 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.770
 impale us when we take a 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.670
 cocktail which is what we want to follow 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.190
 taking continue to enjoy it follow 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.980
 taste the pink the pineapple with the right 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.860
 with condensed milk 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.140
 It blocks the palate a bit, it inhibits it 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.670
 to a point that I teach myself no longer 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.670
 I want more and that is not what we want 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.410
 besides coconut 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.410
 they imagine how natural you can know 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.800
 because we will not debate you know you 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.070
 let's do it let's decorate our 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.070
 Cup 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.400
 Technically , decorate the cup when and 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.379
 we are going to serve or when we have already served 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.819
 here I am advancing a little bit the 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.480
 process because I do not want to be made 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.650
 of the thaw here inside the kitchen already 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.500
 I will explain them well 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.420
 we decorate with coconut cream coconut striped 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.370
 the ice is what was provoked while 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.670
 I was talking while I lost the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.670
 weather 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.760
 salt me ​​that I do not want to be in charge 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.660
 to the concert I want only the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.200
 flavor of the fruit combined with the red 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.200
 and we beat 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.819
 or 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:54.370
 crushed ice to put here all 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:57.330
 this is not going to be able and the oscar 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.330
 to go full 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:06.230
 the refreshing 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.739
 and after this we are going to do the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.959
 decoration last time we took advantage of the 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.719
 pencil sheet let's make cuts 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.870
 crossways we have here the slices 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:20.810
 the slices that comes out of the whole pineapple 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.960
 we are going to cut them in crosses I have here 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.479
 when you get to the middle 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.350
 I'm not going to make half follow 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.350
 I 'm going to make a cut 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.010
 for the volume of water 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.840
 we have here like that and here I go to the 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.840
 half make a cut 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.849
 here 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.170
 two sorbets 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.360
 as we continue thinking a woman other 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.780
 Once we pay a small homage to her 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.780
 beer 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.610
