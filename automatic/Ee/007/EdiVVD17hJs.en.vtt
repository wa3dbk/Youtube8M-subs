00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.219
 monstrous anxiety to play but to him 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.530
 released I found to buy others use feet 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.829
 but released in the American version I was kind of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.660
 that putin or but okay 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.969
 well here's a gameplay like that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.190
 Exactly what are the shoulders year 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.930
 that we're going to say bring more bugs 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.059
 in the future so but it is in the future not 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.620
 currently the project has the holes already 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.309
 were patented let's wait 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 the new bug came out my friends told me 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.010
 but when marrying with sportv in the title of the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.630
 video this black game is showing to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.130
 You are not the seventh on history. 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.180
 series and books 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.580
 What do you think to do and what do you guys think? 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.540
 It's good and it all started in a 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.140
 day of sun knows how to drive lot is south 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.590
 home value that the government showed 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.320
 First mockery in a donkey, no, no. 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.600
 mister eg 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.680
 I thought it was a bug but ok go 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.030
 It started with the fiancé easter egg there and I 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 I told you, people will be interested. 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.460
 Likable channel will grow more with this 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:47.759
 series that if with the one that has in that phase 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.950
 in front of you that you revive the person 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.000
 It must be the person she was with. 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.049
 he will see 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.100
 and then I started to like to start 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.170
 like the bug 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.090
 I went there from the profile but I have good 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.009
 estimate if it was display success 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.459
 but was not a success of likes by the fact 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.649
 the crowd thinks it's too bad 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.580
 Yes, I agree with him. I agree. 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.820
 fully with you inter 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.040
 You do not like bugs like that. 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.630
 fish but because there is a lot of club 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.700
 well, I totally agree with you more 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.440
 I did so but to show them how 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.680
 do because there are a lot of people would know 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.680
 How does it work for me so no matter the ax? 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.550
 It's cool to have enough there and the 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.630
 other slips saying that my video 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.460
 You need to improve. 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.750
 comment on whenever you need it 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.680

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.740
 help a lot 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.180
 but because continuing not leave the bug 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.430
 3 which was a bug is very rare stones was 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.570
 one of the meanest bugs on my channel that 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.190
 It was the bug of the elderly people starting from here. 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.890
 I think if there's not that to leave 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:04.530
 to remember is what I think those were from xp 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.590
 unlimited with the butts if that was a 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.170
 of bugs that are also epic because they have 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.970
 you do if you touch it explains a 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.820
 boot to win all the following 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.340
 all mothers - and the bloodthirsty and 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:26.580
 other things here are a step shot goal 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:28.410

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.110
 to get the radio man to make a 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.510
 Good score and earn an internship here 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.290

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.410
 made that bug have enough 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.100
 also hit bug 4 that was invisible 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.830
 bayern clear a trend that was a bug well 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.769
 of the hour was very epic also of 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.060
 be done because you did not die 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:57.420
 invisible to men and 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.010
 they would treat the side in the corner but 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.870
 was a good game and also very cool that 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.560
 also seek to overturn the debt of the 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.540
 bug 5 was deadly in the scientist you stay 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.790
 through mortal incumbent on scientists 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.440
 time also really cool to be done 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.650

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.680

 It's really a troll for you. 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.009
 the gui 71 of the strongest in the channel 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.620

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:57.000

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.469
 sorry for stopping and it was about 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.150

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.439
 I was guilty but google here again 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.060
 it was the rap bug that was not so much 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:19.680
 success as well but it was very good order 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.919
 even because you see the whole map and it's worth 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.629
 well worth your good government and 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.189
 was eight people in transit was a 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.900
 thump a lot is that you can make a 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.060
 easter egg with eight people in between 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:36.629
