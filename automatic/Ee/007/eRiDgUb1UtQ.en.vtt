 to start and today I greet you 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.230
 another gameplay commentary here 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.849
 on the bse community channel one 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.280
 First of all, I would like to welcome you 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.560
 Thank you for giving me such a big one 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.390
 chance gives a gameplay he comes up 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.550
 his channel on his two counter on 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.259
 to upload his baby channel 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.779
 I think the action mega money that the 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.369
 smaller youtube gives you a chance 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.259
 to get a bit of attention 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.300
 to get a bit bigger and maybe 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.100
 one or two subscribers 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.199
 because he is his content 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.120
 clever and good 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.280
 and as I said tesco many thanks 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.649
 that gives me a chance my content 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.140
 Show here on your community channel 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.760
 to be allowed to so my friends and trade 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.589
 to the gameplay badges here in the team 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.660
 deathmatch about whether gameplay on the 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.489
 beautiful with post of modern warfare 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.350
 3 Here's a quick one with the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.210
 space parks through I've trampled 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.219
 here also very well the opponents 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.989
 away dominated my box at the beginning 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.640
 death position management report and the 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.260
 master marksman I have the merck 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.659
 actually only played on sound so 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.460
 I think I would have liked so 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.630
 death site and situation reports at hear 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.140
 the opponents are actually right here 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.180
 Well 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.610
 because of the snow but you see her 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.829
 opponent bad because of it too 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.259
 situation report master marksman if it 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.969
 somewhere a corner hooked then 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.680
 he probably pulls in already corner 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.770
 and she sees the champion 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.509
 Sniper mostly because he has him 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.520
 always keep such a game a tec light up 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.200
 if there is one in another 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.909
 distance is because then it has 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.380
 usually not and for example 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.149
 now it looks like a stop 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.979
 insider we had already over the stop 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.600
 ass saved and I would stop you 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.950
 recommend if he maps as well as post 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.110
 he just plays that 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.600
 champion she played the opponents 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.070
 much better and has a gaming headset 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.210
 of course, its advantages because I 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.560
 have here really only on sand 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.600
 will be played then probably new 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.539
 see gameplay and actually has 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.280
 also paid so my friends 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.750
 come to the channel now and I am 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.240
 for a year now on youtube 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.329
 I have about 165 videos active 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.460
 uploaded 1100 subscribers and 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.890
 actually invite every other day 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.869
 It's almost always high video 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.660
 team deathmatch with few tips and 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.980
 tricks or just episodes and off 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.620
 and it's also a live mostly 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.560
 is in detail mw2 or now and then 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.940
 black ops 1 but most of the time it is 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.379
 actually in detail because of this game 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.690
 I just like it well, I do not know 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.069
 why this so many this game 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.750
 flame I do not know if that at the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.700
 connection or shitty 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.080
 sportsystem i finally find the game 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.209
 very good if I do not usually 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.500
 Bock on mw2 I have to put it again 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.420
 a detailed play up on 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.190
 specialist actually does a lot 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.840
 fun because this game actually too 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.150
 very fast with the specials 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.280
 Perks and more the sound engine 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.019
 not as good as could work in mw2 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.670
 at least keep the opponents places 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.410
 what you do not expect from black ops 2 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.849
 because he could have been with the as rom 40 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.799
 or even nothing, and here I 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.349
 By the way, the first time abolished 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.299
 I do not know if at two minutes 40 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.790
 Among other things, it was two minutes 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.989
 20 so a pretty fast mohr off me 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.410
 does not even know what the teenager 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.150
 made somehow xfp but also 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.700
 somehow a bit stupid is the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.459
 whole against martin was actually stupid 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.220
 my team was stupid and yes 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.510
 said the gateways are mostly team 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.239
 deathmatch i play on an xbox 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.060
 So full of bock have with warming effect 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.470
 to play whether mw2 black ops 1 or im 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.919
 detail criteria a message 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.290
 write 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.549
 and if I like my videos 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.560
 could he on my channel 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.209
 drop by and bring me every now and then 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.700
 also so tips and tricks episodes for 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.389
 For example, I am a friend of 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.910
 control freaks I do not know if he's the one 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.819
 Things are known that are so small sticks 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.810
 they are for ps3 as well as for 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.459
 xbox compatible and you drink it 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.200
 Stop on 1 tick and have a small 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.419
 increase and thus could also be a lot 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.430
 I also like it much better 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.900
 have so many colleagues of mine 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.639
 recommended and they were all 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.260
 Excited and I'm just getting up 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.419
 ask yes how do I improve mine 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.120
 aiming and I load such videos 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.889
 high as your movement or gaming 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.260
 can improve or just hardware 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:06.620
 technically what about astro headsets 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.620
 controllers and monitors are just a few 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.510
 videos so what the different hardware 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.639
 do things and maybe could 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.829
 this year, the game is improving as well 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.970
 said a very large number of videos too 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.470
 explained in detail by me 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.180
 but otherwise it is actually one 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.950
 team deathmatch one i am like i said 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.740
 not the friend of reign or something 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.600
 I also believe I have a video too 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.610
 Graduation confirmed 100 plus but 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.230
 otherwise I suffer really only so team 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.180
 I declare deathmatch stuff too 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.130
 how the sports can take apart 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.780
 because it just makes fun when he's in 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.250
 a detail 50 plus has because 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.180
 my gameplays actually exist only 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.650
 so in detail so 50plus or 1100 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.360
 Points per minute is actually right 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.040
 high in the team deathmatch because you have to 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.560
 that's what the team deathmatch think about 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.010
 are invented only up to 75 ps and if you 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.260
 your 50 or 55 kills for example 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.240
 I have to gameplay what is 59 kiss 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.770
 or a dom gameplay which only 170 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.870
 takes seconds and then for the whole 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.310
 Round over you can already do that 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.320
 call elimination 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.940
 that was not as bad as 150 now 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.470
 plus but in the team deathmatch is that 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.960
 already the highest that you can achieve 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.850
 that's just that's also deliver 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.330
 and as I said if team deathmatch 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.800
 Gameplay moves and they like you too 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.280
 look could he mean Schenner 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.050
 visit and as I said there in murder 59 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.669
 to 2 here was the 1 I had here too 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.290
 fortunately that drives me here 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.210
 did not bring in the last stand and there 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.440
 I have my second murder as I said 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.240
 you have nice against here too 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.530
 seen and then I would now too 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.580
 I've even gotten a sniper 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.979
 not seen anymore i watch on the 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.419
