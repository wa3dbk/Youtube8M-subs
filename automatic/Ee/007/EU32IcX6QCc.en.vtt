as I pushed up against the side of the
can<00:02:23.440> they<00:02:24.250> broke<00:02:24.490> up<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.670> little<00:02:24.910> bit<00:02:25.030> there

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.690 

it's<00:02:28.600> not<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> easiest<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.319> bake<00:02:29.500> but<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.550> does

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
it's not the easiest to bake but it does

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.010 
it's not the easiest to bake but it does
bake<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:33.360> I'll<00:02:34.360> push<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.570> together<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.959> little

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
bake so I'll push it together a little

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.360 
bake so I'll push it together a little
more<00:02:35.380> because<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.770> not<00:02:35.890> staying<00:02:36.190> together

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
more because it's not staying together

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.810 
more because it's not staying together
for<00:02:36.730> some<00:02:36.880> reason<00:02:37.180> like<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.110> should<00:02:38.760> add<00:02:39.760> a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
for some reason like it should add a
