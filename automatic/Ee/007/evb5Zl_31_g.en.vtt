it was in your you know on board your

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.109 
it was in your you know on board your
computer<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.829> I<00:01:03.250> was<00:01:03.370> fascinated<00:01:03.579> with<00:01:03.969> that

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
computer and I was fascinated with that

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.700 
computer and I was fascinated with that
idea<00:01:04.420> because<00:01:04.750> I've<00:01:04.960> always<00:01:05.079> wanted<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.560> have

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
idea because I've always wanted to have

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.859 
idea because I've always wanted to have
the<00:01:06.280> ability<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:06.759> stop<00:01:07.180> making<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.630> sound

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
the ability to stop making the sound

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.739 
the ability to stop making the sound
effects<00:01:08.110> with<00:01:08.229> my<00:01:08.350> mouth<00:01:09.359> I'd<00:01:10.359> like<00:01:10.539> to<00:01:10.630> be

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
effects with my mouth I'd like to be

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.539 
effects with my mouth I'd like to be
able<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.929> pick<00:01:11.049> up<00:01:11.139> a<00:01:11.259> lightsaber<00:01:11.679> or<00:01:11.979> my<00:01:12.189> hands

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
able to pick up a lightsaber or my hands

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.940 
able to pick up a lightsaber or my hands
and<00:01:12.819> have<00:01:12.999> the<00:01:13.119> proper<00:01:13.479> sound<00:01:13.689> so<00:01:14.319> it<00:01:14.770> was<00:01:14.920> just

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
and have the proper sound so it was just

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.499 
and have the proper sound so it was just
an<00:01:15.189> interesting<00:01:15.579> technology<00:01:16.149> I<00:01:16.179> know<00:01:16.240> it's<00:01:16.420> an

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
an interesting technology I know it's an

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.209 
an interesting technology I know it's an
emerging<00:01:16.929> technology<00:01:17.530> which<00:01:17.679> is<00:01:17.829> coming<00:01:18.130> up

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
emerging technology which is coming up

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.679 
emerging technology which is coming up
now<00:01:18.399> these<00:01:18.579> with<00:01:19.450> these<00:01:19.630> you<00:01:20.229> know<00:01:20.350> game

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
now these with these you know game

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.879 
now these with these you know game
controllers<00:01:22.689> that<00:01:22.719> will<00:01:23.200> actually<00:01:23.409> control

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:23.889 
controllers that will actually control

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:26.160 
controllers that will actually control
the<00:01:23.920> sounds<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.639> within<00:01:25.359> the<00:01:25.719> program's

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
the sounds and within the program's

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.590 
the sounds and within the program's
themselves<00:01:26.350> so<00:01:26.920> it's<00:01:27.549> another<00:01:27.700> whole<00:01:28.420> new

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
themselves so it's another whole new

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.690 
themselves so it's another whole new
area<00:01:28.840> for<00:01:29.079> me<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.289> sound<00:01:29.499> design<00:01:29.859> because

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
area for me and sound design because

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.459 
area for me and sound design because
it'd<00:01:30.850> allow<00:01:30.880> I'd<00:01:31.749> love<00:01:31.899> to<00:01:32.020> be<00:01:32.139> able<00:01:32.229> to

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
it'd allow I'd love to be able to

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.039 
it'd allow I'd love to be able to
perform<00:01:32.920> with<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.789> body<00:01:34.119> and<00:01:34.359> hands<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:34.929> have

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
perform with the body and hands and have

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.410 
perform with the body and hands and have
sounds<00:01:35.469> be<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.740> result<00:01:35.859> so<00:01:36.399> looking<00:01:37.090> forward

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
sounds be the result so looking forward

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.120 
sounds be the result so looking forward
to<00:01:37.539> this<00:01:37.599> new<00:01:37.869> technology<00:01:38.259> will<00:01:38.560> create<00:01:38.950> some

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
to this new technology will create some

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.139 
to this new technology will create some
new<00:01:39.159> things<00:01:39.520> this<00:01:39.639> way<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:41.229> voice<00:01:41.349> of<00:01:41.590> r2d2

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
new things this way the voice of r2d2

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.819 
new things this way the voice of r2d2
was<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.270> hardest<00:01:43.630> sound<00:01:43.869> effect<00:01:44.259> I<00:01:44.409> ever<00:01:44.590> had

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
was the hardest sound effect I ever had

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.199

to<00:01:44.859> make<00:01:45.009> because<00:01:45.399> there<00:01:45.759> was<00:01:45.849> really<00:01:46.029> no

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
to make because there was really no

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.959 
to make because there was really no
precedent<00:01:46.779> for<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.049> most<00:01:47.979> robots<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.609> movies

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
precedent for it most robots and movies

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.819 
precedent for it most robots and movies
had<00:01:49.270> spoke<00:01:49.749> English<00:01:50.139> or<00:01:50.289> they<00:01:50.380> spoke<00:01:50.619> some

a<00:01:52.209> moving<00:01:52.569> mouth<00:01:52.779> so<00:01:53.049> you<00:01:53.109> had<00:01:53.289> some<00:01:53.319> idea<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
a moving mouth so you had some idea the

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.730 
a moving mouth so you had some idea the
script<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:55.569> Star<00:01:55.810> Wars<00:01:55.840> just<00:01:56.229> said<00:01:56.469> that<00:01:56.619> our

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
script of Star Wars just said that our

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.679 
script of Star Wars just said that our
two<00:01:56.950> made<00:01:57.159> electronic<00:01:57.880> sounds<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.389> didn't

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
two made electronic sounds it didn't

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.319 
two made electronic sounds it didn't
really<00:01:58.810> specify<00:01:59.529> exactly<00:01:59.950> when<00:02:00.789> our<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.299> a

talk or you know
the<00:02:03.030> quality<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> noise<00:02:04.400> it<00:02:05.400> took<00:02:05.520> me<00:02:05.580> six

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the quality of the noise it took me six

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.690 
the quality of the noise it took me six
months<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.420> figure<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.170> out<00:02:07.459> and<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.580> was

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
months to figure that out and I was

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.669 
months to figure that out and I was
really<00:02:08.940> nervous<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:09.539> arts<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.380> had<00:02:10.560> to

ended<00:02:21.540> up<00:02:21.660> being<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.319> problem<00:02:23.130> solved<00:02:23.940> by

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
ended up being a problem solved by

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.229 
ended up being a problem solved by

which i had at the time which made

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.009 
which i had at the time which made
electronic<00:02:29.340> sounds<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.850> my<00:02:30.300> voice<00:02:30.600> making

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
electronic sounds and my voice making

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.640 
electronic sounds and my voice making
funny<00:02:31.230> little<00:02:31.440> r2<00:02:32.099> like<00:02:32.610> noises<00:02:32.880> and

funny little r2 like noises and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.780 
funny little r2 like noises and
performing<00:02:34.650> them<00:02:34.769> together<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.400> spending

performing them together and spending

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.520 
performing them together and spending
endless<00:02:36.000> hours<00:02:36.300> editing<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.140> clipping

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
endless hours editing and clipping

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.080 
endless hours editing and clipping
little<00:02:37.739> snippets<00:02:38.160> out<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.580> sound<00:02:38.880> and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
little snippets out of that sound and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.479 
little snippets out of that sound and
stringing<00:02:39.959> them<00:02:40.050> together<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.530> give<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.280> some

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
stringing them together to give it some

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.390 
stringing them together to give it some
sense<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:42.000> meaning<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:44.040> was<00:02:44.190> really

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
sense of meaning and it was really

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.890 
sense of meaning and it was really
actually<00:02:44.640> probably<00:02:45.150> about<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.510> hardest

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
actually probably about the hardest

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.559 
actually probably about the hardest
sound<00:02:46.110> effect<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.470> ever<00:02:46.650> worked<00:02:46.890> on<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.569> you

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
sound effect I ever worked on and you

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:49.910 
sound effect I ever worked on and you
know<00:02:48.690> we<00:02:48.900> thought<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.230> would<00:02:49.290> never<00:02:49.470> work<00:02:49.590> we

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
know we thought it would never work we

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.170 
know we thought it would never work we
thought<00:02:50.100> audiences<00:02:50.519> wouldn't<00:02:50.790> understand

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
thought audiences wouldn't understand

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.170 
thought audiences wouldn't understand
our<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.660> all<00:02:51.780> would<00:02:51.989> be<00:02:52.019> lost<00:02:52.760> but<00:02:53.760> boy<00:02:54.000> were

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
our to it all would be lost but boy were

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.870 
our to it all would be lost but boy were
we<00:02:54.209> proven<00:02:54.660> wrong<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.430> now<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.580> seems<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.850> be

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
we proven wrong and now it seems to be

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.970 
we proven wrong and now it seems to be
part<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.269> culture<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:57.900> I'm<00:02:58.290> thankful<00:02:58.680> for

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
part of the culture so I'm thankful for

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.880 
part of the culture so I'm thankful for
that<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.940> may<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.360> force<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.930> sound<00:03:01.230> be<00:03:01.680> with

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
that so may the force of sound be with

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.690 
that so may the force of sound be with
all<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.220> droids<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:03.480> long
