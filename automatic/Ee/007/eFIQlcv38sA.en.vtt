from but it's on there pretty good it's

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
from but it's on there pretty good it's
not<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.710> anywhere<00:00:55.969> I've<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
not going to go anywhere I've got the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.010 
not going to go anywhere I've got the
zip<00:00:57.570> tie<00:00:57.809> goes<00:00:58.739> right<00:00:59.309> through<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> holes

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
zip tie goes right through the holes

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.630 
zip tie goes right through the holes
through<00:01:01.710> those<00:01:01.859> ones<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.400> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
through those ones and you can see this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.890 
through those ones and you can see this
I'm<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.549> angle<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> camera

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
I'm going to have to angle the camera

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.210 
I'm going to have to angle the camera
and<00:01:09.900> they<00:01:10.110> connect<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> other<00:01:10.740> side<00:01:11.010> like

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and they connect on the other side like

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
and they connect on the other side like
so<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.260> pretty<00:01:13.740> basic<00:01:14.070> stuff<00:01:14.630> but<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
so you know pretty basic stuff but it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.260 
so you know pretty basic stuff but it
works<00:01:16.130> sometimes<00:01:17.299> simpler<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:20.270> simpler

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
works sometimes simpler is a simpler

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.630 
works sometimes simpler is a simpler

what<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> call<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.250> flux<00:01:29.579> capacitor

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
what I like to call the flux capacitor

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.260 
what I like to call the flux capacitor
no<00:01:30.810> no<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> flux<00:01:32.070> capacitor

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
no no it's not it's not a flux capacitor

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.359 
no no it's not it's not a flux capacitor
but<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:34.579> it's<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:36.540> different<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:38.310> you

other<00:02:23.430> side<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> fixture<00:02:25.440> it's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
other side of this of the fixture it's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.770 
other side of this of the fixture it's
going<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.520> connected<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> servo<00:02:27.570> and

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
going to be connected to a servo and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.800 
going to be connected to a servo and
it's<00:02:28.020> going<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.440> rotate<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:29.510> back<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.750> forth

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
it's going to rotate this back and forth

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.490 
it's going to rotate this back and forth
like<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.620> blowing<00:02:32.250> air<00:02:32.870> along<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.110> tracks

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
like this blowing air along the tracks

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.350 
like this blowing air along the tracks
the<00:02:34.770> aluminium<00:02:35.250> tracks<00:02:35.550> all<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:35.970> way<00:02:36.090> around

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
the aluminium tracks all the way around

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.780 
the aluminium tracks all the way around
the<00:02:36.750> system<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:38.040> instead<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.580> going

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the system so instead of just going

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.060 
the system so instead of just going
directional<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.600> way<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.990> way<00:02:40.050> as<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.890> see

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
directional that way that way as you see

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.580 
directional that way that way as you see
I've<00:02:41.220> got<00:02:41.430> I've<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.630> have<00:02:42.810> LEDs<00:02:43.380> all

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
I've got I've going to have LEDs all

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.650 
I've got I've going to have LEDs all
over<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.010> place<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.700> need<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.209> get<00:02:45.390> some

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
over the place so I need to get some

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.560 
over the place so I need to get some
kind<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:45.990> cooling<00:02:46.470> all<00:02:46.680> over<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> place<00:02:47.570> the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
kind of cooling all over the place the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.660 
kind of cooling all over the place the
easiest<00:02:48.930> way<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.230> do<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.490> have

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
easiest way to do this is to have

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.790 
easiest way to do this is to have
movement<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.510> these<00:02:51.690> will<00:02:51.840> taper<00:02:52.230> back<00:02:52.410> and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
movement so these will taper back and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.030 
movement so these will taper back and
forth<00:02:53.040> kind<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.580> fan<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:56.030> and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
forth kind of like a fan like this and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.560 
forth kind of like a fan like this and
uses<00:02:59.040> very<00:02:59.250> low<00:02:59.430> power<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.000> hits<00:03:00.540> everything

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
uses very low power and hits everything

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.230 
uses very low power and hits everything
excuse<00:03:03.570> me<00:03:04.070> anyway<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.610> that's<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.970> piece

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
excuse me anyway so that's that piece

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.090 
excuse me anyway so that's that piece
I'll<00:03:06.780> show<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.260> at<00:03:07.500> work<00:03:07.680> you're<00:03:07.950> not

I'll show you at work you're not

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.160 
I'll show you at work you're not
connected<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.790> bit<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.660> for<00:03:10.020> those<00:03:10.110> that

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
connected in a bit but for those that

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.060 
connected in a bit but for those that
are<00:03:10.410> curious<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.010> interested<00:03:12.470> yeah<00:03:13.470> that's

are curious and interested yeah that's

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.780 
are curious and interested yeah that's
what<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.340> flux<00:03:14.610> capacitor<00:03:14.730> looks<00:03:16.730> all<00:03:17.730> right

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
what the flux capacitor looks all right

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.699 
what the flux capacitor looks all right
just<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.180> quick<00:03:18.360> show<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.840> next<00:03:19.110> part<00:03:19.350> if

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
just a quick show of the next part if

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.590 
just a quick show of the next part if
you<00:03:19.800> can<00:03:19.980> see<00:03:20.280> here<00:03:20.700> what<00:03:20.880> I've<00:03:20.970> got<00:03:21.150> going<00:03:21.180> on

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
you can see here what I've got going on

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.190 
you can see here what I've got going on
is<00:03:21.840> all<00:03:22.220> these<00:03:23.220> little<00:03:23.400> lines<00:03:24.180> these<00:03:24.570> these

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
is all these little lines these these

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.720 
is all these little lines these these
dots<00:03:25.500> with<00:03:25.680> lines<00:03:25.890> are<00:03:26.070> where<00:03:26.220> piece<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.640> my

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
dots with lines are where piece of my

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.490 
dots with lines are where piece of my
little<00:03:27.000> heat<00:03:27.150> sink<00:03:27.420> will<00:03:27.540> go<00:03:27.690> let<00:03:28.019> me<00:03:28.050> grab<00:03:28.290> one

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
little heat sink will go let me grab one

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.400 
little heat sink will go let me grab one
quickly<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:31.230> as<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.430> mentioned<00:03:32.459> before<00:03:33.260> got<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
quickly so as I mentioned before got the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.949 
quickly so as I mentioned before got the
holes<00:03:34.650> tues<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.000> zip-tie<00:03:36.360> go<00:03:36.570> through<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
holes tues it the zip-tie go through the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.390 
holes tues it the zip-tie go through the
holes<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.350> hold<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.650> place<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:38.070> LED<00:03:38.340> will

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
holes and hold it in place the LED will

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.370 
holes and hold it in place the LED will
go<00:03:38.610> there<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.000> then<00:03:39.540> they'll<00:03:39.690> be<00:03:39.810> wires<00:03:40.080> that

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
go there and then they'll be wires that

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.890 
go there and then they'll be wires that
connect<00:03:40.680> from<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.950> LED<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.420> as<00:03:42.690> you

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
connect from the LED so this is as you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.780 
connect from the LED so this is as you
can<00:03:42.930> see<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.170> white<00:03:43.380> one<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:44.310> white<00:03:44.489> one<00:03:44.670> will

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
can see a white one that white one will

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.940 
can see a white one that white one will
connect<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.420> one<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.870> want<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.500> connect<00:03:46.830> to

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
connect to that one I want to connect to

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.160 
connect to that one I want to connect to
that<00:03:47.070> one<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:48.060> one<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.330> all<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.930> way<00:03:49.019> around

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
that one that one and all the way around

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.190 
that one that one and all the way around
and<00:03:49.560> then<00:03:50.390> basically<00:03:51.390> it'll<00:03:51.750> be<00:03:51.870> on<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.049> other

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
and then basically it'll be on the other

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.580 
and then basically it'll be on the other
side<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:53.540> thing<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.989> tapa<00:03:55.230> so

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
side of the thing this is the tapa so

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.670 
side of the thing this is the tapa so
this<00:03:55.830> is<00:03:55.980> where<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.280> drivers<00:03:56.730> will<00:03:56.880> be<00:03:57.030> held

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
this is where the drivers will be held

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.990 
this is where the drivers will be held
the<00:03:58.680> other<00:03:58.769> thing<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.100> see<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.670> I've<00:03:59.820> got

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
the other thing you can see is I've got

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.780 
the other thing you can see is I've got
my<00:04:00.150> servo<00:04:00.570> hooked<00:04:00.840> up<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.200> my<00:04:01.580> little<00:04:02.580> thing

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
my servo hooked up to my little thing

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.600 
my servo hooked up to my little thing
there<00:04:03.000> on<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.630> other<00:04:03.780> side<00:04:04.049> of<00:04:04.080> that<00:04:04.610> that

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
there on the other side of that that

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.490 
there on the other side of that that
will<00:04:05.760> hook<00:04:05.910> up<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.269> my<00:04:06.360> flux<00:04:06.660> capacitor<00:04:07.320> there

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
will hook up to my flux capacitor there

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.920 
will hook up to my flux capacitor there
that's<00:04:07.709> just<00:04:07.950> no<00:04:08.610> some<00:04:08.760> PVC<00:04:09.060> I'll<00:04:09.299> just<00:04:09.450> pop<00:04:09.750> it

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
that's just no some PVC I'll just pop it

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.479 
that's just no some PVC I'll just pop it
on<00:04:10.049> there<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.350> don't<00:04:10.530> have<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.769> screw<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.130> on<00:04:11.280> it

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
on there I don't have to screw it on it

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.940 
on there I don't have to screw it on it
has<00:04:11.610> enough<00:04:11.820> tension<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.739> basically<00:04:13.739> what

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
has enough tension and basically what

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.979 
has enough tension and basically what
will<00:04:14.070> happen<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.610> my<00:04:14.820> fan<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.450> other<00:04:15.660> side

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
will happen is my fan on the other side

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.300 
will happen is my fan on the other side
will<00:04:16.370> rotate<00:04:17.370> as<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:17.820> servo<00:04:18.530> gains<00:04:19.530> motion

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
will rotate as this servo gains motion

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.120 
will rotate as this servo gains motion
as<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.519> can<00:04:20.639> see<00:04:20.880> on<00:04:21.410> we<00:04:22.410> turn<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.770> up<00:04:22.889> here

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
as you can see on we turn it up here

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.220 
as you can see on we turn it up here
I've<00:04:23.910> got<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.180> connected<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.720> potentiometer

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
I've got it connected to a potentiometer

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.860 
I've got it connected to a potentiometer
here<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:25.980> I<00:04:26.010> can<00:04:26.130> actually<00:04:26.430> adjust<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.630> power

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
here so I can actually adjust the power

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.800 
here so I can actually adjust the power
so<00:04:28.680> i<00:04:28.740> can<00:04:28.889> go<00:04:29.070> pretty<00:04:30.030> slow<00:04:30.300> i<00:04:30.389> still<00:04:30.630> have<00:04:30.720> to

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
so i can go pretty slow i still have to

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.450 
so i can go pretty slow i still have to
work<00:04:30.930> on<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.260> sound<00:04:31.590> if<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:31.860> can<00:04:32.070> hear<00:04:32.280> it's

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
work on the sound if you can hear it's

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.150 
work on the sound if you can hear it's
kind<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.730> loud<00:04:32.940> if<00:04:33.870> i<00:04:33.990> can't<00:04:34.260> get<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.620> sound<00:04:34.889> to

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
kind of loud if i can't get the sound to

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.690 
kind of loud if i can't get the sound to
adjust<00:04:35.669> then<00:04:36.419> what<00:04:36.660> will<00:04:36.840> happen<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:37.710> uh<00:04:37.740> I'll

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
adjust then what will happen is uh I'll

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.320 
adjust then what will happen is uh I'll
probably<00:04:39.150> just<00:04:39.740> have<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:41.160> on<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.280> timer<00:04:41.669> so<00:04:41.940> only

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
probably just have it on a timer so only

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.030 
probably just have it on a timer so only
do<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.570> couple<00:04:42.690> seconds<00:04:43.320> everyone<00:04:43.500> so<00:04:43.710> also<00:04:43.830> it

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
do a couple seconds everyone so also it

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.450 
do a couple seconds everyone so also it
will<00:04:44.100> take<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.520> it'll<00:04:45.150> turn<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:47.160> I'll<00:04:47.280> turn

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
will take it it'll turn it and I'll turn

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.570 
will take it it'll turn it and I'll turn
it<00:04:47.610> back<00:04:48.350> turn<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.740> know<00:04:49.860> a<00:04:49.889> couple<00:04:50.010> times

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
it back turn it you know a couple times

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.650 
it back turn it you know a couple times
an<00:04:51.240> hour<00:04:52.400> but<00:04:53.400> that's<00:04:53.580> basically<00:04:53.729> it<00:04:54.090> that

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
an hour but that's basically it that

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.629 
an hour but that's basically it that
will<00:04:54.780> keep<00:04:54.930> my<00:04:55.110> fans<00:04:55.440> from<00:04:55.950> going<00:04:56.010> around<00:04:56.460> and

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
will keep my fans from going around and

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.550 
will keep my fans from going around and
round<00:04:56.700> on<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.060> other<00:04:57.180> side<00:04:57.479> I<00:04:57.690> still<00:04:58.169> have<00:04:58.410> to

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
round on the other side I still have to

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.190 
round on the other side I still have to
readjust<00:04:59.070> my<00:04:59.610> bar<00:04:59.880> here<00:05:00.210> it's<00:05:00.360> not<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.660> good

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
readjust my bar here it's not a good

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.469 
readjust my bar here it's not a good
length<00:05:01.470> yet<00:05:01.800> I<00:05:02.010> might<00:05:02.490> actually<00:05:02.700> extend<00:05:03.300> this

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
length yet I might actually extend this

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.629 
length yet I might actually extend this
a<00:05:03.540> little<00:05:03.780> bit<00:05:04.050> so<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:04.770> will<00:05:05.190> that<00:05:05.370> will<00:05:05.460> help

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
a little bit so that will that will help

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.450 
a little bit so that will that will help
with<00:05:05.850> that<00:05:06.380> but<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:07.650> know<00:05:07.680> trial<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:08.340> error

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
with that but you know trial and error

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
with that but you know trial and error
so<00:05:09.419> that's<00:05:09.600> the<00:05:09.750> stuff<00:05:09.930> I'm<00:05:10.080> on<00:05:10.260> now
