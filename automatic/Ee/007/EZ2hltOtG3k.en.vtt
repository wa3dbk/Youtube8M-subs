simplest solution we've just taken a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.560 
simplest solution we've just taken a
small<00:00:32.160> piece<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.399> cardboard<00:00:32.669> now<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.120> measure

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
small piece of cardboard now I measure

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.069 
small piece of cardboard now I measure
it<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.530> half<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.950> dimension<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.670> my<00:00:36.079> standing

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it to half the dimension of my standing

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200 
it to half the dimension of my standing
drawer<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.890> basically<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.059> want

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
drawer here and basically what you want

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
drawer here and basically what you want
to<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.600> want<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> figure<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.110> how

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
to do and you want to figure out how

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810 
to do and you want to figure out how
many<00:00:40.440> piles<00:00:40.829> you'd<00:00:41.160> want<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.700> your

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
many piles you'd want to have in your

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850 
many piles you'd want to have in your
drawer<00:00:42.059> or<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.420> your<00:00:42.629> shelf<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:43.710> you're

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
drawer or on your shelf and then you're

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.229 
drawer or on your shelf and then you're
going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.100> cut<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:44.399> cardboard<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.059> whatever

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
going to cut your cardboard to whatever

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
going to cut your cardboard to whatever
dimension<00:00:45.899> makes<00:00:46.050> sense<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.620> then

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
dimension makes sense for that then

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.639 
dimension makes sense for that then
after<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.450> done<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
after you have that done you get out of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.410 
after you have that done you get out of
your<00:00:49.739> pile<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.219> clothing<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:54.059> lay<00:00:54.239> your

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
your pile of clothing and you lay your

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.459 
your pile of clothing and you lay your
piece<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.809> hard<00:00:55.020> work<00:00:56.180> between<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.809> shoulder

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
piece of hard work between the shoulder

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.900 
piece of hard work between the shoulder
blades<00:00:59.300> bring<00:01:00.300> each<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> shoulders<00:01:01.109> in

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
blades bring each of the shoulders in

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.700 
blades bring each of the shoulders in
bring<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> bottom<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.510> slide<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.229> cardboard

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
bring the bottom up slide the cardboard

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.580 
bring the bottom up slide the cardboard
out<00:01:05.540> fold<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> into<00:01:06.810> half<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.350> thirds

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
out fold it into half and thirds

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
out fold it into half and thirds
whatever<00:01:08.010> makes<00:01:08.250> sense<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> depth<00:01:08.970> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
whatever makes sense for the depth of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.899 
whatever makes sense for the depth of
your<00:01:09.240> drawer<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.990> tuck<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> right<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.760> on

solution the traditional solution where

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
solution the traditional solution where
we<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.100> stack<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.670> shirt<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.270> top<00:01:21.509> of

we just stack one shirt right on top of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.480 
we just stack one shirt right on top of
another<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.470> much<00:01:22.740> more<00:01:22.920> difficult<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.400> find

things and allow them to stay folded

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.020 
things and allow them to stay folded
with<00:01:25.530> these<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.009> grab<00:01:26.220> exactly<00:01:26.700> what<00:01:26.850> you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
with these you can grab exactly what you

an easy and inexpensive to make it takes
a<00:01:33.840> little<00:01:33.960> more<00:01:34.140> cardboard<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
a little more cardboard in time but it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.609 
a little more cardboard in time but it
gives<00:01:36.150> us<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.540> nice<00:01:36.810> solution<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.470> work

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
gives us a really nice solution to work

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.100 
gives us a really nice solution to work
with<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.240> we're<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.960> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
with so what we're going to do with this

with so what we're going to do with this
one<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.530> we've<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.040> taken<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.549> box<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.090> we've

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
one is we've just taken a box and we've

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.749 
one is we've just taken a box and we've
cut<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.259> down<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.280> some<00:01:44.490> wings

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
cut it down so that we have some wings
