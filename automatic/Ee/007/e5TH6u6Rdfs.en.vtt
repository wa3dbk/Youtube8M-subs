fighting God swords or chaotic noise

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.200 
fighting God swords or chaotic noise
even<00:00:35.520> though<00:00:35.820> they're<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> most

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
even though they're the most

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.030 
even though they're the most
unpredictable<00:00:36.690> within<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> easiest<00:00:37.740> to<00:00:37.800> kill

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
unpredictable within the easiest to kill

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.710 
unpredictable within the easiest to kill
people<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.550> because<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.270> double

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
people with because you can just double

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.210 
people with because you can just double
vinge<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.260> inspect<00:00:40.650> and<00:00:40.890> they<00:00:41.010> dead

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
vinge and inspect and they dead

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.180 
vinge and inspect and they dead
