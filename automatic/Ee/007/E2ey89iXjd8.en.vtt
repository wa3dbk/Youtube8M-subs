have this akuto radical HD and there are

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.150 
have this akuto radical HD and there are
two<00:00:47.989> levels<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.289> our<00:00:49.410> ebf<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
two levels of our ebf so we have the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
two levels of our ebf so we have the
graticule<00:00:50.820> HD<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> graticule<00:00:51.600> LT<00:00:51.989> they

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
graticule HD in the graticule LT they

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.500 
graticule HD in the graticule LT they
have<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> same<00:00:53.070> functions<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> same

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
have the same functions to do the same

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.260 
have the same functions to do the same
thing<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.199> only<00:00:55.469> difference<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.219> HD<00:00:56.610> is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

going to have five million pixels LTS
three<00:00:59.670> million<00:00:59.910> pixels<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.750> hdmi<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
three million pixels we have hdmi in and

go you can do peaking zebras false color
pixel<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> pixel<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.930> I'll<00:01:19.020> punch<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
pixel to pixel and I'll punch it in and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.039 
pixel to pixel and I'll punch it in and
magnify<00:01:20.240> there's<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.330> menu<00:01:21.509> button<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.020> a

sort of like the toggle switch on a/c

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.749 
sort of like the toggle switch on a/c
302<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.100> through<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> menus<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.420> 720

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
302 go through the menus it's a 720

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.940 
302 go through the menus it's a 720
screen<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.060> 1280<00:01:30.540> x<00:01:30.659> 1024<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:33.240> runs<00:01:33.689> off<00:01:33.950> lp6

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
screen it's 1280 x 1024 it runs off lp6

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.609 
screen it's 1280 x 1024 it runs off lp6
batteries<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.930> runs<00:01:37.020> pretty<00:01:37.229> long<00:01:37.470> time

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
batteries so it runs pretty long time

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.530 
batteries so it runs pretty long time
we've<00:01:37.799> been<00:01:37.890> run<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.280> at<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> show<00:01:38.670> maybe

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
we've been run in here at the show maybe

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.230 
we've been run in here at the show maybe
switch<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> out<00:01:40.460> one<00:01:41.460> or<00:01:41.549> two<00:01:41.700> times<00:01:41.909> during

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
switch it out one or two times during

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.719 
switch it out one or two times during
the<00:01:42.390> whole<00:01:42.540> day<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.439> they<00:01:44.159> last<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.430> pretty<00:01:44.610> long

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the whole day so they last a pretty long

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.830 
the whole day so they last a pretty long
time<00:01:45.110> there<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.590> rosette<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> side<00:01:47.549> to
