00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
super bad honestly that it's the second

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.479 
super bad honestly that it's the second
guy<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.609> really<00:01:03.210> ticks<00:01:03.510> me<00:01:03.600> off<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.489> the

guy that really ticks me off but the
first<00:01:05.700> boss<00:01:05.880> isn't<00:01:06.090> too<00:01:06.330> bad<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:06.720> it's

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
first boss isn't too bad I think it's

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960 
first boss isn't too bad I think it's
kind<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.380> cool<00:01:07.890> introduction<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> main

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
kind of a cool introduction to the main

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.020 
kind of a cool introduction to the main
boss<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.689> kitaru<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.590> yeah<00:01:11.430> he's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> big

big<00:01:12.270> hitter<00:01:12.570> big<00:01:13.170> hitter<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:14.820> see

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
big hitter big hitter but as you can see

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.370 
big hitter big hitter but as you can see
something<00:01:15.509> he<00:01:15.570> could<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.869> beginning<00:01:16.140> there

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
something he could do in beginning there

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.780 
something he could do in beginning there
when<00:01:16.530> he's<00:01:16.619> doing<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.979> kind<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.310> spread<00:01:17.610> pad

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
when he's doing that kind of spread pad

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.070 
when he's doing that kind of spread pad
in<00:01:17.909> there<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.210> kind<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.509> stay<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> ground

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
in there is kind of stay on the ground

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.480 
in there is kind of stay on the ground
if<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.530> obviously<00:01:20.040> begin<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
if you can obviously begin on the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.920 
if you can obviously begin on the
platform<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.060> much<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.420> difficult<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
platform it's much more difficult to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.219 
platform it's much more difficult to
evade<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.070> try<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.509> evade<00:01:24.720> some

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
evade so try that and you can evade some

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.929 
evade so try that and you can evade some
of<00:01:25.320> those<00:01:25.380> projectiles<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:26.580> easier

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
of those projectiles a little bit easier

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
of those projectiles a little bit easier
you<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.869> you're<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> melee<00:01:28.500> class<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.979> is

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
you know if you're a melee class that is

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.469 
you know if you're a melee class that is
and<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.790> need<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.090> there<00:01:30.329> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and you really need to be up there to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
and you really need to be up there to
pound<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.900> them<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.310> doing<00:01:32.460> some

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
pound on them so if you're doing some

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.249 
pound on them so if you're doing some
sort<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.030> mage<00:01:33.210> gimmick<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.930> might<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.200> able

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
sort of a mage gimmick you might be able

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.510 
sort of a mage gimmick you might be able
to<00:01:34.409> stable<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.890> down<00:01:34.979> below<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.250> little

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to stable out and down below a little

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.350 
to stable out and down below a little
easier<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.079> here<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.229> actually<00:01:38.240> we<00:01:39.240> don't

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
easier and here is actually we don't

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.730 
easier and here is actually we don't
demonstrate<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.049> best<00:01:40.200> way<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
demonstrate the best way to do that

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.710 
demonstrate the best way to do that
right<00:01:40.950> there<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.400> what<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.060> want<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.509> is

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
right there but what you want to do is

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.139 
right there but what you want to do is
kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.990> follow<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.700> projectiles<00:01:44.700> around<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
kind of follow the projectiles around a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.609 
kind of follow the projectiles around a
little<00:01:45.240> bit<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.720> -<00:01:45.990> there<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.500> have

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
little bit you can - there if you have

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.920 
little bit you can - there if you have
that<00:01:46.799> rune<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.340> stay<00:01:48.210> ahead<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.600> attack

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
that rune and stay ahead of that attack

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.740 
that rune and stay ahead of that attack
a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.140> bit<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.790> reality<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.360> think

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
a little bit but in reality I think

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.080 
a little bit but in reality I think
we're<00:01:52.229> using<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> barb<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:52.890> am<00:01:53.009> i<00:01:53.070> right<00:01:53.100> yeah

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
we're using a barb here am i right yeah

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.410 
we're using a barb here am i right yeah

that's a barb and yes he does

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.139 
that's a barb and yes he does
okay<00:01:58.020> damage<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.729> know<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.909> could

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
okay damage but you know you could

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.880 
okay damage but you know you could
really<00:02:00.329> kill<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.810> guy<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> variety<00:02:01.860> of

the big thing is with the barb and what

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.449 
the big thing is with the barb and what
we<00:02:09.360> liked<00:02:09.599> about<00:02:09.720> him<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:11.129> mess

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
we liked about him is that you can mess

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.750 
we liked about him is that you can mess
up<00:02:11.489> quite<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> bit<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.480> know

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
up quite a bit you know

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.699 
up quite a bit you know
we<00:02:13.000> did<00:02:13.299> here<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:14.049> know<00:02:14.140> we<00:02:14.319> thought<00:02:14.470> about

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
we did here you know we thought about

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:15.929 
we did here you know we thought about
redoing<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.430> showing<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.760> little

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
redoing this and showing you a little

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.660 
redoing this and showing you a little
bit<00:02:16.060> cleaner<00:02:16.239> video<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:18.010> just<00:02:18.310> proves

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
bit cleaner video but this just proves

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.729 
bit cleaner video but this just proves
the<00:02:18.849> versatility<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.689> Barb<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.260> because

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
the versatility of the Barb and because

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.770 
the versatility of the Barb and because
he's<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.250> heavy<00:02:21.519> on<00:02:21.760> HP<00:02:22.209> he<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.569> take<00:02:22.750> a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
he's so heavy on HP he can take a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.990 
he's so heavy on HP he can take a
beating<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.799> know<00:02:23.829> and<00:02:24.099> still<00:02:24.370> stay<00:02:24.579> in<00:02:24.760> there

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
beating you know and still stay in there

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.809 
beating you know and still stay in there
with<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.329> guy<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.900> tear<00:02:26.500> him<00:02:26.620> up<00:02:26.739> so<00:02:27.069> that's

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
with this guy and tear him up so that's

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.520 
with this guy and tear him up so that's
how<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.120> can<00:02:28.329> take<00:02:28.510> down<00:02:28.659> the<00:02:28.780> first<00:02:28.930> boss<00:02:29.200> but

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
how you can take down the first boss but

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.660 
how you can take down the first boss but
obviously<00:02:29.980> can<00:02:30.159> do<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> little<00:02:30.400> cleaner

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
obviously can do it a little cleaner

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.069 
obviously can do it a little cleaner
this<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.209> just<00:02:31.510> total<00:02:31.959> ripoff<00:02:32.290> though<00:02:32.590> right

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
this is just total ripoff though right

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.740 
this is just total ripoff though right
imagine<00:02:35.549> those<00:02:36.549> stats<00:02:36.849> can<00:02:37.090> be<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.269> number<00:02:37.480> of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
imagine those stats can be a number of

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.259 
imagine those stats can be a number of
things<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.319> we<00:02:39.310> just<00:02:39.519> got<00:02:39.670> it's<00:02:39.849> completely

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
things and we just got it's completely

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.330 
things and we just got it's completely
random<00:02:40.420> as<00:02:40.750> far<00:02:40.930> as<00:02:41.049> I'm<00:02:41.170> aware<00:02:41.319> yeah<00:02:42.220> I'm

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
random as far as I'm aware yeah I'm

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.160 
random as far as I'm aware yeah I'm
pretty<00:02:42.459> sure<00:02:42.579> it<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:42.879> and<00:02:43.150> we<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:43.780> kind<00:02:44.140> of

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
pretty sure it is and we just kind of

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.229 
pretty sure it is and we just kind of
got<00:02:44.290> ribbed<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.769> three<00:02:45.069> MP<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:46.090> know

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.220 
here I believe we picked an assassin as
this<00:02:54.459> as<00:02:54.609> an<00:02:54.730> assassin<00:02:54.940> isn't<00:02:55.329> it<00:02:55.480> yeah<00:02:55.989> yeah

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230

this as an assassin isn't it yeah yeah
yeah<00:02:56.859> we<00:02:57.069> can<00:02:57.159> see<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.430> little<00:02:57.549> dark<00:02:58.540> cloud<00:02:58.870> of

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
yeah we can see the little dark cloud of

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.410 
yeah we can see the little dark cloud of
crazy<00:02:59.470> following<00:03:00.010> them<00:03:00.099> around<00:03:00.159> so<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.299> is

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
crazy following them around so this is

crazy following them around so this is
Alexander<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:03.670> guy<00:03:03.970> can<00:03:04.629> be<00:03:04.659> a<00:03:04.840> bit<00:03:05.019> of<00:03:05.109> a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
Alexander and this guy can be a bit of a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.720 
Alexander and this guy can be a bit of a
chore<00:03:06.599> absolutely<00:03:07.599> you<00:03:07.750> know<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:09.400> because

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
chore absolutely you know just because

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.369 
chore absolutely you know just because
it<00:03:10.060> isn't<00:03:10.209> really<00:03:10.420> him<00:03:10.750> that's<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.139> problem

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
it isn't really him that's the problem

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.229 
it isn't really him that's the problem
it's<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:12.040> fact<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.340> he<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:12.670> loads<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
it's the fact that he just loads the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.789 
it's the fact that he just loads the
screen<00:03:13.540> up<00:03:13.659> with<00:03:13.780> those<00:03:13.870> ads<00:03:14.170> you're<00:03:14.440> starting

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
screen up with those ads you're starting

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:15.809

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.490 
so again if you're only melee and you
know<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.359> lot<00:03:19.599> of<00:03:19.629> the<00:03:19.720> time<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.049> have<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.290> do<00:03:20.379> at

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
know a lot of the time you have to do at

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.780 
know a lot of the time you have to do at
least<00:03:20.530> some<00:03:20.859> melee<00:03:21.190> no<00:03:21.310> matter<00:03:21.459> what<00:03:21.669> your

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
least some melee no matter what your

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.869 
least some melee no matter what your
class<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:22.239> in<00:03:22.389> this<00:03:22.510> game<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:24.310> becomes<00:03:24.699> an

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
class is in this game it becomes an

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.909 
class is in this game it becomes an
issue<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.599> get<00:03:25.750> some<00:03:25.959> damage<00:03:26.169> in<00:03:26.379> on<00:03:26.500> him<00:03:26.709> when

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
issue to get some damage in on him when

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.710 
issue to get some damage in on him when
all<00:03:26.980> these<00:03:27.250> guys<00:03:27.489> load<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.910> screen<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:28.480> we

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
all these guys load the screen so we

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.289 
all these guys load the screen so we
figured<00:03:29.260> best<00:03:29.919> thing<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.190> do<00:03:30.430> is<00:03:30.699> to<00:03:30.910> limit<00:03:31.209> the

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
figured best thing to do is to limit the

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.939 
figured best thing to do is to limit the
number<00:03:31.329> of<00:03:31.540> ads<00:03:31.750> on<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.049> screen<00:03:32.319> at<00:03:32.410> once<00:03:32.620> and

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
number of ads on the screen at once and

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.550 
number of ads on the screen at once and
use<00:03:33.879> a<00:03:33.910> class<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.449> has<00:03:34.599> really<00:03:34.989> really<00:03:35.410> high

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
use a class that has really really high

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.589 
use a class that has really really high
damage<00:03:35.859> to<00:03:36.160> try<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.459> turn<00:03:36.730> those<00:03:36.940> off<00:03:37.239> those

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
damage to try to turn those off those

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.479 
damage to try to turn those off those
ads<00:03:37.810> as<00:03:37.959> quickly<00:03:38.230> as<00:03:38.410> possible<00:03:38.470> so<00:03:39.099> that's<00:03:39.250> why

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
ads as quickly as possible so that's why

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.490 
ads as quickly as possible so that's why
we<00:03:39.609> want<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.910> assassin<00:03:40.389> here<00:03:40.629> and<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.989> think

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
we want the assassin here and I think

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.930 
we want the assassin here and I think
this<00:03:41.739> worked<00:03:41.949> out<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.190> best<00:03:42.370> when<00:03:42.609> we<00:03:42.699> tried<00:03:42.910> a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
this worked out the best when we tried a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.539 
this worked out the best when we tried a
number<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.299> things<00:03:43.980> yeah<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.160> one<00:03:45.340> took

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
number of things yeah this one took

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.089 
number of things yeah this one took
quite<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.819> while<00:03:45.910> for<00:03:46.299> us<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.510> get<00:03:46.900> down<00:03:47.169> but<00:03:47.470> you

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
quite a while for us to get down but you

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.589 
quite a while for us to get down but you
went<00:03:48.340> with<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.639> assassin<00:03:49.209> in<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.419> end

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
went with the assassin in the end

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.349 
went with the assassin in the end
because<00:03:50.079> he<00:03:50.590> has<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.769> high<00:03:51.099> crit<00:03:51.430> chance<00:03:51.639> and<00:03:52.060> a

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
because he has a high crit chance and a

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.689 
because he has a high crit chance and a
high<00:03:52.540> crit<00:03:52.900> damage<00:03:53.109> so<00:03:53.889> he<00:03:54.310> was<00:03:54.430> able<00:03:54.549> to

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
high crit damage so he was able to

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.430 
high crit damage so he was able to
really<00:03:54.910> dispatch<00:03:55.359> those<00:03:55.629> ads<00:03:55.870> rather<00:03:56.169> quickly

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
really dispatch those ads rather quickly

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.589 
really dispatch those ads rather quickly
and<00:03:56.769> if<00:03:57.159> you<00:03:57.280> let<00:03:57.430> too<00:03:57.609> many<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.909> them<00:03:58.060> pile<00:03:58.329> on

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
and if you let too many of them pile on

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.960 
and if you let too many of them pile on
it<00:03:59.139> becomes<00:03:59.440> almost<00:03:59.709> impossible<00:04:00.489> not<00:04:00.519> to<00:04:00.699> get

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
it becomes almost impossible not to get

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.059 
it becomes almost impossible not to get
hit<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:02.169> know<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.409> assassin<00:04:02.799> doesn't

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069
