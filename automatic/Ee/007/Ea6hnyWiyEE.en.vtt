the track features some fast short
straightaways<00:00:18.720> as<00:00:18.900> well<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.650> there's<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> lot

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
straightaways as well so there's a lot

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.160 
straightaways as well so there's a lot
of<00:00:20.130> tourney<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.670> plenty<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.300> chances<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.869> get

into<00:00:22.439> trouble

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
into trouble

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.920

there<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.580> several<00:00:23.850> opportunities<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.689> pass

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
there are several opportunities to pass

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.980 
there are several opportunities to pass
so<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> action<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.160> continuous<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.750> front

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
so the action is continuous the front

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.750 
so the action is continuous the front

of turns two and three these two turns

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.700 
of turns two and three these two turns
create<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.300> 180-degree<00:00:45.300> right-hand<00:00:45.870> move<00:00:46.110> with

the exit of turn three being downhill

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.529 
the exit of turn three being downhill
then<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.250> uphill<00:00:50.760> right<00:00:51.059> into<00:00:51.300> turn<00:00:51.510> four

then it's uphill right into turn four

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
then it's uphill right into turn four
which<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.800> correction<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> right
