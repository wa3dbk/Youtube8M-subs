00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
first you're gonna take the brick with

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.790 
first you're gonna take the brick with
studs<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> side<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.180> attach<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.559> two

studs on the side and attach the two
diagonal<00:00:56.760> drills<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:58.430> if<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.670> move<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
diagonal drills and if they move up and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
diagonal drills and if they move up and
down<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.750> alright<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.770> don't

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
down it's alright because they don't

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.219 
down it's alright because they don't
have<00:01:02.070> holes<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.730> them<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.239> Lego<00:01:03.600> bricks<00:01:03.960> do

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
have holes in them like Lego bricks do

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.000 
and then you attach the robot arms like
this<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.609> can<00:02:52.819> attach<00:02:53.209> them<00:02:53.600> using<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.709> holes

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
this you can attach them using the holes

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.640 
this you can attach them using the holes
and<00:02:55.730> then<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.389> arms<00:02:56.780> on<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.109> robot<00:02:57.470> body<00:02:59.650> and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
and then the arms on the robot body and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.370 
and then the arms on the robot body and
then<00:03:00.829> once<00:03:01.459> you're<00:03:02.359> done<00:03:02.389> with<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.870> body<00:03:03.109> you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
then once you're done with the body you

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.490 
then once you're done with the body you
can<00:03:03.590> just<00:03:03.799> slip<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.190> off<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.579> side<00:03:04.700> and

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
can just slip that off to the side and

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.720 
can just slip that off to the side and
start<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.829> head<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.340> you're<00:03:07.489> going<00:03:07.670> to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
start on the head so you're going to

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.250 
start on the head so you're going to
take<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.389> flat<00:03:08.690> tile<00:03:09.609> and<00:03:10.609> insert<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.900> stud

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
take the flat tile and insert the stud

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.229 
take the flat tile and insert the stud
and<00:03:12.290> clip<00:03:12.799> like<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.190> so<00:03:13.849> it<00:03:13.910> should<00:03:14.090> look

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
and clip like that so it should look

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.449 
and clip like that so it should look
like<00:03:14.299> that<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.410> then<00:03:15.680> on<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.950> front<00:03:16.099> should

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
like that and then on the front should

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.030 
like that and then on the front should
look<00:03:16.609> like<00:03:16.760> that<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.450> then<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:18.290> take<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.829> one

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
look like that and then you take the one

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.460 
look like that and then you take the one
with<00:03:19.069> studs<00:03:19.639> and<00:03:20.000> insert<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.139> to<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:22.160> head<00:03:22.639> and

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
with studs and insert it to the head and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.410 
with studs and insert it to the head and
catch<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:26.000> you've<00:03:26.569> got<00:03:26.599> your<00:03:26.840> robot
