exactly the same as the incoming so you

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.760 
exactly the same as the incoming so you
would<00:01:40.360> just<00:01:40.480> duplicate<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.170> information

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.180 

the<00:02:07.150> mail<00:02:07.330> server<00:02:07.570> does<00:02:08.140> not<00:02:08.320> use<00:02:08.590> an<00:02:08.740> ssl

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
the mail server does not use an ssl

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.760 
the mail server does not use an ssl
