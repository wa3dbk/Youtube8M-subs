00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
is colored and bleach is essentially

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.060 
is colored and bleach is essentially
trying<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.960> rid<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.320> color<00:01:52.530> build-up

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
trying to get rid of the color build-up

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.480 
trying to get rid of the color build-up
and<00:01:53.549> cuz<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.030> want<00:01:54.149> ugly<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.540> head<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.840> like

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
and cuz you want ugly your head is like

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.910 
and cuz you want ugly your head is like
say<00:01:56.490> fresher<00:01:56.820> hair<00:01:57.149> it's<00:01:58.049> easier<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.590> get<00:01:58.740> out

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
say fresher hair it's easier to get out

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800 
say fresher hair it's easier to get out
of<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> head<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.670> bottom<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.299> your

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
of the head and at the bottom if your

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.469 
of the head and at the bottom if your
hair<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.140> naturally<00:02:01.619> dark<00:02:02.119> it's<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.390> be

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
hair is naturally dark it's going to be

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.969 
hair is naturally dark it's going to be
a<00:02:03.509> lot<00:02:03.630> easier<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:04.049> get<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> lie<00:02:04.409> anyway<00:02:04.829> because

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
a lot easier to get a lie anyway because

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.649 
a lot easier to get a lie anyway because
it's<00:02:05.189> not<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.759> bleach<00:02:05.939> isn't<00:02:06.299> having<00:02:06.420> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it's not like the bleach isn't having to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.080 
it's not like the bleach isn't having to
bleach<00:02:06.869> through<00:02:07.110> anything<00:02:07.530> else<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.550> did

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
bleach through anything else I just did

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.180
