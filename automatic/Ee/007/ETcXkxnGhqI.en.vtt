00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 as he was very good morning cheers is already 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.299
 Thursday almost Friday weekends 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.580
 to see how the conditions are 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.889
 I present the satellite image that 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.750
 It is happening we have a channel 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.250
 low pressure that extend from the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.109
 northwest towards the west of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 territory and this causes entry of 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.279
 moisture from the Pacific to the interior of the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.230
 Mexican Republic The Tropical Wave 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.060
 number 7 on the Pacific continues 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.560
 advancing westward throwing 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.750
 slight humidity inside the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.789
 territory the tropical wave number 8 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.180
 it is affected more intensely because 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.850
 to which humidity enters so much of the pacifico 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.620
 from the gulf and the Caribbean Sea to the interior 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.809
 of the territory generates a lot of cloudiness and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
 heavy rains could even be 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.219
 thunderstorms all these 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.570
 systems promote cloudiness to the interior 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.390
 of the territory especially towards the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.420
 northwest north west south and southeast 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.430
 of the Mexican Republic also in the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.989
 regions is causing humidity and is 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.770
 that's why to the south and southeast it 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.990
 they present light to moderate rains 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.880
 the is presented the live image we can 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.100
 appreciate a sky is maintained mostly 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.050
 cloudy and this condition in the afternoon 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.360
 will be partially annulled at 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.740
 moment the thermometer already marks 24 degrees 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.190
 centigrade with atmospheric pressure 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.100
 of 1020 millibars but during this day 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.780

 degrees centigrade at night 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.040
 will descend to 26 degrees with a sky 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.680
