big<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.939> recipes<00:02:00.509> I'm<00:02:01.439> into<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.670> technique<00:02:03.090> so

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
big on recipes I'm into the technique so

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.289 
big on recipes I'm into the technique so
let's<00:02:04.200> say<00:02:04.409> by<00:02:04.590> chance<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.520> we're<00:02:05.820> sauteing

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
let's say by chance as we're sauteing

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.109 
let's say by chance as we're sauteing
these<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:07.110> looks<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.710> little<00:02:07.979> dry<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.970> we're

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
these it looks a little dry and we're

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.780 
these it looks a little dry and we're
not<00:02:09.270> getting<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.599> lot<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.780> caramelization

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
not getting a lot of caramelization

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.580 
not getting a lot of caramelization
don't<00:02:11.790> panic<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:13.049> add<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> little<00:02:13.409> bit<00:02:13.560> more

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
don't panic just add a little bit more

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.030 
don't panic just add a little bit more
oil<00:02:14.629> as<00:02:15.629> you<00:02:15.840> introduce<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.290> oil<00:02:16.439> the<00:02:16.680> pan<00:02:16.860> is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
oil as you introduce the oil the pan is

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160 
oil as you introduce the oil the pan is
not<00:02:17.189> so<00:02:17.430> dry<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.970> have<00:02:18.480> more<00:02:18.659> liquid<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:19.049> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
not so dry we have more liquid in the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.740 
not so dry we have more liquid in the
pan<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:19.829> oil<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.730> coat<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.360> pancetta

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
pan and a more oil to coat the pancetta

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.979 
pan and a more oil to coat the pancetta
so<00:02:22.680> let<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.980> cook<00:02:23.220> also<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.480> annoys<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.959> crap

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
so let it cook also it annoys the crap

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.289 
so let it cook also it annoys the crap

stuff<00:02:29.099> we're<00:02:30.000> trying<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.269> get<00:02:30.359> carmelization

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
stuff we're trying to get carmelization

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.229 
stuff we're trying to get carmelization
the<00:02:31.470> pan<00:02:31.769> is<00:02:31.920> hot<00:02:32.099> in<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.370> bottom<00:02:32.670> if<00:02:32.849> you

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
the pan is hot in the bottom if you

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.059 
the pan is hot in the bottom if you
leave<00:02:33.659> it<00:02:33.810> undisturbed<00:02:34.109> for<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> little<00:02:34.890> while

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
leave it undisturbed for a little while

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.339 
leave it undisturbed for a little while
the<00:02:35.700> bottom<00:02:35.909> will<00:02:36.180> get<00:02:36.299> caramelized<00:02:36.569> as<00:02:37.079> the

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
the bottom will get caramelized as the

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.319 
the bottom will get caramelized as the
bottom<00:02:37.590> get<00:02:37.739> caramelized<00:02:38.280> then<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.239> go

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
bottom get caramelized then we can go

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.789 
bottom get caramelized then we can go
ahead<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.540> stir<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.049> around<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.439> switch
