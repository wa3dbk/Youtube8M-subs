00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello, well, we are already here with a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.470
 more video and what it should show 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.870
 in this good video is a delineator the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.630
 of curved fear that many of you 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.910
 maybe you already have in your house some of 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.250
 you may not have it and like me 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.869
 be it the first times or the first 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.269
 Once they use it, it's not pretty 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.400
 that has as a father or novelty this 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.039
 eyeliner because it is precisely its form 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.369
 which is a curved shape that adapts very 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.920
 easy to your hand but your finger 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.620
 I'm going to show you the little tip you have 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.079
 like a nice and this material like 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.390
 Padding is not like the classic brush 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.180
 of the eyeliners in crazy liquid the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.829
 base then it is and much better because 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.629
 we knew that then he runs and there 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.850
 to be a little bit if they blow not 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.890
 to dry is not that that does 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.920
 sincerely liked how you can 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.500
 see my delineated to the delineated that I 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.890
 I made myself go crooked was not so easy 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.360
 how I thought maybe it was going to be 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.039
 do me the delineated with this I do not know if 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.440
 maybe with a little more practice 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.660
 I'll be driving much better 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.630
 I hope that if really and well I 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.100
 I just wanted to show you this 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.350
 eyeliner that many people have 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.940
 asked why they tell me yesterday to 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.020
 try this you do not necessarily approve 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.330
 I had not tried to make a 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.090
 bit that in instagram I put a photo 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.190
 of this one and it barely came then then 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.830
 I love them I wanted to show you this 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.200
 I wanted to share it with you and so 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.300
 I'm going to show you how I eat I made my 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.700
 outlined that actually as they 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.739
 I commented a moment ago I 'm staying 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.350
 crooked but I share it with you 

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:40.869
 for what 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.220
 how are you doing as you use it 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.220

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.910

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.050
 ah 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.460

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.500

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.420
 I made my nails that I invite you to see my 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.240
