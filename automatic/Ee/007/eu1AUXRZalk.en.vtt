they'll start trying to set in to
posture<00:00:32.170> well<00:00:32.680> if<00:00:32.860> I'm<00:00:33.010> standing<00:00:33.430> straight<00:00:33.700> up

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730

posture well if I'm standing straight up
and<00:00:33.969> down<00:00:34.030> I'm<00:00:34.329> a<00:00:34.390> different<00:00:34.750> distance<00:00:35.410> from

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
and down I'm a different distance from

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.010 
and down I'm a different distance from
the<00:00:35.710> ball<00:00:35.920> as<00:00:36.190> I<00:00:36.640> would<00:00:36.850> be<00:00:37.030> from<00:00:37.239> posture<00:00:37.750> if

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
the ball as I would be from posture if

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.979 
the ball as I would be from posture if
you<00:00:38.649> look<00:00:38.920> at<00:00:39.039> the<00:00:39.160> best<00:00:39.399> players<00:00:39.789> they<00:00:40.780> go

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
you look at the best players they go

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.479 
you look at the best players they go
through<00:00:41.260> pretty<00:00:41.530> much<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.860> same<00:00:42.070> routine

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
through pretty much the same routine

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.459 
through pretty much the same routine
every<00:00:42.520> time<00:00:43.059> they<00:00:43.750> will<00:00:43.960> set<00:00:44.320> their<00:00:44.980> posture

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
every time they will set their posture

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.869 
every time they will set their posture
then<00:00:47.469> they're<00:00:47.739> going<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:47.949> set<00:00:48.250> their<00:00:48.460> club

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
then they're going to set their club

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.740 
then they're going to set their club
face<00:00:49.300> down<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.379> target<00:00:50.649> line<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:52.449> they're

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
face down the target line then they're

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.080 
face down the target line then they're
going<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:52.899> set<00:00:53.230> their<00:00:53.440> feet<00:00:53.850> underneath<00:00:54.850> their

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
going to set their feet underneath their

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.209 
going to set their feet underneath their
hips<00:00:55.359> staying<00:00:55.989> in<00:00:56.230> this<00:00:56.379> posture<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:57.070> whole

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
hips staying in this posture the whole

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.430 
hips staying in this posture the whole
time<00:00:57.460> that's<00:00:58.090> what<00:00:58.449> gives<00:00:58.690> me<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:58.930> distance

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
time that's what gives me the distance

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.529 
time that's what gives me the distance
from<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.800> ball<00:01:00.010> especially<00:01:00.460> so<00:01:00.789> they<00:01:00.940> got<00:01:01.059> 13

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
from the ball especially so they got 13

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.599 
from the ball especially so they got 13
different<00:01:01.719> clubs<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.289> I'm<00:01:02.440> hitting<00:01:02.739> with<00:01:02.949> my

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
different clubs that I'm hitting with my

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.940 
different clubs that I'm hitting with my
posture<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:05.050> length<00:01:05.350> of<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.710> club

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
posture and the length of the club

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.370 
posture and the length of the club
dictates<00:01:06.580> how<00:01:06.730> far<00:01:07.000> from<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.330> ball<00:01:07.510> I<00:01:07.540> am<00:01:07.870> so

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
dictates how far from the ball I am so

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.690 
dictates how far from the ball I am so
if<00:01:08.770> I<00:01:09.250> set<00:01:09.580> my<00:01:09.610> posture<00:01:10.890> then<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:11.920> set<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.370> club

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.690 
if I set my posture then I set the club
face<00:01:12.970> down<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.420> target<00:01:13.660> line<00:01:14.190> then<00:01:15.190> I<00:01:15.220> can<00:01:15.580> go

will just go in with one hand or the
other<00:01:51.300> set<00:01:52.300> their<00:01:52.510> posture<00:01:53.140> set<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.040> club

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
other set their posture set the club

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.800 
other set their posture set the club
face<00:01:54.660> then<00:01:55.660> their<00:01:55.930> grip<00:01:56.290> then<00:01:57.160> their<00:01:57.430> feet

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
face then their grip then their feet

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.700 
face then their grip then their feet
others<00:01:58.810> will<00:01:58.990> go<00:01:59.490> posture<00:02:00.690> club<00:02:01.690> face<00:02:02.020> feet

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
others will go posture club face feet

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.130 
others will go posture club face feet
then<00:02:03.640> they'll<00:02:03.940> go<00:02:04.090> ahead<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.450> set<00:02:04.690> their<00:02:04.870> grip

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
then they'll go ahead and set their grip

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.040 
then they'll go ahead and set their grip
so<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.890> timing<00:02:06.430> of<00:02:06.550> where<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:06.850> grip<00:02:07.120> occurs

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
so the timing of where the grip occurs

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.680 
so the timing of where the grip occurs
doesn't<00:02:09.039> really<00:02:09.160> matter<00:02:09.460> what<00:02:10.030> does<00:02:10.360> matter

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
doesn't really matter what does matter

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.590 
doesn't really matter what does matter
is<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.440> posture<00:02:12.400> gives<00:02:12.580> me<00:02:12.850> my<00:02:12.970> distance<00:02:13.450> to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
is the posture gives me my distance to

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.670 
is the posture gives me my distance to
the<00:02:13.690> ball

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
the ball

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.399 
the ball
then<00:02:15.579> I<00:02:15.609> set<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.030> club<00:02:16.450> face<00:02:16.689> down<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.109> target

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
then I set the club face down the target

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.429 
then I set the club face down the target
line<00:02:17.590> for<00:02:18.010> alignment<00:02:18.569> now<00:02:19.569> I'm<00:02:19.780> setting<00:02:20.290> my

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
line for alignment now I'm setting my

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.179 
line for alignment now I'm setting my
feet<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.129> club<00:02:21.459> face<00:02:22.620> while<00:02:23.620> staying<00:02:24.010> in

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
feet to that club face while staying in

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.880 
feet to that club face while staying in
that<00:02:24.219> posture<00:02:24.640> if<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.840> set<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.349> routine

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
that posture if we set that routine

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.530 
that posture if we set that routine
every<00:02:27.250> time<00:02:27.519> we're<00:02:28.090> going<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.269> get<00:02:28.390> our

every time we're going to get our

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.360 
every time we're going to get our
distance<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.260> ball<00:02:29.439> and<00:02:29.739> we're<00:02:30.189> going<00:02:30.310> to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
distance to the ball and we're going to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.580 
distance to the ball and we're going to
be<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.519> lot<00:02:30.790> better<00:02:30.939> balanced<00:02:31.540> watch<00:02:32.139> the<00:02:32.379> tour
