00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.510 
is freaking pimpness so we're gonna put
those<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.680> gotta<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:08.069> them<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.310> put

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
those on you gotta know them and put

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.260 
those on you gotta know them and put
those<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.940> mom<00:02:09.810> definitely<00:02:10.560> put<00:02:11.129> each<00:02:11.310> 232<00:02:12.030> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
those on mom definitely put each 232 so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.110 
those on mom definitely put each 232 so
that<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.629> feel

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
that I feel

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.660 
that I feel
tonnage<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.629> 18<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.069> looks<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.400> thing

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
tonnage of 18 so looks like this thing

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.220 
tonnage of 18 so looks like this thing
got<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:15.909> lot<00:02:16.239> of<00:02:16.269> lasers<00:02:16.659> so<00:02:16.930> we're<00:02:17.019> going<00:02:17.140> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
got a lot of lasers so we're going to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.500 
got a lot of lasers so we're going to
switch<00:02:17.440> over<00:02:17.620> head<00:02:18.489> up<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.760> laser<00:02:19.060> group

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
switch over head up to the laser group

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.170 
switch over head up to the laser group

tam<00:02:33.700> cannon<00:02:34.329> Jesus<00:02:34.720> Christ<00:02:34.989> um<00:02:36.420> let's<00:02:37.420> see<00:02:37.659> er

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
tam cannon Jesus Christ um let's see er

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.559 
tam cannon Jesus Christ um let's see er
that's<00:02:40.180> all<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:41.049> not<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.190> heavy<00:02:45.269> yeah<00:02:46.269> I<00:02:46.299> have

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
that's all it's not so heavy yeah I have

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.330 
that's all it's not so heavy yeah I have
to<00:02:46.720> do<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.109> is<00:02:47.379> that<00:02:47.500> those<00:02:47.709> things<00:02:47.890> kick<00:02:48.160> ass

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
to do that is that those things kick ass

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.690 
to do that is that those things kick ass
um<00:02:49.560> now<00:02:50.560> what<00:02:50.680> we<00:02:50.829> have<00:02:50.859> that<00:02:51.280> that'll<00:02:51.549> be<00:02:51.609> the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
um now what we have that that'll be the

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.410 
um now what we have that that'll be the
primary<00:02:52.920> okay<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:53.980> we<00:02:54.220> have<00:02:54.250> our<00:02:54.400> PPC<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.269> going

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
primary okay so we have our PPC is going

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.420 
primary okay so we have our PPC is going
to<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.870> primary<00:02:56.200> attack<00:02:56.739> for<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.129> laser

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
to be the primary attack for the laser

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.330 
to be the primary attack for the laser
section<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:58.989> know<00:02:59.290> another<00:03:00.040> thing<00:03:00.159> to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
section so I know another thing to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.619 
section so I know another thing to
probably<00:03:00.579> gonna<00:03:00.700> have<00:03:00.940> you're<00:03:01.209> going<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.510> put

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
probably gonna have you're going to put

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.720 
probably gonna have you're going to put
multiple<00:03:02.019> smaller<00:03:02.440> lasers<00:03:03.010> on<00:03:03.190> hopefully

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
multiple smaller lasers on hopefully

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.759 
multiple smaller lasers on hopefully
don't<00:03:03.879> generate<00:03:04.209> too<00:03:04.359> much<00:03:04.390> heat<00:03:07.620> where's<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
don't generate too much heat where's the

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.860 
don't generate too much heat where's the
range<00:03:09.010> on<00:03:09.190> these<00:03:09.310> 400<00:03:10.120> it's<00:03:10.269> kind<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.599> poor

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
range on these 400 it's kind of a poor

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:23.220 
range on these 400 it's kind of a poor
range<00:03:11.200> ah<00:03:13.560> 400<00:03:16.019> 300<00:03:17.019> Jesus<00:03:17.319> crews<00:03:22.079> will<00:03:23.079> have

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
range ah 400 300 Jesus crews will have

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:32.099 
range ah 400 300 Jesus crews will have
one<00:03:23.739> heavy<00:03:24.220> laser<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:29.129> couple<00:03:30.129> of<00:03:31.109> better

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
one heavy laser and a couple of better

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.509 
one heavy laser and a couple of better
put<00:03:32.290> some<00:03:32.440> more<00:03:32.560> heat<00:03:32.769> sinks<00:03:33.069> on<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.370> because

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
put some more heat sinks on this because

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.599 
put some more heat sinks on this because
our<00:03:33.609> heat<00:03:33.790> efficiency<00:03:34.239> start<00:03:34.569> to<00:03:34.690> suck<00:03:35.609> okay

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
our heat efficiency start to suck okay

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.020 
our heat efficiency start to suck okay
so<00:03:36.669> the<00:03:36.970> heat<00:03:37.150> efficiency<00:03:37.690> is<00:03:37.959> average<00:03:39.030> ok

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
so the heat efficiency is average ok

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.030 
so the heat efficiency is average ok
it's<00:03:40.269> not<00:03:40.329> freaking<00:03:40.780> great<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.769> there<00:03:41.919> we<00:03:42.010> go

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
it's not freaking great so there we go

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.740 
it's not freaking great so there we go
that's<00:03:42.579> what<00:03:42.699> we<00:03:42.790> got<00:03:42.940> for<00:03:43.090> addressing<00:03:43.569> back

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
that's what we got for addressing back

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.809 
that's what we got for addressing back
right<00:03:43.989> now<00:03:44.019> on<00:03:45.419> pretty<00:03:46.419> decent<00:03:46.629> i<00:03:46.989> would<00:03:47.139> say

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
right now on pretty decent i would say

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.920 
right now on pretty decent i would say
actually<00:03:48.819> why<00:03:49.239> don't<00:03:49.269> we<00:03:49.419> take<00:03:49.569> this<00:03:49.720> on<00:03:49.900> the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
actually why don't we take this on the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.789 
actually why don't we take this on the
field<00:03:50.410> for<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.340> quick<00:03:51.549> feeling<00:03:51.970> rodman<00:03:52.359> and

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
field for a quick feeling rodman and

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.920 
field for a quick feeling rodman and
racine<00:03:53.799> is<00:03:53.949> a<00:03:53.980> yes<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:56.579> transporting<00:03:57.579> out<00:03:57.930> so

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
racine is a yes and transporting out so

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.740 
racine is a yes and transporting out so
we're<00:03:59.019> going<00:03:59.169> to<00:03:59.260> go<00:03:59.379> to<00:03:59.459> wave<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:01.569> we<00:04:01.629> might

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
we're going to go to wave and we might

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.900 
we're going to go to wave and we might
as<00:04:01.840> well<00:04:01.989> just<00:04:02.109> do<00:04:02.260> on<00:04:02.379> the<00:04:02.500> first<00:04:02.739> map<00:04:03.040> will

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
as well just do on the first map will

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.220 
as well just do on the first map will
fight<00:04:04.150> something<00:04:04.389> that's<00:04:04.599> a<00:04:04.660> quote<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.930> little

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
fight something that's a quote a little

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.339 
fight something that's a quote a little
