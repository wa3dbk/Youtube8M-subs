00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
because if he needed to feel any better

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.660 
because if he needed to feel any better
about<00:04:30.940> himself

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.320 
problem has been for guys to stay up

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.380 
problem has been for guys to stay up
there<00:07:34.500> and<00:07:34.560> keep<00:07:34.800> that<00:07:35.040> level<00:07:35.310> up<00:07:35.580> for<00:07:36.060> two<00:07:36.240> out

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 
of three sets and that's why Nadal has

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.690 
of three sets and that's why Nadal has
taken<00:07:39.330> his<00:07:39.540> game<00:07:39.750> to<00:07:39.810> new<00:07:40.470> heights<00:07:40.680> he<00:07:41.460> sure
