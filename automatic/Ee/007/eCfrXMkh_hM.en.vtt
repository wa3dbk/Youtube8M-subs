00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.630
 welcome my name is eduardo and in 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.450
 I will teach you this opportunity to 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.210
 make a pionono to make a 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.800
 pionono what we are going to need are 4 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:22.970
 eggs 60 grams of flour 60 grams of 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.369
 sugar a pinch of salt honey and essence 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.899
 of vanilla to flavor to begin 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.079
 to make our pionono what we are going 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.149
 to do is beat the eggs without sugar to 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.250
 room temperature when the eggs 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.800
 have vanished what we are going to do is 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.570
 put the sugar in the form of rain 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.190
 once we have incorporated the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.920
 sugar what we are going to incorporate also 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.199
 it's honey, honey is not just going to 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.840
 bring color to our pionono but 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.340
 also what he is going to do is that this 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.920
 pawn or not have enough moisture 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.199
 so that we can then be able to 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.820
 roll it with our stuffing and 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.390
 we keep beating until we get our 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.390
 point letter 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.129
 satiety 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.700
 very well once we achieve our 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.800
 point letter is that memory in which 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.260
 we raise the preparation and 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.960
 we can make a drawing about our 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.760
 shake there we stop and what we're going 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.310
 to incorporate now are going to be the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.869
 dry ingredients we had flour to the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.150
 which I will add a pinch of salt 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.700
 this will make it best enhances the 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.420
 flavors and the smoothie I'm going to add a 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.140
 vanilla essence trickle 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.600
 we always mix with movements 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.040
 envelopes always the light shakes 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.170
 like this type like the sponge cake 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.789
 as a genoa we are always going to incorporate 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.729
 the ingredients in enveloping form 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.369
 so as not to lose our air we are going to 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.619
 sift the dry ingredient together with the 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.720
 come out if you are preparing this 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.420
 they would like to make chocolate what they are going 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.600
 to do is replace a 20 percent 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.450
 of the flour for bitter cocoa 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.980
 we incorporate the dry ingredients in 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.950
 wrap around until you see what 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.280
 the flour has been integrated in a 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.750
 couple we do not find lumps always 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.600
 take the precaution of mixing 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.670
 from the bottom up because it is usually 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.700
 usually decant the flour for being more 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.110
 heavy if they do not have that care they're going to 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.120
 find with lumps of flour then 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.400
 when they are going to dump this preparation 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.620
 its mold once we have our 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.900
 beaten we will put in the mold 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.860
 I have prepared a plate with paper 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.360
 butter greased and floured this is 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.070
 important so that our hair does not 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.800
 we can easily take off 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.640
 let's go placing our shake and 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.560
 once we have all the smoothie 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.860
 what we are going to do is extend it with 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.800
 the help of a metal spatula 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.050
 and we 're going to take it to an oven 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.270
 of 200 degrees because we need a 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.790
 strong oven because this cake is 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.460
 you have to cook fast in about 10 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.200
 minutes 8 minutes barely gilds the 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.420
 surface of this cake there what 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.250
 we remove it has to be a cooking 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.810
 quick so that I get wet 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.070
 inside if we do it in a cooking 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.590
 slow what's going to happen is that it's going to 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.300
 dry and we will have a cookie 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.270
 they will let cool and if they want it 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.400
 disassemble to fill what they are going to 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.560
 to do is remove the butter paper that 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.780
 it comes out very easily but if they want it 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.640
 preserve well and use them later what 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.830
 what they can do is keep it with their 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.290
 Butter paper with which it was cooked 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.300
 can roll up and in this way what 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.280
 they can place you can place paper 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.590
 film or inside a bag and so have it 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.050
 in the refrigerator until the moment of 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.180
 use I hope you have been 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.480
 utility this recipe and see you in a 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.480
 next 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.010
 i
