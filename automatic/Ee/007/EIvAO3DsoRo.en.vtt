gundam<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.460> reason<00:00:08.760> i<00:00:08.820> chose<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:09.360> review

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
gundam and the reason i chose to review

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.060 
gundam and the reason i chose to review
this<00:00:09.840> particular<00:00:10.260> interframe<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.769> because<00:00:11.040> of

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
this particular interframe is because of

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.129 
this particular interframe is because of
the<00:00:11.280> unique<00:00:11.460> color<00:00:11.730> scheme<00:00:12.059> as<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.840> can<00:00:12.929> see

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the unique color scheme as you can see

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.200 
the unique color scheme as you can see
the<00:00:13.290> inter-frame<00:00:13.559> plastic<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> shiny<00:00:14.790> gold

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
the inter-frame plastic is a shiny gold

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.320 
the inter-frame plastic is a shiny gold
plastic<00:00:18.289> and<00:00:19.580> the<00:00:20.580> fact<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.090> shiny

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
plastic and the fact that it's shiny

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.150 
plastic and the fact that it's shiny
really<00:00:21.600> brings<00:00:21.900> out<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.109> lot<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.470> details<00:00:22.859> in

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
really brings out a lot of details in

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.300 
really brings out a lot of details in
the<00:00:23.400> plastic<00:00:23.910> molding<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.250> there's<00:00:26.250> even

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
the plastic molding and there's even

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.339 
the plastic molding and there's even
plastic<00:00:26.730> gold<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.920> bottom<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> feet

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
plastic gold on the bottom of the feet

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.330 
plastic gold on the bottom of the feet
so<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.500> I'll<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.710> break<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.070> review

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
so what I'll do is break this review

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.530 
so what I'll do is break this review
down<00:00:32.520> into<00:00:32.730> sections<00:00:32.940> showing<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
down into sections showing you the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.180 
down into sections showing you the
various<00:00:33.840> features<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.500> inner<00:00:34.680> frame<00:00:34.920> of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
various features of the inner frame of

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.920 
various features of the inner frame of
the<00:00:35.760> masquerade<00:00:36.239> strike<00:00:36.510> freedom<00:00:36.690> gundam

the masquerade strike freedom gundam

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.709 
the masquerade strike freedom gundam
here<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> unobstructed<00:00:38.910> view<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
here we have a unobstructed view of the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.790 
here we have a unobstructed view of the
cockpit<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.710> pilot<00:00:42.590> looking<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
cockpit with the pilot looking at the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560 
cockpit with the pilot looking at the
joint<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.129> attaches<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.700> torso<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
joint that attaches the torso to the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
joint that attaches the torso to the
shoulder<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.500> joint<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.980> move<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.309> like

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
shoulder the joint can move out like

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.549 
shoulder the joint can move out like
this<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:49.620> joint<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.520> move<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.300> down

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
this and the joint can move up and down

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.680 
this and the joint can move up and down
now<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.890> joints<00:00:53.399> were<00:00:53.520> particularly<00:00:54.420> hard

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
now these joints were particularly hard

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.130 
now these joints were particularly hard
to<00:00:55.079> put<00:00:55.410> together<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.980> had<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> use<00:00:56.930> quite<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.989> bit

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
to put together I had to use quite a bit

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.229 
to put together I had to use quite a bit
of<00:00:58.230> force<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.800> them<00:00:58.920> together<00:00:59.090> which<00:01:00.090> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
of force to get them together which I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
of force to get them together which I
suppose<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> long<00:01:01.170> run<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.530> good<00:01:01.739> because

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
suppose in the long run is good because

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
suppose in the long run is good because
you<00:01:02.399> want<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.760> stiff<00:01:03.210> joint<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
you want to have a stiff joint so that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.200 
you want to have a stiff joint so that
you<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.769> pose<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.159> figure<00:01:05.430> however<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.090> want

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you can pose as figure however you want

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.929 
you can pose as figure however you want
to<00:01:06.860> here<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.340> see<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> joint<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.880> allows

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
to here we can see a joint that allows

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.660 
to here we can see a joint that allows
articulation<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.290> ab<00:01:10.500> section<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.460> this

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
articulation for the ab section of this

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.630 
articulation for the ab section of this
particular<00:01:12.150> model<00:01:12.330> kit<00:01:14.150> it<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.930> rather<00:01:16.259> stiff

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
particular model kit it is rather stiff

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.740 
particular model kit it is rather stiff
but<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> once<00:01:17.939> again<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.240> think<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.659> will

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
but it once again I think that will

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.899 
but it once again I think that will
allow<00:01:19.049> some<00:01:19.409> more<00:01:19.650> stability<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> figure

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
allow some more stability for the figure

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.890 
allow some more stability for the figure
as<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.750> pose<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> looking<00:01:24.450> at<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> waist

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
as you pose it so looking at the waist

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.020 
as you pose it so looking at the waist
section<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.310> see<00:01:26.430> there<00:01:26.610> actually

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
section you actually see there actually

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.140 
section you actually see there actually
is<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.360> recessed<00:01:28.110> area<00:01:28.439> here<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
is a recessed area here and here for the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330 
is a recessed area here and here for the
ball<00:01:30.540> joints<00:01:30.930> which<00:01:31.079> attach<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.890> cannons

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
ball joints which attach to the cannons

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.370 
ball joints which attach to the cannons
now<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.329> happen<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> figure<00:01:34.229> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
now what can happen with the figure is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.539 
now what can happen with the figure is
you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:34.619> move<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> cannons<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you can actually move the cannons to the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.999 
you can actually move the cannons to the
back<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.030> having<00:01:36.810> these<00:01:37.079> two<00:01:37.290> joints<00:01:37.710> here

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
back and having these two joints here

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.670 
back and having these two joints here
allows<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.700> capability<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> simply

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
allows that capability so you simply

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.120 
allows that capability so you simply
move<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.240> back<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
move this back like that and then you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.580 
move this back like that and then you
would<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.670> canon<00:01:45.030> stored<00:01:45.509> towards<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
would have the canon stored towards the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.300 
would have the canon stored towards the
back<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> kit<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.990> here's<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.680> look<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
back of the kit and here's a look at the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.300 
back of the kit and here's a look at the
inner<00:01:50.460> frame<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.390> hip<00:01:51.720> /<00:01:52.170> leg<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:53.189> can

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
inner frame for the hip / leg you can

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.950 
inner frame for the hip / leg you can
see<00:01:53.549> here<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:53.970> take<00:01:54.090> off<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.509> lower<00:01:54.689> part

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
see here if we take off the lower part

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.249 
see here if we take off the lower part
of<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> leg<00:01:55.259> how<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.159> joint<00:01:56.430> goes<00:01:56.610> together

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
of the leg how the joint goes together

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
pelvic area if you take a look at this

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.729 
pelvic area if you take a look at this
section<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.330> leg<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.440> bend<00:02:10.649> the

section of the leg here if you bend the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.339 
section of the leg here if you bend the
knee<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.150> how<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.569> moves<00:02:13.020> like

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
knee you can see how that moves like

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.030 
knee you can see how that moves like
that<00:02:13.379> which

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
that which

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.869 
that which
is<00:02:14.129> really<00:02:14.280> cool<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:16.189> the<00:02:17.189> new<00:02:17.310> section<00:02:17.700> there

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
is really cool in the new section there

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.429 
is really cool in the new section there
is<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.120> piece<00:02:18.359> here<00:02:18.629> that<00:02:18.689> moves<00:02:19.140> up<00:02:19.319> and

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
is this piece here that moves up and

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.559 
is this piece here that moves up and
down<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:23.060> here's<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.209> joint<00:02:24.450> without

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
down like this here's the joint without

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.240 
down like this here's the joint without
the<00:02:24.900> armor<00:02:25.049> here's<00:02:25.469> the<00:02:25.650> joint<00:02:25.859> with<00:02:26.069> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
the armor here's the joint with the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.369 
the armor here's the joint with the
armor<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.239> see<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.750> piece<00:02:28.019> allows

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
armor and you can see this piece allows

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.740 
armor and you can see this piece allows
the<00:02:28.590> armor<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:30.060> actually<00:02:30.920> move<00:02:31.920> back<00:02:32.250> and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
the armor to actually move back and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.179 
the armor to actually move back and
forth<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.470> there's<00:02:34.590> actually<00:02:34.950> a

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
forth like that and there's actually a

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.869 
forth like that and there's actually a
separation<00:02:36.120> there<00:02:36.599> as<00:02:36.810> well<00:02:37.019> so<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.700> very

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
separation there as well so it's a very

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.920 
separation there as well so it's a very
nice<00:02:39.060> detail<00:02:39.599> of<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.530> inner<00:02:40.650> frame<00:02:41.239> as<00:02:42.239> you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
nice detail of the inner frame as you

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.199 
nice detail of the inner frame as you
can<00:02:43.079> see<00:02:43.230> here<00:02:43.469> the<00:02:44.099> actual<00:02:44.459> Paula<00:02:44.700> caps<00:02:44.969> are

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209
