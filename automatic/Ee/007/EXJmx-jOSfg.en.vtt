00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
okay what I'm about to harvest some

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.230 
okay what I'm about to harvest some
worms<00:00:11.840> here<00:00:12.139> I<00:00:12.230> got<00:00:12.350> about<00:00:12.440> three<00:00:12.650> buckets<00:00:13.240> but

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
worms here I got about three buckets but

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.189 
worms here I got about three buckets but
what<00:00:14.389> I<00:00:14.420> did<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:15.709> the<00:00:15.940> harvester<00:00:16.990> since<00:00:17.990> my

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
what I did to the harvester since my

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.980 
what I did to the harvester since my
last<00:00:18.410> video<00:00:18.770> I<00:00:19.160> had<00:00:20.029> to<00:00:20.150> raise<00:00:20.420> it<00:00:20.660> up<00:00:20.750> in<00:00:20.900> the

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
last video I had to raise it up in the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.759 
last video I had to raise it up in the
front<00:00:21.320> here

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
front here

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.529 
front here
to<00:00:22.070> get<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.369> angle<00:00:22.990> right<00:00:23.990> on<00:00:24.259> the<00:00:25.359> on<00:00:26.359> the

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
to get the angle right on the on the

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.999 
to get the angle right on the on the
sifter<00:00:26.990> here<00:00:29.140> because<00:00:30.140> what<00:00:30.380> was<00:00:30.499> happening

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
sifter here because what was happening

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.430 
sifter here because what was happening
was<00:00:31.480> everything<00:00:32.480> was<00:00:32.540> good<00:00:32.750> flowing<00:00:33.079> down<00:00:33.230> too

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
was everything was good flowing down too

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.330 
was everything was good flowing down too
fast<00:00:34.270> so<00:00:35.270> by<00:00:35.540> raising<00:00:35.720> it<00:00:36.110> up<00:00:36.230> I<00:00:36.560> lifted<00:00:37.220> the

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
fast so by raising it up I lifted the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.730 
fast so by raising it up I lifted the
angle<00:00:37.670> up<00:00:37.820> or<00:00:38.540> less<00:00:38.780> than<00:00:38.990> the<00:00:39.110> angle<00:00:39.440> I<00:00:39.530> should

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
angle up or less than the angle I should

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.000 
angle up or less than the angle I should
say<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.900> now<00:00:41.900> it's<00:00:42.080> flowing<00:00:42.320> a<00:00:42.470> little<00:00:42.680> easier

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
say and now it's flowing a little easier

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.470 
say and now it's flowing a little easier
it<00:00:43.580> still<00:00:43.880> moves<00:00:44.120> down<00:00:44.360> pretty<00:00:44.630> quick<00:00:44.960> my

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
it still moves down pretty quick my

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.960 
it still moves down pretty quick my
bedding<00:00:47.480> is<00:00:47.600> still<00:00:47.810> wet<00:00:48.110> or<00:00:48.410> moist<00:00:49.280> very<00:00:49.700> moist

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
bedding is still wet or moist very moist

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.170 
bedding is still wet or moist very moist
I<00:00:50.180> should<00:00:50.360> say<00:00:50.860> but<00:00:51.860> in<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.640> minute<00:00:52.910> here<00:00:53.060> I'll

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
I should say but in a minute here I'll

00:00:53.180 --> 00:04:17.349 
I should say but in a minute here I'll
show<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:53.450> how<00:00:54.410> it<00:00:54.620> works

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.979 

well<00:04:18.359> anyways<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:19.139> just<00:04:19.680> got<00:04:20.100> done<00:04:20.840> what<00:04:21.840> I've

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
well anyways I just got done what I've

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.520 
well anyways I just got done what I've
noticed<00:04:22.229> is<00:04:23.300> well<00:04:24.300> first<00:04:24.510> of<00:04:24.660> all<00:04:24.750> my<00:04:24.930> castings

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
noticed is well first of all my castings

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.920 
noticed is well first of all my castings
were<00:04:25.860> my<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.930> bedding<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:29.160> warm<00:04:29.370> bedding<00:04:29.930> was

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
were my the bedding the warm bedding was

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.490 
were my the bedding the warm bedding was
a<00:04:30.990> little<00:04:31.440> moist<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.979> little<00:04:32.220> too<00:04:32.370> moist<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:33.500> it

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
a little moist a little too moist and it

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.760 
a little moist a little too moist and it
wanted<00:04:34.770> to<00:04:34.889> flow<00:04:35.160> down<00:04:35.400> real<00:04:35.699> quick<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:37.500> it

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
wanted to flow down real quick and it

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.610 
wanted to flow down real quick and it
was<00:04:37.860> sticking<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.490> screen<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.620> mean

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
was sticking to the screen so I mean

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.960 
was sticking to the screen so I mean
this<00:04:40.770> I<00:04:40.919> had<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.160> keep<00:04:41.310> pushing<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:41.760> back<00:04:41.940> and

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
this I had to keep pushing it back and

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.830 
this I had to keep pushing it back and
pushing<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.570> back<00:04:43.130> if<00:04:44.130> if<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.850> was<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.030> dryer<00:04:45.449> it

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
pushing it back if if it was a dryer it

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.659 
pushing it back if if it was a dryer it
would've<00:04:46.020> worked<00:04:46.169> much<00:04:46.410> better<00:04:46.490> but<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.580> know

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
would've worked much better but you know

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.850 
would've worked much better but you know
what<00:04:47.850> overall<00:04:48.270> I'm<00:04:48.479> happy<00:04:49.050> with<00:04:49.560> it<00:04:49.850> I<00:04:51.860> just

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
what overall I'm happy with it I just

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.750 
what overall I'm happy with it I just
did<00:04:52.979> I<00:04:53.100> had<00:04:53.220> three<00:04:53.460> buckets<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:55.699> don't<00:04:56.699> know

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
did I had three buckets and I don't know

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.110 
did I had three buckets and I don't know
I<00:04:56.789> guess<00:04:57.060> they<00:04:57.270> were<00:04:57.419> not<00:04:57.990> quite<00:04:58.440> ready<00:04:58.770> yet

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
I guess they were not quite ready yet

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.840 
I guess they were not quite ready yet
but<00:05:00.120> good<00:05:00.840> enough<00:05:01.110> for<00:05:01.560> my<00:05:01.979> first<00:05:02.250> time<00:05:02.490> here

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
but good enough for my first time here

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.480 
but good enough for my first time here
doing<00:05:03.449> it<00:05:03.600> anyways<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.560> got<00:05:05.070> this<00:05:05.280> much

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
doing it anyways I got this much

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.140 
doing it anyways I got this much
castings<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:07.550> don't<00:05:08.550> know<00:05:08.610> how<00:05:08.699> much<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:08.970> weighs

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
castings I don't know how much it weighs

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.029 
castings I don't know how much it weighs
penny<00:05:09.600> probably<00:05:10.199> 3040<00:05:10.710> pounds<00:05:10.949> maybe<00:05:13.039> of

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
penny probably 3040 pounds maybe of

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.010 
penny probably 3040 pounds maybe of
course<00:05:14.100> it's<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.520> little<00:05:14.729> wet<00:05:14.910> yet<00:05:15.120> so<00:05:15.449> a<00:05:15.690> little

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
course it's a little wet yet so a little

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.200 
course it's a little wet yet so a little
lighten<00:05:16.320> up<00:05:16.470> once<00:05:16.680> it<00:05:16.800> dries<00:05:17.039> but<00:05:17.820> anyway<00:05:18.060> this

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
lighten up once it dries but anyway this

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.060 
lighten up once it dries but anyway this
is<00:05:18.270> going<00:05:18.539> to<00:05:18.600> my<00:05:18.720> garden<00:05:19.139> just<00:05:19.830> probably

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
is going to my garden just probably

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.610 
is going to my garden just probably
itty-bitty<00:05:20.760> worms<00:05:21.030> in<00:05:21.330> here<00:05:21.539> too<00:05:21.840> it<00:05:22.380> probably

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
itty-bitty worms in here too it probably

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.980 
itty-bitty worms in here too it probably
fell<00:05:22.919> through<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.520> maybe<00:05:23.880> occasional<00:05:24.630> cocoon

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
fell through and maybe occasional cocoon

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.230 
fell through and maybe occasional cocoon
but<00:05:25.860> that's<00:05:26.010> okay<00:05:26.340> it'll<00:05:26.490> feed<00:05:26.699> my<00:05:26.880> garden

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
but that's okay it'll feed my garden

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.629 
but that's okay it'll feed my garden
better<00:05:27.449> and<00:05:27.750> these<00:05:28.710> two<00:05:28.889> buckets<00:05:29.310> were<00:05:31.639> very

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
better and these two buckets were very

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.400 
better and these two buckets were very
little<00:05:32.910> worms<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:35.430> cocoons<00:05:35.789> I<00:05:36.150> got<00:05:37.080> and<00:05:37.320> I

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
little worms and cocoons I got and I

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.330 
little worms and cocoons I got and I
filled<00:05:37.680> these<00:05:37.770> two<00:05:37.919> buckets<00:05:38.280> up<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:39.590> I<00:05:40.590> want

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
filled these two buckets up and I want

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.230 
filled these two buckets up and I want
to<00:05:41.400> let<00:05:41.550> these<00:05:41.699> mature<00:05:42.030> let<00:05:42.599> them<00:05:42.780> grow<00:05:44.240> till

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
to let these mature let them grow till

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.540 
to let these mature let them grow till
they<00:05:45.300> get<00:05:45.419> to<00:05:45.570> an<00:05:45.660> adult<00:05:46.169> size<00:05:46.470> but<00:05:47.250> anyways

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
overall it worked pretty good for

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.270
