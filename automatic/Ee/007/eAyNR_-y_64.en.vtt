00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.360
 the days of killing innocent companions 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.740
 finally they have finished hey you put the 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.120
 pick szeged and welcome back to 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.370
 channel on this that a video of 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.810
 a new function of banfield 4 called 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.369
 campus of tests in which you 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.580
 You can drive from something very simple 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.050
 like a jeep to drive fighter planes 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.869
 attack aircraft 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.939
 good stealth fighters attack houses in 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.619
 bounce everything you can think of even 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.450
 they have a shooting range in the images 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.890
 they are going to see some things about the jets 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.870
 especially jet fighters and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.430
 helicopters so it's serious if it's 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.079
 what is serious but if it provides 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.519
 do practically everything even them 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.309
 mark to attack that does not attack 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.079
 infantry vehicles or what are they 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.059
 happen there is the map for you 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.710
 can practice to me it seems perfect 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.329
 this new option that they added for the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.309
 simple fact that now you do not have to 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.660
 be jumping into the multiplayer and kill 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.339
 your classmates taking them against a 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.230
 building or something similar so that 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.820
 Learn to fly the right way 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.100
 You can experience doing what 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.739
 want even if it's something so simple 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.140
 like for example shoot a weapon up 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.059
 more massive things like making a nose 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.590
 some pirouette with a helicopter or something 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.690
 similar to access this function 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.070
 is in using the multiplayer of 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.060
 battlefield go to the option 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.220
 correspondent 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.009
 in console to the multiplayer tab 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.960
 and in what would be pc especially in value 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.360
 you can go directly from the tab 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.009
 drop down multiplayer also that 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.869
 take advantage of the video to make some 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.909
 details that I saw for example the new 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.240
 camera of the jets follows rather what 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.979
 you and this one would be watching from the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.259
 perspective of the jet is to say if you 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.539
 You put on your head you will not see a plane 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.460
 head and nothing else and while everything 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.920
 others it looks right do not turn around with 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.780
 everything and the plane the effects of the field of 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.729
 vision seems to be quite improved me 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.799
 very much liked that of 9 in the raid of 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.049
 this visual field also the 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.899
 more agile helicopters somehow 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.880
 the way of aiming is easier no longer 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.860
 you have to be calculating half 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.569
 between the two sights those who have 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.580
 some some helicopter piloted 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.649
 recognition will know what I mean and 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.869
 if not that now you have a single point that 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.939
 determines on the screen where you are going to 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.740
 shoot also a little bit of the dynamics 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.509
 of the waves that are interactive 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.880
 they block the damage of the bullets a little 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.640
 other vehicles here we can see more 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.900
 forward the use of the boats and also 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.940
 I would like to talk about the channel because 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.630
 good is a new stage will begin a 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.990
 new game 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.820
 to 24 days we go from 3 to 4 is a great 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.550
 I jump and all those who know me 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.800
 vain will know what to expect from you 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.130
 there are reviews of the vehicles even 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.200
 they subscribed much much earlier but 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.530
 if they are here and subscribe 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.180
 wait for vehicles and weapons that's for sure 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.770
 although I have some small ones in mind 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.080
 projects that could be of great 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.030
 utility so do not tell anymore go in 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.590
 this field of practice and improve and 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.330
 improve and improve so that they reach 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.980
 multiplayer and can split back 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.100
 please a rating and if they are 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.450
 new here consider subscribe 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.280
 watching the other videos that are in the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.690
 channel to convince the networks 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.100
 social if they want to follow me 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.660
 I highly recommend it they are in the 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.770
 description and some videos that have not 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.760
 seen in the next screen 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.360
 interactive we'll see you in the next 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.360
 all right
