 wolfgang and has his workshop near 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.269
 Munich has made his profession his profession 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.720
 and is dedicated to repair especially gold 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.450
 a vehicle that in the 80s wrote 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.279
 history of the automobile and the cinema and is 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.279
 today a model of worship 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.680
 the first thing that draws attention in the 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.860
 Delorean is the steel body 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.620
 stainless brushed steel without paint 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.710
 because it is not necessary the design is of 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.430
 giugiaro and such a design that created him 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.910
 late 70's another attraction are 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.830
 the doors of seagull wings 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.110
 relatively large and heavy by the 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.019
 many components that also carry 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.489
 It has centralized locking and power windows 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:00.470
 electric central phenyl a traveler 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.720
 electrointensive the car was very 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.840
 comfortable for those times came 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.970
 with air conditioning leather seats 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.700
 steering wheel also covered with leather a 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.440
 very good equipment interface 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.430
 landings 11 cut 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.430
 those who are here same 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.990
 because he had rejected an assignment 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.240
 development for delorean why is 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.030
 based on the esprit lotus chassis 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.799
 then the engine is a six cylinder 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.820
 of weight series 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.820
 reindeer and volvo 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.510
 this is v6 engine the developed rb6 and 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.270
 built by dogs reindeer and volvo but 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:51.400
 this variant was not mounted on any other 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.350
 Author of those manufacturers conceived 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.290
 originally as sporty with motor 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.690
 central the size and weight of the best 6 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.680
 they finally made the engine have 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.680
 to be mounted back 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.709
 the delorean has because of the engine 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.660
 back a bias of its own but both in 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.450
 straight as in curves behaves 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.599
 neutral mind is a joy to drive it 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.660
 fast on the road the b 6 has a 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:23.519
 132 horsepower speed 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.930
 maximum about 200 kilometers per hour 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.239
 back, the big ones are striking 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.790
 bumpers are German manufactured by 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.849
 phoenix in hamburg also the two 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.290
 upper decks are German from the 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.980
 parrot company in augsburg are 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.469
 frontmen in the cars because 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.079
 at the end of the 70s at the beginning of 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.750
 the 1980s it was not yet common to integrate 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.090
 bumper on the body 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.189
 delorean took it to practice very very 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.540
 well these are the original tires 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:03.280
 typical delorean an outfit and lorient 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.739
 this little window originally 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.840
 It was sliding but they did not like the 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.750
 builders and it finally transformed 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.250
 in a small window a double that 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.170
 it is operated electrically 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.120
 in short a lot of glass the interior is 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.340
 Warms up quickly without air 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.940
 conditioning would be very hot in the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.000
 car 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.480
 the delorean car becomes famous for the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.240
 film trilogy back to the future screenplay 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.730

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.620
 motors opens the factory in ireland where 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.270
 receives a support of 100 million 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.270
 sterling government 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.840
 also sammy davis junior and johnny 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.000
 carson invest however due to the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.780
 crisis in the automotive sector 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.810
 company is in 1980 on the verge of closure 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:58.310

 total 3 golden deloreans 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.940
 I have in the dorado was an idea of 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.160
 delorean and american express was planned 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.930
 build 100 gold cars but 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.709
 they actually came to be manufactured 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.420
 only three the third was the last of 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.750
 lorean that came out of the line of 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:30.040
 production was manufactured for the receiver 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.400
 charged with liquidating the company at the 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.640
 1982 he bought for himself and it 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.640
 I wear 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.490
 wolfgang is the specialist in delorean 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:45.410
 throughout Europe your customers come from 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.480
 near and far

 getting spare parts is easy you can 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.620
 buy new or used 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.260
 - the left front fender 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.240
 after closing the factory the 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.110
 tools to make it were 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.540
 destroyed the car has many parts 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.210
 standard engine and gearbox 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.940
 are reindeer the injection the electronics 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.580
 and the voice ignition the components 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.510
 lucas and bosch electric 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.910

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:29.080
 of 5 changes or automatic of 3 driving 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.300
 a lorean is not complicated there is 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.670
 observe the law of physics and have 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.360
 care on wet asphalt by the 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.360
 rear engine 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.800
 for the rest, it behaves like any 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:45.330
 another car that is not spectacular by 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:50.300
 the series components used 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:54.030
 but this delorean if it's something special 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.039
 is a lorean of the first series the 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:01.409
 first series still has the
