00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.920
 when the leaves dough good formula 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.569
 by taking a piece of dough and

 squeezing it with fingers and 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.830
 not apart stock then you have the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.660
 Achieved correct consistency and if 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.670
