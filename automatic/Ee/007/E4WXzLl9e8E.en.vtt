00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.320
 Hi all guys and well found on AndroidMod, after weeks of development are finally 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.070
 available the first nightly of the CyanogenMod 12.1 based on the latest release of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.320
 Android or 5.1 Lollipop. Currently officially supported devices 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.860
 not many, about twenty, but with time they will increase and, in addition, on many 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.030
 devices you can still mount it now in an unofficial version. 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.000
 Let's see how it gets after the intro! 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.100
 Well, as already mentioned CyanogenMod 12.1 with Android Lollipop so let's start with the settings. 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 In addition to the classic ones, various items have been added such as Themes, which is the new Theme 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.679
 Chooser characterized by Material Design and updated packages, Notification Management 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.460
 to check the alerts and buttons that allow you to change the navigation bar e 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.370
 the actions to be associated with the power button and volume rocker. 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.750
 As for customization, we find Home Page that allows you to choose 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.910
 the interface (and as you can see the default launcher is the Trebuchet, which I'll show you later 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.360
 in detail), System profiles to automate some actions, Status bar to set 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.780
 clock, battery icon, brightness control and statusbar notification counter 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.210
 and notification menus for the secondary drop-down menu that can be activated with a swipe from 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.710
 top right and which, if we want, will show the expandable weather. 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 Secondary drop-down menu with the editable and re-orderable tiles that presents the features 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.820
 and the really nice Android 5.1 animations. 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.670
 Finally there are still two additions, that is, always on Personal, the classic Privacy entry 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.490
 by CyanogenMod, and on System, the Performance section: here we can activate the profiles for the apps 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.420
 and change the Scheduler. It is not possible to operate on the CPU and Governor but such 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.550
 changes can be made with different applications found on the Play Store. 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.650
 In addition, within the classic voices, there are many small additions, for example 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.030
 on Suoni the incremental ringer has been inserted, in Display &amp; Lights the have been implemented 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.670
 LiveDisplay (to adjust the screen according to the time of day) and double-tap 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.260
 to suspend the device and on Battery a mode that allows us to choose 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.530
 between a use focused on energy saving, one balanced or the last that points everything 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.700
 on performance. 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.560
 For the rest, settings that are the classic Android Lollipop settings with, of course, 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.590
 all the new features, starting from the heads-up notifications, continuing with energy savings 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.420
 which can be activated automatically when the battery is at 15 or 5%, the multi-user 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.400
 that before was a feature reserved for tablets and, finally, in Security, the lock on screen. 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.430
 The latter allows to block the device on a specific application, for example 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.150
 in case you need to lend the phone to someone who has to make a call. 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.790
 Settings that are therefore already more than complete and all fully functional. 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.540
 Now let's move on to see the Trebuchet, which has no major changes compared to the past 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.099
 versions, but above all the apps. The launcher, as just mentioned, was not 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.160
 modified and holding for a long time on any empty spot on the screen, we will be able to 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.319
 open additional options. In addition to those for backgrounds (which have some additions 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.270
 in Material style), widgets and settings, with an upward swipe we can activate 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.270
 the menu with customizations: here we can enable or not the search bar, set 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.989
 a scroll effect, choose whether to show application names, enable scrolling 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.030
 of the wallpaper and resize the grid, the same thing we can do for the drawer 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.520
 of the apps and, the latter, we can make them bigger or protect them with a code. 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.590
 Big news instead for applications that, despite being almost the same 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.300
 of the previous versions, they have all been updated according to the new guidelines of the 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.920
 Material Design. We find Audio FX that allows you to control 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.230
 the sound customizing it as we prefer and with many options, the stock browser, 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.069
 cClock which is no longer just a setting but, indeed, a real app through 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.610
 which we can control the widget with clock, weather and calendar, the file manager 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.459
 which, with the completely renewed graphics, has improved considerably, the Messages, Music 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.590
 or a media player and the Radio, the Sound Recorder, SuperSU and Themes that 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.240
 I have already shown you before. 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.940
 Now let's see the camera that is the new one from Google with, in addition to the classic options, 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.870
 three advanced settings for manual exposure, the shots with the On / Off button and 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.100
 the bright screen. Let's try to take some pictures. 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:44.100
 Let's do it without the flash ... And how you see the focusing speed 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.370
 and shooting is more than good. Despite the Moto G camera, phone 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.600
 with which I am carrying out the review, it is not the most exciting, the results 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.960
 obtained are clear and well defined therefore all excellent. 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.110
 Also with regards to the video part it works well and has no bugs. 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.180
 Ok, let's close a few applications (and as you can see there is a button for the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.280
 multiple closure) and move on to the final considerations. 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.880
 As for energy management, it is really good: I have always arrived 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.930
 at the end of the day with a decidedly intense use and, at least, 4/5 hours of screen. 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.190
 If the Moto G already did well with Lollipop 5.0 stock, with the 5.1 version it became 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.410
 really perfect. When the use is not intense I can even cover two 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.960
 full days. Moreover, stability is fantastic and for 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.770
 As for fluidity, you can see for yourself that it is perfect. Never a lag and never 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.979
 an imposition even with several open applications. 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.490
 So all I can do is advise you to try this CyanogenMod 12.1, promising you 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.270
 which will soon receive reviews of other ROMs still based on Lollipop and more 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.419
 more complete. 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.540
 Perfect, I have nothing else to add, except that the download links for the ROM 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.800
 and the Gapps can be found in the description, so this is all for today. 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.509
