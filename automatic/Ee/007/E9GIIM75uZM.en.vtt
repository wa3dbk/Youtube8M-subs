00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.869
 hello guys today I bring you a new video 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:14.529
 and good I bring you the review of the 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:16.150
 snapshot 14 w 03 b 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.690
 ok they have already removed version b and 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.930
 true 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.760
 first of all tell you that good more than 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.710
 nothing one is a super epic option for 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.450
 me the best is , had seen nothing 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.790
 better since I play minecraft in 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.220
 seriously you will see now what it brings 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.750
 well it will be very epic now you will see but 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.210
 well first of all I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.680
 I already buy the premium and good nothing else 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.390
 more than anything to say thank you all 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.860
 because I can buy it thanks to 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.370
 you for following me day by day in 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.850
 youtube and good as he called me to see 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.269
 well my name is extra jams and it's worth how 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.339
 you see and well I have this corner and Ã¡lex 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.720
 a suv is making me a corner in 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.800
 the same but with a block command in 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.530
 the head is worth that you have asked me 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.620
 several and I liked the good idea 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.030
 we go with the good commands not before you 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.370
 I will explain a little what is the other 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.620
 but what are not commands but good 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.650
 this is not going to get me much inside 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.480
 why not 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.950
 are much more important to the 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.850
 field commands this is worth to start 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.490
 I will say that the potato before healed 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.470
 55 of hungry now heals 4 the carrot 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.850
 3 instead of curing curing two or four 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.550
 three or one less the carrot 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.130
 also now if the villagers give them a 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.930
 lightning turn into witches just like 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.250
 the pigs in zombie pigment for now 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.990
 the villagers and what else if below the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.860
 villages are going to put a rock layer of 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.560
 eating this is not worth to avoid how 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.570
 call to avoid them good that it joins in 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.790
 caves and rabbin are generated badly on top of 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.530
 villages and such odd things are worth they put 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.600
 the coat of koleston I do not know well why 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.190
 but they place it to avoid these 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.820
 problems 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.380
 Also, what else do we have that you think about and 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.440
 now good if you feed the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.390
 tiny animals will take less in 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.940
 grow up I do not know if this was already I do not know 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.180
 well as it has happened but and well and for 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.070
 last we would have what would be 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.350
 that the kilns when the coal is finished 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.540
 the progress that comes from 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.860
 cook something before I did now 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.630
 not stuck and it is night 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.370
 it's more coal is not going to continue but it 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.860
 is where it was worth something else 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.600
 important good have already suppressed 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.650
 numerical ideas forever thing that a 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.900
 I did not like it because now 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.760
 write mini craft two points good the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.310
 ideas are now are the honest ones 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.810
 they are mini craft two points and the block and 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.840
 well let's go with the interesting thing 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.280
 let's leave this aside and we have 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.900
 here bar field is worth the field bar 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.380
 what is it good for many of you will know the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.470
 mods these of wall edit and this is that you 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.270
 you are placed you can generate constructions 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.739
 huge just by taking two coordinates 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.070
 well look what we can do 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.560
 you see and we can take it off how 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.060
 this command works is a film worth 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.560
 it means to say I do not know I do not know what 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.920
 it means but I think it's good more or 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.230
 minus this and the coordinates number one 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.239
 it's worth thinking that it 's the 2d you have to 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.760
 place as if it were with the ax of 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.540
 wall edit a coordinate and another by 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.310
 example these are worth and there is forgiveness and good 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.660
 you have to place the coordinates of the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.150
 point 1 and 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.210
 point 2 here we can specify the 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.180
 kind of idea then we can make huge 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.190
 huge things and then place here 0 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.810
 replay a kit 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.670
 man then good you see that 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.750
 it's from here because it would be absolutely what 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.580
 same but with air to remove it 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.080
 and good to see this is what has most 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.510
 liked the truth is that I loved it 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.370
 something very epic seriously I liked 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.890
 very much now we can build everything 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.530
 what we want without good without necessity 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.850
 to go block by block I do not know and to 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.970
 doing epic things on maps is 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.530
 they can do a lot of things and we're going 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.230
 with the following command and serial bar 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.150
 clone what is this good for? 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.400
 also very epic would be for example for 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.200
 cloning all this building is there that what 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.000
 is testing the declared without cloning 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.709
 the commands and all and so we have a 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.410
 chest with something put inside also 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.280
 clone then well you see the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.810
 construction that then let's explore it 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.410
 a little bit higher so you can see what 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.750
 I'm going to put in 70 voucher and you see that it's 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.840
 so you can not take the text but 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.750
 cloned and you should see clone now 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.700
 upwards 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.280
 well the position go the coordinates and 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.700
 I think we clarified whole not good da 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.260
 same 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.060
 this is to take the coordinates and 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.250
 You see that it is all the same and with the 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.460
 put commands and everything is worth it guys this 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.440
 it's very very important very interesting and 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.870
 very epic or everything together 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.220
 the truth is that very well again very 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.930
 well like the previous one but this time 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.550
 better although the former is , I have been 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.980
 surprised very much I did not expect it 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.540
 this and we go with the last good command 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.820
 it's not so useful but it's also 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.970
 interesting we can expect mobs watching 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.140
 to a certain point or good or you but 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.180
 we also looking at a point 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.890
 determined and look at you I see you and I'm 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.890
 looking there if I change this I that be 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.900
 20 I'll be looking for another site to see 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.760
 what are we not going to change this that would be 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.880
 more effective we are going to put you here 10 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.740
 I was looking for there and that's how 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.370
 changed has changed now we put here 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.810
 100 to see what happened should I go if I 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.430
 you see now it seems commenting for here and 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.870
 well with the mods also 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.330
 could do this we can do mobs 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.800
 rotating already good already investigated 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.750
 about this and if I do this I do a 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.950
 video is worth good guys this is all the 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.780
 very epic snapshot 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.890
 If you have any questions 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.830
 suggestion of videos you already know that 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.330
 you can say and well guys this is all 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.270
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.270
 nothing until another goodbye
