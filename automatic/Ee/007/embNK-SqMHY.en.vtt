00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.499 

so<00:00:04.710> are<00:00:04.830> certain<00:00:05.100> people<00:00:05.279> like<00:00:05.790> Morde<00:00:06.180> risk

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
so are certain people like Morde risk

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.780 
so are certain people like Morde risk
for<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.839> pandemic<00:00:07.200> flu<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.859> think<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:08.730> case

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
for a pandemic flu I think in this case

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.280 
for a pandemic flu I think in this case
people<00:00:09.360> should<00:00:09.540> make<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.870> assumption<00:00:10.139> that

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
people should make the assumption that

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.370 
people should make the assumption that
we're<00:00:10.500> all<00:00:10.679> at<00:00:10.889> risk<00:00:11.210> and<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.540> course<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:13.080> it

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
we're all at risk and of course if it

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.950 
we're all at risk and of course if it
shows<00:00:13.769> up<00:00:13.799> if<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.370> actually<00:00:14.519> get<00:00:15.240> up<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.599> emic

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
shows up if we actually get up and emic

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.560 
shows up if we actually get up and emic
and<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:16.949> actually<00:00:17.160> can<00:00:17.460> track<00:00:17.760> who's<00:00:18.180> getting

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and we actually can track who's getting

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.150 
and we actually can track who's getting
sick<00:00:18.810> we'll<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.050> able<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.230> better<00:00:19.410> target<00:00:19.740> but

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
sick we'll be able to better target but

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.830 
sick we'll be able to better target but
right<00:00:20.340> now<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:21.119> should<00:00:21.150> assume<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.720> we're

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
right now we should assume that we're

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.019 
right now we should assume that we're
all<00:00:21.960> at<00:00:22.109> risk<00:00:22.250> often<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> people<00:00:23.760> who<00:00:23.880> are

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
all at risk often is the people who are

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.849 
all at risk often is the people who are
most<00:00:24.240> active<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> community<00:00:25.140> who<00:00:25.529> are

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
most active in the community who are

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.710 
most active in the community who are
traveling<00:00:26.340> around<00:00:26.640> who<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> be

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
traveling around who going to be

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.570 
traveling around who going to be
infected<00:00:28.050> first<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.949> might<00:00:29.130> well<00:00:29.310> not

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
infected first and so it might well not

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.790 
infected first and so it might well not
be<00:00:29.789> older<00:00:30.090> people<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.449> children<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.050> lot<00:00:31.619> of

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
be older people in children a lot of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.620 
be older people in children a lot of
young<00:00:31.980> adults<00:00:32.550> who<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:32.790> active<00:00:33.329> business

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
young adults who are active business

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.620 
young adults who are active business
people<00:00:34.489> physicians<00:00:35.489> nurses<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.149> others<00:00:36.480> if

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
people physicians nurses and others if

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.959 
people physicians nurses and others if
not<00:00:36.870> properly<00:00:37.140> protected<00:00:37.980> would<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.610> infected

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
not properly protected would be infected

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.139 
not properly protected would be infected
by<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.300> virus<00:00:40.129> so<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.399> there<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> pandemic

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
by this virus so if there is a pandemic

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
by this virus so if there is a pandemic
flu<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:43.140> quarantine<00:00:43.710> entire

flu with a really quarantine entire

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.240 
flu with a really quarantine entire
areas<00:00:44.840> quarantine<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.200> separating<00:00:47.100> those

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
areas quarantine is separating those

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.910 
areas quarantine is separating those
who've<00:00:47.520> been<00:00:47.760> exposed<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.930> disease<00:00:48.960> from

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
can separate is bad weather days or just

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.880 
can separate is bad weather days or just
staying<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.640> home<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:09.119> bad<00:01:09.600> weather<00:01:09.900> days<00:01:10.200> we

that<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.520> mass<00:02:08.789> may<00:02:09.330> be<00:02:09.390> helpful<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:10.500> they

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
that the mass may be helpful but they

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.500 
that the mass may be helpful but they
are<00:02:11.129> not<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
are not going to be the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.270 
are not going to be the
sir<00:02:12.629> we've<00:02:13.170> got<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.439> talk<00:02:13.560> about<00:02:13.620> washing

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
sir we've got to talk about washing

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.600 
sir we've got to talk about washing
hands<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:15.930> there<00:02:16.230> vaccine<00:02:16.860> for<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.159> pandemic

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
hands is there vaccine for the pandemic

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.710 
hands is there vaccine for the pandemic
flu<00:02:17.930> there<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.290> no<00:02:19.860> tried<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.640> tested<00:02:20.909> vaccine

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
flu there is no tried and tested vaccine

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.039 
flu there is no tried and tested vaccine
for<00:02:21.959> pandemic<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:22.739> almost<00:02:23.189> by<00:02:23.400> definition

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
for pandemic and almost by definition

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.569 
for pandemic and almost by definition
because<00:02:25.049> if<00:02:25.349> you<00:02:25.500> had<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.709> vaccine<00:02:26.220> if<00:02:26.489> you

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
because if you had a vaccine if you

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.190 
because if you had a vaccine if you
could<00:02:26.730> create<00:02:26.909> immunity<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.629> people<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.110> would

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
could create immunity in people it would

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.470 
could create immunity in people it would
be<00:02:28.290> very<00:02:28.470> hard<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.129> pandemic<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.299> one

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
be very hard to have a pandemic so one

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.089 
be very hard to have a pandemic so one
thing<00:02:30.629> that<00:02:30.690> makes<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.110> pandemic<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.890> fact

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
thing that makes a pandemic is the fact

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.309 
thing that makes a pandemic is the fact
that<00:02:32.190> people<00:02:32.610> don't<00:02:32.760> have<00:02:33.000> immunity<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.200> you

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
that people don't have immunity and you

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.500 
that people don't have immunity and you
don't<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:34.799> people<00:02:35.610> who've<00:02:35.849> been<00:02:35.970> adequately

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
don't have people who've been adequately

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.740 
don't have people who've been adequately
vaccinated<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.920> government<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:38.760> investing<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
vaccine research and we are hoping for

vaccine research and we are hoping for

research breakthroughs here though that

research breakthroughs here though that
really<00:02:49.680> will<00:02:50.060> provide<00:02:51.060> us<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.510> vaccine<00:02:52.109> but

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
really will provide us that vaccine but

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.580 
really will provide us that vaccine but
if<00:02:53.069> we<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.430> had<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.639> say<00:02:54.000> today<00:02:54.329> is<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.959> vaccine

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590
