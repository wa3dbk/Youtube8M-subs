00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
a little bit different anyway this is

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.889 
a little bit different anyway this is
the<00:00:54.960> Caroline<00:00:56.270> like<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.539> long<00:00:57.840> I

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the Caroline like you know long I

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.200 
the Caroline like you know long I
haven't<00:00:58.199> carried<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.680> yet<00:00:58.920> either<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.640> I'm

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
haven't carried it yet either so I'm

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.400 
haven't carried it yet either so I'm
going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> decide<00:01:00.899> between<00:01:01.050> those

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
going to have to decide between those

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.900 
going to have to decide between those
two<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.070> think<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.730> pattern

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
two because I think this is the pattern

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
course to put it back on top which i

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.920 
course to put it back on top which i
think<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:13.890> what<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.280> was<00:03:14.400> intended<00:03:14.790> for<00:03:15.210> to

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
think is what it was intended for to

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.160 
think is what it was intended for to
keep<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.260> tea<00:03:16.440> warm<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.520> anyway<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.300> is<00:03:18.450> I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
keep the tea warm so anyway that is I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.310 
keep the tea warm so anyway that is I
hope<00:03:19.740> that's<00:03:20.010> all<00:03:20.310> my<00:03:20.490> pieces<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:21.360> ribbons<00:03:22.200> I

try<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.620> remember<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.460> think<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.030> was

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
try to remember and think of that was

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.930 
try to remember and think of that was
all<00:03:24.330> in<00:03:24.510> but<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.690> think<00:03:24.990> that<00:03:25.050> it<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:26.430> anyway

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940
