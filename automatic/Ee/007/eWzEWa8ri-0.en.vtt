00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
our relationship with food you know and

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.980 
our relationship with food you know and

knowing that how we feel now we perform
how<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.230> function<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:17.100> directly<00:00:17.670> related<00:00:17.940> to

is<00:03:59.380> going<00:03:59.650> is<00:03:59.769> it<00:03:59.880> turns<00:04:00.880> it<00:04:01.000> into<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.329> fat

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
is going is it turns it into this fat

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.960 
is going is it turns it into this fat
storing<00:04:02.139> mode<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:03.100> this<00:04:03.220> causes<00:04:03.609> stress

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
storing mode and so this causes stress

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.580
