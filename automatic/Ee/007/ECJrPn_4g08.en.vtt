00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
back about by and a half and I guess the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.650 
back about by and a half and I guess the
trail<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.370> as<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.610> can<00:00:08.760> see<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.240> good

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
trail is as you can see a good

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.730 
trail is as you can see a good
well-developed<00:00:10.139> trail<00:00:10.880> well<00:00:11.880> maintained<00:00:12.740> but

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
well-developed trail well maintained but

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.140 
well-developed trail well maintained but
it<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:13.950> uh<00:00:14.690> pretty<00:00:15.690> steep<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.910> can

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
it is uh pretty steep as you can

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.010 
it is uh pretty steep as you can
probably<00:00:18.390> tell<00:00:18.600> from<00:00:18.810> my<00:00:20.390> breathing<00:00:21.390> or

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.580 
up this trail and that six miles and I
don't<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:29.180> 2,800<00:01:30.180> feet<00:01:30.720> I've<00:01:31.290> already

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
gone 1500 feet of elevation gain up so

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.560

Mountain<00:01:41.180> okay<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.600> later

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.100 

this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.530> uh<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.820> guess<00:01:47.939> about<00:01:48.299> three<00:01:48.869> miles

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
this is uh and I guess about three miles

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.440 
this is uh and I guess about three miles
in<00:01:49.490> from<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:51.119> don't<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
in from now on I really don't know the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.980 
in from now on I really don't know the
distances<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> howl<00:01:54.479> about<00:01:54.570> log

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
distances but this is a howl about log

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.569 
distances but this is a howl about log
been<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.680> years<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:55.979> years<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.310> years

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
been here for years and years and years

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.139 
been here for years and years and years
and<00:01:56.640> years

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and years

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.480 
and years
I<00:01:57.180> would<00:01:57.990> certainly<00:01:58.229> treat<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.920> water<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
I would certainly treat the water but it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.100 
I would certainly treat the water but it
is<00:01:59.579> coming<00:01:59.790> from<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.119> spring<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.930> see

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
is coming from a spring as you can see

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.889 
is coming from a spring as you can see
right<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:02.119> but<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.509> mostly

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
right there but I think it's mostly

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.440 
right there but I think it's mostly
meant<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.920> horses<00:02:05.759> when<00:02:06.060> there<00:02:06.210> are<00:02:06.270> horses

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
meant for horses when there are horses

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.320 
meant for horses when there are horses
on<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.899> trail<00:02:08.270> okay

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.740

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
course she could see here we are about a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.000 
course she could see here we are about a
mile<00:02:47.359> summit

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
mile summit

00:02:49.010 --> 00:03:16.879 
mile summit
be<00:03:05.150> careful<00:03:13.370> okay<00:03:14.370> I'm<00:03:15.440> above<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.470> treeline

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
be careful okay I'm above the treeline

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.759 
be careful okay I'm above the treeline
now<00:03:18.349> and<00:03:19.349> I'm<00:03:19.739> pretty<00:03:19.980> close<00:03:21.470> somehow<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.500> think

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
now and I'm pretty close somehow I think

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:43.839 
now and I'm pretty close somehow I think
but<00:03:23.220> these<00:03:23.459> really<00:03:24.359> steep<00:03:24.750> switchbacks<00:03:25.349> are

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.069 

well<00:03:44.849> that<00:03:45.180> looks<00:03:45.419> like<00:03:45.660> one<00:03:46.500> big<00:03:46.859> long<00:03:47.250> last

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
well that looks like one big long last

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:55.099 
well that looks like one big long last
steep<00:03:50.930> trail<00:03:51.930> up<00:03:52.139> to<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.760> switch<00:03:53.760> back<00:03:53.970> up<00:03:54.780> to

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
steep trail up to the switch back up to

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.379 
steep trail up to the switch back up to
the<00:03:55.230> top<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.829> I<00:03:55.949> can<00:03:56.190> see<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.669> flags<00:03:56.970> and

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
the top and I can see the flags and

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:04.460 
the top and I can see the flags and
stuff<00:03:57.569> right<00:03:57.720> over<00:03:57.989> here<00:03:58.199> okay<00:04:03.290> see<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.410> at

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
stuff right over here okay see you at

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.720 
stuff right over here okay see you at
the<00:04:04.560> top<00:04:06.739> okay<00:04:07.739> well<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.699> made<00:04:09.599> it<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.489> the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
the top okay well I made it this is the

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.629 
the top okay well I made it this is the
top<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:12.269> Mount<00:04:12.480> Charleston

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
top of Mount Charleston

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.180 
top of Mount Charleston
eleven<00:04:14.639> thousand<00:04:15.209> nine<00:04:15.389> hundred<00:04:15.810> and

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
eleven thousand nine hundred and

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.229 
eleven thousand nine hundred and
eighteen<00:04:17.190> feet<00:04:17.430> something<00:04:17.699> like<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:18.090> almost

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
eighteen feet something like that almost

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.900 
eighteen feet something like that almost
5000<00:04:18.959> feet<00:04:19.219> so<00:04:20.219> that's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
5000 feet so that's

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:29.270 
5000 feet so that's
I<00:04:21.940> think<00:04:22.690> in<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.260> distance<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:24.760> way<00:04:26.280> and

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
I think in the distance that way and

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.890 
I think in the distance that way and
can't<00:04:30.280> it's<00:04:30.490> difficult<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.030> see<00:04:31.240> its<00:04:31.420> but<00:04:31.780> it's

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
can't it's difficult to see its but it's

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.650 
can't it's difficult to see its but it's
in<00:04:32.080> its<00:04:32.860> vaguest<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.580> back<00:04:33.910> of<00:04:34.090> those<00:04:34.240> couple

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
in its vaguest and back of those couple

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.720 
in its vaguest and back of those couple
mountain<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.680> little<00:04:35.950> mountain<00:04:36.430> rages<00:04:36.820> there

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
mountain the little mountain rages there

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.640 
mountain the little mountain rages there
that's<00:04:39.730> a<00:04:39.880> dugout<00:04:40.600> that<00:04:40.870> was<00:04:41.050> been<00:04:41.350> built<00:04:41.530> here

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
that's a dugout that was been built here

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.830 
that's a dugout that was been built here
over<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.190> years<00:04:42.430> it's<00:04:42.910> pretty<00:04:43.090> windy<00:04:43.330> at<00:04:43.600> top

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
over the years it's pretty windy at top

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.190 
over the years it's pretty windy at top
so<00:04:44.130> hikers<00:04:45.130> can<00:04:45.720> this<00:04:46.720> is<00:04:46.810> our<00:04:46.900> hunker<00:04:47.170> down

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
so hikers can this is our hunker down

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.450 
so hikers can this is our hunker down
and<00:04:47.380> get<00:04:47.560> something<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:47.920> eat<00:04:47.980> before<00:04:48.250> they

and get something to eat before they
head<00:04:48.580> back<00:04:48.730> down<00:04:50.370> this<00:04:51.370> over<00:04:51.670> here<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.380> this

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
head back down this over here that this

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.800 
head back down this over here that this
trail<00:04:53.680> is<00:04:53.770> not<00:04:53.890> mine<00:04:54.130> that's<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.730> South<00:04:55.510> Loop

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
trail is not mine that's the South Loop

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.460 
trail is not mine that's the South Loop
Trail<00:04:56.080> I<00:04:56.170> did<00:04:56.530> hike<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.550> twice<00:04:57.880> before<00:04:58.440> now<00:04:59.440> I

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
Trail I did hike that twice before now I

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.470 
Trail I did hike that twice before now I
do<00:04:59.680> I<00:04:59.980> consider<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.550> North<00:05:00.790> Loop<00:05:01.030> what<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:01.270> did

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
do I consider the North Loop what I did

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.520 
do I consider the North Loop what I did
today<00:05:01.660> tougher

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
today tougher

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.110 
today tougher
maybe<00:05:03.280> it's<00:05:03.460> because<00:05:04.500> let's<00:05:05.500> see<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.770> think

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
maybe it's because let's see I think

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.100 
maybe it's because let's see I think
2003<00:05:07.120> was<00:05:07.270> my<00:05:07.390> first<00:05:07.630> hike<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:10.540> South<00:05:10.780> Loop

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
2003 was my first hike to the South Loop

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.710 
2003 was my first hike to the South Loop
some<00:05:11.460> maybe<00:05:12.460> it's<00:05:12.670> just<00:05:12.790> that<00:05:13.060> I'm<00:05:13.420> 10<00:05:13.690> years

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
some maybe it's just that I'm 10 years

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.370 
some maybe it's just that I'm 10 years
older<00:05:14.350> M<00:05:14.680> near<00:05:14.920> that<00:05:15.100> might<00:05:15.490> be<00:05:15.640> possible

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
older M near that might be possible

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.580 
older M near that might be possible
possibly<00:05:17.380> put<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.680> case<00:05:18.960> see<00:05:19.960> people<00:05:20.290> put<00:05:20.470> up

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
possibly put the case see people put up

00:05:20.590 --> 00:06:00.390 
possibly put the case see people put up
flags<00:05:21.430> that's<00:05:21.910> pretty<00:05:22.120> nice<00:05:58.410> ok<00:05:59.410> at<00:06:00.010> the<00:06:00.280> end
