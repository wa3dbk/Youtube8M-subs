00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
didn't really like about mimic vat and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.039 
didn't really like about mimic vat and
the<00:01:35.850> red-green<00:01:36.180> destroyed<00:01:36.450> artifacts<00:01:36.840> deck

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the red-green destroyed artifacts deck

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.870 
the red-green destroyed artifacts deck
is<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.860> couldn't<00:01:38.189> really<00:01:38.340> take

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
is that we couldn't really take

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
is that we couldn't really take
advantage<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> mimic<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.229> much

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
advantage of the mimic that so much

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.609 
advantage of the mimic that so much
because<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:41.159> had<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.689> if<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.840> had<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.259> have

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
because we had to if we had to have

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.620 
because we had to if we had to have
other<00:01:43.920> artifacts<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> field<00:01:45.000> before<00:01:45.240> we

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
other artifacts on the field before we

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.179 
other artifacts on the field before we
could<00:01:45.869> play<00:01:46.290> our<00:01:46.439> guys<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.860> destroyed

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
could play our guys that destroyed

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.560 
could play our guys that destroyed
artifacts<00:01:47.610> or<00:01:47.759> else<00:01:47.909> we'd<00:01:48.060> end<00:01:48.180> up<00:01:48.270> destroying

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
artifacts or else we'd end up destroying

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.440 
artifacts or else we'd end up destroying
your<00:01:48.750> own<00:01:48.780> mimic<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.110> I'm<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.500> bad<00:01:49.649> synergy

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
your own mimic that I'm a bad synergy

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.170 
your own mimic that I'm a bad synergy
yeah<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.380> we<00:01:51.619> here<00:01:52.430> we're<00:01:52.670> using<00:01:52.820> guys<00:01:53.030> that

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
yeah so we here we're using guys that

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.999 
yeah so we here we're using guys that
have<00:01:53.299> good<00:01:53.509> synergy<00:01:53.810> with<00:01:54.350> mimic<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.680> such

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
have good synergy with mimic that such

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.010 
have good synergy with mimic that such
as<00:01:55.159> skin<00:01:55.399> render<00:01:55.670> who<00:01:56.149> not<00:01:56.329> only<00:01:56.360> can<00:01:56.750> skin

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
as skin render who not only can skin

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.719 
as skin render who not only can skin
rent<00:01:57.229> their<00:01:57.439> guys<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:58.009> put<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.219> the<00:01:58.250> mimic<00:01:58.549> fat

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
rent their guys and put on the mimic fat

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.190 
rent their guys and put on the mimic fat
but<00:01:58.939> if<00:01:59.030> you<00:01:59.119> can<00:01:59.270> get<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.420> skin<00:01:59.689> render<00:01:59.960> on<00:02:00.079> the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
but if you can get a skin render on the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.039 
but if you can get a skin render on the
mimic<00:02:00.439> fat<00:02:00.619> then<00:02:00.920> that's<00:02:01.369> pretty<00:02:02.090> all<00:02:02.539> fallen

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
mimic fat then that's pretty all fallen

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.929 
mimic fat then that's pretty all fallen
and<00:02:03.469> gatekeeper<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.189> Malachor<00:02:04.670> who

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
and gatekeeper of Malachor who

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.029 
and gatekeeper of Malachor who
necessarily<00:02:05.179> it<00:02:05.869> wasn't<00:02:06.289> that<00:02:06.530> great<00:02:06.770> honor

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
necessarily it wasn't that great honor

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.350 
necessarily it wasn't that great honor
mimic<00:02:07.340> that<00:02:07.369> because<00:02:07.759> you<00:02:07.850> can't<00:02:08.030> kick<00:02:08.209> him

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
mimic that because you can't kick him

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.359 
mimic that because you can't kick him
when<00:02:08.450> he<00:02:08.539> comes<00:02:08.660> into<00:02:08.869> play<00:02:09.080> but<00:02:09.140> he's<00:02:09.890> still

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
when he comes into play but he's still

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.830 
when he comes into play but he's still
get<00:02:10.550> at<00:02:10.640> getting<00:02:10.940> your<00:02:11.150> opponent's<00:02:11.569> good

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
stuff on the mimic that in addition we

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.809 
stuff on the mimic that in addition we

not<00:02:33.560> you're<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.400> first<00:02:34.430> thing<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.849> would

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
not you're the first thing that would

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.890 
not you're the first thing that would
come<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.120> mind<00:02:35.360> when<00:02:35.450> you're<00:02:35.599> thinking<00:02:35.630> like

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
come to mind when you're thinking like

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.229 
come to mind when you're thinking like
finisher<00:02:36.590> for<00:02:36.620> mono<00:02:36.980> black<00:02:37.220> control<00:02:37.700> deck<00:02:37.880> but

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
finisher for mono black control deck but

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.490 
finisher for mono black control deck but
he<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.599> a<00:02:38.630> pretty<00:02:38.900> good<00:02:39.049> budget<00:02:39.349> choice

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
he is a pretty good budget choice

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.280 
he is a pretty good budget choice
because<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.700> mean<00:02:40.940> he's<00:02:41.120> not<00:02:41.390> grave<00:02:41.720> titan<00:02:42.110> as

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
because I mean he's not grave titan as

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.500 
because I mean he's not grave titan as
in<00:02:42.500> when<00:02:42.650> he<00:02:42.769> comes<00:02:43.040> down<00:02:43.250> he<00:02:43.579> generates<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.180> 22

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
in when he comes down he generates to 22

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.300 
in when he comes down he generates to 22
s<00:02:44.569> but<00:02:44.720> he<00:02:44.810> does<00:02:44.959> kind<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.260> generate<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.860> card

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
s but he does kind of generate a card

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.100 
s but he does kind of generate a card
advantage<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.880> same<00:02:47.060> way<00:02:47.239> because<00:02:47.840> when

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
advantage in the same way because when

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.900 
advantage in the same way because when
he<00:02:48.170> comes<00:02:48.380> down<00:02:48.470> yeah<00:02:48.829> he<00:02:48.920> comes<00:02:49.069> out<00:02:49.190> as<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> 44

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
he comes down yeah he comes out as a 44

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.970 
he comes down yeah he comes out as a 44
but<00:02:50.209> if<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.599> have<00:02:50.810> mana<00:02:51.110> open<00:02:51.530> or<00:02:51.680> if<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.829> want

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
but if you have mana open or if you want

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.920 
but if you have mana open or if you want
tap<00:02:52.130> with<00:02:52.340> him<00:02:52.459> then<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.269> can<00:02:53.420> just<00:02:53.569> destroy

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
tap with him then you can just destroy

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.150 
tap with him then you can just destroy
your<00:02:54.079> opponent's<00:02:54.440> whole<00:02:54.560> board<00:02:54.769> depending<00:02:55.160> on

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
your opponent's whole board depending on

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.270 
your opponent's whole board depending on
what<00:02:55.370> deck<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:55.700> are<00:02:55.760> playing<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:57.280> that

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
what deck that are playing and that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.370 
what deck that are playing and that
generates<00:02:58.639> the<00:02:58.790> same<00:02:58.940> or<00:02:59.299> more<00:02:59.359> amount<00:03:00.260> of

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
generates the same or more amount of

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.289 
generates the same or more amount of
card<00:03:00.590> advantage<00:03:00.709> as<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.430> would<00:03:01.579> be<00:03:01.609> with<00:03:01.970> grave

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
card advantage as it would be with grave

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.879 
card advantage as it would be with grave
titan<00:03:02.600> i<00:03:02.660> mean<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:02.930> guy<00:03:03.109> has<00:03:03.260> saved<00:03:03.470> me<00:03:03.680> in

then jumps up to 6 / 8 because you

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.820 
then jumps up to 6 / 8 because you
wouldn't<00:03:43.810> mind<00:03:43.990> playing<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.410> guy<00:03:44.590> if<00:03:44.740> you

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
wouldn't mind playing this guy if you

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.830 
wouldn't mind playing this guy if you
have<00:03:44.950> eight<00:03:45.130> man<00:03:45.310> out<00:03:45.580> but<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.360> mean<00:03:46.600> probably

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
have eight man out but I mean probably

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.770 
have eight man out but I mean probably
make<00:03:47.140> do<00:03:47.290> with<00:03:47.440> 25<00:03:47.980> maybe<00:03:48.580> 24<00:03:49.390> if<00:03:49.480> we<00:03:49.570> push<00:03:49.750> it

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
make do with 25 maybe 24 if we push it

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.930 
make do with 25 maybe 24 if we push it
but<00:03:50.350> I<00:03:50.380> think<00:03:50.410> having<00:03:51.040> more<00:03:51.370> land<00:03:51.640> here's

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
but I think having more land here's

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.240 
but I think having more land here's
better<00:03:52.270> than<00:03:52.510> not<00:03:52.690> because<00:03:53.170> just<00:03:53.250> having

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
better than not because just having

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.890 
better than not because just having
playing<00:03:54.970> lash<00:03:55.120> right<00:03:55.360> then<00:03:55.510> immediately

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
playing lash right then immediately

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.720 
playing lash right then immediately

stabilize but then it's hard to win from
there<00:05:17.650> and<00:05:17.830> if<00:05:17.979> I<00:05:18.070> could<00:05:18.220> just<00:05:18.250> have<00:05:18.400> another
