 burton martins in the front point to a 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.550
 of the brands of English beers which 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.220
 People have in Brazil one of the faces. 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.660
 most known of them is the one here 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.670

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.870
 the brewery and discovered something totally 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.739
 new 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.690
 the fermentation room of the guys still 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.720
 follows the same process from the beginning of the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:49.829
 brewery that was in 1836 is this 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.440
 in 1834 the beer made the implementation 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.600
 open and then there is a preference action 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.760
 in containers as well and then the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.640
 fermentation is completed in barrels 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.129
 and individual barrels small barrels 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.989
 where the top has one as if 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.869
 I was a minor with them by waiting 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.630
 yeast and maturation is also done there 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.420
 even an amazing staff room 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.950
 digan search implementation is to show 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.720

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.819
 pictures I got there for everyone 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.310
 of the group was totally a surprise 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.470
 very positive and no one had seen 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.020
 nothing like civilian personnel was what 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.220
 really their system is the only and 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.830
 beer they make there 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.360
 the pedigree and he also has others here 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.860
 the brewery but does a process 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.470
 different but at their request maintains 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.229
 in this process as is pedigree coloring 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.459
 good amber foam formation a thin 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:48.759
 on the nose it was slightly malted 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:52.599
 floral in the mouth very well balanced 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.950
 slightly above low bitterness is well 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.280
 better than I had ever tasted before 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.989
 when it is for us in Brazil just goes on 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.060
 in the bottle that was withdrawn through 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:02.709
 bank house 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.179
 another brand that guys are making 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:09.910
 here you see totally new is one more 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.280
 tones new old this beer is being 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.620
 made with New Zealand hops 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.300
 This is what's cool considering this. 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.280
 is also having this evolution of 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.410
 imported inputs and thus the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.480
 other parts of the world here in beers 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.270
 English will see with that coloration 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.630
 Golden 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.070
 was a more present citrus floral of the 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:36.090
 that way and ales 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:39.570
 who has tasted here in the mouth a little 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.790
 more of her final bitterness presence 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.030
 continue this citrus a good beer 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.280
 Delicious and this beer for me there. 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.730
 Brazil already liked her is an honor 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.620
 vote emerge take sounds opera staut 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.680
 a lot of people confuse thinking that she has 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.630
 it is not good to show only the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.820
 name because it has that comparison 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.030
 to that well-known organization 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.620
 that is put others with a beer 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.220
 stout and they made this label a 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.040
 beer 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.990
 already to match with shows but not 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.750
 takes other brands where the heart is 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.000
 closed and dark good foaming 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.020
 with a thin in the mouth 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.020
 exhaust smell on the nose 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.020
 very low chocolate little present 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.390
 in the mouth the taste of chocolate 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.810
 I like tobacco is also smoked and yes 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.650
 tobacco and a well-balanced lightweight finish. 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.810
 of whey a small presence of bitterness 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.549
 three beers excuses here I do not know if 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.409

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.720
 You will probably find this in Brazil. 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.430
 new orders will get there too but they are 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.250
 beers you have to taste the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.799
 Beer referring to the English school and 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.810
