actually go when using this glitch you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.209 
actually go when using this glitch you
just<00:00:39.960> want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> follow<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> path<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.950> take

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
just want to follow the path that I take

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.860 
just want to follow the path that I take
because<00:00:41.640> although<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> spots<00:00:42.719> in

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
because although a lot of the spots in

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.209 
because although a lot of the spots in
this<00:00:42.960> video<00:00:43.260> look<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.920> could<00:00:44.040> go<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
this video look like you could go to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.010 
this video look like you could go to
them<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.940> could<00:00:45.090> run<00:00:45.300> around<00:00:45.390> perhaps<00:00:45.719> you

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
them you could run around perhaps you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.930 
them you could run around perhaps you
actually<00:00:46.350> can't<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.219> example<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.820> I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
actually can't do that for example if I

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.700 
actually can't do that for example if I
jump<00:00:48.270> down<00:00:48.450> right<00:00:48.750> now<00:00:48.960> into<00:00:49.260> any<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.590> these

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
jump down right now into any of these

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
jump down right now into any of these
spots<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.430> would<00:00:50.789> fall<00:00:51.000> underneath<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.570> map

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
spots I would fall underneath the map

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.720 
spots I would fall underneath the map
and<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.170> would<00:00:52.410> die<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.129> follow<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> path<00:00:53.699> that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
and I would die so follow the path that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.279 
and I would die so follow the path that
I<00:00:53.910> take<00:00:54.180> there<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> good<00:00:54.750> area<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.199> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
