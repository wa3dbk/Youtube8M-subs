00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
transitions this user inspired tip can

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.360 
transitions this user inspired tip can
help<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.630> change<00:00:12.900> curve<00:00:13.290> types<00:00:13.620> quickly<00:00:14.160> for

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
help you change curve types quickly for

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.599 
help you change curve types quickly for
transitions<00:00:15.049> for<00:00:16.049> example<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.890> would<00:00:17.400> like

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
transitions for example you would like

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.880 
transitions for example you would like
oil<00:00:17.880> dissolves<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.750> be<00:00:18.869> linear<00:00:19.140> instead<00:00:19.859> of

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
oil dissolves to be linear instead of

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.509 
oil dissolves to be linear instead of
s-shaped<00:00:21.020> any<00:00:22.020> curve<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.619> matter<00:00:22.859> can

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
s-shaped any curve for that matter can

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.109 
s-shaped any curve for that matter can
be<00:00:23.760> copied<00:00:24.000> across<00:00:24.269> multiple<00:00:24.779> transitions

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
be copied across multiple transitions

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.779 
be copied across multiple transitions
now<00:00:27.119> smoke<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.720> selection<00:00:28.320> based<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.490> can

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
now smoke is selection based so you can

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.910 
now smoke is selection based so you can
multi-select<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.630> bunch<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.990> transitions<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
multi-select a bunch of transitions and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.250 
multi-select a bunch of transitions and
adjust<00:00:32.640> some<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:32.969> their<00:00:33.149> properties<00:00:33.690> ranging

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
adjust some of their properties ranging

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.790 
adjust some of their properties ranging
from<00:00:34.620> dissolve<00:00:35.070> blending<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.820> durations<00:00:36.800> by

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
from dissolve blending to durations by

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.560 
from dissolve blending to durations by
adjusting<00:00:38.160> settings<00:00:38.640> using<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.390> basic

dissolves<00:00:42.690> will<00:00:42.870> update<00:00:43.110> with<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> changes

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
dissolves will update with the changes

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.330 
dissolves will update with the changes
however<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.500> want<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.860> edit<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
however if you want to edit the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.459 
however if you want to edit the
animation<00:00:47.850> curve<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.780> would<00:00:48.930> need<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.289> do

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
animation curve you would need to do

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.160 
animation curve you would need to do
this<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> channel<00:00:50.430> editor<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.989> all

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
this in the channel editor this is all

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
this in the channel editor this is all
fine<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.309> change<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.820> animation

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
fine and you can change the animation

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.020 
fine and you can change the animation
curve<00:00:54.710> but<00:00:55.710> any<00:00:55.949> changes<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.610> make<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
curve but any changes you make in the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.229 
curve but any changes you make in the
editor<00:00:57.570> only<00:00:58.410> apply<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.129> transition<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
editor only apply to one transition and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.740 
editor only apply to one transition and
not<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> other<00:01:01.320> dissolves<00:01:02.570> going<00:01:03.570> into

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
not all the other dissolves going into

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.530 
not all the other dissolves going into
any<00:01:04.080> other<00:01:04.379> transition<00:01:04.680> editor<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.030> curve<00:01:06.299> is

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
any other transition editor the curve is

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.870 
any other transition editor the curve is
still<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> same<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.890> last<00:01:08.130> thing<00:01:08.369> anyone

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
still the same and the last thing anyone

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450 
still the same and the last thing anyone
wants<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.869> go<00:01:10.409> through<00:01:10.619> each<00:01:10.860> dissolve

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
wants to do is go through each dissolve

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.950 
wants to do is go through each dissolve
one<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.970> time<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.070> two<00:01:14.430> choices

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
one at a time so you have two choices

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.749 
one at a time so you have two choices
you<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.110> either<00:01:16.290> set<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:16.950> curve<00:01:17.250> type<00:01:17.580> in

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
you can either set up your curve type in

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
you can either set up your curve type in
the<00:01:17.850> Preferences<00:01:18.420> menu<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.590> requires

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the Preferences menu but this requires

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.700 
the Preferences menu but this requires
foresight<00:01:20.700> which<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.450> impossible<00:01:21.869> because<00:01:22.259> we

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
foresight which is impossible because we

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.850 
foresight which is impossible because we
never<00:01:22.950> know<00:01:23.100> exactly<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.030> clients<00:01:24.509> want<00:01:24.860> or

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
never know exactly what clients want or

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.999 
never know exactly what clients want or
you<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.520> try<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.420> tip<00:01:27.799> once<00:01:28.799> you

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you can try this little tip once you

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.620 
you can try this little tip once you
have<00:01:29.100> made<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.340> curve<00:01:29.759> adjustment<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
have made your curve adjustment to the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.440 
have made your curve adjustment to the
first<00:01:30.960> transition<00:01:31.670> select<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> transition

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.530 
first transition select the transition
in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> sequence<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.409> copy<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.390> now

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
in the sequence and copy it you can now

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.929 
in the sequence and copy it you can now
manually<00:01:36.990> select<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.680> other<00:01:37.829> transitions<00:01:38.640> or

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
manually select the other transitions or

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.240 
manually select the other transitions or
you<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.900> into<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> filter<00:01:40.590> selection

the sequence with the selection made you

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.389 
the sequence with the selection made you
can<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:47.490> choose<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.090> paste<00:01:48.829> please<00:01:49.829> note<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
can now choose to paste please note that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.609 
can now choose to paste please note that
this<00:01:50.790> will<00:01:51.000> paste<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.540> new<00:01:51.689> curve<00:01:51.990> into<00:01:52.409> each

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
this will paste the new curve into each

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.160 
this will paste the new curve into each
selected<00:01:53.340> transition<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.780> will<00:01:54.930> not

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
selected transition but it will not

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.310 
selected transition but it will not
change<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.799> duration<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.490> each<00:01:56.700> dissolve<00:01:57.320> so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
change the duration of each dissolve so

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.380 
change the duration of each dissolve so
this<00:01:58.560> works<00:01:58.829> great<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.250> transitions<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
this works great for transitions of the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.289 
this works great for transitions of the
same<00:02:00.630> length<00:02:01.040> for<00:02:02.040> transitions<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.880> different

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
same length for transitions of different

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.270 
same length for transitions of different
lengths<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.140> will<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:04.770> into<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
lengths you will have to go into the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.270 
lengths you will have to go into the
editor<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.119> adjust<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> pasted<00:02:07.439> curves<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
editor and adjust the pasted curves to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.680 
editor and adjust the pasted curves to
match

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
match

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.890
