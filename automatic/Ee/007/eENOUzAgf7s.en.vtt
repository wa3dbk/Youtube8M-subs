00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hi there, we are still in Taiwan 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.350
 God very cool island and we on 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.200
 computex 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.150
 look at the interesting news in this 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.309
 case we are at the press conference md 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.890
 accordingly not often we look at 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.220
 Yandex, these solutions and generally on n.d. 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.260
 and this is bad right now we will consider 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.580
 function and cedar 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.000
 approves and we found asus laptops here 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 On md, there are not so many of them, either with asus and in general 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.140
 each manufacturer in the portfolio 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.870
 more intel but 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.719
 and Yandex is not interesting in this 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.879
 case we are looking at budget 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 xx 555 series voy a and x 555 d 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.500
 they differ in color differ 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.170
 body materials probably something else 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.160
 different but in this case installed 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.329
 processor ppm 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.289
 a 673 10th anniversary video card 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.760
 and m d rodion or 4 graphics and as many as 12 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.430
 GB of RAM despite the fact that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.710
 This type of budget series do not know 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.659
 and a terabyte of screw and so how 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.170
 cool and soon everything should cost 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.560
 not cheap 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.740
 very practical case and on working 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.530
 surface and from this side it is so 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.200
 coarse rough texture while 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.689
 black well they say they do not often do 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.050
 because any speck of dust is visible and this is it 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.420
 like a gray car 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.940
 the gray car is always there 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.480
 clean can not wipe too rude 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.940
 texture 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.590
 by the way cover then black laptops from 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.190
 single lineup is different already 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.280
 I see processors here cafe x 88 20 api 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:47.930
 and drink and drink and r7 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.630
 video core or r8 m 350px 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.490
 and also 12 gigabytes of RAM and 1 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.110
 terabyte screw here of course 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.500
 games are shown 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.930
 that you can play a bunch of games she always 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.940
 talked about productivity like that 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.620
 create videos and photoshop and all 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.840
 the rest on our platforms is very 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.880
 cool cool do it accordingly 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.880
 do not regret it here why 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.940
 exactly 12 to suspect that part is unsoldered 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.830
 and then die 4 is unsoldered by him and 1 die 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.530
 8 inserted likely to have more 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.450
 one more nest is empty this we are 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.030
 suspicions that can be done at all 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.220
 dofiga there can only be one slot in 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.960
 anyways these laptops are sold on 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.290
 ours are sold in our markets 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.530
 I remind the series that asus x series is given 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.720
 case 555 and there are different letters there is a bunch 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.820
 any modifications that fit on 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.260
 any pocket and here is a laptop which we 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.500
 have long seen this m550 series n550 on 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.459
 In this case, it is n 551 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.880
 processor amd fx 76 two zero and among 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.709
 core or 7 or or 9 here 16 gigabytes 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.660
 RAM in on intelovskih in 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.840
 Intel version also 16 gigs 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.600
 RAM can be it actually 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.340
 productively productivity machine 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.960
 who are always with very powerful 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.360
 a lot of processor 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.790
 RAM and hard space 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.920
 drive in order for us to actually 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.780
 one of the installers working on such 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.030
 computer mounts video already 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.740
 very, very long time here we are ours 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.780
 attention is still attracted by the fact that here 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.030
 The technology is pressing which 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.060
 allows you to synchronize it 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.530
 analogue of ji seung from nvidia in india too 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.470
 there is called free sim which 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.870
 synchronizes the image on the screen with 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.780
 the signal is the video core 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.290
 actually ando also develops too 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.660
 hello to another 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.130
 camp which unfortunately we are not 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.320
 so often illuminate well really 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.390
 the car will also be sold soon 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.490
 total will be sold on ours on 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.060
 our markets because this model is already 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:55.740
 not new body itself but now it 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.740
 if also in the filling with a m d d
