00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.110
 in day 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.239
 from the airport the group 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.239
 the fifth fastest 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.779
 at least three months 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.150
 stop in hell 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.150
 divided by the crisis 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.169
 a personal video 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.050
 in a climate of crisis 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.210
 enough with the emelec team 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.950
 murilo pitol 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.320
 mercy 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.810
 christine burkheiser 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.870
 is very similar to the fifth consecutive one and that also never 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.140
 lined 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.140
 together with a periscope of this percentage 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.760
 is a more dynamic and interactive disc 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.620
 force that he can 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.840
 this trip alone 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.970
 the characteristic of the adversary 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.980
 have you been given 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.980
 by the three countries 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.250
 in sequence rate 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 the fourth and final test 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.250
 and hence to other people percent 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.370
 not from happiness 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.370
 and now more individual with 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.980
 did not give up and now face the team the Portuguese defender 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.030
 and do this to me 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.030
 traffic is a new day 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.150
 technically more 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
 in the spirit part 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.980
 His picture is asking 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.980
 the edict already has that air 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.930
 more powerful 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.930
 was delivered to his father 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 the report on excelsior 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:14.589
 I stayed there 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.519
 to grow 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.709
 much also depends on how this 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.689
 How was the victory? 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.689
 not only the victory but with 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.549
 so it's something that leaves power 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.129
 we are turning 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.129
 wants to learn English was our job well done 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.069
 who knows this most appreciated state posture 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.929
 because if you try to win well and win with 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:39.949
 determination 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:41.919
 the sector a posture 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:45.479
 in the category of well-balanced as always but now seems more than 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.289
 Never 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.289
 I have proud 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.929
 ana claudia is the half tinga 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.929
 terminating people can connect to the internet 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.099
 and now then 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.419
 the show 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.679
 for the luck of the single game who 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.999
 during the classes 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.909
 of the total eight teams because it will have 12 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:00.629
 it's very motivating 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:01.779
 everything well concentrated
