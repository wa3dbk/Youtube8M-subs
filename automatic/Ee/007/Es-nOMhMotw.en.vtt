were falling and semi semi dry but it's
working<00:00:49.909> it's<00:00:50.030> starting<00:00:50.300> to<00:00:50.360> spread<00:00:50.600> out<00:00:50.780> good

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
working it's starting to spread out good

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.770 
working it's starting to spread out good
it's<00:00:51.199> going<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.379> pull<00:00:51.620> up<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.420> before<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:53.629> gets

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
it's going to pull up and before it gets

here and I'll camp about a foot away
from<00:01:06.680> at<00:01:06.979> that<00:01:07.280> long<00:01:07.520> fire<00:01:08.530> see<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.649> winds

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
from at that long fire see the winds

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.109 
from at that long fire see the winds
kind<00:01:10.070> of<00:01:10.130> shifting<00:01:10.490> on<00:01:10.580> me<00:01:10.729> blowing<00:01:10.970> right

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
kind of shifting on me blowing right

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
toward me now but you know we'll see how

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.859 
toward me now but you know we'll see how
it<00:01:16.039> works<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.369> got<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.550> I<00:01:17.080> got<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.229> tarp<00:01:19.270> as<00:01:20.270> a

ground pad and a will blanket and a
pillow<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:26.479> we'll<00:01:26.630> see<00:01:26.810> how<00:01:26.840> it

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.750 

labels<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
labels to

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.970 
labels to
logs<00:01:48.420> across<00:01:48.600> top<00:01:49.020> try<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> burn<00:01:49.560> them<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.710> half

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
logs across top try to burn them in half

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.210 
logs across top try to burn them in half
and<00:01:50.930> add<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.800> fire<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.360> amazing<00:01:54.360> how<00:01:55.220> how

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
and add to the fire it's amazing how how

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.070 
and add to the fire it's amazing how how
slow<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.850> burns<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.480> same<00:01:57.630> time<00:01:57.870> it

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
slow it burns the at the same time it

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.720 
slow it burns the at the same time it
for<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.470> would<00:01:58.650> you<00:01:58.770> put<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:58.980> it<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.490> looks

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
for the would you put on it it looks

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.730 
for the would you put on it it looks
pretty<00:01:59.910> quick<00:02:02.630> but<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:03.990> putting<00:02:04.230> off<00:02:04.380> nice

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
pretty quick but it's putting off nice

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.020 
pretty quick but it's putting off nice
heat

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:23.840 

about<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.810> half<00:02:11.020> hour<00:02:11.200> before<00:02:11.380> dark

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.210 

so<00:02:24.450> I'm<00:02:24.630> kind<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:24.960> at<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.520> angle<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:28.740> get<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.100> as

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
so I'm kind of at a angle to get it as

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.240 
so I'm kind of at a angle to get it as
flat<00:02:29.490> as<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.760> wanted<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> be<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:31.070> on<00:02:32.070> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
flat as I wanted it to be in on the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.290 
flat as I wanted it to be in on the
ground<00:02:32.490> but<00:02:35.210> it<00:02:36.210> kind<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.540> slowed<00:02:36.810> down<00:02:37.080> but

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
ground but it kind of slowed down but

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.390 
ground but it kind of slowed down but
hopefully<00:02:39.300> be<00:02:39.480> all<00:02:39.660> right

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.360 

may<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.000> prob<00:02:45.269> about

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
may I prob about

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.490 
may I prob about
three<00:02:47.000> feet<00:02:47.209> away<00:02:47.299> from<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.049> it's<00:02:48.260> just

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
three feet away from it and it's just

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.680 
three feet away from it and it's just
something<00:02:48.799> my<00:02:48.920> my<00:02:49.400> faux<00:02:49.700> fur<00:02:49.940> my<00:02:50.180> body's<00:02:50.569> is

something my my faux fur my body's is

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.500 
something my my faux fur my body's is
born<00:02:50.959> this<00:02:51.110> could<00:02:51.290> be<00:02:51.940> it's<00:02:52.940> warm<00:02:53.239> where<00:02:53.390> your

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
heat coming off as coals right here and

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.050 
heat coming off as coals right here and
it's<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.920> tells<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.310> what<00:04:11.520> I<00:04:11.550> may<00:04:11.760> have<00:04:11.910> to

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
it's this tells you what I may have to

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.319 
it's this tells you what I may have to
move<00:04:12.180> back<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.450> little<00:04:12.570> bit

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:25.360 

it's<00:04:18.659> about<00:04:19.340> nine<00:04:20.340> o'clock

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.480 

I've<00:04:26.120> had<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.479> stoke<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:27.949> stuff<00:04:28.190> running

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
I've had to stoke it and stuff running

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.410 
I've had to stoke it and stuff running
out<00:04:28.669> of<00:04:28.699> fuel

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
out of fuel

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.530 
out of fuel
so<00:04:30.870> i<00:04:30.900> needed<00:04:31.230> about<00:04:31.380> double

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
so i needed about double

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.270 
so i needed about double
the<00:04:34.050> amount<00:04:34.260> of<00:04:34.380> fuel<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:34.680> figure<00:04:35.100> that's

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
the amount of fuel that figure that's

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.450 
the amount of fuel that figure that's
about<00:04:35.520> what<00:04:35.670> I<00:04:35.700> always<00:04:36.770> about<00:04:37.770> halfway<00:04:38.040> off

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
about what I always about halfway off

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.659 
about what I always about halfway off
it's<00:04:39.880> doubled<00:04:40.210> along<00:04:40.440> but<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:42.039> front<00:04:42.250> love<00:04:42.460> is

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
it's doubled along but the front love is

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.480 
it's doubled along but the front love is
pretty<00:04:42.970> much<00:04:43.120> deteriorated<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:45.130> lungs

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
pretty much deteriorated that lungs

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.199 
pretty much deteriorated that lungs
about<00:04:46.479> halfway<00:04:46.720> burns
