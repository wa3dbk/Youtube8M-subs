00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.350
 a bus and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.509
 video today we're going to see the best editor of 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.780
 photography for android and in this case 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.599
 snap set created by the creators of 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.410
 google so do not miss it stay 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.410
 to see this video 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.699
 Well let's start first 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.349
 of everything a few miles above 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.180
 we're not going to comment everything thoroughly so 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.970
 well let's open the application now 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.489
 you know what called snap set as I say 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.800
 the creators of google so it's a 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.480
 excellent application so good then 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.579
 nothing else to enter the application is going to 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.620
 ask to access a photo you go to the 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.649
 gallery and we select the photo that 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.450
 you want to edit obviously I chose then 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.910
 one of a personalization that I had 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.790
 the first effect that we are going to be able to 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.120
 choose and what would stand out the most would be 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.340
 transform one there are several adjustment of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.230
 photo detail of crop etcetera but 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.400
 transform is one of the most 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.830
 interesting that there is of this application 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.120
 here if we perform the finger up or 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.350
 down we will have different 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.300
 options like throwing it and putting it in 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.680
 3-d as you are seeing that I then 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.480
 I was surprised because I did not know 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.190
 this application and seeing it for the first time 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.500
 once I was quite surprised and the 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.869
 true that gives a very very good result 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 even if the camera does not appear because 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.840
 it was one hundred percent but it does give a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.479
 very good and good result because 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.670
 I really recommend that 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.040
 download you are free in the shade and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.540
 let's continue a little commenting what 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.070
 that comes to be other options that 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.070
 stand out from this application 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 the next section that we are going to see is going 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.450
 to be the details where we will be able to 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.030
 set the sharpness of the image in 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.460
 camera does not look very good this this 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.700
 paragraph but if to the charges in your 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.799
 mobile or tablet if you're going to try 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.259
 the setting the section and the truth that 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.349
 so very very good and very the next 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.150
 Useful section is that of Vienna for what 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.989
 serves this section because it serves 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.400
 basically at one point we're going to put 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.390
 let's be able to adjust around that 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.210
 point in the brightness of the image also 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.340
 we can change him 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.310
 the radius of the point to make it more 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.070
 big or smaller or the sharpness the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.800
 shine and other the truth that remains 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.080
 very good the photo when it fits and the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.690
 truth as I say it is very cool and 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.910
 very to stand out from the other photos 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.100
 the next section is not very new 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.810
 but worth mentioning is that of 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.170
 blur when we will be able 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.360
 adjust the blur of a radius of the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.150
 image to give depth and other 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.430
 good this this adjustment I think what 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.090
 we know almost all that minimally 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.620
 We edit some photograph but the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.890
 true, here it stands out that we can 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.460
 put the odd silhouette 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.600
 say it like star heart shape 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.010
 etcetera so he wants your photo even more 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.410
 personalized to your face so good 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.410
 because one thing also costs this 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.959
 the next point is the filters here 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.010
 let's see all of them because some are 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.200
 well not much that stands out but but 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.819
 Well, I also drop you for 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.800
 that you do not have it in mind download 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.720
 this application so good as well as 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.489
 I say if you liked the video I have 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.340
 liked this application you liked 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.500
 the video in general you can comment and 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.000
 to give a like also committed 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.590
 against the caretaker social networks at 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.599
 just like with your friends that you have 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.560
 at this point of android I say goodbye 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.560
 a short all
