impression that there's not enough space
but<00:03:05.290> actually<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:06.280> better<00:03:06.639> than<00:03:07.090> the

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
but actually it's better than the

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.250 
but actually it's better than the

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.380 
interspersed with chrome makes the dash
look<00:03:13.720> very<00:03:13.959> smart

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.020 

and<00:03:16.510> quality<00:03:17.319> of<00:03:17.650> materials<00:03:17.800> used<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.670> pretty

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
and quality of materials used is pretty

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.490 
and quality of materials used is pretty
good<00:03:19.240> too<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:22.600> seats<00:03:22.870> were<00:03:23.050> extremely

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
good too the seats were extremely

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.620 
good too the seats were extremely
comfortable<00:03:23.980> as<00:03:24.190> well<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.640> in<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.940> variant<00:03:25.420> I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
comfortable as well and in the variant I

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.260 
comfortable as well and in the variant I
had<00:03:25.900> only<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.650> driver<00:03:27.040> side<00:03:27.370> had<00:03:27.819> powered

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
had only the driver side had powered

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.620 
had only the driver side had powered
seats<00:03:30.569> passenger<00:03:31.569> had<00:03:32.020> a<00:03:32.050> manual<00:03:32.500> adjust

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
seats passenger had a manual adjust

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.910 
seats passenger had a manual adjust
visibility<00:03:34.630> from<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.900> driver<00:03:35.170> seat<00:03:35.440> is<00:03:35.650> good

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
visibility from the driver seat is good

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.770 
visibility from the driver seat is good
though<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.430> thought<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.940> steeply<00:03:37.180> raked<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
though I thought the steeply raked a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.750 
though I thought the steeply raked a
pillar<00:03:38.050> may<00:03:38.620> impair<00:03:39.040> one's<00:03:39.220> line<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:39.640> vision

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
pillar may impair one's line of vision

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:56.740 
pillar may impair one's line of vision
it<00:03:40.240> never<00:03:40.600> actually<00:03:40.870> did

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.840 

so<00:03:57.380> this<00:03:57.530> is<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.740> 2-liter<00:03:58.100> engine<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.730> I'm

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
so this is the 2-liter engine that I'm

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.820 
so this is the 2-liter engine that I'm
driving<00:03:59.330> now<00:03:59.360> it's<00:03:59.600> quite<00:03:59.810> nice<00:04:00.020> it's<00:04:00.380> refined

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
driving now it's quite nice it's refined

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.600 
driving now it's quite nice it's refined
it's<00:04:01.220> smooth<00:04:01.670> but<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:03.260> thing<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.580> that<00:04:04.580> even

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
it's smooth but the thing is that even

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.880 
it's smooth but the thing is that even
though<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.090> has<00:04:05.210> a<00:04:05.240> very<00:04:05.450> respectable<00:04:06.080> 20.2

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
though it has a very respectable 20.2

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.120 
though it has a very respectable 20.2
kgm<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.460> torque<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.850> comes<00:04:08.060> in<00:04:08.180> at<00:04:08.270> a<00:04:08.330> very<00:04:08.660> high

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
kgm of torque it comes in at a very high

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.240 
kgm of torque it comes in at a very high
4600<00:04:10.130> RPM<00:04:10.420> which<00:04:11.420> means<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:12.410> bottom<00:04:12.740> n<00:04:12.860> is<00:04:13.010> not

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
4600 RPM which means the bottom n is not

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.280 
4600 RPM which means the bottom n is not
as<00:04:13.430> peppy<00:04:13.790> it's<00:04:14.030> not<00:04:14.270> quick<00:04:14.570> off<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.750> line<00:04:14.900> so

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
as peppy it's not quick off the line so

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.660 
as peppy it's not quick off the line so
when<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.500> stop<00:04:15.860> and<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:16.100> put<00:04:16.340> your<00:04:16.459> foot<00:04:16.609> down

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
when you stop and you put your foot down

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.420 
when you stop and you put your foot down
again<00:04:17.239> it<00:04:17.720> just<00:04:18.230> doesn't<00:04:18.410> go<00:04:18.680> as<00:04:18.859> quick<00:04:19.310> as

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
again it just doesn't go as quick as

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.430 
again it just doesn't go as quick as
you'd<00:04:19.579> like<00:04:19.609> plus<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.540> gearbox<00:04:20.959> is<00:04:21.109> also<00:04:21.410> a

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
you'd like plus the gearbox is also a

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.210 
you'd like plus the gearbox is also a
little<00:04:21.829> lazy<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.610> react<00:04:23.740> but<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.980> thing<00:04:25.190> is

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
little lazy to react but the thing is

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.190 
little lazy to react but the thing is
that<00:04:25.400> in<00:04:25.640> India<00:04:25.820> we<00:04:26.270> will<00:04:26.450> probably<00:04:26.870> get<00:04:27.050> the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
that in India we will probably get the

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.460 
that in India we will probably get the
2.4<00:04:27.860> liter<00:04:28.100> version<00:04:28.510> for<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.540> car<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.020> that

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
2.4 liter version for the car and that

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:38.140 
2.4 liter version for the car and that
will<00:04:30.800> be<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:30.980> much<00:04:31.340> nicer<00:04:31.580> engine<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.450> drive<00:04:37.150> the

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
will be a much nicer engine to drive the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.820 
will be a much nicer engine to drive the
engines<00:04:38.510> lackluster<00:04:39.110> feel<00:04:39.320> was<00:04:39.560> also

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
engines lackluster feel was also

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.980 
engines lackluster feel was also
compounded<00:04:40.220> by<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.580> gearbox<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.419> felt<00:04:41.690> lazy

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
compounded by a gearbox that felt lazy

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.500 
compounded by a gearbox that felt lazy
it<00:04:42.740> was<00:04:42.950> slow<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.220> react<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:43.850> annoying<00:04:44.240> when

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
it was slow to react and annoying when

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.330 
it was slow to react and annoying when
one<00:04:44.660> wanted<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.020> overtake

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
you really have to press the pedal flat

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.830 
you really have to press the pedal flat
to<00:04:50.620> get<00:04:50.770> any<00:04:50.950> juice<00:04:51.280> out<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.880> car<00:04:54.750> so<00:04:55.750> the
