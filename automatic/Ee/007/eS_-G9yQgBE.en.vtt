you can get the pump separately but I

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.580 
you can get the pump separately but I

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.890 
think that overall Taurani is a really
excellent<00:04:40.710> product<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.430> every<00:04:42.300> month<00:04:42.510> they

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900
