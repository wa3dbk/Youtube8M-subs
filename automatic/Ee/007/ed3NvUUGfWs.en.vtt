00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
relate to each other right I guess the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.010 
relate to each other right I guess the
other<00:01:10.070> hooks<00:01:10.370> that<00:01:10.580> got<00:01:10.760> into<00:01:10.970> me<00:01:11.090> was<00:01:11.330> these

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
other hooks that got into me was these

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.550 
other hooks that got into me was these
people<00:01:12.410> here<00:01:12.950> new<00:01:13.250> people<00:01:13.550> in<00:01:14.330> particular

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
people here new people in particular

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.160 
people here new people in particular
it's<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.710> pretty<00:01:16.130> tight<00:01:16.550> group<00:01:16.960> there's<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.020> lot

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
it's a pretty tight group there's a lot

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.000 
it's a pretty tight group there's a lot
of<00:01:18.290> support<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.220> lot<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:21.380> on<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.800> job

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
of support and a lot of that on the job

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.100 
of support and a lot of that on the job
training<00:01:22.220> I<00:01:22.580> guess<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:23.180> happens<00:01:23.600> whereas<00:01:23.930> I

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
training I guess that happens whereas I

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.870 
training I guess that happens whereas I
don't<00:01:24.470> think<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:24.920> necessary<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.550> happens

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
don't think that necessary that happens

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.640 
don't think that necessary that happens
in<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.060> places<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.660> know<00:01:27.140> if<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.470> push
