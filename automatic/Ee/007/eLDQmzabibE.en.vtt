00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.220
 the note 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.660
 we will treat what is known as 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.240
 Mesoamerica constituted by 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.570
 civilizations that developed in 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.420
 Central America from 1400 before 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.369
 the Christian era of Mesoamerica we will see 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.650
 the most outstanding civilizations 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.869
 such as the Olmec with its 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.300
 monumental heads sculpted in 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.570
 the Toltec stone that marked the zenith of 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.390
 militarism in the region and also the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.480
 Aztec who achieved an amazing empire in 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.820
 the center and south of what is now Mexico 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.320
 and of course the known Mayan culture 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.930
 for its indisputable advances 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.130
 scientists 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.590
 in mesoamerica the largest city and 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.290
 important of the region was Teotihuacán 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.140
 whose civilization influenced all 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.480
 mentioned later we will go south 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.180
 where we will deal with the great Inca empire 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.910
 by extension and by its developed 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 civilization truncated with the arrival of 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.420
 the conquerors to the continent 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.100
 what we know as mesoamerica has 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.380
 understood civilizations that 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.860
 developed in Central America from 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.810
 of 1,400 before Christ- period in the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.240
 that the cities were growing already 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.520
 early in the Christian era the first 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.920
 pre-Columbian Mexico City had 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.400
 reached urban dimensions and domain

 commercial in teotihuacán valley of mexico 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.060
 in the classic period between the year 292 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.400
 until 900 of the Christian era the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.560
 olmeca civilization in the jungle of the 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.900
 The coast of the Gulf of Mexico had a 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.180
 capital with palaces temples and 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.760
 monuments built on a huge 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.850
 platform 50 meters high and 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.920
 about 16 kilometers the Olmecs 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.590
 They present sculptures in large blocks 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.290
 of stone and fine works of small 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.930
 axes and figurines carved in jade and 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.390
 obsidian its art is typical of a 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.310
 very developed society with the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.980
 Olmecs appear the oldest 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.560
 planned ceremonial centers that 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.020
 they know in Mesoamerica and they consist 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.600
 essentially on platforms made of 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.200
 compact earth or also of adobe or 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.989
 sun-dried clay blocks

 san lorenzo one of the first of these 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.550
 ceremonial centers was built in 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.670
 a plateau raised by a 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.220
 gigantic labor of land hauling its 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.290
 Urban planning reveals an axis 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.120
 that integrates platforms and one of the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.060
 first ball game courts 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.950
 Oakley characteristic in all 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.290
 Mesoamerican cultures where 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.440
 players simulate the layout of the 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.170
 cosmos 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.140
 the Toltec culture whose members are 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.850
 they know as the master builders 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.040
 marked the zenith of militarism in 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.530
 mesoamerica since the army 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.920
 Toltec used its greatest potential to

 dominate the neighboring societies the village 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.660
 Toltec created a refined culture that 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.150
 it included knowledge about the foundry 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.130
 metal working of stone 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.190
 distillation and astronomy

 the remains of tula its main city 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.590
 include three pyramidal temples of the 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.950
 which the biggest one was dedicated to 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.990
 his deity the quetzalcoatl or snake 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.350
 feathered 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.390
 from the 14th century to the 16th century a 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.940
 village famous for its organization in 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.520
 Mesoamerica is the Aztec culture or 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.740
 mexica empire that dominated the center and 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.600
 south of present Mexico and that finally 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.540
 It was destroyed by the conquerors 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.300
 Spaniards and their allies the chs caltech 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.730
 us this powerful culture that had a 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.640
 society divided into three slaves 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.800
 plebeians and nobles arises from a legend 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.380
 according to which they would found a great 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.440
 civilization in a swampy area in the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.320
 that they saw a nopal or cactus on a 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.870
 rock and above him an eagle devouring a 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.720
 snake and there they were able to 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.080
 consolidate a powerful empire in just 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.630
 two centuries the Aztecs converted the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.110

 Chinampas very fertile gardens are 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.400
 they made roads and bridges to 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.620
 connect the city with the mainland 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.780
 they raised aqueducts and dug 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.630
 channels throughout the city for the 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.240
 transport of goods and persons 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.950

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.740
 territory in what is now Guatemala and

 el salvador agriculture constituted the 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.180
 basis of its economy since the time

 pre-Columbian and corn its main 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.790
 culture 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.250
 the Mayan culture produced an architecture 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:18.170
 monumental of which ruins are conserved

 ceremonial coexist various styles 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.760
 architectural features that stand out 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.530
 the small columns attached crosses 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.870
 added to the masks of the

 Latino since with the arrival of 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.120
 conquerors were lost valuable and

 Colombia 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:05.340
 as well as Ecuador equator and essentially 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.370
 perú its value lies in the ability 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.580
 to spread order and manage the 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.169
 Andean system in a large territory 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.780
 it was a theocracy based on 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:18.060
 agriculture and in the aid system 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.970
 or kinship groups dominated by the

 mortar like the Temple of the Sun in Cusco 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.490
 were built with a minimum of 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.740
 engineering equipment other achievements 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.140
 highlights include the construction of 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.570
 suspension bridges made of rope 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.300
 channels for irrigation and aqueducts

 own and original to his works that he 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.090
 based on a simplification of the forms 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.800
 by means of geometric volumes 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.470
 simple ones and a schematization of the

 sobriety geometry and synthesis 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:33.200
 tending more to the practical and functional 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.200
 that formally
