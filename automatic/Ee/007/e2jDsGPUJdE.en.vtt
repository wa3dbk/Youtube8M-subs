00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
hey all Alan hear from mb motorsports in

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.910 
hey all Alan hear from mb motorsports in
Tinton<00:00:07.729> Falls<00:00:07.759> New<00:00:08.179> Jersey<00:00:08.600> and<00:00:08.840> right<00:00:09.769> now

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
Tinton Falls New Jersey and right now

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.650 
Tinton Falls New Jersey and right now
I'm<00:00:10.039> going<00:00:10.190> to<00:00:10.250> talk<00:00:10.430> about<00:00:10.580> something<00:00:11.119> that's

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
I'm going to talk about something that's

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.579 
I'm going to talk about something that's
on<00:00:12.549> almost<00:00:13.549> every<00:00:14.000> car<00:00:14.240> and<00:00:14.599> now<00:00:15.169> is<00:00:15.379> actually

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589 
on almost every car and now is actually

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.400 
on almost every car and now is actually
mandatory<00:00:16.279> it's<00:00:16.820> called<00:00:17.029> the<00:00:17.150> tpms<00:00:18.050> monitor

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
mandatory it's called the tpms monitor

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.990 
mandatory it's called the tpms monitor
which<00:00:18.560> is<00:00:18.680> the<00:00:18.830> tire<00:00:19.099> pressure<00:00:19.460> monitoring

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
which is the tire pressure monitoring

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.660 
which is the tire pressure monitoring
system<00:00:20.680> and<00:00:21.680> it's<00:00:21.830> actually<00:00:22.220> part<00:00:22.519> of<00:00:22.609> the

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
system and it's actually part of the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.230 
system and it's actually part of the
valve<00:00:22.910> which<00:00:23.269> is<00:00:23.449> in<00:00:23.660> your<00:00:24.050> tire<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:25.119> what<00:00:26.119> it

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
valve which is in your tire and what it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.689 
valve which is in your tire and what it
does<00:00:26.420> it<00:00:26.599> is<00:00:26.720> constantly<00:00:27.470> just<00:00:28.130> measuring<00:00:28.550> the

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
does it is constantly just measuring the

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.910 
does it is constantly just measuring the
tire<00:00:28.910> pressure<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:29.570> then<00:00:30.320> if<00:00:30.470> there's<00:00:30.650> a<00:00:30.710> tire

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
tire pressure and then if there's a tire

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.040 
tire pressure and then if there's a tire
pressure<00:00:31.099> fluctuation<00:00:32.029> or<00:00:32.210> anything

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
pressure fluctuation or anything

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.890 
pressure fluctuation or anything
different<00:00:33.530> it<00:00:33.890> will<00:00:34.040> let<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.879> driver<00:00:35.150> know<00:00:35.330> so

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
different it will let the driver know so

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.100 
different it will let the driver know so
you<00:00:35.960> can<00:00:36.170> either<00:00:36.260> add<00:00:36.850> you<00:00:37.850> know<00:00:37.970> more<00:00:38.629> air<00:00:38.839> or

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
you can either add you know more air or

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.430 
you can either add you know more air or
whatever<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:39.530> need<00:00:39.739> to<00:00:40.750> now<00:00:41.750> that<00:00:41.989> these<00:00:42.229> are

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
whatever you need to now that these are

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.859 
whatever you need to now that these are
in<00:00:42.589> all<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.250> cars<00:00:43.699> they<00:00:44.420> are<00:00:44.570> kind<00:00:44.809> of

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:44.869 
in all the cars they are kind of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:46.570 
in all the cars they are kind of
expensive<00:00:45.019> if<00:00:45.440> something<00:00:45.830> breaks<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:46.460> I

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
expensive if something breaks and I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.180 
expensive if something breaks and I
spoke<00:00:46.909> to<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.089> couple<00:00:47.239> different<00:00:47.449> mechanics

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
spoke to a couple different mechanics

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.189 
spoke to a couple different mechanics
and<00:00:49.190> they<00:00:50.150> just<00:00:50.420> see<00:00:50.570> them<00:00:50.720> constantly

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
and they just see them constantly

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.840 
and they just see them constantly
breaking<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:51.890> they're<00:00:52.250> not<00:00:52.400> cheap<00:00:52.460> either

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
breaking and they're not cheap either

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.479 
breaking and they're not cheap either
because<00:00:53.299> you<00:00:53.420> got<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.659> think<00:00:53.809> there<00:00:54.500> are<00:00:54.799> there

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
because you got to think there are there

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.579 
because you got to think there are there
wireless<00:00:55.850> sensors<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:56.900> they're<00:00:57.049> going<00:00:57.199> into

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
wireless sensors so they're going into

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.609 
wireless sensors so they're going into
the<00:00:57.680> tire<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.250> they<00:00:59.150> send<00:00:59.449> it<00:00:59.540> to<00:00:59.689> receiver

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:00.619 
the tire and they send it to receiver

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.490 
the tire and they send it to receiver
inside<00:01:01.010> your<00:01:01.640> car<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.199> there's<00:01:03.199> obviously

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
inside your car and there's obviously

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.039 
inside your car and there's obviously
four<00:01:03.769> sensors<00:01:04.330> and<00:01:05.330> they<00:01:05.479> can<00:01:05.659> be<00:01:05.689> about<00:01:06.020> a

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
four sensors and they can be about a

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.020 
four sensors and they can be about a
hundred<00:01:06.260> or<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:06.560> dollars<00:01:06.860> some<00:01:07.430> need<00:01:07.610> actual

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
hundred or so dollars some need actual

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.020 
hundred or so dollars some need actual
programming<00:01:08.509> if<00:01:08.869> one<00:01:09.200> breaks<00:01:09.490> but<00:01:10.490> there<00:01:11.000> are

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
programming if one breaks but there are

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.609 
programming if one breaks but there are
a<00:01:11.149> couple<00:01:11.299> different<00:01:11.509> options<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:12.229> make<00:01:12.409> sure

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
a couple different options to make sure

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.700 
a couple different options to make sure
that<00:01:12.920> you're<00:01:13.490> taking<00:01:14.329> care<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.600> them<00:01:14.899> now<00:01:15.439> my

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
that you're taking care of them now my

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.419 
that you're taking care of them now my
car<00:01:15.979> have<00:01:16.159> a<00:01:16.189> 2008<00:01:17.030> mazda6<00:01:17.859> one<00:01:18.859> of<00:01:18.950> my<00:01:19.070> tire

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
car have a 2008 mazda6 one of my tire

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:22.120 
car have a 2008 mazda6 one of my tire
pressure<00:01:19.759> sensors<00:01:20.240> actually<00:01:20.929> was<00:01:21.679> destroyed

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
pressure sensors actually was destroyed

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.499 
pressure sensors actually was destroyed
and<00:01:22.719> this<00:01:23.719> was<00:01:23.929> due<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:26.119> was<00:01:26.240> actually

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
and this was due to it was actually

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.239 
and this was due to it was actually
something<00:01:26.630> stupid<00:01:27.079> not<00:01:27.740> even<00:01:27.890> really

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
something stupid not even really

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:31.929 
something stupid not even really
thinking<00:01:28.640> I<00:01:28.820> bought<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.979> new<00:01:30.979> tire<00:01:31.310> cap<00:01:31.640> and

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
thinking I bought a new tire cap and

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.200 
thinking I bought a new tire cap and
there<00:01:32.929> were<00:01:33.310> they<00:01:34.310> look<00:01:34.520> like<00:01:34.670> these<00:01:34.880> chrome

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
there were they look like these chrome

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.120 
there were they look like these chrome
tire<00:01:35.450> caps<00:01:35.719> but<00:01:35.899> actually<00:01:36.170> had<00:01:36.319> brass<00:01:36.619> inside

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
tire caps but actually had brass inside

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.789 
tire caps but actually had brass inside
and<00:01:37.399> because<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.119> these<00:01:38.329> are<00:01:38.719> mostly<00:01:39.289> made<00:01:39.649> of

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
and because of these are mostly made of

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.630 
and because of these are mostly made of
aluminum<00:01:40.420> what<00:01:41.420> happened<00:01:41.899> was<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:43.189> brass

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
aluminum what happened was the brass

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.959 
aluminum what happened was the brass
inside<00:01:44.509> of<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.619> actual<00:01:46.069> chrome<00:01:46.399> looking<00:01:46.759> tire

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969

cause a galvanic corrosion to happen and

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.020 
cause a galvanic corrosion to happen and
pretty<00:01:54.710> much<00:01:54.799> cease<00:01:55.189> because<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:55.639> wasn't

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
pretty much cease because I wasn't

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.590 
pretty much cease because I wasn't
always<00:01:56.179> taking<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:56.749> on<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.079> off<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:58.039> luckily

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
always taking it on and off so luckily

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.029 
always taking it on and off so luckily
three<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.719> the<00:01:59.810> four<00:02:00.020> tires<00:02:00.259> i<00:02:00.619> was<00:02:00.770> able<00:02:00.920> to

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
three of the four tires i was able to

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.289 
three of the four tires i was able to
remove<00:02:01.719> the<00:02:02.719> cap<00:02:02.959> and<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:04.340> last<00:02:04.579> hire<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.119> was

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
remove the cap and the last hire it was

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.929 
remove the cap and the last hire it was
completely<00:02:05.899> stuck<00:02:06.439> and<00:02:06.709> what<00:02:07.189> i<00:02:07.219> did<00:02:07.520> i<00:02:07.549> just

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
completely stuck and what i did i just

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.120 
completely stuck and what i did i just
tried<00:02:08.240> pretty<00:02:08.959> much<00:02:09.050> with<00:02:09.319> all<00:02:09.350> my<00:02:09.619> might<00:02:09.770> held

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
tried pretty much with all my might held

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
to this I found one actually on ebay was

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.039 
to this I found one actually on ebay was
about<00:02:41.099> 20<00:02:41.909> or<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.209> dollars<00:02:42.329> but<00:02:42.750> if<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.959> have

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
about 20 or so dollars but if you have

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.959 
about 20 or so dollars but if you have
to<00:02:43.170> replace<00:02:43.379> two<00:02:43.799> three<00:02:44.250> or<00:02:44.400> four<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.819> them

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
to replace two three or four of them

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:46.729 
to replace two three or four of them
it's<00:02:45.540> going<00:02:45.659> to<00:02:45.719> be<00:02:45.780> pretty<00:02:45.870> expensive<00:02:46.200> and

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
it's going to be pretty expensive and

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.020 
it's going to be pretty expensive and
you<00:02:46.859> really<00:02:47.159> can't<00:02:47.340> get<00:02:47.489> them<00:02:47.579> from<00:02:47.700> junkyards

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.149 
you really can't get them from junkyards
either<00:02:48.420> because<00:02:48.900> they<00:02:49.530> want<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.859> sell<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
either because they want to sell the

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.199 
either because they want to sell the
whole<00:02:50.340> tire<00:02:50.579> system<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:52.669> it's<00:02:53.669> a<00:02:53.790> real<00:02:53.970> pain

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
whole tire system so it's a real pain

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.300 
whole tire system so it's a real pain
but<00:02:55.169> it's<00:02:55.439> definitely<00:02:55.650> something<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.069> you

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
but it's definitely something that you

but it's definitely something that you
need<00:02:56.569> in<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.780> mazda<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.200> know<00:02:58.489> they<00:02:59.489> recommend

recommend getting it because sometimes

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.569
