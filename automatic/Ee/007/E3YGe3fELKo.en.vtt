00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.069
 and the vehicle was here on the way 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.070
 Puncture probably very moderate »with the suspension 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.579
 So the car at least 1 percent 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.619
 Ms. Homburger should also all crises accident her 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.149
 Wiesbaden dpa 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.700
 which the company is involved in a role 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.740
 but the shell over 30 can do that in the race Magna me this 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.740
 Aggressiveness of Allan McNish 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.310
 I hope you understand 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.470
 it is in the tire piles for a long time 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.240
 Of course, a beaten-up car has now looked terrible the safety car 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
 is quite logically broken down in the car outside 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.380
 that's this interlude between gt to prototypes did not work 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.120
 Ferrari has closed "the principal has lies 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.900
 is being negotiated 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.930
 «From what at that time 13 3 Mio 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.229
 tapped and principle 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.510
 unfortunately in a different direction 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.830
 catapults as he wanted to drive and after the heavy impact in the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.360
 tire wall 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.420
 and to be different because neither the spectators nor the photographer and also 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.960
 if he did nothing 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.670
 because of that some parts fly around more 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.720
 As I said, it is hard to work out the tires and the tires 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.180
 Safety of the vehicles 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.790
 buy or even gates 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.970
 while Ferrari had sat Anthony Beltoise 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.810
 yes I think times could not see him in the rearview mirror you can see 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.970
 probably only 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.500
 a car 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.510
 so what just seen more Container Line Audi see the other 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.170
 Not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.650
 12 Sébastien Loeb from the under or confiscated one can call it that but 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.979
 I guess he did not think Elson could come by car 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.470
 that does not even see what soft top clear that car buyers 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.470
 the angry and falling frightened faces at the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.680
 clearly the EISA Belgian is developed 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.540
 wait there 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.980
 thank goodness shaken certainly 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.200
 speaks for the safety of the vehicles have thank God absolutely 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.519
 great moving moments imprinted Wolfgang Ullrich 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.759
 that was looked violent 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.729
 we have had an accident we have not seen for many years 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.139
 I have to say Mohr 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.139
 more violent than quick-witted 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.519
 Gabriel I say I'm not so relieved and so completely 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.499
 calms the world that is seen there but there are a lot of shares turned over and 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.989
 The spectators are quiet as there is definitely in the direction of photographers 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.439
 Marshal I was not aware that all the others really were 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.179
 also hail are not affected by this trauma 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.589
 is that true very good but leak me nothing happened but is a job 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.959
 could have caught the hail really bad but the Council what 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.169
 after one flown in so that he already 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.049
 an ugly thing that did not get along well anymore 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.080
 it was almost almost of both safety standards today 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.589
 but expect Neubauer impact but the big question something like this he is behind 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.289
 the guardrail happens 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:02.209
 On the one hand, luck that it did not pass over the guardrail 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.229
 also that Rainer Barzel fractions second home Burda on the 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:07.099
 fly another side 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.689
 For me it was still pretty bad can go out absolutely that was the 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.499
 biggest NUK he says that the car has not gone over the guardrail 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.599
 into the photographers crowd in there 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.279
 After all, openly, that's not really what you want 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.329
 flying parts became
