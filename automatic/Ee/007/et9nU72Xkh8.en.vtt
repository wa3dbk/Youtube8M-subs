dark wood they also have a light wood
one<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.560> I'd<00:00:28.949> kind<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.660> dark<00:00:30.869> wood

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
one but I'd kind of like the dark wood

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.799 
one but I'd kind of like the dark wood
design<00:00:31.439> better<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.610> see<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.210> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
design better and as you can see here I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.780 
design better and as you can see here I
carbons<00:00:34.680> really<00:00:35.010> paid<00:00:35.219> attention<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
carbons really paid attention to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.630 
carbons really paid attention to
precision<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:37.020> install<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.649> quite<00:00:38.100> simple

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
precision the install was quite simple

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.910 
precision the install was quite simple
all<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.149> needed<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> blow<00:00:40.559> dryer

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
all I needed to do is get a blow dryer

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.080 
all I needed to do is get a blow dryer
and<00:00:41.840> if<00:00:42.840> something<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.770> wrinkled<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.700> if

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and if something got wrinkled or if

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.600 
and if something got wrinkled or if
there<00:00:45.300> were<00:00:45.510> air<00:00:46.289> bubbles<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:47.520> have

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
there were air bubbles then I could have

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.299 
there were air bubbles then I could have
easily<00:00:47.760> gotten<00:00:48.360> rid<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> them<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.129> here's<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
easily gotten rid of them so here's the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.479 
easily gotten rid of them so here's the
back<00:00:50.489> let<00:00:50.850> me<00:00:50.969> flip<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> over<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.870> see

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
back let me flip it over as you can see

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.979 
back let me flip it over as you can see
it's<00:00:53.489> brushed<00:00:54.680> would<00:00:55.680> sort<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.690> but<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.809> not

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it's brushed would sort of but it's not

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.229 
it's brushed would sort of but it's not
metal<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.399> brushwood<00:00:59.910> because

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
metal it's just it's brushwood because

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.930 
metal it's just it's brushwood because
they<00:01:00.390> polished<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.230> also<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.760> see

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
that were not perfectly aligned and they

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.399 
that were not perfectly aligned and they
wouldn't<00:02:15.519> fit<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.090> they<00:02:16.810> would<00:02:17.049> just<00:02:17.260> screw

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
wouldn't fit and they would just screw

taking my ideas my DSLR my nikon d50 100

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.599 
taking my ideas my DSLR my nikon d50 100
but<00:03:04.629> overall<00:03:04.959> i<00:03:05.379> definitely<00:03:06.069> recommend<00:03:06.159> the

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
but overall i definitely recommend the

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.030 
but overall i definitely recommend the
skin<00:03:06.909> especially<00:03:07.450> for<00:03:07.989> its<00:03:08.170> cheap<00:03:08.409> price<00:03:08.709> and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
skin especially for its cheap price and

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.339 
skin especially for its cheap price and
if<00:03:09.609> you<00:03:09.730> can't<00:03:09.970> afford<00:03:10.150> both<00:03:10.629> sides<00:03:11.019> because

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
if you can't afford both sides because

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.960 
if you can't afford both sides because
they<00:03:11.530> come<00:03:11.709> in<00:03:11.829> a<00:03:11.889> package<00:03:12.129> i<00:03:12.549> would

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
they come in a package i would

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.190 
they come in a package i would
definitely<00:03:13.180> recommend<00:03:13.329> getting<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.989> back

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
definitely recommend getting the back

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.929 
definitely recommend getting the back
over<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> front<00:03:14.980> because<00:03:15.430> they're<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.760> same

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
over the front because they're the same

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.240 
over the front because they're the same
price<00:03:16.120> for<00:03:16.420> one<00:03:16.629> and<00:03:16.840> for<00:03:16.870> two<00:03:17.379> i'm<00:03:17.680> just<00:03:17.919> much

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
price for one and for two i'm just much

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.189 
price for one and for two i'm just much
more<00:03:18.459> fun<00:03:18.699> in<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:18.910> back<00:03:19.120> because<00:03:19.780> it's<00:03:19.989> much

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
more fun in the back because it's much

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.949 
more fun in the back because it's much
more<00:03:20.760> attracting<00:03:21.760> not<00:03:22.030> attractive<00:03:22.629> but<00:03:22.810> a

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
more attracting not attractive but a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.110 
more attracting not attractive but a
track<00:03:23.260> thing<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.769> they're<00:03:24.340> both<00:03:24.459> attractive

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
this one fits perfectly and i would

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.890 
this one fits perfectly and i would
definitely<00:03:51.639> recommend<00:03:51.849> it<00:03:52.180> overall<00:03:52.510> it's<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
definitely recommend it overall it's the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.819 
definitely recommend it overall it's the
best<00:03:53.139> of<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.379> best<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:55.079> i'm<00:03:56.079> not<00:03:56.349> saying<00:03:56.769> that

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
best of the best and i'm not saying that

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.229 
best of the best and i'm not saying that
because<00:03:57.069> they<00:03:57.280> paid<00:03:57.459> me<00:03:57.519> understand<00:03:58.060> that

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
because they paid me understand that

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.839
