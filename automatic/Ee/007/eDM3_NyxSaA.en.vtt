00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
strut to the knuckle so it's the first

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.439 
strut to the knuckle so it's the first
one<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.359> the<00:00:27.359> second<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.960> right<00:00:28.140> below<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
one and the second one is right below it

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.200

and then take off the three bolts on the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.819 
and then take off the three bolts on the
top<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.290> inside<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.800> engine<00:00:35.010> bay<00:00:36.829> and

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
top this is inside the engine bay and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.319 
top this is inside the engine bay and
after<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.399> you'll<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.730> ready<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> actually

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
after that you'll be ready to actually

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.750 
after that you'll be ready to actually
remove<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.140> entire<00:00:40.440> strut<00:00:40.920> from<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> car

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
remove the entire strut from the car

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.670 
remove the entire strut from the car
okay<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.899> might<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.200> bit<00:00:46.289> stuck<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
okay so might be a little bit stuck to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.990 
okay so might be a little bit stuck to
the<00:00:46.770> knuckle<00:00:47.070> worried<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.820> hit<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the knuckle worried about it just hit it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.369 
the knuckle worried about it just hit it
and<00:00:48.570> it'll<00:00:48.960> come<00:00:49.200> off<00:00:50.239> okay<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and it'll come off okay and so if you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.830 
and it'll come off okay and so if you
need<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.789> compress<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.239> take<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> top<00:00:54.660> hat

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you'll learn how to do the spring

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.310 
you'll learn how to do the spring
compressor<00:01:05.510> okay<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.600> once<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.200> out

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
compressor okay so once you get it out

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.170 
compressor okay so once you get it out
it's<00:01:07.890> pretty<00:01:08.220> much<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> sort<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.760> first<00:01:08.909> order

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
it's pretty much the sort of first order

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.740 
it's pretty much the sort of first order
so<00:01:09.590> put<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.740> strut<00:01:11.520> back<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.360> bowl<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
so put this strut back in that bowl is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480 
so put this strut back in that bowl is
actually<00:01:13.020> bigger<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.830> put<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
actually bigger so put that one on the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.030 
actually bigger so put that one on the
top<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.780> camber<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
top it's because of your camber so you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
top it's because of your camber so you
need<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> top<00:01:17.880> okay<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
need to have that in the top okay and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.030 
need to have that in the top okay and
then<00:01:18.659> put<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.380> put<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> two<00:01:19.799> bolts

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
then put the you know put the two bolts

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.730 
then put the you know put the two bolts
back<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:21.780> lining<00:01:22.049> up<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.409> that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
back in if it's not lining up like that

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.039 
back in if it's not lining up like that
really<00:01:23.340> easily<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.240> video<00:01:24.630> take

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
really easily like in this video take

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.690 
really easily like in this video take
the<00:01:25.170> other<00:01:25.320> strut<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> other<00:01:26.400> side

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the other strut out of the other side

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.420 
the other strut out of the other side
and<00:01:27.020> it'll<00:01:28.020> lock<00:01:28.170> your<00:01:28.470> problems<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:29.009> beyond

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and it'll lock your problems just beyond

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.600 
and it'll lock your problems just beyond
this<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> we'll<00:01:31.799> basically<00:01:32.100> put<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> bolts

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
this so we'll basically put the bolts

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.490 
this so we'll basically put the bolts
back<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:33.450> put<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> two<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.290> three

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
back in and then put the two the three

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.560 
back in and then put the two the three
top<00:01:34.740> bolts<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.119> you're<00:01:36.329> good<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.630> go<00:01:37.009> for

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
top bolts on and you're good to go for

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.440 
top bolts on and you're good to go for
the<00:01:39.570> back<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:41.130> pretty<00:01:41.430> much<00:01:41.610> same<00:01:41.850> thing<00:01:42.270> I'm

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the back it's pretty much same thing I'm

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.429

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
middle too so it's kind of right near

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.949

middle<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.980> have<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.190> take<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.819> backrest

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
middle so have to I take the backrest

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.780 
middle so have to I take the backrest
and<00:02:41.900> it's<00:02:42.620> connected<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.010> these<00:02:43.220> three<00:02:43.550> hooks

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
and it's connected to these three hooks

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.790 
and it's connected to these three hooks
so<00:02:44.240> here's<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> first<00:02:44.660> one<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.080> middle<00:02:45.320> it

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
so here's the first one in the middle it

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.680 
so here's the first one in the middle it
looks<00:02:45.860> like<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.550> then<00:02:46.640> there's<00:02:47.120> one<00:02:47.570> on

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
looks like that and then there's one on

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.830 
looks like that and then there's one on
each<00:02:47.840> side<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.260> look<00:02:48.380> like<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:49.390> okay<00:02:50.390> so

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
each side that look like this okay so

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.360 
each side that look like this okay so
then<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.350> only<00:02:51.380> other<00:02:51.530> difference<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:52.160> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
then the only other difference is the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.340 
then the only other difference is the
way<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.700> brake<00:02:52.910> line<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.270> held<00:02:53.450> in<00:02:53.600> it's

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
way that the brake line is held in it's

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.780 
way that the brake line is held in it's
just<00:02:54.590> held<00:02:54.739> in<00:02:54.860> by<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.100> clip<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:55.489> it's<00:02:55.610> just<00:02:55.670> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
just held in by this clip so it's just a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.190 
just held in by this clip so it's just a
hammer<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.209> pop<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.540> out<00:02:57.520> just<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.200> then

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
hammer and pop it out just that and then

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.220 
hammer and pop it out just that and then
