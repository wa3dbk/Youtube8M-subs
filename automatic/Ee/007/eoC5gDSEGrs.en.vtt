00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.620 

I<00:00:21.610> think<00:00:22.610> the<00:00:22.730> first<00:00:22.940> thing<00:00:23.030> I'd<00:00:23.240> like<00:00:23.390> to<00:00:23.480> talk

I think the first thing I'd like to talk

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.570 
I think the first thing I'd like to talk
about<00:00:23.690> is<00:00:24.110> an<00:00:24.230> anchor<00:00:24.470> trolley<00:00:24.740> system<00:00:25.070> like

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
about is an anchor trolley system like

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.750 
about is an anchor trolley system like
any<00:00:25.790> kind<00:00:26.060> of<00:00:26.210> fishing<00:00:26.930> you<00:00:27.200> do<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.830> critical

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
any kind of fishing you do the critical

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.580 
any kind of fishing you do the critical
part<00:00:29.029> of<00:00:29.180> it<00:00:29.390> is<00:00:29.570> being<00:00:29.779> able<00:00:29.990> to<00:00:30.140> present<00:00:30.349> your

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
part of it is being able to present your

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.510 
part of it is being able to present your
bait<00:00:31.480> to<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.510> fish<00:00:32.900> and<00:00:33.200> able<00:00:33.830> to<00:00:33.920> do<00:00:34.070> in<00:00:34.370> the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
bait to the fish and able to do in the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.150 
bait to the fish and able to do in the
order<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.600> do<00:00:35.840> that<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:36.410> need<00:00:36.590> to<00:00:36.650> be<00:00:36.830> able<00:00:36.980> to

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
order to do that you need to be able to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.310 
order to do that you need to be able to
position<00:00:37.520> your<00:00:38.030> boat<00:00:38.270> and<00:00:38.629> that's<00:00:38.780> what<00:00:39.110> the

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
position your boat and that's what the

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.439 
position your boat and that's what the
anchor<00:00:39.800> trolley<00:00:40.100> system<00:00:40.489> does<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.239> just

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
anchor trolley system does it just

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.170 
anchor trolley system does it just
basically<00:00:41.720> changes<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:43.370> anchor<00:00:43.730> point<00:00:43.970> on

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
basically changes the anchor point on

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.060 
basically changes the anchor point on
the<00:00:44.330> side<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:44.809> boat<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:45.290> you<00:00:45.320> can<00:00:45.590> fish<00:00:45.830> up

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
the side of the boat so you can fish up

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.009 
the side of the boat so you can fish up
current<00:00:46.460> down<00:00:46.670> current<00:00:47.210> or<00:00:47.360> side<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.809> current

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
current down current or side the current

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.250 
current down current or side the current
or<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.590> wind<00:00:48.860> or<00:00:49.370> just<00:00:49.940> any<00:00:50.210> anyhow<00:00:50.780> any<00:00:51.080> way

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260

or the wind or just any anyhow any way
you<00:00:51.320> want<00:00:51.650> to<00:00:51.739> position<00:00:52.040> it<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:52.790> can<00:00:52.970> use<00:00:53.120> it

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
you want to position it you can use it

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.709 
you want to position it you can use it
with<00:00:53.480> my<00:00:53.690> stake<00:00:53.989> out<00:00:54.230> Pole<00:00:54.790> and<00:00:55.790> this<00:00:56.329> is<00:00:56.540> for

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
with my stake out Pole and this is for

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.479 
with my stake out Pole and this is for
shallow<00:00:56.960> water<00:00:57.110> you<00:00:57.380> just<00:00:57.590> drive<00:00:57.980> this<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.399> the

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
shallow water you just drive this in the

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.670 
shallow water you just drive this in the
ground<00:00:58.700> and<00:00:59.360> then<00:00:59.719> you<00:00:59.870> can<00:01:00.050> position<00:01:00.379> the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
ground and then you can position the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.709 
ground and then you can position the
boat<00:01:00.860> on<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.190> pole<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.790> you<00:01:02.420> have<00:01:02.540> to

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
boat on the pole that you have to

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.689 
boat on the pole that you have to
imagine<00:01:03.140> that<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.410> boat<00:01:03.649> moves<00:01:04.009> the<00:01:04.250> pole<00:01:04.489> is

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
imagine that the boat moves the pole is

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.440 
imagine that the boat moves the pole is
stationary<00:01:05.239> in<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.390> boat<00:01:05.630> moves<00:01:07.240> if<00:01:08.240> you're

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
stationary in the boat moves if you're

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.770 
stationary in the boat moves if you're
using<00:01:08.690> if<00:01:09.259> you're<00:01:09.470> fishing<00:01:09.680> deeper<00:01:10.190> waters

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
using if you're fishing deeper waters

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.070 
using if you're fishing deeper waters
you<00:01:11.780> wouldn't<00:01:12.080> be<00:01:12.170> using<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:13.869> stake<00:01:14.869> out

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
you wouldn't be using the the stake out

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.020 
you wouldn't be using the the stake out
pole<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:15.680> would<00:01:15.800> probably<00:01:16.369> be<00:01:16.490> using<00:01:16.910> an

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
pole you would probably be using an

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.570 
pole you would probably be using an
anchor<00:01:17.210> if<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.690> were<00:01:17.810> fishing<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.289> pond<00:01:18.560> or<00:01:19.520> a

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
anchor if you were fishing a pond or a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.730 
anchor if you were fishing a pond or a
lake<00:01:19.729> situation<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.899> stake<00:01:21.140> out<00:01:21.320> pole<00:01:21.530> is

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
lake situation the stake out pole is

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.350 
lake situation the stake out pole is
used<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.100> lot<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.550> flats<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.090> really

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
used a lot on the flats and really

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.560 
used a lot on the flats and really
shallow<00:01:23.600> written<00:01:24.050> rivers<00:01:24.610> so<00:01:25.610> if<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:25.880> if

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
shallow written rivers so if you if

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.859 
shallow written rivers so if you if
you're<00:01:26.869> fishing<00:01:27.350> an<00:01:27.439> anchor<00:01:28.780> there<00:01:29.780> are

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
you're fishing an anchor there are

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.570 
you're fishing an anchor there are
several<00:01:30.080> different<00:01:30.530> types<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.920> anchors<00:01:31.100> most

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
several different types of anchors most

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.850 
several different types of anchors most
people<00:01:32.000> use<00:01:32.180> these<00:01:32.420> this<00:01:33.260> type<00:01:33.500> of<00:01:33.530> anchor

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
people use these this type of anchor

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.679 
people use these this type of anchor
it's<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.220> fold<00:01:34.490> up<00:01:34.670> anchor<00:01:34.880> because<00:01:35.330> it<00:01:35.479> takes

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
it's a fold up anchor because it takes

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.190 
it's a fold up anchor because it takes
up<00:01:35.869> very<00:01:35.900> little<00:01:36.140> room<00:01:36.500> in<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.770> boat<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.600> you

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
up very little room in the boat and you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.380 
up very little room in the boat and you
it's<00:01:39.590> got<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:39.950> float<00:01:40.189> on<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.549> end<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.909> it<00:01:41.090> your

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
it's got to float on the end of it your

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.420 
it's got to float on the end of it your
route<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:41.600> double<00:01:42.170> loop<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.650> line<00:01:42.830> over<00:01:43.220> like

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
route you double loop the line over like

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.249 
route you double loop the line over like
this<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.119> run<00:01:44.299> it<00:01:44.450> through<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:45.049> bottom

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
this and you run it through the bottom

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.270 
this and you run it through the bottom
of<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.710> ring<00:01:46.960> like<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.530> clean<00:01:49.009> it<00:01:49.159> off

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
of the ring like that and clean it off

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.109 
of the ring like that and clean it off
over<00:01:49.610> here<00:01:50.030> on<00:01:50.659> this<00:01:51.110> zigzag<00:01:51.409> cleat<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:52.909> don't

over here on this zigzag cleat you don't

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.670 
over here on this zigzag cleat you don't
have<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.390> thread<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.750> too<00:01:53.900> many<00:01:53.990> times<00:01:54.140> just<00:01:54.530> a

have to thread it too many times just a

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.249 
have to thread it too many times just a
couple<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:55.070> times<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:56.390> way<00:01:56.600> by<00:01:56.810> running<00:01:57.049> it

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
couple of times that way by running it

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.080
