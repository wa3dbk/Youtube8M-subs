00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.190
 Dear friends of speed competitions 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:09.040
 remote places in Italy in the city of monty rotunda 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.860
 continues with me travels my 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.200
 friend and throw Valeric now 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.230
 carefully as I watch the participants 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.449
 the youngest of whom have already begun their 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.890
 Build it just those guys 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.500
 who compete in competitions 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.390
 first time but their support group 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.390
 people noticeably increased 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.399
 on each of the tables is already sitting someone from 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 participants and maybe doing their first 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.540
 attempt in life 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.490
 Mostly this youth and here perhaps 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.990
 the youngest competitor 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.990
 just look his eyes 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.210
 unfortunately from this angle is not visible as 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.310
 he collects the cube because the box 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.320
 obstructed but here from this angle a little 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.670
 Better though and also he collects dice 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.670
 under the table like gorpinchenko 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.880
 I can hardly see 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.470
 here 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.920
 it is immediately clear that the guy is not using 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.350
 the fastest method but why? 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.710
 is he still learning and learning his victories 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.710
 still ahead 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.929
 what is the name of this boy his name is 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.929
 nikola 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.290
 he is already finishing the build 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.590
 and here is one of the main organizers 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.159
 competition 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.159
 on your screens 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.710
 husband and wife organize these 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.710
 competition 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.200
 the guy on the go a little sewn well 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.090
 is it scary is it important 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.110
 especially if this is the first 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.039
 assembly in his life 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.039
 here the main thing to collect 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.920
 but rather to collect and not be upset because 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.520
 that the first attempt should always be 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.070
 step bright future step in new 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.070
 Hope we cook completes assembly 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.610
 to applause 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.420
 well really not very thick applause 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.420
 but nonetheless 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.600
 that's what competitions are held for 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.910
 speedcubing 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.980
 this is the best that can be the most 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.650
 best gift for organizers when in 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.610
 competitions take part here 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.610
 these are the guys 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.870
 but for example the participant who 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.879
 much older 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.700
 and this is also impressive and let her 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.700
 collects a cube probably about a minute 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.650
 maybe more but who cares 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.610
 this is a competition for which there is no spirit 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.940
 rivalry 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.329
 People come here to view 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.830
 eyes to others just like them 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.990
 like-minded people 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.660
 people who are passionate about the same 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:25.300
 from which all is well 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.300
 from which there is no loss 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.370
 deed that unites us all 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.900
 and really urge everyone this thing is not 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.750
 roll a dice 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.959
 in any possible situation in any 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.959
 conditions 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.090
 it makes you better until new meetings
