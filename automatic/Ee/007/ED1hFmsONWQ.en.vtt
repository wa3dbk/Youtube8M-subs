00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
a thread at this point but I have a

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.820 
a thread at this point but I have a
feeling<00:01:47.600> hey<00:01:48.170> if<00:01:48.290> he<00:01:48.380> puts<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.619> little<00:01:48.710> pressure

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
feeling hey if he puts a little pressure

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.740 
feeling hey if he puts a little pressure
back<00:01:49.250> on<00:01:49.280> Baker<00:01:49.670> anything<00:01:50.240> could<00:01:50.390> happen<00:01:50.570> in

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
back on Baker anything could happen in

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.960 
back on Baker anything could happen in
the<00:01:50.840> tenth<00:01:51.080> frame<00:01:51.340> sometimes<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.520> mark<00:01:52.790> is

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
the tenth frame sometimes a mark is

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.469 
the tenth frame sometimes a mark is
harder<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.300> get<00:01:53.540> than<00:01:53.690> a<00:01:53.810> strike<00:01:54.970> but<00:01:55.970> that's

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
harder to get than a strike but that's

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.180 
harder to get than a strike but that's
all<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.630> could<00:01:56.810> demonstrate<00:01:57.080> out<00:01:58.040> on<00:01:58.130> the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
all I could demonstrate out on the
