00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
as we're allowed to do by the slope it's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
kind of go in and just building a kicker

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.000 
kind of go in and just building a kicker
onto<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.260> pretty<00:00:37.469> obvious<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:37.920> I'm

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
onto it and it's pretty obvious what I'm

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.069 
onto it and it's pretty obvious what I'm
doing<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.519> literally<00:00:39.089> the<00:00:39.269> rails<00:00:39.870> kind

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
doing here is literally the rails kind

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.630 
doing here is literally the rails kind
of<00:00:40.140> iced<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:41.039> all<00:00:41.159> nice<00:00:41.339> and<00:00:41.579> straight

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
of iced and it's all nice and straight

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.209 
of iced and it's all nice and straight
and<00:00:41.879> all<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.210> kind<00:00:42.449> of<00:00:42.480> stuff<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:44.010> key

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and all that kind of stuff and the key

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.399 
and all that kind of stuff and the key
is<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.760> pile<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.659> loads<00:00:46.019> of<00:00:46.170> snow<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
is just to pile in loads of snow to

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:47.869 
is just to pile in loads of snow to
begin<00:00:46.589> with<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.219> you've<00:00:47.339> got<00:00:47.519> something<00:00:47.699> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
begin with so you've got something to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.759 
begin with so you've got something to
work<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.089> and<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.199> rid<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.440> any<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.679> the

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
work with and then get rid of any of the

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.069 
work with and then get rid of any of the
basic<00:00:50.159> lumps<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.210> stuff<00:00:51.479> about<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.749> might

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
basic lumps and stuff about that might

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.340 
basic lumps and stuff about that might
be<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.319> the<00:00:52.440> snow

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.650 

so<00:00:56.829> once<00:00:57.010> you've<00:00:57.220> got<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:57.579> right<00:00:57.790> height<00:00:58.329> for

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
so once you've got the right height for

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.970 
so once you've got the right height for
the<00:00:58.750> kind<00:00:58.960> of<00:00:58.989> kicker<00:00:59.200> you<00:00:59.380> want<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.590> work<00:00:59.739> with

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
the kind of kicker you want to work with

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.460 
the kind of kicker you want to work with
you<00:01:00.370> need<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.700> get<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.000> basic<00:01:01.390> shape<00:01:01.630> and<00:01:01.900> the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
you need to get the basic shape and the

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.410 
you need to get the basic shape and the
key<00:01:02.710> with<00:01:02.920> rail<00:01:03.160> kickers<00:01:03.700> is<00:01:03.910> just<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.269> have

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
key with rail kickers is just to have

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.930 
key with rail kickers is just to have
them<00:01:04.600> super<00:01:04.930> smooth<00:01:05.199> not<00:01:06.160> too<00:01:06.340> much<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.729> whip

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
them super smooth not too much of a whip

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.240 
them super smooth not too much of a whip
on<00:01:07.150> them<00:01:07.360> just<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:08.229> you<00:01:08.290> can<00:01:08.500> really<00:01:08.680> float<00:01:09.010> on

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
on them just so you can really float on

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.800 
on them just so you can really float on
because<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.490> don't<00:01:09.670> need<00:01:09.850> any<00:01:09.910> dramas<00:01:10.570> when

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810

technical onto a rail I'm using a part
rate<00:01:16.300> that<00:01:16.479> we've<00:01:16.630> imported<00:01:16.930> from<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.380> states

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
rate that we've imported from the states

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.010 
rate that we've imported from the states
you<00:01:18.400> can<00:01:18.550> also<00:01:18.700> use<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.000> shovel<00:01:19.330> just<00:01:19.540> something

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
you can also use a shovel just something

you can also use a shovel just something
with<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.200> nice<00:01:20.440> flat<00:01:21.040> head<00:01:21.250> if<00:01:21.400> possible<00:01:21.850> so<00:01:22.360> you

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
with a nice flat head if possible so you

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:33.540 
with a nice flat head if possible so you
can<00:01:22.600> make<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.900> kicker<00:01:23.229> as<00:01:23.350> smooth<00:01:23.650> as<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:23.979> can

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
now once I've got the main height for

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.520 
now once I've got the main height for
the<00:01:37.300> central<00:01:37.690> kicker<00:01:37.930> then<00:01:38.170> what<00:01:38.320> I'm<00:01:38.410> gonna

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
the central kicker then what I'm gonna

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.350 
the central kicker then what I'm gonna
do<00:01:38.740> is<00:01:38.860> just<00:01:39.009> cut<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.430> side<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:40.060> I've<00:01:40.210> got

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
do is just cut the side so I've got

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.109 
do is just cut the side so I've got
enough<00:01:40.600> room<00:01:40.930> to<00:01:41.200> shape<00:01:42.160> out<00:01:42.399> each<00:01:42.729> side<00:01:43.119> hit

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
enough room to shape out each side hit

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.639 
enough room to shape out each side hit
these<00:01:46.119> metal<00:01:46.390> shovels<00:01:46.750> have<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:46.990> really<00:01:47.500> nice

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
these metal shovels have a really nice

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.710 
these metal shovels have a really nice
straight<00:01:48.039> edge<00:01:48.190> on<00:01:48.369> them<00:01:48.550> so<00:01:48.729> they<00:01:48.850> great<00:01:49.270> kind

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
straight edge on them so they great kind

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.170 
straight edge on them so they great kind
of<00:01:49.780> getting<00:01:50.050> nice<00:01:50.229> clean<00:01:50.680> cuts<00:01:51.009> out<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.820> snow

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180

once<00:01:52.420> it's<00:01:52.630> settled<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.110> little<00:01:53.410> bit

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.830 

so<00:02:19.250> once<00:02:19.430> I've<00:02:19.609> trimmed<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:19.969> sidestand

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
so once I've trimmed the sidestand

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.660 
so once I've trimmed the sidestand
I've<00:02:20.989> got<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.260> basic<00:02:21.739> height<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.219> society

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
going to spin onto the rail then they

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.740 
going to spin onto the rail then they
need<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.519> little<00:02:28.760> bit<00:02:28.909> of<00:02:29.030> width<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.389> make<00:02:29.569> that

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
need a little bit of width to make that

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.410 
need a little bit of width to make that
super<00:02:30.139> easy<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.609> once<00:02:31.909> again<00:02:32.030> with<00:02:32.329> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
super easy and then once again with the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.849 
super easy and then once again with the
part<00:02:32.629> rate<00:02:32.840> cut<00:02:33.019> you<00:02:33.200> just<00:02:33.260> get<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.620> basic

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
part rate cut you just get the basic

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.890 
part rate cut you just get the basic
profile<00:02:34.609> and<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.849> key<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.239> trying<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.599> make<00:02:35.750> it

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
profile and the key is trying to make it

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.129 
profile and the key is trying to make it
super<00:02:36.230> smooth<00:02:36.709> not<00:02:37.489> wimpy<00:02:37.939> so<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.900> know<00:02:39.019> the

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.139 
super smooth not wimpy so you know the

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.690 
super smooth not wimpy so you know the
shape<00:02:39.349> of<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.590> typical<00:02:39.889> panel<00:02:40.219> that<00:02:40.400> we<00:02:40.489> don't

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
shape of a typical panel that we don't

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.309 
shape of a typical panel that we don't
want<00:02:40.909> that<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.209> want<00:02:41.239> it's<00:02:41.510> super<00:02:41.930> easy<00:02:41.959> and

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
want that we want it's super easy and

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:52.179 
want that we want it's super easy and
super<00:02:42.620> mellow<00:02:43.010> for<00:02:43.219> people<00:02:50.859> now<00:02:51.859> we<00:02:51.919> come<00:02:52.159> to

one<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.579> most<00:02:52.730> important<00:02:53.209> elements<00:02:53.599> here

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
one of the most important elements here

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.050 
one of the most important elements here
which<00:02:53.959> is<00:02:54.139> icing<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.519> I'm<00:02:55.609> just<00:02:55.790> trying<00:02:56.030> to

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
which is icing so I'm just trying to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.479 
which is icing so I'm just trying to
give<00:02:56.239> it<00:02:56.329> a<00:02:56.419> nice<00:02:56.689> even<00:02:56.959> spread<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.739> water<00:02:57.950> I've

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
give it a nice even spread of water I've

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.490 
give it a nice even spread of water I've
got<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.730> good<00:02:58.909> metal<00:02:59.329> watering<00:02:59.719> can<00:02:59.959> here<00:03:00.230> so

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
got a good metal watering can here so

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.949 
got a good metal watering can here so
you<00:03:01.340> get<00:03:01.519> all<00:03:01.669> the<00:03:01.790> water<00:03:01.939> nicely<00:03:02.419> over<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
you get all the water nicely over the

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.140 
you get all the water nicely over the
kicker<00:03:03.200> but<00:03:03.379> not<00:03:03.680> in<00:03:03.919> too<00:03:04.219> many<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:04.790> large

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
kicker but not in too many like large

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.319 
kicker but not in too many like large
clumps<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.980> once<00:03:07.189> you've<00:03:07.340> got<00:03:07.519> that<00:03:07.730> next

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
clumps and once you've got that next

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.000 
clumps and once you've got that next
most<00:03:08.480> important<00:03:08.930> bits<00:03:09.049> just<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.409> get<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.620> bit<00:03:09.889> of

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
most important bits just to get a bit of

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.949 
most important bits just to get a bit of
dusting<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.549> snow<00:03:10.669> onto<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.450> face<00:03:11.659> of<00:03:11.900> the

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
dusting of snow onto the face of the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.420 
dusting of snow onto the face of the
jump<00:03:12.169> otherwise<00:03:12.560> he'll<00:03:12.769> just<00:03:12.980> turn<00:03:13.219> into

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
jump otherwise he'll just turn into

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.819 
jump otherwise he'll just turn into
solid<00:03:13.700> ice<00:03:14.109> so<00:03:15.109> want<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.319> make<00:03:15.439> it<00:03:15.590> super

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
solid ice so want to make it super

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.460 
solid ice so want to make it super
smooth<00:03:16.280> once<00:03:17.120> we've<00:03:17.299> got<00:03:17.479> this<00:03:17.599> nice<00:03:17.840> saw<00:03:18.169> snow

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
smooth once we've got this nice saw snow

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.020 
smooth once we've got this nice saw snow
and<00:03:18.709> trying<00:03:18.949> to<00:03:19.010> throw<00:03:19.220> on<00:03:19.370> snow<00:03:19.639> which<00:03:19.849> it

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
and trying to throw on snow which it

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.629 
and trying to throw on snow which it
hasn't<00:03:20.269> got<00:03:20.449> too<00:03:20.599> many<00:03:20.690> lumps<00:03:20.989> in<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:25.370> also

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
hasn't got too many lumps in and also

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.969 
hasn't got too many lumps in and also
tidy<00:03:25.909> up<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.180> sides<00:03:26.449> again<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.349> if<00:03:27.470> extra

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
tidy up the sides again and if extra

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.589 
tidy up the sides again and if extra
strength<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.579> make<00:03:28.790> sure<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.120> maintains

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
strength and make sure that maintains

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.629 
strength and make sure that maintains
its<00:03:29.840> shape<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:30.260> could<00:03:30.379> just<00:03:30.560> ice<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.159> side<00:03:31.430> of

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
its shape I could just ice the side of

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:43.760 
its shape I could just ice the side of
the<00:03:31.760> kicker

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.980 

and<00:03:44.220> then<00:03:44.340> once<00:03:44.520> again<00:03:44.720> smoothing<00:03:45.720> out<00:03:45.780> all

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
and then once again smoothing out all

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.930 
and then once again smoothing out all
this<00:03:46.140> freshmen<00:03:46.620> over<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.010> icy<00:03:47.490> under<00:03:47.760> layer

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
this freshmen over the icy under layer

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.150 
this freshmen over the icy under layer
so<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.540> really<00:03:48.810> starts<00:03:49.200> to<00:03:49.260> bind<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.890> creates

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
so it really starts to bind and creates

00:03:50.160 --> 00:04:17.410 
so it really starts to bind and creates
a<00:03:50.250> good<00:03:50.430> grip<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.760> surface

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.670 

over<00:04:18.420> this<00:04:18.540> state<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:19.049> really<00:04:19.320> want<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.560> let

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
over this state you really want to let

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.199 
over this state you really want to let
the<00:04:19.799> smoke<00:04:20.010> settle<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.580> a<00:04:20.610> little<00:04:20.670> bit<00:04:20.970> once

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
the smoke settle in a little bit once

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.760 
the smoke settle in a little bit once
you've<00:04:21.390> done<00:04:21.570> your<00:04:21.630> main<00:04:21.930> icing<00:04:22.530> on<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.740> top

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
you've done your main icing on the top

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.160 
you've done your main icing on the top
and<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.280> should<00:04:23.310> bind<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.750> shouldn't<00:04:25.050> fall

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
and it should bind so it shouldn't fall

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.020 
and it should bind so it shouldn't fall
apart<00:04:25.500> too<00:04:25.710> much<00:04:25.980> when<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.220> do<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.610> cuts<00:04:26.820> and

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
apart too much when you do the cuts and

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.430 
apart too much when you do the cuts and
if<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.270> can<00:04:27.570> be<00:04:27.660> bothered<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:27.960> make<00:04:28.200> stuff

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
if you can be bothered to make stuff

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:38.180 
if you can be bothered to make stuff
that<00:04:28.620> really<00:04:28.800> nice

got throw on some fresh snow then that

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.409 
got throw on some fresh snow then that

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
will bind and recreate that nice solid

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:40.419 
will bind and recreate that nice solid
