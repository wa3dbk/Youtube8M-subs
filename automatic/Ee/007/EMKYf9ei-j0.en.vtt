00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
hey guys as you can see the snow blowers

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.770 
hey guys as you can see the snow blowers
been<00:00:04.770> cannibalized<00:00:06.440> along<00:00:07.440> with<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:08.780> bunch

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
been cannibalized along with that bunch

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.150 
been cannibalized along with that bunch
of<00:00:09.900> other<00:00:10.050> junk<00:00:10.080> that's<00:00:10.620> generally<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.040> way

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
of other junk that's generally the way

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.430 
of other junk that's generally the way
it<00:00:11.340> works<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.820> know<00:00:11.940> keep<00:00:12.809> hunting<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.230> stuff

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
it works you know keep hunting for stuff

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.730 
it works you know keep hunting for stuff
but<00:00:13.679> here's<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.370> came<00:00:14.460> up<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:15.740> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
but here's what I came up with the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.580 
but here's what I came up with the
wheels<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.250> bike<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:18.869> then<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.230> cut<00:00:19.439> that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
wheels on the bike and then I cut that

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.290 
wheels on the bike and then I cut that
side<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.010> frame<00:00:20.220> off<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.760> then<00:00:20.970> this

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
side of the frame off and then this

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.759 
side of the frame off and then this
metal<00:00:22.050> right<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:22.310> is<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:24.199> little<00:00:25.199> generator

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
metal right here is a little generator

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.759 
metal right here is a little generator
the<00:00:26.070> frame<00:00:26.369> from<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.730> generator<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:28.380> cage<00:00:28.590> that

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the frame from a generator the cage that

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.030 
the frame from a generator the cage that
went<00:00:28.920> around<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> sliced<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
went around it so I sliced that up and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.120 
went around it so I sliced that up and
made<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.279> my<00:00:33.500> wishbones<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.710> guess<00:00:34.890> you'd<00:00:35.070> say

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
made that my wishbones I guess you'd say

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.310 
made that my wishbones I guess you'd say
to<00:00:36.030> go<00:00:36.180> back<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.520> original<00:00:38.520> plate<00:00:39.170> which<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to go back to the original plate which I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.799 
to go back to the original plate which I
cut<00:00:40.530> everything<00:00:40.710> free<00:00:41.129> from<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.700> I'll<00:00:42.450> lined

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
cut everything free from and I'll lined

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.959 
cut everything free from and I'll lined
it<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.260> other<00:00:43.379> side<00:00:43.680> got<00:00:44.280> big<00:00:44.489> washers

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
it with the other side got big washers

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.299 
it with the other side got big washers
on<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> wheel<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.750> both<00:00:45.930> sides<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.770> make<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.160> so

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
on the wheel on both sides to make it so

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.850 
on the wheel on both sides to make it so
the<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> wheel<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.149> true<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.440> kind<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.710> took

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the the wheel is true and I kind of took

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.100 
the the wheel is true and I kind of took
some<00:00:50.070> time<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.730> true<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> rest<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
some time to make it true to the rest of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.010 
some time to make it true to the rest of
the<00:00:52.199> frame<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.180> stitch<00:00:54.629> these

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the frame and then just stitch these

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.310 
the frame and then just stitch these
across<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.129> stitch<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.030> across<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
across to it stitch this one across to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.160 
across to it stitch this one across to
it<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.840> that<00:01:00.840> would<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
it to make it so that that would be the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.680 
it to make it so that that would be the
support<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> wheel<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.430> gave<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.969> quite

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
support on the wheel and I gave it quite

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.299 
support on the wheel and I gave it quite
a<00:01:03.809> bit<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.080> room<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.500> time<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.129> can

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
a bit of room this time see if you can

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.340 
a bit of room this time see if you can
see<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> good<00:01:09.170> just<00:01:10.170> shy<00:01:10.320> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
see you know I have a good just shy of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
see you know I have a good just shy of
an<00:01:10.560> inch<00:01:10.740> probably<00:01:11.220> 3/4<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> 7/8<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.210> an<00:01:12.299> inch

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
an inch probably 3/4 of 7/8 of an inch

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.039 
an inch probably 3/4 of 7/8 of an inch
between<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:14.960> see<00:01:15.960> him

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
between there and there you know see him

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.210 
between there and there you know see him
on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> bottom<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> other<00:01:16.860> side<00:01:16.890> should

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
on the bottom now the other side should

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.070 
on the bottom now the other side should
be<00:01:17.310> fine<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.720> stock

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
be fine because that's all stock

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.530 
be fine because that's all stock
nothing's<00:01:19.530> changed<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.430> same<00:01:20.640> size<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
nothing's changed the same size that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.300 
nothing's changed the same size that
three<00:01:21.900> inch<00:01:22.020> tire<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.650> back<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:23.040> there

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
three inch tire is going back on there

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.390 
three inch tire is going back on there
that<00:01:23.790> shouldn't<00:01:24.060> make<00:01:24.240> any<00:01:24.299> difference<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.400> I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that shouldn't make any difference and I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.859 
that shouldn't make any difference and I
will<00:01:26.640> make<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.030> pebbles<00:01:27.390> again<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.840> got

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
will make it so pebbles again but I got

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.749 
will make it so pebbles again but I got
to<00:01:28.200> kick<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> down<00:01:29.009> under<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.369> motor<00:01:29.670> I'm

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
to kick it down under the motor I'm

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.520 
to kick it down under the motor I'm
gonna<00:01:29.939> stick<00:01:30.119> pedals<00:01:30.420> out<00:01:30.570> front<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.350> right

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
gonna stick pedals out front but right

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.539 
gonna stick pedals out front but right
now<00:01:31.680> I'm<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.860> building<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> drivetrain<00:01:33.500> so

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
now I'm just building the drivetrain so

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.230 
now I'm just building the drivetrain so
having<00:01:35.549> said<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.689> cut<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.880> hoop<00:01:39.090> out

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
having said that I cut the the hoop out

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.530 
having said that I cut the the hoop out
of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> pedal<00:01:39.799> assembly<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:41.329> this<00:01:42.329> is

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
of the pedal assembly there this is

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.240 
of the pedal assembly there this is
where<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.930> normally<00:01:43.530> would<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.770> pedaled<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
where you normally would have pedaled it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.030 
where you normally would have pedaled it
but<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.360> motor<00:01:45.540> needed<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
but the motor needed to go there so that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.410 
but the motor needed to go there so that
needed<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.610> leave<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.799> then<00:01:50.030> again<00:01:51.030> mounting

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
needed to leave and then again mounting

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.840 
needed to leave and then again mounting
the<00:01:51.540> motor<00:01:51.720> trying<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> motor<00:01:52.320> Center<00:01:52.850> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the motor trying at the motor Center to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.850 
the motor trying at the motor Center to
the<00:01:53.970> back<00:01:54.149> wheel<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:55.470> playing<00:01:55.680> with

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the back wheel and just playing with

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.630 
the back wheel and just playing with
that<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.969> motor<00:01:57.149> had<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.540> plate<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.640> you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that the motor had this plate on it you

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.749 
that the motor had this plate on it you
know<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.540> plate<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.310> after<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> cut<00:02:02.640> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
know that plate on it after I cut that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.399 
know that plate on it after I cut that
sucker<00:02:03.060> off<00:02:03.180> stick<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.170> could

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
sucker off stick it on like that I could

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.600 
sucker off stick it on like that I could
weld<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> frame

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.250 

so<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> had<00:02:08.790> to<00:02:08.850> go<00:02:08.940> make<00:02:09.060> my<00:02:09.119> own<00:02:09.360> setup<00:02:09.690> which

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
so I had to go make my own setup which

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.570 
so I had to go make my own setup which
basically<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.650> laid<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.100> over<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> top<00:02:11.520> of

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
basically just laid this over the top of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.790 
basically just laid this over the top of
it<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.140> traced<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.290> out<00:02:13.410> drilled<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.400> out<00:02:14.490> and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
it and traced it out drilled it out and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.230 
it and traced it out drilled it out and
here's<00:02:16.800> what<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.100> see<00:02:17.340> there<00:02:17.580> how<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.910> do<00:02:18.030> some

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
here's what you see there how to do some

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.110 
here's what you see there how to do some
creative<00:02:19.190> bending<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.520> walk<00:02:20.850> that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
creative bending of one walk that

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.730 
creative bending of one walk that
wouldn't<00:02:21.390> clear<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.350> wanted<00:02:22.680> something

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
wouldn't clear but I wanted something

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.030 
wouldn't clear but I wanted something
yeah<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.490> see<00:02:23.730> channel<00:02:24.090> will<00:02:24.830> keep<00:02:25.830> from

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
yeah that see channel will keep from

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.080 
yeah that see channel will keep from
rocking<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.790> speak<00:02:28.460> made<00:02:29.460> that<00:02:29.670> up<00:02:29.880> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
rocking so to speak made that up and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.800 
rocking so to speak made that up and
then<00:02:30.450> whittled<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.860> match<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.310> frame

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
then whittled it in to match the frame

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.000 
then whittled it in to match the frame
it's<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.140> everything's<00:02:34.530> just<00:02:34.560> got<00:02:34.860> you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010

it's just that everything's just got you
tax<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.060> tech<00:02:36.270> again<00:02:36.570> on<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.840> bottom

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
tax on you and tech again on the bottom

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.660 
tax on you and tech again on the bottom

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
notched it around the carburetor and

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.130

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
I'm just gonna keep it simple just like

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.280 
I'm just gonna keep it simple just like
a

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
a

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.660 
a
actor<00:04:19.530> gets<00:04:20.370> engaged<00:04:20.640> or<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:22.430> snowblower<00:04:23.430> for

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
actor gets engaged or a snowblower for

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.260 
actor gets engaged or a snowblower for
that<00:04:23.760> matter<00:04:23.960> same<00:04:24.960> idea<00:04:25.290> so<00:04:26.190> if<00:04:26.310> they<00:04:26.460> get<00:04:27.180> it

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
that matter same idea so if they get it

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.760 
that matter same idea so if they get it
moving<00:04:27.480> a<00:04:27.540> little<00:04:27.660> bit<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.170> other<00:04:28.290> bike<00:04:28.470> seems

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
moving a little bit the other bike seems

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.180 
moving a little bit the other bike seems
to<00:04:28.890> work<00:04:29.040> quite<00:04:29.370> fine<00:04:30.060> with<00:04:30.390> that<00:04:30.540> same<00:04:30.750> idea

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
to work quite fine with that same idea

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.290 
to work quite fine with that same idea
but<00:04:32.190> I'm<00:04:32.490> probably<00:04:32.670> going<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:32.940> try<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.120> go<00:04:33.180> with

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
but I'm probably going to try to go with

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.240 
but I'm probably going to try to go with
a<00:04:33.360> lever<00:04:33.630> up<00:04:34.230> on<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.590> handlebars<00:04:34.920> instead<00:04:35.160> of

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
a lever up on the handlebars instead of

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.830

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
our thing on the side but we'll see what

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:50.320 
our thing on the side but we'll see what
else<00:04:41.150> pop<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.300> off<00:04:42.680> it's<00:04:43.680> been<00:04:43.890> that<00:04:44.010> back
