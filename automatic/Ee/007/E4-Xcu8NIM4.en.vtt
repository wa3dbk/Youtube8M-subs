00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that it looked really cool and this is

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
that it looked really cool and this is
pretty<00:00:55.350> useful<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:56.039> mapmaking<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.239> can

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
pretty useful for mapmaking so you can

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.529 
pretty useful for mapmaking so you can
already<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> repeater<00:00:58.320> over<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:59.539> but

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
already see a repeater over there but

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.680 
already see a repeater over there but
let<00:01:00.780> me<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:00.930> show<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.350> guys<00:01:01.620> how<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.280> works

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
let me just show you guys how this works

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.390 
let me just show you guys how this works
so<00:01:03.690> over<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.100> red

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
so over here you can see all the red

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.950 
so over here you can see all the red
stone<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.970> used<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
stone that I used for this but this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.020 
stone that I used for this but this
probably<00:01:07.350> doesn't<00:01:07.470> say<00:01:07.979> much<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.610> guys<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
probably doesn't say much to you guys so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.580 
probably doesn't say much to you guys so
let<00:01:09.180> me<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.450> go<00:01:09.630> through<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.049> step-by-step

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
let me just go through this step-by-step

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.890 
let me just go through this step-by-step
but<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> first<00:01:11.610> thing<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.970> need<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.299> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
but the first thing you need to know is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.679 
but the first thing you need to know is
that<00:01:13.200> over<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.130> better<00:01:15.060> blocks<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.659> top

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that over here are better blocks on top

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.100 
that over here are better blocks on top
of<00:01:16.080> me<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.409> only<00:01:16.650> works<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.159> 1.8<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
of me this only works in 1.8 but as you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.570 
of me this only works in 1.8 but as you
can<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.619> are<00:01:19.650> barrier<00:01:20.070> blocks<00:01:20.369> with

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
can see there are barrier blocks with

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.300 
can see there are barrier blocks with
brad<00:01:20.880> stone<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.360> them<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.159> when<00:01:23.159> you're

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
brad stone on them and when you're

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.249 
brad stone on them and when you're
underneath<00:01:23.700> barrier<00:01:24.299> blocks<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.960> see

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
underneath barrier blocks you can see

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.649 
underneath barrier blocks you can see
the<00:01:25.470> red<00:01:25.650> stone<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.430> top<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.880> them<00:01:27.060> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the red stone that is on top of them so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.630 
the red stone that is on top of them so
that<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.020> pretty<00:01:28.259> cool<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.979> find<00:01:29.430> some

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that is pretty cool you can find some

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.910 
that is pretty cool you can find some
really<00:01:29.909> cool<00:01:30.090> uses<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.290> used<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.710> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
really cool uses for it and I used it to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.640 
really cool uses for it and I used it to
make<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> visible<00:01:32.759> redstone<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:34.229> happens

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
make a visible redstone so what happens

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.910 
make a visible redstone so what happens
over<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.009> when<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.670> push<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.150> button<00:01:36.920> we

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
over here when we push this button we

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.789 
over here when we push this button we
got<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.490> machine<00:01:38.939> which<00:01:39.509> shortens<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
got this machine which shortens the the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.800 
got this machine which shortens the the
polls<00:01:41.100> because<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.970> look<00:01:42.150> really<00:01:42.450> fast

able<00:01:51.640> because<00:01:51.940> it<00:01:52.810> used<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.409> be<00:01:53.590> like<00:01:54.430> this<00:01:55.120> my

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
able because it used to be like this my

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.540 
able because it used to be like this my
redstone<00:01:55.960> signal<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.890> then<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.220> would<00:01:57.520> be

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
redstone signal and then you would be

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.570 
redstone signal and then you would be
able<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.110> see<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.260> so<00:01:59.410> if<00:01:59.560> it's<00:01:59.740> on<00:01:59.950> a<00:01:59.979> flat<00:02:00.340> line

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
able to see it so if it's on a flat line

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.330 
able to see it so if it's on a flat line
you<00:02:00.790> would<00:02:00.970> be<00:02:01.150> able<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.570> get<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.100> go

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
you would be able to get there you go

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.140 
you would be able to get there you go
you<00:02:03.400> could<00:02:03.670> sell<00:02:03.940> those<00:02:05.580> particles<00:02:06.580> really

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
you could sell those particles really

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.250 
you could sell those particles really
fast<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:08.500> when<00:02:09.459> they're<00:02:09.759> in<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.330> small<00:02:10.750> bowl<00:02:11.050> or

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
fast but when they're in a small bowl or

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.020 
fast but when they're in a small bowl or
something<00:02:11.290> then<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:11.920> can<00:02:12.250> see<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.610> particle

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
something then you can see the particle

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.660 
something then you can see the particle
so<00:02:13.180> that's<00:02:13.360> great<00:02:13.600> but<00:02:14.440> yeah<00:02:14.950> then<00:02:15.250> over<00:02:15.610> here

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
so that's great but yeah then over here

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.240 
so that's great but yeah then over here
we<00:02:15.910> got<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.390> pulse<00:02:16.720> shortener<00:02:17.470> which<00:02:17.709> makes

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
we got the pulse shortener which makes

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.510 
we got the pulse shortener which makes
the<00:02:18.540> particles<00:02:19.540> just<00:02:20.320> visible<00:02:20.950> for<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.220> really

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
the particles just visible for a really

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.000 
the particles just visible for a really
short<00:02:21.760> time<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.200> wrestling<00:02:23.560> goes<00:02:23.770> all

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
short time then the wrestling goes all

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.340 
short time then the wrestling goes all
the<00:02:24.040> way<00:02:24.220> over<00:02:24.520> here<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:25.600> over<00:02:26.020> here<00:02:26.050> we

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
the way over here and then over here we

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.830 
the way over here and then over here we
got<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.610> think<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.239> is<00:02:28.300> called<00:02:28.690> ad

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
got a I think this is called ad

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.350 
got a I think this is called ad
flip-flop<00:02:29.350> I'm<00:02:29.830> not<00:02:30.190> really<00:02:30.580> sure<00:02:30.700> but<00:02:31.150> what

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
flip-flop I'm not really sure but what

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.530 
flip-flop I'm not really sure but what
this<00:02:31.510> does<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.989> is<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.739> creates<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.540> single

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
this does this is this creates a single

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.190 
this does this is this creates a single
pulse<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.530> be<00:02:35.739> like<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.160> lever<00:02:36.730> leaver<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.720> when

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
pulse to be like a lever leaver so when

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.979 
pulse to be like a lever leaver so when
I<00:02:38.230> push<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:38.680> button<00:02:38.739> as<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:40.510> can<00:02:40.660> see<00:02:40.840> this

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
I push this button as you can see this

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.430 
I push this button as you can see this
persistent<00:02:41.860> or<00:02:42.010> tracks<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:43.570> lamp<00:02:44.140> turns

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
persistent or tracks and the lamp turns

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.670 
persistent or tracks and the lamp turns
off<00:02:44.709> but<00:02:45.250> when<00:02:45.370> i<00:02:45.400> press<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.730> again<00:02:46.560> based<00:02:47.560> in

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
off but when i press it again based in

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.520 
off but when i press it again based in
extends<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.610> lamps<00:02:48.940> turn<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:50.380> is

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
extends and the lamps turn on so this is

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.800 
extends and the lamps turn on so this is
really<00:02:50.830> easy<00:02:51.100> really<00:02:51.640> cool<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.300> just<00:02:52.570> think

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
really easy really cool and I just think

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.420 
really easy really cool and I just think
it<00:02:52.959> looks<00:02:53.170> great<00:02:53.410> because<00:02:53.799> from<00:02:54.040> here<00:02:54.100> you

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
it looks great because from here you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.670 
it looks great because from here you
really<00:02:54.580> can't<00:02:55.060> see<00:02:55.209> any<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.049> redstone<00:02:56.500> and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
really can't see any of the redstone and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.070 
really can't see any of the redstone and
then<00:02:57.250> when<00:02:57.459> i<00:02:57.489> press<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.239> look<00:02:58.780> round<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.320> oh

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
guys hear that just that was the

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.630 
guys hear that just that was the
rendering<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.840> my<00:03:17.049> previous<00:03:17.320> video<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:18.370> was

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
rendering of my previous video it was

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.310 
rendering of my previous video it was
about<00:03:18.880> how<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.150> create<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:19.660> black<00:03:19.959> brute

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
about how to create this black brute

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.100 
about how to create this black brute
because<00:03:20.799> yeah<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.430> used<00:03:21.940> black<00:03:22.239> girls<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:22.989> my

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
because yeah I used black girls in my

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.530 
because yeah I used black girls in my
tutorials<00:03:23.709> if<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.610> guys<00:03:24.730> want<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.180> know<00:03:25.269> how

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
tutorials if you guys want to know how

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.380 
tutorials if you guys want to know how
to<00:03:25.600> create<00:03:25.959> these<00:03:26.079> black<00:03:26.440> bolts<00:03:26.860> it's<00:03:27.310> for<00:03:28.180> me

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
to create these black bolts it's for me

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.660 
to create these black bolts it's for me
I<00:03:28.420> think<00:03:28.690> it's<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.200> best<00:03:29.350> way<00:03:29.590> possible<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:30.579> if

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
I think it's the best way possible so if

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.830 
I think it's the best way possible so if
you<00:03:30.790> guys<00:03:30.940> want<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.269> know<00:03:31.360> how<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.570> create

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
you guys want to know how to create

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.539 
you guys want to know how to create
these<00:03:31.989> blank<00:03:32.260> rules<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.769> make<00:03:33.220> sure<00:03:33.400> to

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
these blank rules that make sure to

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:34.410 
these blank rules that make sure to
check<00:03:33.730> out<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.000> link<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.329> description

that<00:03:36.420> rendering<00:03:37.420> remind<00:03:37.840> me<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:39.010> but<00:03:39.760> yeah

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
that rendering remind me of it but yeah

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.819 
that rendering remind me of it but yeah
I<00:03:40.180> guess<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.570> this<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.930> all<00:03:41.140> there<00:03:41.320> is<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.799> it

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
I guess that this is all there is to it

and same for the post shortener so how

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.870 
and same for the post shortener so how
this<00:03:54.630> works<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.080> a<00:03:55.410> resto<00:03:56.040> signal<00:03:56.400> comes<00:03:56.640> in

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
this works is a resto signal comes in

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.390 
this works is a resto signal comes in
then<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.480> piston<00:03:57.840> extends<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.680> immediately

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
then the piston extends and immediately

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.670 
then the piston extends and immediately
cuts<00:03:59.790> off<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.270> rest<00:04:00.420> of<00:04:00.600> signal<00:04:00.960> but<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.170> small

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
cuts off the rest of signal but a small

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.010 
cuts off the rest of signal but a small
portion<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.490> it<00:04:02.700> will<00:04:02.910> still<00:04:03.300> go<00:04:03.480> through<00:04:03.510> and

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
portion of it will still go through and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
portion of it will still go through and
go<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.340> other<00:04:05.490> side<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:07.080> yeah<00:04:07.590> thank<00:04:07.950> you
