craft 4.1 and we're going to be doing a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.570 
craft 4.1 and we're going to be doing a
bit<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.589> an<00:00:08.870> in-between<00:00:09.870> kind<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.830> video<00:00:11.040> so

bit of an in-between kind of video so

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.310 
bit of an in-between kind of video so
we're<00:00:11.670> gonna<00:00:11.790> be<00:00:11.940> upgrading<00:00:12.870> stuff<00:00:13.110> that

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
we're gonna be upgrading stuff that

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.470 
we're gonna be upgrading stuff that
we've<00:00:13.469> already<00:00:13.620> made<00:00:14.120> so<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.299> video

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
we've already made so in this video

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.990 
we've already made so in this video
we're<00:00:15.960> gonna<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.440> creating<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:17.130> arcane<00:00:17.789> lamp

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
we're gonna be creating on arcane lamp

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.630 
we're gonna be creating on arcane lamp
for<00:00:18.420> our<00:00:18.539> arcing<00:00:18.960> ball<00:00:19.340> we're<00:00:20.340> gonna<00:00:20.460> be

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
for our arcing ball we're gonna be

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.790 
for our arcing ball we're gonna be
stabilizing<00:00:21.119> our<00:00:22.880> diffusional<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:25.710> are

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
stabilizing our diffusional and we are

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.589 
stabilizing our diffusional and we are
going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.539> creating<00:00:27.539> bellows<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.410> our

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
going to be creating bellows for our

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.209 
going to be creating bellows for our
infernal<00:00:30.599> furnace<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.710> let's<00:00:31.890> make<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
infernal furnace so let's make the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.660 
infernal furnace so let's make the
arcane<00:00:32.669> lamp<00:00:33.829> first<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.160> create<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
arcane lamp first you need to create a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.959 
arcane lamp first you need to create a
daylight<00:00:36.120> sensor<00:00:36.329> which<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.969> glass

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
daylight sensor which is like this glass

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.420 
daylight sensor which is like this glass
along<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> top<00:00:39.860> quartz<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> middle<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
along the top quartz in the middle and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.250 
along the top quartz in the middle and
slabs<00:00:42.059> below<00:00:43.520> then<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:45.000> place<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.989> this

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
slabs below then you place it like this

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.400 
slabs below then you place it like this
they<00:00:46.800> believe<00:00:47.690> first<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.870> need<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> buy<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
they believe first you need to buy the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
they believe first you need to buy the
research<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:52.969> you<00:00:53.969> should<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.239> able<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
research and then you should be able to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.959 
research and then you should be able to
craft<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.820> wanna

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
craft it like this so then you wanna

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.450 
craft it like this so then you wanna
just<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.780> lid<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.859> we've

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
just put your one lid there and we've

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.299 
just put your one lid there and we've
gotten<00:00:59.670> our<00:00:59.760> game<00:00:59.940> up<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.039> we're<00:01:02.219> gonna

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
gotten our game up so now we're gonna

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310 
gotten our game up so now we're gonna
want<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.640> make<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> bellows<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.199> go

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
want to make the bellows which if we go

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.899 
want to make the bellows which if we go
into<00:01:04.439> our<00:01:04.530> formula<00:01:04.830> mark<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:10.909> keen

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
into our formula mark on it is a keen

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.820 
into our formula mark on it is a keen
bellows<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.619> literally

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
bellows is here so you can literally

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.620 
bellows is here so you can literally
just<00:01:13.950> buy<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> research<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.420> enough

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
just buy the research if you have enough

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.800 
just buy the research if you have enough
aspect<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.970> we'll<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> research<00:01:18.630> notes

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
aspect and we'll have the research notes

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.580 
aspect and we'll have the research notes
all<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.890> research<00:01:20.189> knowledge<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.030> guess

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
all that the research knowledge I guess

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.270 
all that the research knowledge I guess
so<00:01:22.590> now<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.770> we've<00:01:22.920> got<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> knowledge

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so now that we've got the knowledge

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
so now that we've got the knowledge
let's<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> look<00:01:24.119> at<00:01:24.270> how<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.540> craft<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
let's have a look at how you craft it

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.249 
let's have a look at how you craft it
the<00:01:25.650> lever<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.450> would<00:01:27.450> each<00:01:27.810> side<00:01:28.080> air<00:01:30.259> so

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the lever there would each side air so

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.690 
the lever there would each side air so
there<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:34.159> there<00:01:36.170> there<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.579> have

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
there that there there that you can have

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.069 
there that there there that you can have
free<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.600> infernal<00:01:40.200> furnace<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.079> make

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
free for one infernal furnace so make

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.740 
free for one infernal furnace so make
free<00:01:45.710> next<00:01:46.710> we're<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> make<00:01:47.750> some

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
free next we're going to make some

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.660 
free next we're going to make some
candles<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:51.110> what<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.229> need<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.619> some<00:01:53.399> rotten

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
candles so what you need is some rotten

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.230 
candles so what you need is some rotten
flesh<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:55.530> some<00:01:55.770> air<00:01:55.979> shard<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.090> ever

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
flesh and some air shard if you ever

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.929 
flesh and some air shard if you ever
look<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.960> forma<00:01:58.229> nomicon<00:01:58.530> go<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
look in the forma nomicon go to the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.219 
look in the forma nomicon go to the
alchemy<00:02:00.810> tab<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.369> research<00:02:02.369> magic<00:02:02.939> tallow

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
alchemy tab and research magic tallow

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.160 
alchemy tab and research magic tallow
now<00:02:05.039> we<00:02:05.250> need<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:07.640> work<00:02:08.640> out<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.149> guess<00:02:10.819> this

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
now we need to go work out I guess this

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.479 
now we need to go work out I guess this
which<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.560> through<00:02:14.310> vacuous<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.180> believe

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
which is through vacuous I believe

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.199 
which is through vacuous I believe
vacuous<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:19.459> good<00:02:20.489> DCO<00:02:21.290> then<00:02:22.290> mortise<00:02:23.209> links

vacuous the good DCO then mortise links
like<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:25.069> we've<00:02:26.069> got<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.250> magic<00:02:26.400> tally

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
like that we've got the magic tally

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.789 
like that we've got the magic tally
researched<00:02:27.180> right<00:02:27.690> click<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:31.170> now<00:02:31.230> go<00:02:31.739> to

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
researched right click it and now go to

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.229 
researched right click it and now go to
our<00:02:31.980> cauldron<00:02:32.730> or<00:02:33.200> crucible<00:02:34.760> chuck<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.970> the

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
tunnel which the bore is destroying so

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.499 
tunnel which the bore is destroying so
it<00:04:49.379> draws<00:04:49.679> Lux<00:04:50.099> from<00:04:50.369> their<00:04:50.610> atmosphere

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
it draws Lux from their atmosphere

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.519 
it draws Lux from their atmosphere
atmosphere<00:04:52.909> and<00:04:53.909> uses<00:04:54.719> it<00:04:54.899> to<00:04:54.929> like<00:04:55.409> the

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:55.529 
atmosphere and uses it to like the

atmosphere and uses it to like the
tunnel<00:04:56.269> and<00:04:57.269> now<00:04:57.300> let's<00:04:58.019> attach<00:04:58.349> these<00:04:58.709> arcing

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
tunnel and now let's attach these arcing

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:06.769 
tunnel and now let's attach these arcing
bellows<00:05:04.489> so<00:05:05.489> what<00:05:05.669> this<00:05:05.789> does<00:05:06.059> is<00:05:06.269> speed<00:05:06.599> up

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:06.779
