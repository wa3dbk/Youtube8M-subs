00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello and welcome it is me 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.430
 food and today it's about title again 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.740
 in front 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.420
 yes but not about any gameplay 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.030
 things I do not want you the best 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.860
 loud otte was present or you the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 best tactic on any map 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.760
 maybe in the city or something 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.039
 I do not want to present that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.449
 Today I wish you a few commands 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.680
 you can bring that closer to the game 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.050
 now most of them are in the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.080
 linking enrolled as the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.330
 parameter life to be given that 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.279
 they are floating as here wants the game 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 I do not want to play in English 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.020
 would like to have a farmer input from the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.660
 mouse you do not use a mouse 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 Acceleration also has if you look 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.629
 unsure is whether the still everything or 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.149
 you can not just force that 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.800
 then it's still about the one no 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.170
 border window get that one 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.420
 a window has something in full screen mode 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.070
 just does not really work 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.579
 Full screen mode is but I think you know 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.719
 what I mean 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.879
 we already have a battlefield 4 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.370
 and at call of duty there are costs 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.109
 far from this not possible in the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.969
 game that you just have to then we the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.820
 regulate linkage and then just 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.439
 last of the very few 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.960
 possible command or 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.000
 Settings like the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 external resolution when setting to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.040
 for example failed to play 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.780
 somehow black screen has if you 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.310
 before the resolutions are so high 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.630
 hired right first as well 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.490
 whenever it works right here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.369
 then you can do that outside of 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.430
 swimmer a bit troubleshooting 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.350
 To operate hall is now 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.520
 list and of course there are 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.840
 a description of which all 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.310
 List also with the German 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.960
 description if you like the English 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.000
 not powerful could be me otherwise 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.250
 sometimes ask explicitly when I think 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.729
 that will be pretty quick 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.220
 to explain 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.140
 yes I want to start with the resolution 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.579
 how to be the external rule for that 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.790
 actually the only one 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.240
 possibility of adjustment we 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.890
 outside of the link make or 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.740
 except from the game and outside of the game 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.509
 Linking in any case you have to 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.250
 in addition euro documents in the folder 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.890
 share the response before and then again 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.719
 in the note subfolder local da finds 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.909
 her the video content text file 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.549
 Just opened her then looked for 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.320
 setting the fortress there he gives the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.050
 first worth practically so already one 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.210
 Full HD would have been that would be the 1920's 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.130
 then the first value and then 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.000
 a newspaper underneath there is just 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:23.200
 setting the ford has the height then 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.760
 that's just 1080 so 1120 x 1080 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.760
 registered if you have a higher 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.700
 example okay then you have to stop 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.760
 enter the first value 2560 and at 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.020
 the second value is a number below 1440 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.790
 then you have just that 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.110
 various resolutions set 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.880
 I would not recommend one though 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.590
 to enter the resolution of yours 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.450
 screen or video card not 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.440
 is supported because there is the game 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.440
 not start anyway 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.940
 you should not try that 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.900
 now I come to the orders that the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.120
 most probably very 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.830
 be interested because the orders 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.970
 cause I'm counting on that same 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.800
 one does not play the game in German 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.510
 states gus in radio sign but 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.630
 just start in English 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.460
 that you have no intro that you can do that 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.340
 start playing a full screen window 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.700
 can and that you can use from the mouse 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.680
 can 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.090
 We have to get those commands in the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.440
 Write a link that we can do there 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.090
 do not share in any conficker 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.420
 write because the state just parameters 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.060
 are 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.340
 and there's no console in the game anyway 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.600
 Well, that's what actually results 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.070
 of course why not do that 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.640
 can and then you just have to 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.500
 open desktop link here 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.150
 right click I'm always doing this around it 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.620
 I was able to tell you exactly 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.630
 here for example the origin game 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.980
 Stanford think after the excel 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.570
 simply quotes it 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.070
 Blank and then he could 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.050
 command visions in the description 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.780
 are already reinschreiben there have 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.700
 I now for example - no witt with it 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.330
 I do not have to see any intro then 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.550
 blank - language english 95 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.810
 sign the game instead of in german 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.520
 can start in English 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.080
 there you can still all other orders 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.000
 or the two a feather 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.460
 Write if you want that 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.810
 you have input in the brewery or just one 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.030
 Full screen window but I do 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.800
 not because I could use chat 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.900
 cello play just works 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.690
 if you play the game in the exclusive 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.880
 has damaged full screen mode has confessed 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.290
 So so you have to spend each 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.520
 it takes you out of the game out 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.560
 he can do something else 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.010
 just the advantage of the pools play 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.480
 windows full screen windows you can 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.650
 just briefly on the desktop children again 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.400
 back that is not so long then 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.140
 the game halo in window mode for 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.960
 I want to conclude with you one more 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.250
 Introduce small program and that is 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.860
 really very small but has one 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.890
 pretty big use and that's right 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.270
 the little program out comes from station wagons 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.650
 the same developer as the one 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.450
 battlefield 3 mod if one does not 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.530
 is currently developing and that too 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.210
 come in bed rom has developed something 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.100
 does come easily you can you 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.580
 sign up with euro and aldi and then 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.900
 just without origin has the launch games 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.550
 a pretty big effect and that 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.680
 then you have less memory 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.400
 load less cpu load and such 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.010
 on and on 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.419
 and, most importantly, what now for me 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.669
 last two days pretty important 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.350
 because I could start without the vpn too 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.060
 have to 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.550
 play full bags because origin is like that 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.260
 built that is then again against 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.740
 Check if the difficult unlocked 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.720
 is 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.700
 even if the license is already on 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.590
 the cover and skin contact are just 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.060
 if the license files are there and then 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.919
 you can start the game just now 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.270
 that is a really no problem and 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.860
 who really is not upset anymore 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.169
 origin and then only for 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.590
 install wants to use or must 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.510
 he can use the program and then 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.950
 I can only recommend and the link 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.050
 you 'll find next to all the orders for 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.250
 also full in the description 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.880
 with that it is already comments 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.340
 over again 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.050
 I hope you help these commands 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.700
 a little further if you have any 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.710
 has problems or if you like the game 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.750
 but still want to do better then hope 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.810
 I want you to miss this one 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.669
 help yes that the reviews thumb 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.830
 1 comment with criticism if you 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.970
 Of course, there are only and we have 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.970
 See you next time bye
