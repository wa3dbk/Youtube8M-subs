tension control arms and I had a video

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.440 
tension control arms and I had a video
on<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.809> previously<00:00:13.340> so<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:15.089> really<00:00:15.210> simple

all you need is a 17 mil socket which is
somewhere<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:25.730> it<00:00:26.730> is

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
somewhere here it is

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.600 
somewhere here it is
you<00:00:28.109> need<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> 17<00:00:28.769> mil<00:00:29.160> socket<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.529> a<00:00:31.529> 17<00:00:32.279> ml

you need a 17 mil socket and a 17 ml
bunch<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> use<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.899> offset<00:00:34.190> closed<00:00:35.190> end

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
bunch so I use the offset closed end

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
bunch so I use the offset closed end
wrenches<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.649> use<00:00:37.770> anything<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.129> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
so yeah let's get started so this is the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.930 
so yeah let's get started so this is the
arm<00:00:59.219> right<00:00:59.370> over<00:00:59.579> here

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
arm right over here

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.770 
arm right over here
it's<00:01:00.449> held<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.989> by<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.739> bolt<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.600> side

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it's held in by a bolt on the one side

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.330 
it's held in by a bolt on the one side
over<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:04.650> two<00:01:04.890> nuts<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.580> end

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
over here and then two nuts on this end

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.710

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.500 

and<00:03:21.430> as<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.879> can<00:03:22.030> see<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.670> pushing<00:03:25.150> has<00:03:25.480> a

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
and as you can see the pushing has a

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.570 
and as you can see the pushing has a
little<00:03:25.959> bit<00:03:26.049> of<00:03:26.110> an<00:03:26.260> offset<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:26.830> this<00:03:27.040> has<00:03:27.250> more

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
little bit of an offset so this has more

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.039 
little bit of an offset so this has more
of<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.810> protrusion<00:03:29.739> than<00:03:30.099> this<00:03:30.250> side

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
of a protrusion than this side

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.899 
of a protrusion than this side
so<00:03:32.049> if<00:03:32.349> you<00:03:32.560> if<00:03:32.860> your<00:03:33.010> tension<00:03:33.340> control<00:03:33.700> rods

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
so if you if your tension control rods

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.289 
so if you if your tension control rods
have<00:03:34.299> that<00:03:35.519> protrusion<00:03:36.519> then<00:03:36.730> make<00:03:36.970> sure<00:03:37.150> that

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
have that protrusion then make sure that

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.100 
have that protrusion then make sure that
it<00:03:37.599> you<00:03:38.560> install<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.250> correct<00:03:39.549> size<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.870> this

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
it you install the correct size so this

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.820 
it you install the correct size so this
is<00:03:41.260> from<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.709> passenger<00:03:42.400> side<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
is from the passenger side and the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.440 
is from the passenger side and the
protrusion<00:03:44.830> is<00:03:44.980> towards<00:03:45.340> an<00:03:45.580> inside<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.390> the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
protrusion is towards an inside of the

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.970 
protrusion is towards an inside of the
vehicle<00:03:47.670> okay<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:50.099> take<00:03:51.099> your<00:03:51.250> arm<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:52.980> touch

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
vehicle okay so take your arm and touch

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.569 
vehicle okay so take your arm and touch
up<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.310> length<00:03:55.110> to<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.230> stock<00:03:56.530> one<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:59.579> we

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
up the length to the stock one and we

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:13.640 
up the length to the stock one and we
want<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:01.030> do<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:06.120> line<00:04:07.120> up<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:10.540> bolt<00:04:10.900> in<00:04:12.269> here

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
want to do is line up this bolt in here

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.439 
want to do is line up this bolt in here
with<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.799> rod<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.489> could<00:04:15.790> get<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.150> little

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
with the rod and it could get a little

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.219 
with the rod and it could get a little
tricky<00:04:16.989> but<00:04:17.289> you<00:04:17.470> just<00:04:17.620> have<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.859> kind<00:04:18.130> of

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
tricky but you just have to kind of

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:38.160 
tricky but you just have to kind of
steal<00:04:20.229> your<00:04:20.440> way

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:45.900
