00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
building that door as soon as possible

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.510 
building that door as soon as possible
for<00:02:03.110> once<00:02:03.319> this<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:03.740> building<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.369> can

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
for once this is building you can

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.900 
for once this is building you can
actually<00:02:04.700> build<00:02:05.000> two<00:02:05.360> more<00:02:05.740> SUVs<00:02:06.910> because

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
actually build two more SUVs because

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.839 
actually build two more SUVs because
delta<00:02:08.899> 8<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.200> 13<00:02:09.410> supply<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.310> thor<00:02:10.550> across

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
delta 8 to 13 supply and the thor across

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.390 
delta 8 to 13 supply and the thor across
six<00:02:11.270> so<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.500> will<00:02:12.590> give<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.800> like<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> perfect

six so that will give you like a perfect

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.580 
six so that will give you like a perfect
amount

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.960 

and<00:02:17.590> yeah<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:17.890> once<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.520> done<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.850> and
