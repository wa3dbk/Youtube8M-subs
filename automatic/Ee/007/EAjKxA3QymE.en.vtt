 for our today's recipe in a pan 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.460
 out of the fire we'll put the milk 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.430
 condensed 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.219
 Let's put margarine and coconut 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.030

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.940
 here we are at this point the lady 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.090
 began to boil dropping from the bottom of 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090
 pan 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.730
 You have to be very careful not to 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.869
 burn 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.210
 we stayed the fire now we spent a 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.090
 little margarine on the plate that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.490
 we dump our cream 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.180
 He's very creamy, we'll leave. 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.850
 cool to room temperature check 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.830
 the consistency we want now 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.140
 We are going to blanch the almonds. 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.329
 we sin thus boiling water and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.420
 We play friends in here. 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.950
 We left three minutes to avoid 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.200
 get off the bark 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.750
 if you want you can leave it with the shell 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.100
 but it gets a little hard 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.100
 Now we put out the fire. 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.979
 and we will remove the peel of the almonds 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:58.369

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.700
 and thus we make the loose shell 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.180

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.430

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.470
 we do not need one for the hands 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.459

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.310

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:27.030
