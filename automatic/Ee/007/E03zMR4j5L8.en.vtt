00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.450 
imagine that something like that we
would<00:05:49.340> have<00:05:49.520> today<00:05:49.699> if<00:05:50.660> it<00:05:50.870> was<00:05:50.990> ours<00:05:51.289> in<00:05:52.130> some

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
would have today if it was ours in some

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.420 
would have today if it was ours in some
way<00:05:53.080> otherwise<00:05:54.080> we<00:05:54.889> wouldn't<00:05:55.160> worry<00:05:55.340> about

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
way otherwise we wouldn't worry about

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.219 
way otherwise we wouldn't worry about
other<00:05:55.850> people<00:05:56.180> having<00:05:56.479> nuclear<00:05:56.600> weapons<00:05:56.810> we

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
other people having nuclear weapons we

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.450 
other people having nuclear weapons we
could<00:05:57.350> just<00:05:57.530> shut<00:05:57.770> them<00:05:57.860> down<00:05:58.010> anytime<00:05:58.430> I

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
could just shut them down anytime I

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
could just shut them down anytime I
wanted<00:05:58.760> to

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.070 

it's<00:06:14.480> been<00:06:14.690> on<00:06:14.810> my<00:06:14.840> mind<00:06:15.160> I've<00:06:16.160> got<00:06:16.370> to<00:06:16.490> admit

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
it's been on my mind I've got to admit

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.510 
it's been on my mind I've got to admit
there<00:06:18.080> was<00:06:18.169> always<00:06:18.410> the<00:06:18.710> possibility<00:06:18.919> that

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
there was always the possibility that

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.610 
there was always the possibility that
there<00:06:20.150> could<00:06:20.180> be<00:06:20.360> reprisals<00:06:20.900> against<00:06:21.470> me

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
there could be reprisals against me

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.350 
there could be reprisals against me
officially<00:06:22.220> and<00:06:22.810> but<00:06:23.810> I<00:06:24.580> persevered<00:06:25.580> I<00:06:25.790> fought

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
officially and but I persevered I fought

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.070 
officially and but I persevered I fought
through<00:06:26.600> that<00:06:26.810> and<00:06:27.080> continued<00:06:27.620> to<00:06:27.710> talk<00:06:27.919> about
