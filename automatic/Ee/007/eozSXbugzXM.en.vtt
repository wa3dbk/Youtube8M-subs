stuff<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.670> say<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> little<00:01:12.659> thicker

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.510 
stuff as I say so it's a little thicker
and<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.500> consistency<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> wanted

the stuff you buy in a store you might

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.240 
the stuff you buy in a store you might
want<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.350> thicken<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:16.979> bit

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
want to thicken that up a little bit

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.130 
want to thicken that up a little bit
actually<00:01:17.670> sweeten<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.060> too<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.689> some<00:01:18.840> icing

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
actually sweeten it too with some icing

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.300 
actually sweeten it too with some icing
sugar<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:19.770> where<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.040> third

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
sugar so that's where that third

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
sugar so that's where that third
ingredient<00:01:20.580> would<00:01:21.060> come<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:21.900> your

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
ingredient would come in so get your

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
ingredient would come in so get your
peanut<00:01:22.320> butter<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.770> around<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> edge<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.790> the
