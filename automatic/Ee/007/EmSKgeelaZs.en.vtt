00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
the last year as I found that I'm using

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.449 
the last year as I found that I'm using
a<00:02:27.239> lot<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.420> Planet<00:02:27.959> Waves<00:02:28.109> guitar<00:02:28.769> leagues<00:02:29.099> and

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
a lot of Planet Waves guitar leagues and

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.789 
a lot of Planet Waves guitar leagues and
a<00:02:29.790> few<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.120> other<00:02:30.329> planning<00:02:30.750> products<00:02:31.560> -

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
a few of the other planning products -

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.069 
a few of the other planning products -
one<00:02:32.670> thing<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.090> me<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.329> very<00:02:33.359> important

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
one thing that for me is very important

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.680 
one thing that for me is very important
is<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.379> use<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.769> right-angle<00:02:35.489> jack<00:02:35.790> here<00:02:36.480> on

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
is the use of a right-angle jack here on

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.690 
is the use of a right-angle jack here on
the<00:02:36.810> guitar<00:02:37.170> because<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.799> really<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.459> much

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
the guitar because it really is a much

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.309 
the guitar because it really is a much
safer<00:02:38.940> alternative<00:02:39.150> having<00:02:40.109> some

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
safer alternative having some

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.589 
safer alternative having some
sticky-outy<00:02:40.920> Jack<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.609> when<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.180> tread<00:02:42.450> on

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
sticky-outy Jack that when you tread on

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.930 
sticky-outy Jack that when you tread on
the<00:02:42.720> lead<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.170> going<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.859> very<00:02:44.099> possibly<00:02:44.700> just

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the lead is going to very possibly just

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.729 
the lead is going to very possibly just
you<00:02:45.389> know<00:02:45.540> shred<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.109> back<00:02:46.260> end<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.620> your

guitar right angle Jack's molded right
angle<00:02:50.940> Jack's<00:02:51.180> are<00:02:51.359> much<00:02:51.540> safer<00:02:51.930> bet

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900
