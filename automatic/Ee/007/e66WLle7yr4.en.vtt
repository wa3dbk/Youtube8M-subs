00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 with here below let's see what 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.299
 what are we going to find when we buy 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.220
 the digital microscope for colleagues 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.929
 who have already acquired it in other countries 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.900
 and here in Colombia is what he loves 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.960
 find this is a remote control that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.010
 will turn on the screen more against 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.300
 the wide 7 inch screen 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.939
 develop an improved version that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.640
 always shown in the videos has more 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.119
 sharpness let's find then a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.119
 lamp 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.890
 for the microscope and we're going to find 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.930
 the base of it from the same screen 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.309
 which is very easy to assemble for 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.059
 assemble from the back 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.489
 we just clicked it in there 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.680
 and we already adjust to the need that 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.019
 we have now what I'm going to show is 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.700
 simply the connection of the 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.890
 microscope 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.040
 when the subject of the screen we are going to 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.260
 identify these contacts these 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.810
 screens always have two points of 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.250
 entrance two channels 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.130
 single channel 2 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.510
 the central residue of any video 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.220
 of them we will select it as 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.590
 we only have microscopic and we're just going 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.060
 to occupy one and this red then it would be 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.399
 the entrance 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.120
 of power and this cable cited in the 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.980
 antenna that already has the receiver 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.410
 now let's look at what we are going to 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.620
 find in the box where the 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.140
 microscope module 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.650
 in the microscope module then 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.800
 Now let's find 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.800
 ah 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.320
 and everything that has to do with the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.320
 functioning 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.510
 from it we will find the support 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.570
 however this is very easy d 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.020
 to install here it's coming now if the 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.020
 lens 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.939
 here comes the lens and here then comes 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.790
 the module 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.060
 the one that transforms that signal that is 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.060
 observing 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.280
 in video 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.680
 we disconnected captain the two japan 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.680
 quoted enrosca moses toca 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:31.030
 we look for you there we have it ready 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.160
 for only what here to support 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.210
 unscrew moss leaves everything 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.550
 and we leave it here 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.740
 and the other then we just put it 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.570
 at the base however what I want is 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.030
 explain since this is shown in 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.970
 other videos what I want to explain how 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.180
 is that it connects the lens 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.099
 with the module 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.250
 the display that what we're going to do to 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.250
 continuation 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.760
 ready first let's connect the source 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.420
 from the current up to now 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.519
 here we already have a voltage output 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.120
 let's take a converter that goes to 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.220
 take a voltage line and it's going to 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.680
 convert into two voltage outputs to 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.940
 feed the display and to feed the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.180
 microscope 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.879
 then now we connect one of them 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.700
 here under a microscope we are 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.670
 I understand a red LED that does not mean 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.569
 gives us to understand that the module is already 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.450
 of the camera's microscope is being 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.109
 powered by voltage now what 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.910
 we must feed is the screen 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.740
 let's then feed the screen 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.260
 and we are going to connect it in the cable 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.930
 red when we connect it in the cable 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.930
 red one does not light the display 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.000
 we have here the module powered 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.770
 we have the module already powered now 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.450
 we have to give video signal the 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.880
 video signal then we're going to 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.900
 grab with this coupling 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.900
 that is the cable already 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.509
 this is the coupling that must 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.070
 introduce dry the leads a guide where 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:34.100
 fit rotate 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.100
 and it is insured it can not remain red 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.920
 because then he will not give us the video 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.990
 all right 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.330
 we connect there the video cable 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.569
 and when to put we have one of the two 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.789
 ports 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:52.179
 here he is already giving us videos and 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.979
 connect it to the other is because it is 

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:55.569
 using the camera at this time 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.509
 are watching the video here I can 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.249
 configure to receive the display be 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.490
 doing only video for this yellow 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:07.719
 but here I do press the button that says b1 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.479
 b2 now you start receiving video here 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.189
 we already have the microscope to modulate 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.249
 what this already explains in another video here 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:18.699
 I'm just explaining 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:20.249
 a little bit here like the connection there what 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.620
 we recorded to the point where we already 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:25.030
 let's be 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.360
 analyzing the image well here also what 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:31.390
 we can configure the contrast the 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.610
 shine the color and here if we want the 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.150
 English or Spanish menu here too 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.529
 we can rotate the screen I can 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.289
 let it 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:43.639
 upside down from one side of the other here to the 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:47.300
 straight 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.330
 here we already handle only that is the system 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.150
 of the menu and also because the control is 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.260
 something already very easy we simply remove 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.350
 the little part that is here 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:02.100
 and we already have the remote control 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.100
 working 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.460
 we turn on we have all the menus too 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.580
 there 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.319
 and here then we configure we want 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.150
 say hello to a colleague from Ecuador who 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:16.490
 acquired the microscope and already told us 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.840
 that he had arrived and this video itself 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.860
 we are doing it so that also 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.740
 can install it correctly at least 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.500
 here in the connections part from 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.169
 durango ecuador a great greeting for him 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.860
 for trusting us and acquiring 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.450
 this 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.100
 very important tool service the 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.750
 Arauca professional technical service in 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.750
 mobile telephony and mobile devices
