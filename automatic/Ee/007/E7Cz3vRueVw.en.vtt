one yeah definitely yesterday we had a

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.130 
one yeah definitely yesterday we had a
good<00:02:15.430> pace<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.880> practice<00:02:16.360> today<00:02:16.810> we

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
good pace in the practice today we

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.490 
good pace in the practice today we
repeated<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:18.570> results<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.630> yesterday<00:02:20.200> the

was<00:02:21.400> everything<00:02:21.790> good<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:22.120> car<00:02:22.330> was<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> really

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
was everything good the car was a really

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.960 
was everything good the car was a really
perfect<00:02:23.670> balance<00:02:24.670> for<00:02:24.970> qualifying<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.960> think

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
perfect balance for qualifying I think

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.490 
perfect balance for qualifying I think
you<00:02:27.970> know<00:02:28.090> it's<00:02:28.330> bad<00:02:28.510> today<00:02:28.690> but<00:02:28.990> we<00:02:29.080> could<00:02:29.470> I

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
you know it's bad today but we could I

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.350 
you know it's bad today but we could I
made<00:02:29.800> some<00:02:30.250> little<00:02:30.520> mistake<00:02:30.790> up<00:02:30.940> because<00:02:31.270> I

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
made some little mistake up because I

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.090 
made some little mistake up because I
still<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.840> learn<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.080> lot<00:02:32.290> more<00:02:32.470> about<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
still have to learn a lot more about the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.500 
still have to learn a lot more about the
car<00:02:33.310> because<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:34.000> know<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.330> my<00:02:34.480> first

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
car because I you know this is my first

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.660

experience<00:02:34.840> with<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.470> with<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> roof<00:02:35.860> so<00:02:36.640> I

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
experience with the with a roof so I

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.760 
experience with the with a roof so I
still<00:02:37.090> there<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:37.300> still<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.020> lot<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.200> come<00:02:38.440> on<00:02:38.590> me

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
still there is still a lot to come on me

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.580 
still there is still a lot to come on me
but<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.459> u.p<00:02:39.730> team<00:02:39.910> gave<00:02:40.120> me<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.390> really<00:02:41.290> good

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
but the u.p team gave me a really good

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.370 
but the u.p team gave me a really good
chance<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.250> push<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.940> think<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:44.200> know<00:02:44.260> we

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
chance to push and I think you know we

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.140 
chance to push and I think you know we
are<00:02:44.470> in<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.650> good<00:02:44.740> position<00:02:45.070> for<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.610> start<00:02:45.850> oh

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
are in a good position for the start oh

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.850 
are in a good position for the start oh
sure<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.720> won't<00:02:46.900> be<00:02:46.989> easy<00:02:47.050> because<00:02:47.380> all<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
sure it won't be easy because all the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.970 
sure it won't be easy because all the
enemies<00:02:47.980> are<00:02:48.250> really<00:02:48.760> hungry<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.739> fight

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
enemies are really hungry to to fight

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.370 
enemies are really hungry to to fight
with<00:02:51.640> me<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.970> win<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.239> race<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.020> think<00:02:53.140> would

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
with me to win the race so I think would

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.830 
with me to win the race so I think would
be<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.560> difficult<00:02:54.340> first<00:02:55.090> race<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.540> getting

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
be a difficult first race is getting

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.840 
be a difficult first race is getting
warmer<00:02:56.230> compared<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.739> yesterday<00:02:57.190> so<00:02:57.670> we'll

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
warmer compared to yesterday so we'll

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.220 
warmer compared to yesterday so we'll
change<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.150> little<00:02:58.239> bit<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.630> balance<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.050> the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
change a little bit the balance of the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.660 
change a little bit the balance of the
car<00:02:59.440> but<00:02:59.739> we<00:02:59.890> are<00:02:59.950> looking<00:03:00.130> forward<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.550> next

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
car but we are looking forward to next

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.090 
car but we are looking forward to next
to<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.150> result<00:03:01.480> today<00:03:01.989> so<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:02.980> aim<00:03:03.070> is

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
to the result today so the aim is

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.740 
to the result today so the aim is
getting<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.700> first<00:03:03.760> corner<00:03:04.239> and<00:03:04.480> keep<00:03:04.600> out

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
getting that first corner and keep out

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.479 
getting that first corner and keep out
of<00:03:04.840> trouble<00:03:04.870> really<00:03:05.320> definitely<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.250> saw

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
of trouble really definitely I saw

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.010 
of trouble really definitely I saw
there's<00:03:06.790> some<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.030> picture<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.540> last<00:03:07.690> year<00:03:07.840> so

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
there's some a picture of last year so

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.510 
there's some a picture of last year so
the<00:03:08.200> key<00:03:08.380> would<00:03:08.560> be<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:09.100> thing<00:03:09.340> out<00:03:09.489> of

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
the key would be this thing out of

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.729 
the key would be this thing out of
trouble<00:03:10.060> but<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.870> race<00:03:11.020> is<00:03:11.170> long<00:03:11.350> as<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.590> said

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
trouble but the race is long as I said

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.710 
trouble but the race is long as I said
before<00:03:11.770> is<00:03:12.160> really<00:03:12.430> well<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.180> think<00:03:13.360> also

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
before is really well so I think also

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.930 
before is really well so I think also
physically<00:03:14.230> won't<00:03:14.500> be<00:03:14.620> easy<00:03:14.830> but<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.220> feel<00:03:15.790> that

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
physically won't be easy but I feel that

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.030 
physically won't be easy but I feel that
I'm<00:03:16.090> really<00:03:16.299> prepared<00:03:16.690> for<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.959> long<00:03:17.260> race<00:03:17.500> so

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
I'm really prepared for a long race so

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.289 
I'm really prepared for a long race so
we'll<00:03:18.220> see<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.850> would<00:03:18.970> be<00:03:19.090> an<00:03:19.180> interesting

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
we'll see it would be an interesting

00:03:19.299 --> 00:04:05.090 
we'll see it would be an interesting
first<00:03:19.810> race<00:03:20.230> with<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.709> rule

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.160 

you
