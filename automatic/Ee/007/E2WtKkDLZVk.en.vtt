00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
two away from the end so that it will

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.230 
two away from the end so that it will
leave<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.259> tail<00:02:05.619> long<00:02:06.429> enough<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:06.850> weave<00:02:07.030> in

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
leave a tail long enough to weave in

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
later so use your needle to help undo

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.309 
later so use your needle to help undo
the<00:02:15.090> portion<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.480> chain<00:02:16.750> that's<00:02:17.290> close<00:02:18.190> to

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
the portion of the chain that's close to

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:45.610 
the portion of the chain that's close to
where<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.500> started

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.670 

for<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.709> rest<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.069> foundation<00:02:47.730> chain<00:02:48.680> you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
for the rest of the foundation chain you

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.270 
for the rest of the foundation chain you
can<00:02:49.980> undo<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.489> or<00:02:50.849> I<00:02:51.420> find<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.050> easier<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.830> just

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
can undo it or I find it easier to just
